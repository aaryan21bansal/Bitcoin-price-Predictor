UK MPs banned by China vow to 'redouble' efforts,"Iain Duncan Smith, Nusrat Ghani and Tom Tugendhat have been banned from entering China Five UK parliamentarians sanctioned by China have released a joint statement vowing to ""redouble"" their efforts to campaign against human rights abuses. Three MPs, including ex-Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, and two peers said the action by China was an attempt to stifle ""free and open debate"". The PM said he ""stands firmly"" with those targeted by China for criticising its treatment of the Uighur people. The sanctions follow similar moves by the UK, US, Canada and the EU on China. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US president Joe Biden ""expressed their concern about retaliatory action taken by China,"" during a phone call on Friday, Downing Street said. China hasimposed sanctions on nine UK citizens in total- including the five parliamentarians - who are among its most vocal critics in the UK. It said it was sanctioning the group for spreading what it called ""lies and disinformation"" about China. In response, Sir Iain, along with MPs Nusrat Ghani and Tim Loughton, and the peers Lord Alton and Baroness Kennedy, said: ""Today's sanctions have unmasked the Chinese Communist Party. ""These actions are not only an attack on us as individuals but an attempt to stifle the free and open debate that is at the heart of our parliamentary democracy."" The group added that ""intimidation"" would only encourage them to ""redouble"" their efforts, as they pledged to continue advocating on behalf of ""the Uighurs, Tibetans, Hong Kongers and all other persecuted groups in China"". ""These are the true victims of the Chinese government's authoritarian rule, not us,"" they added. In common with the government, the group also called for ""international investigations into the alleged abuses"" in Xingjian against the Uighur people. Britain's relations with China are going from bad to worse. On Monday, the UK imposed its first ever sanctions on Chinese officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Now Beijing has retaliated, announcing sanctions on some of its most vocal critics in Britain. It matters because the government is trying to strike a balance in its relations with Beijing. In its recent foreign policy review, the UK described China as a ""systemic competitor"" and ""the biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security"". But it also spoke of pursuing ""a positive trade and investment relationship"" and co-operating with China on climate change and biodiversity. All that just became a little harder still. On Friday afternoon, the Foreign Office (FCDO) said the minister for Asia, Nigel Adams, had summoned Yang Xiaoguang, the Chinese embassy in London's chargÃ© d'affaires, over Beijing's actions. An FCDO spokesperson said Mr Adams had made it clear that China's decision to impose sanctions on Britons and UK entities was ""unwarranted and unacceptable"". Mr Adams also noted that China's decision to target those ""seeking to shine a light on human rights violations"" would ""not distract attention away from those very violations taking place in Xinjiang"". Earlier Prime Minister Boris Johnsontweeted,externalthat the British citizens facing sanctions were ""performing a vital role"" in highlighting the treatment of Uighur Muslims, adding: ""Freedom to speak out in opposition to abuse is fundamental and I stand firmly with them."" Western states sanction China for Uighur 'abuses' Who are the Uighurs? Uighur camp detainees allege systematic rape Nike, H&M face China fury over Xinjiang cotton More than a million Uighurs and other minorities are estimated to have been detained at camps in the north-west region of Xinjiang, where allegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged. Uighurs living in the region speak their own language, similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. The Chinese government has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on Uighur women and separating children from their families. It has denied the allegations of abuse and claimed the camps are ""re-education"" facilities used to combat terrorism. Sanctions were imposed on Chinese officials on Monday, as part of a co-ordinated action by the European Union and the UK, the US and Canada. After UK sanctions were announced on Monday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the abuse of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang ""one of the worst human rights crises of our time"". Mr Raab also said that if Beijing wanted to ""credibly rebut"" the claims, it should allow the United Nation's commissioner for human rights to access Xinjiang. The nine Britons now facing sanctions from China are:,external Tory MPs Sir Iain, Nusrat Ghani and Tim Loughton, and peers Baroness Kennedy and Lord Alton, who are all members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China Tory MPs Tom Tugendhat and Neil O'Brien, who lead the China Research Group Lawyer Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, chair of the Uighur Tribunal, which is investigating atrocities against the minority group Newcastle University academic Jo Smith Finley, whose research focuses on the Uighurs They will all be banned from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau, their property in China will be frozen and Chinese citizens and institutions will be prohibited from doing business with them. Ms Ghani said the move had made her ""even even more determined"" to speak out about the Uighurs, while Sir Iain argued that those who lived free lives ""must speak for those who have no voice"". Mr Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, told the BBC: ""I view this as a direct assault on British democracy and an attempt to silence the British people who have chosen me to speak for them."" He added that the government had been too soft on China, which he said had been ""constantly and continuously seeking to intervene"" in the internal matters of the UK. Academic Dr Smith Finleytweeted:,external""I have no regrets for speaking out, and I will not be silenced."" China has created a sprawling network of detention camps for minorities in the Xinjiang region Four groups have also been sanctioned - the China Research Group, the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, the Uighur Tribunal, and Essex Court Chambers. A legal opinion by senior barristers at Essex Court Chambers had concluded there was a ""very credible case"" that the Chinese government was committing genocide against the Uighurs. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the sanctions were a ""direct attempt to silence those who criticise the actions of the Chinese government"". A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the UK's decision to impose sanctions ""flagrantly breaches international law and basic norms governing international relations, grossly interferes in China's internal affairs, and severely undermines China-UK relations"". He added that the Chinese foreign ministry had summoned the British Ambassador to China to ""lodge solemn representations, expressing firm opposition and strong condemnation"". Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, later told a press briefing China was forced to act ""in self-defence"" in response to UK sanctions ""based on lies"".

Ships stuck in 'traffic jam' outside Suez Canal,"More than 230 ships are waiting to enter the Suez Canal, through which all navigation has been suspended The blockage of Egypt's Suez canal by a giant container ship is causing a ""traffic jam"" in the Red Sea, according to a merchant seaman on a nearby ship. Joe Reynolds, chief engineer of the Maersk Ohio, told the BBC the number of vessels waiting at the canal's southern entrance was ""growing exponentially"". ""It's going to affect shipping schedules around the world,"" he warned. Tugboats and dredgers are trying to dislodge the Ever Given, which is wedged diagonally across the waterway. The 400m-long (1,300ft), 200,000-tonne vessel ran aground on Tuesday morning amid high winds and a sandstorm that affected visibility. Specialist salvage companies have been brought in to help refloat the ship, and an adviser to Egypt's president has said he hopes the situation will be resolved within two to three days. But experts have said it could take weeks if the vessel's containers need to be removed. 'Our customers are worried about the Suez blockage' How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal About 12% of global trade passes through the 193km (120-mile) canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. An alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, can take two weeks longer. Mr Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Maersk Ohio, a US-flagged container ship that is 292m long and weighs 50,000 tonnes, was ""stacked up"" alongside dozens of other vessels near Port Suez. ""I think you can imagine there was a queue of ships waiting to go through to begin with, and now that queue has just grown exponentially,"" he said. ""Standing outside, as you look, everywhere around you is ships."" This video can not be played A salvage company, working to free the Ever Given, says the operation could take weeks He said there was still a lot of work to be done on board his ship, and that he and his fellow crewmembers had not yet had a chance to communicate with the other vessels. ""It's just a long waiting game. There's not a lot to see... We are ships sitting at anchor, just waiting as if you were in a traffic jam on the M5,"" he added, referring to a British motorway. Despite the delay, Mr Reynolds expressed sympathy for the Ever Given's 25 Indian crew members. ""As sailors, we complain a lot about things. But we also understand when other sailors are in a fix or other seamen are working really hard day and night to try to correct a situation. We've all been there,"" he said. About 10 tugboats and two dredger vessels are working to refloat the Ever Given. Diggers and other machinery operating on the banks are also assisting. The Ever Given is almost as long as Manhattan's Empire State Building is high The Ever Given's technical mangers, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said another attempt to refloat the vessel on Friday had failed, and that the salvage operation was now focused on removing sand and mud from around the port (left) side of the vessel's bow. A specialised suction dredger, which can shift 2,000 cubic metres (70,000 cubic feet) of material every hour, arrived on site on Thursday, it added. Arrangements are also being made for high-capacity pumps to reduce the water levels in the vessel's forward void space and the bow thruster room. Another two tugs will arrive by Sunday, when a higher tide is expected. Dredging vessels are working around the clock to help refloat the Ever Given John Denholm, president of the UK Chamber of Shipping, told the BBC that if the diggers and tugs were not successful, salvage teams would have to start the slow process of ""lightering"" the ship - transferring its cargo to another vessel or the canal bank. That would involve bringing in specialist equipment, including a crane that would need to stretch more than 60m (200ft) high, he said. ""If we go through the lightering process, I suspect we're talking weeks."" Mr Reynolds said the Maersk Ohio, which started its voyage in the Gulf and was headed to northern Europe via the Mediterranean, still had a ""little wriggle-room"" in its schedule. ""If it goes more than five days, then we start to see our schedule back up. I'm sure other ships are on a much tighter schedule than we were... It's going to affect shipping schedules all around the world."" Service provider Leth Agencies said a total of 237 vessels were waiting in the area on Friday - 107 at Port Suez in the Red Sea, 41 at the canal's midway point in the Great Bitter Lake, and 89 at Port Said in the Mediterranean. Almost 19,000 ships passed through the Suez Canal last year The blockage is holding up an estimated $9.6bn (Â£7bn) of goods each day - or $400m an hour - according to data from Lloyd's List. The shipping journal said two major companies, Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, were looking into whether to re-route their vessels. The first container ship to opt for the longer journey around the Cape of Good Hope was the Ever Given's sister ship, the Ever Greet, both of which are operated by the Taiwanese firm Evergreen Marine, it added. Richard Meade, the editor of Lloyd's List, told the BBC that the risk of piracy to vessels off the coast of Africa had been overblown to some extent. ""Obviously, we did see a major piracy surge a few years ago off the Somali coast. That has largely been brought under control,"" he told the BBC. ""The Gulf of Guinea is the hotspot. But I think realistically you would see ships move well outside the Gulf of Guinea as the route."" Did you witness the incident? Are you on board another vessel on the Suez Canal?

Shops in England can open until 10pm post-lockdown,"Shops in England will be allowed to stay open until 22:00 six days a week when customers return from 12 April, the government has said. After months of coronavirus-related closures, non-essential retailers will be able to apply to trade from 07:00 BST Monday to Saturday. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said the move would help businesses to recover and customers to shop safely. He said councils will be asked to avoid ""unnecessary restrictions"" on hours. Under theroad map for easing England's coronavirus restrictions, non-essential shops are permitted to reopen from 12 April at the earliest, providing the government's four tests are met. Shops will be able to extend their opening hours from 07:00 to 22:00 from Monday to Saturday, to help customers avoid peak times and to ease the pressure on transport, according to the Ministry of Local Government. Dominic Curran of the British Retail Consortium said it welcomed the announcement of extended opening hours, as it would allow people to avoid the busier shopping periods. He added: ""Retailers have invested hundreds of millions in making their stores Covid-secure, implementing additional hygiene measures, perspex screens, social distancing and more."" Shops can open 24 hours a day over Christmas John Lewis to permanently close eight more shops What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? Mr Jenrick said the temporary measures would ""support businesses to reopen and recover"", alongside a Â£56m ""Welcome Back Fund"" announced by the government last week. He said: ""This will provide a much-needed boost for many businesses - protecting jobs, reducing pressure on public transport and supporting people and communities to continue to visit their high streets safely and shop locally."" In awritten ministerial statement on Thursday,external, Mr Jenrick said he would ask local councils to take a ""positive and flexible approach"" to shops wishing to extend their opening hours. He said the government acknowledged that longer retail hours could have a ""temporary impact"" on local residents, but this had to be balanced by the ""significant public interest in ensuring there is a safe retail environment when non-essential shops reopen"". The government said it would also continue to allow pubs and restaurants to put up marquees to help increase seating capacity in a Covid-secure way. Flexible working hours on construction sites will also be extended, and food deliveries to supermarkets will be allowed over more time periods, No 10 said.

Liberty Steel boss asks government for Â£170m bailout,"The owner of Liberty Steel has asked the government for Â£170m in financial support. In a letter sent to the Department of Business last night, Sanjeev Gupta said the support was required to pay day-to-day operating expenses and absorb recent losses. Concerns over the future of Liberty Steel have grown after key financial backer, Greensill Capital, went bust. Liberty Steel employs about 5,000 people in the UK. ""The collapse of Greensill has put financial pressure on the GFG Alliance and our British steel operations,"" Mr Gupta writes in the letter. ""We are still refining the details with my management team and our external advisors, but preliminary indications are that the steel manufacturing and processing operations would need in the range of Â£170m to fund working capital and some additional capital to fund operating losses in the short term, which we are in the process of finalising."" Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance employs a total of 5,000 people in the UK - 3,000 of them in steel and aluminium businesses across 12 UK sites. There have been grave concerns for the future of Liberty Steel since its main financial backer Greensill Capital went bust in early March. 'If the steelworks shuts it will destroy Rotherham' Liberty Steel: Government looking at 'all options' Liberty Steel asks customers to pay up front Government sources told the BBC they have not yet responded and have concerns about the ""opaque"" nature of Mr Gupta's empire. GFG employs 35,000 worldwide and given its international footprint the government would certainly need assurances any support would not find its way abroad. Mr Gupta said he envisaged the support ""could be structured in a way that works to ensure value for money and appropriate protections for the taxpayer"". Government sources also indicated that it was unlikely government support would be offered to the company with its current structure and management - with any assistance likely to come after an administration process. A spokeswoman for the government said: ""The government is closely monitoring developments around Liberty Steel and continues to engage closely with the company, the broader UK steel industry and trade unions."" Both the Business Secretary and the Prime Minister have pledged in recent days to look at all options to ensure the business survives.

Met investigates 'Everyone's Invited' abuse claims,"Soma Sara set up the Everyone's Invited website to highlight victims' stories of sexual abuse Allegations of sexual assault at London schools are being investigated by police, after being highlighted by an online campaign. The website ""Everyone's Invited"" asked victims to post anonymous accounts of abuse they had suffered, and has now received more than 5,000 testimonies. The Met Police said it has been ""reviewing the content"" of the site and contacted schools it could identify. The testimonies include accounts from victims as young as nine. The Met's lead for rape and sexual offences, Det Supt Mel Laremore, said: ""It is deeply concerning to see the number of accounts published on this website, many of which appear to relate to previous or current experiences within educational settings in London and across the country. ""We take all allegations of sexual assault very seriously. We understand the complex and varied reasons why many victim-survivors do not contact law enforcement, but I want to personally reassure anyone who needs our help that we are absolutely here for you."" People who were abused years ago should still come forward and report the incidents, Det Supt Laremore said. In June 2020, Soma Sara, who is now 22, shared her experience on Instagram of what she calls ""rape culture"". Within a week she had received and shared more than 300 anonymous responses of people with stories of ""misogyny, harassment, abuse and assault"". The Everyone's Invited,externalwebsite now carries thousands of victims' testimonies, often from schools and universities. Experiences range from being drugged and raped at parties to explicit images being shared over messaging platforms. This week, pupils at Highgate School in North Londonwalked out of classesin protest at a perceived ""rape culture"". One male ex-pupiltold BBC Newsnightthat girls were ""hounded"" for naked selfies at the school. The school's governing body said it was ""truly sorry"" and had commissioned an external review. Other private schools in London have reportedly passed allegations of sexual abuse onto police.

France accuses UK of 'blackmail' over jab exports,"France's vaccine rollout - along with the rest of the EU - is lagging behind the UK's France has accused the UK of ""blackmail"" over its handling of coronavirus vaccine exports, amid continuing tensions over supply chains. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was asked whether the EU had been ""scammed"" by sending millions of doses to the UK while its own rollout stuttered. ""We need to build a co-operative relationship,"" he told France Info radio. ""But we cannot deal this way."" France has called for the EU to implement tougher export controls. Vaccine rollouts have started sluggishly across the bloc, and the EU has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering its promised doses. AstraZeneca has denied that it is failing to honour its contract. The EU is expecting to receive about 30 million AstraZeneca doses by the end of March, less than a third of what it was hoping for. The UK's vaccination drive, meanwhile, has so far been more successful than that of the EU's 27 member states. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Where is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made? EU tussle with UK over AstraZeneca jabs escalates On Thursday, following a virtual summit where EU leaders discussed vaccine supplies, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was the ""region that exports most vaccines worldwide"" and invited other countries to ""match our openness"". She also said AstraZeneca must ""catch up"" on its deliveries to the EU before exporting doses elsewhere. On Friday, Mr Le Drian said the EU ""shouldn't be paying the price"" for the UK's vaccination policy. He also criticised its approach to purchasing jabs, claiming the UK would struggle to source and supply second shots. ""The United Kingdom has taken great pride in vaccinating well with the first dose except they have a problem with the second dose,"" he said. ""One can't play with blackmail,"" he added. ""You can't be playing like this."" The foreign minister did not specify what he considered to be blackmail, but earlier this week UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that strict EU export controls could negatively hit investment in member states. ""I would just gently point out to anybody considering a blockade... that companies may look at such actions and draw conclusions about whether or not it is sensible to make future investments,"" he said. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also said a UK-EU vaccine war would be ""astonishing"" Mr Le Drian is not the only senior French figure to have called for tighter controls on doses sent from the EU. President Emmanuel Macron told reporters on Thursday that the virtual summit marked ""the end of naivety"" from the bloc. ""I support the fact that we must block all exports for as long as some drug companies don't respect their commitments,"" he said. EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, meanwhile, singled out AstraZeneca for criticism. ""AstraZeneca has been an issue,"" he said. ""I just remind you that we were expecting to have 120 million doses... and finally we got 30 million. So we had a problem with this company."" On Thursday, following hours of talks,EU leaders gave their backing in principle to toughening vaccine export controls. But they stopped short of a banning exports altogether, and a post-summit statement emphasised the importance of maintaining the global supply chains needed to produce vaccines. President Ursula von der Leyen, however, voiced frustration at AstraZeneca and threatened to block exports from the UK-Swedish company until it delivered its promised doses to the EU. ""The company has to catch up, [it] has to honour the contract it has with European member states, before it can engage again in exporting vaccines,"" she said. Elements of the AstraZeneca vaccination are manufactured in a number of EU states. This video can not be played One Austrian MEP tells the BBC that export bans should be considered Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said while his fellow leaders had found the Commission's tougher export measures ""acceptable"", he hoped they would never be used - a message echoed by his Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo. Member states also agreed to try and ramp up the production of vaccines within the bloc. They called on manufacturers to ""ensure predictability of their vaccine production and respect contractual delivery deadlines"". A third wave of infections is sweeping across much of mainland Europe. EU states have seen some of the deadliest outbreaks of the pandemic, with Italy recording more than 106,000 deaths, France 93,000, Germany 75,000 and Spain 73,000. Yet recent figures show just 12.9 doses of vaccine have been administered per 100 people in the EU compared with 44.7 in the UK and 37.2 in the US. France's Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said 400,000 people had been vaccinated on Friday, which is just under the UK's daily average. The country is hoping to step-up its vaccination programme in the coming weeks. Also on Friday, Europe's medicines regulator approved three factories for the production of coronavirus vaccines. A site in the Netherlands was cleared to produce the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, while a German factory was given the go-ahead to make Pfizer/BioNTech doses. A manufacturing site for the Moderna jab in Switzerland was also approved. Speaking earlier this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the British variant had become the dominant strain circulating in Germany and amounted to ""a new pandemic"". ""The situation is serious,"" she said. ""Case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive care beds are filling up again."" Lockdowns have been re-imposed or extended in countries like Belgium or the Netherlands but there isparticular concern over eastern EU states. Poland will close nurseries, pre-schools and hairdressers for two weeks from Saturday after coronavirus cases surged.

France accuses UK of 'blackmail' over jab exportsThe row over Covid vaccination supplies escalates after France's foreign minister criticises the UK.Europe,"France's vaccine rollout - along with the rest of the EU - is lagging behind the UK's France has accused the UK of ""blackmail"" over its handling of coronavirus vaccine exports, amid continuing tensions over supply chains. Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian was asked whether the EU had been ""scammed"" by sending millions of doses to the UK while its own rollout stuttered. ""We need to build a co-operative relationship,"" he told France Info radio. ""But we cannot deal this way."" France has called for the EU to implement tougher export controls. Vaccine rollouts have started sluggishly across the bloc, and the EU has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering its promised doses. AstraZeneca has denied that it is failing to honour its contract. The EU is expecting to receive about 30 million AstraZeneca doses by the end of March, less than a third of what it was hoping for. The UK's vaccination drive, meanwhile, has so far been more successful than that of the EU's 27 member states. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Where is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made? EU tussle with UK over AstraZeneca jabs escalates On Thursday, following a virtual summit where EU leaders discussed vaccine supplies, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc was the ""region that exports most vaccines worldwide"" and invited other countries to ""match our openness"". She also said AstraZeneca must ""catch up"" on its deliveries to the EU before exporting doses elsewhere. On Friday, Mr Le Drian said the EU ""shouldn't be paying the price"" for the UK's vaccination policy. He also criticised its approach to purchasing jabs, claiming the UK would struggle to source and supply second shots. ""The United Kingdom has taken great pride in vaccinating well with the first dose except they have a problem with the second dose,"" he said. ""One can't play with blackmail,"" he added. ""You can't be playing like this."" The foreign minister did not specify what he considered to be blackmail, but earlier this week UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that strict EU export controls could negatively hit investment in member states. ""I would just gently point out to anybody considering a blockade... that companies may look at such actions and draw conclusions about whether or not it is sensible to make future investments,"" he said. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also said a UK-EU vaccine war would be ""astonishing"" Mr Le Drian is not the only senior French figure to have called for tighter controls on doses sent from the EU. President Emmanuel Macron told reporters on Thursday that the virtual summit marked ""the end of naivety"" from the bloc. ""I support the fact that we must block all exports for as long as some drug companies don't respect their commitments,"" he said. EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton, meanwhile, singled out AstraZeneca for criticism. ""AstraZeneca has been an issue,"" he said. ""I just remind you that we were expecting to have 120 million doses... and finally we got 30 million. So we had a problem with this company."" On Thursday, following hours of talks,EU leaders gave their backing in principle to toughening vaccine export controls. But they stopped short of a banning exports altogether, and a post-summit statement emphasised the importance of maintaining the global supply chains needed to produce vaccines. President Ursula von der Leyen, however, voiced frustration at AstraZeneca and threatened to block exports from the UK-Swedish company until it delivered its promised doses to the EU. ""The company has to catch up, [it] has to honour the contract it has with European member states, before it can engage again in exporting vaccines,"" she said. Elements of the AstraZeneca vaccination are manufactured in a number of EU states. This video can not be played One Austrian MEP tells the BBC that export bans should be considered Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said while his fellow leaders had found the Commission's tougher export measures ""acceptable"", he hoped they would never be used - a message echoed by his Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo. Member states also agreed to try and ramp up the production of vaccines within the bloc. They called on manufacturers to ""ensure predictability of their vaccine production and respect contractual delivery deadlines"". A third wave of infections is sweeping across much of mainland Europe. EU states have seen some of the deadliest outbreaks of the pandemic, with Italy recording more than 106,000 deaths, France 93,000, Germany 75,000 and Spain 73,000. Yet recent figures show just 12.9 doses of vaccine have been administered per 100 people in the EU compared with 44.7 in the UK and 37.2 in the US. France's Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran said 400,000 people had been vaccinated on Friday, which is just under the UK's daily average. The country is hoping to step-up its vaccination programme in the coming weeks. Also on Friday, Europe's medicines regulator approved three factories for the production of coronavirus vaccines. A site in the Netherlands was cleared to produce the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, while a German factory was given the go-ahead to make Pfizer/BioNTech doses. A manufacturing site for the Moderna jab in Switzerland was also approved. Speaking earlier this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the British variant had become the dominant strain circulating in Germany and amounted to ""a new pandemic"". ""The situation is serious,"" she said. ""Case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive care beds are filling up again."" Lockdowns have been re-imposed or extended in countries like Belgium or the Netherlands but there isparticular concern over eastern EU states. Poland will close nurseries, pre-schools and hairdressers for two weeks from Saturday after coronavirus cases surged.

"The UK professor and the fake Russian agentAn email exchange between a UK professor and a man called ""Ivan"" shows how intense the information war over Syria remains.","Professor Paul McKeigue A British professor corresponded for months with a man called only ""Ivan"", seeking assistance to discredit an organisation that helps bring Syrian war criminals to justice. He also asked ""Ivan"" to investigate other British academics and journalists. The email exchange, seen by the BBC, reveals how, a decade on from the start of the Syrian conflict, a battle is still being waged in the field of information and misinformation. One chilly December morning there was a ping as an email from a professor at Edinburgh University dropped into Bill Wiley's inbox. The subject line read: Questions for William Wiley. Wiley, who runs an organisation that salvages documents for use in war crimes trials from abandoned Syrian government buildings, recognised the sender's name. Prof Paul McKeigue, an epidemiologist from Edinburgh University, had been in touch once before asking similar questions about Wiley's NGO - the Commission for International Justice and Accountability (Cija) - for a critical report he was writing with a professor from Bristol and a former professor who once taught at Sheffield. Knowing what he did of McKeigue's view that Western-funded NGOs are acting on behalf of the CIA and MI6 to blacken the image of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, Wiley felt sure their report would accuse Cija of distorting the truth about torture and murder in Syrian jails. Over the last decade Cija's undercover investigators have salvaged more than 1.3 million documents created by a bureaucratic regime that is obsessed with paperwork, even when it concerns the brutal killing of its own people. All that paperwork is being held in an archive at Cija's headquarters in a secret location in Europe. McKeigue's email to Wiley repeated that he and his colleagues were investigating Cija, but he didn't ask questions about Cija's work. He only seemed to be interested in companies Wiley had registered in his name. Wiley didn't reply. Bill Wiley and some of the 1.3 million documents in the Cija archive A few hours later, McKeigue received an unexpected email too. It was from an anonymous sender and it read: ""My office heard from London yesterday that you have some questions about Syria. Perhaps we can help you get to the truth."" McKeigue quickly replied with a few questions to test his new acquaintance. Was this person aware of chemical attacks in Syria that had been faked? He certainly was, and he hinted that he had access to a treasure trove of knowledge. McKeigue seemed excited to have a fresh source, and an email exchange that would last more than three months got under way. Early on McKeigue revealed that he was interested in Cija and particularly in Wiley. The reply came back that Wiley was a CIA operative who had worked in the US embassy in Iraq. (Part of this was true, Wiley, a Canadian, had been employed by the US Department of Defense to work on the trial of Saddam Hussein in Iraq - but he says he has never worked for the intelligence services.) McKeigue was cautious, though. ""If we just come straight out with 'Wiley is CIA,' I think we will be derided as conspiracy theorists making wild unsourced allegations,"" he wrote. His contact replied: ""My colleagues laughed in a knowing way when this was read to them. What sort of evidence would you want to feel comfortable stating this fact? If we can provide it without damage to our sources we will do that."" While McKeigue's email sign-off included a link to his Edinburgh University profile, his new correspondent initially left his emails unsigned. The only clues to his identity were occasional mistakes in his English, and references to his headquarters in Moscow. And then, after a while, he began signing himself ""Ivan"". Documents strewn across a room in abandoned Baath Party offices in northern Syria, September 2013 McKeigue says he kept an open mind about who was on the other end of this correspondence. He told me that like any other journalist or citizen investigator, he cultivates contacts with all kinds of people who may have relevant information, including anonymous sources. He also told me he believed it was entirely legal for him to do this as a private citizen without access to state secrets. Some of the correspondence dealt with McKeigue's theories about Cija's activities. The academic explained that he and his colleagues regarded Cija as part of a ""strategic communications"" - or StratCom - operation run by the CIA and MI6 on behalf of their governments, which were hell bent on regime change in Syria. From the emails it seems that McKeigue really believed he was doing a public service by trying to uncover a conspiracy being waged to dupe the public. But he also asked Ivan for personal information about Wiley - about a woman he might have slept with, and whether he had a cocaine habit - which didn't bear any relation to the trustworthiness of Cija's documents. And he kept returning to questions about Cija's finances. His overarching aim, he explained, was to get people questioning the evidence Cija had gathered, but there were different ways of doing this, he noted. ""We call it the Al Capone tactic - even if we can't bring them down over war crimes, we may be able to get them over fraud."" This was why his questions to Wiley had focused on the companies he had started. The European anti-fraud office, Olaf, has accused Cija of fraud and irregular accounting, relating to a contract it received from the EU in 2013 worth 3m euros (Â£2.6m). The European Commission is still looking into Olaf's report, but Commission spokesman Peter Stano told the BBC this was not a reason to question the importance of Cija's evidence. ""The Olaf investigation concerns invoicing by the consortium, not the information collected during the implementation of the project and there is no indication of wrongdoing concerning the deliverables of the project,"" he said. Cija's finance team reject the Olaf allegations and say they have sent the European Commission documentation proving that they are false. They also say that since 2013 the organisation has received 70 grants totalling more than 42m euros (Â£36m), and been audited 64 times by external auditors without any adverse findings. Cija has obtained voluminous evidence of war crimes carried out in Syria ""Ivan"" encouraged the professor in his investigations and praised his ingenuity. ""We note that this exchange remains a pleasure for our office. Thank you again and again for your important work... Thank you for resisting the UK's anti-Russia operations. This means a lot to us,"" he wrote. Paul McKeigue says the co-authors of his investigation into Cija did not know about his relationship with Ivan, but the information the professor was gathering was meant for their joint paper. He outlined their motivation: ""A key objective of our little academic group is to encourage members of parliament, lawyers and journalists to hold the government to account by asking questions about these StratCom activities that have not only drawn the UK into confrontation with other countries but have also been used to marginalise and smear dissenters at home."" Before long Ivan was giving McKeigue direction, asking him for information, telling him who to speak to and who not to approach, and the professor seemed to comply with some of these requests. Six weeks into the correspondence Prof McKeigue agreed not to write to any Cija employees without Ivan's prior approval. ""I will not contact anyone without checking first with you,"" he wrote. McKeigue forwarded emails and information to Ivan at his request. Then the professor wrote to Ivan with big news. He had stumbled across what he seemed to regard as persuasive evidence that Wiley was a CIA agent during the time he was in Iraq. It came in a book by a former CIA analyst, John Nixon, who described briefing US Vice-President Dick Cheney on Saddam's interrogation, in April 2008. ""He went to Cheney's office with 'Bill, the CIA analyst who had succeeded me in Baghdad',"" McKeigue writes, quoting Nixon's book. ""This can only be Wiley. What do you think? The CIA's Publication Review Board redacted many other passages, but missed this."" It didn't seem to occur to McKeigue that there could have been more than one ""Bill"" in Iraq at the time, or that Nixon might have used a false name. But Ivan was impressed. ""This is why we admire you and your work so much!!... Funny, we did not know that the meeting was in the public. We thought it was our secret!"" McKeigue seemed excited to be getting somewhere. Now he returned to an offer of Â£10,000 Ivan had made, which he had originally declined. Perhaps it would be useful after all, he said, to bring a legal case against Bill Wiley and Cija on behalf of their employees, who had been ""deceived into working for a CIA front organisation"". ""Such a lawsuit would be expensiveâ¦ Injecting money into a legal fund, covering past and future costs, might be a way for your office to contribute. But the scale of support required would be far more than the figure you mention."" McKeigue also cast his net wider than Cija and asked Ivan to look into what he called ""the UK network of Syria narrative enforcers"". These included British academics and journalists who have challenged his writings about Syria. McKeigue sent Ivan a long list of names and email addresses, and asked him to use that information to work out the connections between them, and who was co-ordinating them. Chloe Hadjimatheou was among the journalists McKeigue asked ""Ivan"" to investigate McKeigue told the man hinting he was a Russian spy that he had particular concerns about a BBC producer who covers Syria. ""Does your office know anything about him?"" he asked. ""It's clear to us that he has been involved in staging incidents in Syria since 2013."" The professor does not seem concerned about whether making an allegation of this kind to a possible Russian agent might put the producer in danger. McKeigue told me that all the information he passed on to Ivan, including email addresses, was in the public domain. He also said the role of these individuals as leading communicators in ""the UK-led information operations associated with the Syrian conflict"" had been widely described in the media. My name was also included on McKeigue's list of these ""narrative enforcers"" supposedly co-ordinated by the British government, and he didn't hold back in telling Ivan what he thinks of me. ""We know quite a lot about CH [Chloe Hadjimatheou], and think she's just a dim-witted person who has been flattered into taking on something beyond her competence."" But Ivan was not a Russian agent - he did not exist. His emails were written by a team of Cija employees, assembled by Bill Wiley in an urgent effort to find out how much McKeigue knew about his organisation. He was particularly worried about the possibility that a Cija employee who had been sacked might have approached McKeigue and his co-authors and given away the location of the archive and the names of staff. Only three staff members of Cija have made their names public, for good reason, says Wiley. They could be harassed or threatened, and hostile elements might find it easier to get into Cija's systems if they knew the names of employees. And the Syrian regime had good reasons to want to destroy the archive of documents. In the course of the correspondence, McKeigue wrote that the sacked member of staff had indeed spoken to him, offering this information and other personal details about Wiley. McKeigue told the BBC that although he did plan on revealing the location of the office he had no intention of making the more personal information public. But Wiley didn't know this, and meanwhile he was well aware that McKeigue's close contacts include the Damascus-based British blogger, Vanessa Beeley. Beeley extols the virtues of the Syrian army as well as President Bashar al-Assad and his wife, often posting photographs of herself with members of the Syrian regime and military commanders on social media. Wiley says he fears that anything McKeigue knows he may have told Beeley, and that she may have passed it on to the Syrian state. So he is not taking any risks. He is currently making plans to relocate the entire Cija archive and staff, and to uproot his family too. The sacked Cija staff member says she would never deliberately compromise the security of ex-colleagues or their families and does not believe she has done so. Both McKeigue and Beeley are members of the Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media, a group of ""independent researchers"" and academics many of whom share McKeigue's view that British and US intelligence services are using the media to cast the Syrian government in a negative light, in order to make the case for regime change. I discussed the Working Group in my Mayday podcast which traces the life and death of James Le Mesurier, a former British army officer, and co-founder of the White Helmets - a group of ordinary Syrian civilians trained with the help of Western funding in how to rescue survivors from bombed buildings. The email exchange between McKeigue and ""Ivan"" is the subject of a 12th episode of the podcast, which will be published on 6 April. It was thanks to this podcast that I ended up on McKeigue's blacklist of journalists. ""From the Mayday podcasts it is clear that you are working with... a presumed MI6 officer,"" he wrote to me. Listen to the 11-part Mayday podcast with Chloe Hadjimatheou on BBC Sounds Read: How the White Helmets and James Le Mesurier got pulled into a deadly battle for truth One of the themes of Mayday was how the White Helmets found themselves at the centre of  a battle to control the narrative of the Syrian war. The Go-Pro cameras attached to their helmets provided footage showing how civilian areas, hospitals and schools were being bombed by Syrian and Russian aircraft. These videos, posted on social media, made it into news reports and documentaries making the group famous and providing millions with evidence of war crimes, including the aftermath of chemical attacks. As a result, James Le Mesurier and the White Helmets came under attack from the Russian and Syrian states, which accused the organisation of everything from working with jihadists to overseeing an organ-harvesting racket. These ideas were taken up by some in the West. One of Paul McKeigue's main preoccupations has been the supposed faking of chemical attacks. Through the Working Group he has co-authored papers, for example, suggesting that the Syrian regime might not have been responsible for the 2018 chlorine attack on the town of Douma as inspectors for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) concluded. Instead, he has put forward the idea that more than 40 victims might have been deliberately killed in a gas chamber as part of a ""managed massacre"" by rebel forces with the help of the White Helmets in an elaborate scheme to con the world. This video can not be played Children being treated after the suspected chemical attack in Douma This was a theory he outlined in a talk presented by the Working Group in Westminster last year. The head of the Intelligence Security Committee, Conservative MP Dr Julian Lewis, was there, although he says he arrived late and didn't hear the part about gas chambers. It turns out McKeigue borrowed the gas chamber idea from a retired American pharmacologist, Denis O'Brien, who described in a self-published paper how it had come to him in a dream after he had eaten an anchovy pizza. O'Brien's paper is full of assumption and conjecture and his analysis is based on his own dream and grainy photographs. His other pet project was something he called ""New Jews"" a list of ""Mainstream Media owners, operators, and stars"" with Jewish connections. McKeigue told me he didn't believe O'Brien's personal views negated the ""compelling"" evidence his paper offers for the idea that chemical attacks were staged using gas chambers. He didn't mention the anchovy-fuelled dreams but he did say that he is neutral with respect to the Syrian conflict, and that his objective is to expose the covert information operations that have, in his view, ""subverted our system of parliamentary government"". The Working Group has echoed other Russian disinformation narratives too. In 2018 McKeigue and the two co-authors of his report on Cija - Piers Robinson, a former professor at the University of Sheffield, and David Miller a professor at Bristol University - published a series of papers on the Salisbury attacks. These argued that the US and UK had had a motive to kill the Russian dissident, Sergei Skripal, in order to prevent him from testifying in a libel case against Christopher Steele, the man who compiled the infamous dossier that purported to show co-operation between the Trump campaign and Russia in the run up to the 2016 US election. Despite the extensive evidence found by the UK authorities pointing to the involvement of the Russian government, and of two assassins believed to have been working for the Russian security services,  the group hypothesised at great length about various factors that would cast doubt on Russia's involvement in the poisonings. In his day job,Prof Paul McKeigueis a genetic epidemiologist. For the last year he has been writing papers about the coronavirus pandemic and acting as a consultant to Public Health Scotland. In October 2020 he became an advocate for the Great Barrington Declaration, which called for the national lockdown to be replaced by the isolation of vulnerable people, allowing the rest of the population to develop herd immunity. Prof David Miller, a sociologist at Bristol University, is currently at the centre of a row over comments he made about Israel and Jewish students. He has long argued that a network of Zionist organisations in the UK, funded and controlled by Israel, has been stirring up Islamophobia. His recent comments included a claim that Israel is ""trying to exert its will all over the world"". The founder of the Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media isDr Piers Robinson, who was professor of politics, society and political journalism at Sheffield University until his sudden departure in 2019. Before he left hewarned students not to buy into stories about fake news,external, which he said were a distraction from the propaganda and lies told by the ""mainstream"" media. Robinson has argued that the US government may have been behind the 9/11 attacks, and that coronavirus has been hyped to control the population through fear. McKeigue says the Working Group's report criticises what was then the official line - that only Russia had the technical means and the motive to carry out this attack. He stresses that at no point do they suggest that ""Western intelligence services"" were responsible for the attack. In 2019 the Working Group wrote a paper accusing James Le Mesurier of corruption and involvement in faking chemical attacks in Syria. But by 2020 Cija was firmly in its sights. Evidence gathered by Cija had made it into high profile court cases like the 2018 lawsuit filed against the Syrian regime by the family of Marie Colvin - the American journalist working for The Sunday Times, who was killed in a rocket attack on a makeshift media centre in the rebel-held city of Homs in February 2012. A Turkish journalist holds images of photographer Remi Ochlik and Marie Colvin both killed in Homs on 22 February 2012 Cija documents were cited extensively in the judgement, which found the Syrian government liable for the extrajudicial killing of Colvin in a deliberate artillery attack, awarding the journalist's family damages of $302m. Cija has also gathered close to 300,000 documents and other pieces of evidence on the Islamic State group, some of which was submitted as evidence in the successful prosecutions of two of its fighters in Germany and the Netherlands. These days Cija is busy with a war crimes trial under way in the German city of Koblenz, one of the first of its kind against a member of the Syrian regime on European soil. In the dock is a former colonel in the Syrian military intelligence service, Anwar Raslan, who stands accused of 4,000 counts of torture, 58 counts of murder and rape and sexual coercion over a period of just 18 months. For 18 years Raslan was in charge of interrogations at one of Syria's most notorious detention facilities - Branch 251 in central Damascus. From the outside it's an unremarkable government building, there is a sportswear shop across the road and a supermarket on the next block, but people who make it out alive - which is by no means a given - are marked for life by the terrible torture they've undergone there. Christoph Reuter, a journalist working for Der Spiegel who interviewed Raslan several years before his arrest, says Raslan was proud of his work and of his success at extracting information. But when the uprising began in 2011, Raslan told Reuter that he felt professionally humiliated at having to torture people whose only crime was to have been caught at a demonstration. They didn't have any information to be extracted. ""It insulted his professional pride, and insulted his moral standardsâ¦ he couldn't stand it any more to torture, to have people possibly killed, who clearly had done nothing wrong,"" says Reuter. Anwar Raslan, 57, arrives at court in April 2020 - German law forbids publication of identifying photographs Aided by opposition rebels, who wanted as many high-ranking defections as possible in order to weaken the regime, Raslan defected to Jordan. By 2014 he had received asylum in Germany, where a year later he walked into a Berlin police station saying he was being followed by Syrian intelligence officers. The police were understandably sceptical, so he explained that he was a defector from the regime - which led ultimately to his arrest at the start of 2020. The trial has provided an incredible insight into the workings of the Syrian regime as witness after witness has taken the stand describing horrific torture, including the systematic rape of men and women. Raslan denies all the charges and his defence has not yet put its side of the case. A lower-ranking Syrian intelligence service employee who helped arrest protesters who were later tortured and murdered was found guilty by the Koblenz court in February and sentenced to more than four years in prison. If Raslan is found guilty he could spend the rest of his life behind bars. McKeigue told ""Ivan"" that he was concerned about the evidence Cija was submitting to the Koblenz trial. He and his co-authors suspected that Cija had originated as a covert UK government strategic communications programme aimed at disseminating false news to discredit President Assad's government and that it might be using its documents to make the Syrian government seem more vicious than it really was. One of the documents submitted by Cija to the court, in order to paint a picture of the system within which Raslan was working, contains a letter from an official to a detention facility to complain about the torture methods being used, including glass bottles being inserted into people's anal passages. The staff are reminded to use ""pre-approved protocols"" for interrogation. A photo taken by Cija at the Raqqa General Intelligence Directorate - one of many sources of documents Another important document in Cija's possession are the minutes from a 2011 meeting of the so-called Central Crisis Management Cell or CCMC, a committee made up of Syrian ministers, heads of the security and intelligence services and the military. It was a top-level body akin to a war cabinet. The minutes in Cija's archive show the CCMC discussing and formalising a list of targets who they wanted arrested and detained, including people who participated in protests, people who funded protests, anyone who ""besmirched the name of Syria"" in comments to the foreign media. Bill Wiley says that he has collected documentary evidence showing that the CCMC decision was passed through the chain of command unamended all the way down to local security intelligence branches and that it lent a structure and formality to the thousands of arrests that followed. The Syrian president was not present at that particular meeting but the minutes Cija has in its possession were taken to him for his personal signature. ""From a legal point of view, this is quite important because it incorporates the members of the CCMC, who took that decision,"" explains Wiley. It is evident, he says, that there was a very conscious decision to arrest unarmed protesters and put them in detention facilities where they would be tortured and possibly killed and that the decision went all the way to the very top of the Syrian regime. In his emails McKeigue told ""Ivan"" that he was concerned about the authenticity of this Cija document but also about the evidence being presented to the court by an anonymous defector known by the alias Caesar. Army defector ""Caesar"", who began leaking images to Syrian opposition groups in 2011, speaking in Washington DC in 2020 Caesar was a state photographer whose job was to document the dead bodies of torture victims, and who in 2013 defected from Syria with a hard drive containing 53,275 photographs. They show more than 6,000 individual victims, men women and children, who display signs of unimaginable torture, including many who have their eyes gouged out. Forensic investigators in Europe have examined the photographs and the metadata they contain and pronounced them genuine. Wiley's team in Syria has also found documents that detail where individual prisoners shown in Caesar's pictures were held - each was photographed with a number painted on their skin, or stuck on their body, and the same prisoner numbers are used in Cija documents. More than 700 victims have been identified by their families after photos were cropped and put online so that relatives could search for missing loved ones. Stephen Rapp, the former US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues, and a member of Cija's board, says there is no doubt about the Caesar evidence. ""It's proven rock solid. We've got better evidence on the Syrian regime, frankly, than the prosecutors two generations ago had against the Nazis. The one thing that they didn't have was pictures of each of those individual victims with a card in front of them, identifying the unit that had killed them,"" he says. ""And so in that sense, when you throw in the Caesar photos, it adds up to better evidence than they had at Nuremberg."" An exhibition of photographs smuggled out of Syria documenting the atrocities carried out by the Assad regime (Washington DC, 2015) McKeigue seemed far from convinced, though. The Working Group had analysed the Caesar photographs and - according to the emails - decided the victims might be captives executed by opposition groups. With the knowledge that courts across Europe had determined that Caesar's identity needed to be protected, the academic asked Ivan to tell him who Caesar was. ""Do you have any more information about his identity and the Syrian opposition group that he is affiliated with?"" he asked. McKeigue told me he believes the Syrian state knows who Caesar is and so his identity does not need to be protected. But the identities both of evidence gatherers, like Caesar, and of regime officials who are named in the documents Cija has gathered need to be confidential because, says Bill Wiley, they are at risk of reprisals, not just from the Syrian regime but also from members of the public. He recounts how, during the televised trial of Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 2005, two Iraqi officials were murdered days after their names appeared in a document displayed on a screen in the courtroom. At times during their correspondence McKeigue appeared to talk remarkably freely with ""Ivan"". A couple of months into their exchange the professor claimed that his co-author, Piers Robinson, and the Damascus-based blogger, Vanessa Beeley, could be reached through a Russian diplomat in Geneva, Sergey Krutskikh. The BBC approached the diplomat for comment, but got no reply. Vanessa Beeley has always maintained she's independent, not incentivised by any government and that her concern is getting to the truth. Piers Robinson said that, like all good researchers, during the course of his writing he is in contact with senior government officials, politicians and members of the military from many states. McKeigue's readiness to expose British academics and journalists to investigation by a man who dropped clues he was a Russian agent, is repeated in some of the later emails with regard to people in far more vulnerable positions. He drew ""Ivan's"" attention to a journalist for the Russian state-funded media outlet, Ruptly, who had been employing local journalists in Douma to look into the attack, and who had shared some information about his results in several emails to McKeigue and Piers Robinson. Douma, on the outskirts of Damascus, at the time of the chemical attack in April 2018 Here was an opportunity to prove that the Douma attack was faked. But things didn't go as they imagined. Ruptly found a witness who said his children and wife had all been killed in the chemical attack. McKeigue then wrote to Ivan, inviting him to spy on the Ruptly journalist. ""I suggest that your office keeps an eye on what [he] and his stringers (if they exist) are doing, without letting him know that anyone has raised concerns."" McKeigue also shared the entire Ruptly email correspondence. Had ""Ivan"" been a real agent he would now have had in his possession the details of a Syrian witness whose evidence ran contrary to the national narrative. Earlier this month the UK government published its Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy in which it mentioned Russia 14 times as posing ""the most acute threat to our security"". Asked to comment on McKeigue's correspondence with ""Ivan"", Edinburgh University said that freedom of expression within the law is central to the concept of a university, and that they seek to foster a culture that enables this kind of expression to take place. Paul McKeigue declined invitations for an interview but told me in an email that he believed he was the victim of an elaborate entrapment operation. ""I think the effort put into this operation makes it obvious that I have annoyed some state-level actors,"" he said. In a statement published on the Working Group's website he said: ""The people on the other end of this sting managed to get me to reveal information provided by others that was not intended to be shared, along with other information that may have been embellished. This was a failure on my part for which I accept responsibility and have apologised to those concerned."" Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, the director of the NGO Doctors Under Fire, which campaigns against attacks on hospitals in war zones, reacted angrily when told that McKeigue repeatedly referred to him in emails to ""Ivan"" as a ""known MI6 agent"". ""Potentially this guy's putting lots of people's lives [at risk] and potentially one of them is mine,"" he said. Approximately 400,000 civilians will be deprived of healthcare after a hospital in Idlib was targeted earlier this week De Bretton-Gordon says he has never worked for the intelligence services. Dr Mohammed Idrees Ahmad from Stirling University, one of those whom McKeigue wanted Ivan to gather information on, said he was not surprised by the revelation, as he has come under attack from the Working Group before. He accused them of spreading rumours first that he was working for the CIA, and later that he was employed by MI6. Bill Wiley says he was forced to carry out the three-month deception because it was the only legal means he could use to work out whether there had been any security breaches which might endanger his staff and the archive. ""This wasn't some kind of revenge operation. It was driven entirely by concerns for our security, and ultimately our findings justified those concerns,"" he says. ""Aside from protecting our sources, witnesses and our personnel, we need to protect our reputation. Because if our reputation is dragged through the mud, our funding will stop. And if the funding stops that will have a highly negative impact on justice."" Correction 23 April 2021: Vanessa Beeley wasn't invited to respond to this article before publication but has since told the BBC that she has never had any communication with Russian diplomat Sergey Krutskikh. Piers Robinson also says he is not in contact with Sergey Krutskikh.

The UK professor and the fake Russian agent,"Professor Paul McKeigue A British professor corresponded for months with a man called only ""Ivan"", seeking assistance to discredit an organisation that helps bring Syrian war criminals to justice. He also asked ""Ivan"" to investigate other British academics and journalists. The email exchange, seen by the BBC, reveals how, a decade on from the start of the Syrian conflict, a battle is still being waged in the field of information and misinformation. One chilly December morning there was a ping as an email from a professor at Edinburgh University dropped into Bill Wiley's inbox. The subject line read: Questions for William Wiley. Wiley, who runs an organisation that salvages documents for use in war crimes trials from abandoned Syrian government buildings, recognised the sender's name. Prof Paul McKeigue, an epidemiologist from Edinburgh University, had been in touch once before asking similar questions about Wiley's NGO - the Commission for International Justice and Accountability (Cija) - for a critical report he was writing with a professor from Bristol and a former professor who once taught at Sheffield. Knowing what he did of McKeigue's view that Western-funded NGOs are acting on behalf of the CIA and MI6 to blacken the image of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad, Wiley felt sure their report would accuse Cija of distorting the truth about torture and murder in Syrian jails. Over the last decade Cija's undercover investigators have salvaged more than 1.3 million documents created by a bureaucratic regime that is obsessed with paperwork, even when it concerns the brutal killing of its own people. All that paperwork is being held in an archive at Cija's headquarters in a secret location in Europe. McKeigue's email to Wiley repeated that he and his colleagues were investigating Cija, but he didn't ask questions about Cija's work. He only seemed to be interested in companies Wiley had registered in his name. Wiley didn't reply. Bill Wiley and some of the 1.3 million documents in the Cija archive A few hours later, McKeigue received an unexpected email too. It was from an anonymous sender and it read: ""My office heard from London yesterday that you have some questions about Syria. Perhaps we can help you get to the truth."" McKeigue quickly replied with a few questions to test his new acquaintance. Was this person aware of chemical attacks in Syria that had been faked? He certainly was, and he hinted that he had access to a treasure trove of knowledge. McKeigue seemed excited to have a fresh source, and an email exchange that would last more than three months got under way. Early on McKeigue revealed that he was interested in Cija and particularly in Wiley. The reply came back that Wiley was a CIA operative who had worked in the US embassy in Iraq. (Part of this was true, Wiley, a Canadian, had been employed by the US Department of Defense to work on the trial of Saddam Hussein in Iraq - but he says he has never worked for the intelligence services.) McKeigue was cautious, though. ""If we just come straight out with 'Wiley is CIA,' I think we will be derided as conspiracy theorists making wild unsourced allegations,"" he wrote. His contact replied: ""My colleagues laughed in a knowing way when this was read to them. What sort of evidence would you want to feel comfortable stating this fact? If we can provide it without damage to our sources we will do that."" While McKeigue's email sign-off included a link to his Edinburgh University profile, his new correspondent initially left his emails unsigned. The only clues to his identity were occasional mistakes in his English, and references to his headquarters in Moscow. And then, after a while, he began signing himself ""Ivan"". Documents strewn across a room in abandoned Baath Party offices in northern Syria, September 2013 McKeigue says he kept an open mind about who was on the other end of this correspondence. He told me that like any other journalist or citizen investigator, he cultivates contacts with all kinds of people who may have relevant information, including anonymous sources. He also told me he believed it was entirely legal for him to do this as a private citizen without access to state secrets. Some of the correspondence dealt with McKeigue's theories about Cija's activities. The academic explained that he and his colleagues regarded Cija as part of a ""strategic communications"" - or StratCom - operation run by the CIA and MI6 on behalf of their governments, which were hell bent on regime change in Syria. From the emails it seems that McKeigue really believed he was doing a public service by trying to uncover a conspiracy being waged to dupe the public. But he also asked Ivan for personal information about Wiley - about a woman he might have slept with, and whether he had a cocaine habit - which didn't bear any relation to the trustworthiness of Cija's documents. And he kept returning to questions about Cija's finances. His overarching aim, he explained, was to get people questioning the evidence Cija had gathered, but there were different ways of doing this, he noted. ""We call it the Al Capone tactic - even if we can't bring them down over war crimes, we may be able to get them over fraud."" This was why his questions to Wiley had focused on the companies he had started. The European anti-fraud office, Olaf, has accused Cija of fraud and irregular accounting, relating to a contract it received from the EU in 2013 worth 3m euros (Â£2.6m). The European Commission is still looking into Olaf's report, but Commission spokesman Peter Stano told the BBC this was not a reason to question the importance of Cija's evidence. ""The Olaf investigation concerns invoicing by the consortium, not the information collected during the implementation of the project and there is no indication of wrongdoing concerning the deliverables of the project,"" he said. Cija's finance team reject the Olaf allegations and say they have sent the European Commission documentation proving that they are false. They also say that since 2013 the organisation has received 70 grants totalling more than 42m euros (Â£36m), and been audited 64 times by external auditors without any adverse findings. Cija has obtained voluminous evidence of war crimes carried out in Syria ""Ivan"" encouraged the professor in his investigations and praised his ingenuity. ""We note that this exchange remains a pleasure for our office. Thank you again and again for your important work... Thank you for resisting the UK's anti-Russia operations. This means a lot to us,"" he wrote. Paul McKeigue says the co-authors of his investigation into Cija did not know about his relationship with Ivan, but the information the professor was gathering was meant for their joint paper. He outlined their motivation: ""A key objective of our little academic group is to encourage members of parliament, lawyers and journalists to hold the government to account by asking questions about these StratCom activities that have not only drawn the UK into confrontation with other countries but have also been used to marginalise and smear dissenters at home."" Before long Ivan was giving McKeigue direction, asking him for information, telling him who to speak to and who not to approach, and the professor seemed to comply with some of these requests. Six weeks into the correspondence Prof McKeigue agreed not to write to any Cija employees without Ivan's prior approval. ""I will not contact anyone without checking first with you,"" he wrote. McKeigue forwarded emails and information to Ivan at his request. Then the professor wrote to Ivan with big news. He had stumbled across what he seemed to regard as persuasive evidence that Wiley was a CIA agent during the time he was in Iraq. It came in a book by a former CIA analyst, John Nixon, who described briefing US Vice-President Dick Cheney on Saddam's interrogation, in April 2008. ""He went to Cheney's office with 'Bill, the CIA analyst who had succeeded me in Baghdad',"" McKeigue writes, quoting Nixon's book. ""This can only be Wiley. What do you think? The CIA's Publication Review Board redacted many other passages, but missed this."" It didn't seem to occur to McKeigue that there could have been more than one ""Bill"" in Iraq at the time, or that Nixon might have used a false name. But Ivan was impressed. ""This is why we admire you and your work so much!!... Funny, we did not know that the meeting was in the public. We thought it was our secret!"" McKeigue seemed excited to be getting somewhere. Now he returned to an offer of Â£10,000 Ivan had made, which he had originally declined. Perhaps it would be useful after all, he said, to bring a legal case against Bill Wiley and Cija on behalf of their employees, who had been ""deceived into working for a CIA front organisation"". ""Such a lawsuit would be expensiveâ¦ Injecting money into a legal fund, covering past and future costs, might be a way for your office to contribute. But the scale of support required would be far more than the figure you mention."" McKeigue also cast his net wider than Cija and asked Ivan to look into what he called ""the UK network of Syria narrative enforcers"". These included British academics and journalists who have challenged his writings about Syria. McKeigue sent Ivan a long list of names and email addresses, and asked him to use that information to work out the connections between them, and who was co-ordinating them. Chloe Hadjimatheou was among the journalists McKeigue asked ""Ivan"" to investigate McKeigue told the man hinting he was a Russian spy that he had particular concerns about a BBC producer who covers Syria. ""Does your office know anything about him?"" he asked. ""It's clear to us that he has been involved in staging incidents in Syria since 2013."" The professor does not seem concerned about whether making an allegation of this kind to a possible Russian agent might put the producer in danger. McKeigue told me that all the information he passed on to Ivan, including email addresses, was in the public domain. He also said the role of these individuals as leading communicators in ""the UK-led information operations associated with the Syrian conflict"" had been widely described in the media. My name was also included on McKeigue's list of these ""narrative enforcers"" supposedly co-ordinated by the British government, and he didn't hold back in telling Ivan what he thinks of me. ""We know quite a lot about CH [Chloe Hadjimatheou], and think she's just a dim-witted person who has been flattered into taking on something beyond her competence."" But Ivan was not a Russian agent - he did not exist. His emails were written by a team of Cija employees, assembled by Bill Wiley in an urgent effort to find out how much McKeigue knew about his organisation. He was particularly worried about the possibility that a Cija employee who had been sacked might have approached McKeigue and his co-authors and given away the location of the archive and the names of staff. Only three staff members of Cija have made their names public, for good reason, says Wiley. They could be harassed or threatened, and hostile elements might find it easier to get into Cija's systems if they knew the names of employees. And the Syrian regime had good reasons to want to destroy the archive of documents. In the course of the correspondence, McKeigue wrote that the sacked member of staff had indeed spoken to him, offering this information and other personal details about Wiley. McKeigue told the BBC that although he did plan on revealing the location of the office he had no intention of making the more personal information public. But Wiley didn't know this, and meanwhile he was well aware that McKeigue's close contacts include the Damascus-based British blogger, Vanessa Beeley. Beeley extols the virtues of the Syrian army as well as President Bashar al-Assad and his wife, often posting photographs of herself with members of the Syrian regime and military commanders on social media. Wiley says he fears that anything McKeigue knows he may have told Beeley, and that she may have passed it on to the Syrian state. So he is not taking any risks. He is currently making plans to relocate the entire Cija archive and staff, and to uproot his family too. The sacked Cija staff member says she would never deliberately compromise the security of ex-colleagues or their families and does not believe she has done so. Both McKeigue and Beeley are members of the Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media, a group of ""independent researchers"" and academics many of whom share McKeigue's view that British and US intelligence services are using the media to cast the Syrian government in a negative light, in order to make the case for regime change. I discussed the Working Group in my Mayday podcast which traces the life and death of James Le Mesurier, a former British army officer, and co-founder of the White Helmets - a group of ordinary Syrian civilians trained with the help of Western funding in how to rescue survivors from bombed buildings. The email exchange between McKeigue and ""Ivan"" is the subject of a 12th episode of the podcast, which will be published on 6 April. It was thanks to this podcast that I ended up on McKeigue's blacklist of journalists. ""From the Mayday podcasts it is clear that you are working with... a presumed MI6 officer,"" he wrote to me. Listen to the 11-part Mayday podcast with Chloe Hadjimatheou on BBC Sounds Read: How the White Helmets and James Le Mesurier got pulled into a deadly battle for truth One of the themes of Mayday was how the White Helmets found themselves at the centre of  a battle to control the narrative of the Syrian war. The Go-Pro cameras attached to their helmets provided footage showing how civilian areas, hospitals and schools were being bombed by Syrian and Russian aircraft. These videos, posted on social media, made it into news reports and documentaries making the group famous and providing millions with evidence of war crimes, including the aftermath of chemical attacks. As a result, James Le Mesurier and the White Helmets came under attack from the Russian and Syrian states, which accused the organisation of everything from working with jihadists to overseeing an organ-harvesting racket. These ideas were taken up by some in the West. One of Paul McKeigue's main preoccupations has been the supposed faking of chemical attacks. Through the Working Group he has co-authored papers, for example, suggesting that the Syrian regime might not have been responsible for the 2018 chlorine attack on the town of Douma as inspectors for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) concluded. Instead, he has put forward the idea that more than 40 victims might have been deliberately killed in a gas chamber as part of a ""managed massacre"" by rebel forces with the help of the White Helmets in an elaborate scheme to con the world. This video can not be played Children being treated after the suspected chemical attack in Douma This was a theory he outlined in a talk presented by the Working Group in Westminster last year. The head of the Intelligence Security Committee, Conservative MP Dr Julian Lewis, was there, although he says he arrived late and didn't hear the part about gas chambers. It turns out McKeigue borrowed the gas chamber idea from a retired American pharmacologist, Denis O'Brien, who described in a self-published paper how it had come to him in a dream after he had eaten an anchovy pizza. O'Brien's paper is full of assumption and conjecture and his analysis is based on his own dream and grainy photographs. His other pet project was something he called ""New Jews"" a list of ""Mainstream Media owners, operators, and stars"" with Jewish connections. McKeigue told me he didn't believe O'Brien's personal views negated the ""compelling"" evidence his paper offers for the idea that chemical attacks were staged using gas chambers. He didn't mention the anchovy-fuelled dreams but he did say that he is neutral with respect to the Syrian conflict, and that his objective is to expose the covert information operations that have, in his view, ""subverted our system of parliamentary government"". The Working Group has echoed other Russian disinformation narratives too. In 2018 McKeigue and the two co-authors of his report on Cija - Piers Robinson, a former professor at the University of Sheffield, and David Miller a professor at Bristol University - published a series of papers on the Salisbury attacks. These argued that the US and UK had had a motive to kill the Russian dissident, Sergei Skripal, in order to prevent him from testifying in a libel case against Christopher Steele, the man who compiled the infamous dossier that purported to show co-operation between the Trump campaign and Russia in the run up to the 2016 US election. Despite the extensive evidence found by the UK authorities pointing to the involvement of the Russian government, and of two assassins believed to have been working for the Russian security services,  the group hypothesised at great length about various factors that would cast doubt on Russia's involvement in the poisonings. In his day job,Prof Paul McKeigueis a genetic epidemiologist. For the last year he has been writing papers about the coronavirus pandemic and acting as a consultant to Public Health Scotland. In October 2020 he became an advocate for the Great Barrington Declaration, which called for the national lockdown to be replaced by the isolation of vulnerable people, allowing the rest of the population to develop herd immunity. Prof David Miller, a sociologist at Bristol University, is currently at the centre of a row over comments he made about Israel and Jewish students. He has long argued that a network of Zionist organisations in the UK, funded and controlled by Israel, has been stirring up Islamophobia. His recent comments included a claim that Israel is ""trying to exert its will all over the world"". The founder of the Working Group on Syria, Propaganda and Media isDr Piers Robinson, who was professor of politics, society and political journalism at Sheffield University until his sudden departure in 2019. Before he left hewarned students not to buy into stories about fake news,external, which he said were a distraction from the propaganda and lies told by the ""mainstream"" media. Robinson has argued that the US government may have been behind the 9/11 attacks, and that coronavirus has been hyped to control the population through fear. McKeigue says the Working Group's report criticises what was then the official line - that only Russia had the technical means and the motive to carry out this attack. He stresses that at no point do they suggest that ""Western intelligence services"" were responsible for the attack. In 2019 the Working Group wrote a paper accusing James Le Mesurier of corruption and involvement in faking chemical attacks in Syria. But by 2020 Cija was firmly in its sights. Evidence gathered by Cija had made it into high profile court cases like the 2018 lawsuit filed against the Syrian regime by the family of Marie Colvin - the American journalist working for The Sunday Times, who was killed in a rocket attack on a makeshift media centre in the rebel-held city of Homs in February 2012. A Turkish journalist holds images of photographer Remi Ochlik and Marie Colvin both killed in Homs on 22 February 2012 Cija documents were cited extensively in the judgement, which found the Syrian government liable for the extrajudicial killing of Colvin in a deliberate artillery attack, awarding the journalist's family damages of $302m. Cija has also gathered close to 300,000 documents and other pieces of evidence on the Islamic State group, some of which was submitted as evidence in the successful prosecutions of two of its fighters in Germany and the Netherlands. These days Cija is busy with a war crimes trial under way in the German city of Koblenz, one of the first of its kind against a member of the Syrian regime on European soil. In the dock is a former colonel in the Syrian military intelligence service, Anwar Raslan, who stands accused of 4,000 counts of torture, 58 counts of murder and rape and sexual coercion over a period of just 18 months. For 18 years Raslan was in charge of interrogations at one of Syria's most notorious detention facilities - Branch 251 in central Damascus. From the outside it's an unremarkable government building, there is a sportswear shop across the road and a supermarket on the next block, but people who make it out alive - which is by no means a given - are marked for life by the terrible torture they've undergone there. Christoph Reuter, a journalist working for Der Spiegel who interviewed Raslan several years before his arrest, says Raslan was proud of his work and of his success at extracting information. But when the uprising began in 2011, Raslan told Reuter that he felt professionally humiliated at having to torture people whose only crime was to have been caught at a demonstration. They didn't have any information to be extracted. ""It insulted his professional pride, and insulted his moral standardsâ¦ he couldn't stand it any more to torture, to have people possibly killed, who clearly had done nothing wrong,"" says Reuter. Anwar Raslan, 57, arrives at court in April 2020 - German law forbids publication of identifying photographs Aided by opposition rebels, who wanted as many high-ranking defections as possible in order to weaken the regime, Raslan defected to Jordan. By 2014 he had received asylum in Germany, where a year later he walked into a Berlin police station saying he was being followed by Syrian intelligence officers. The police were understandably sceptical, so he explained that he was a defector from the regime - which led ultimately to his arrest at the start of 2020. The trial has provided an incredible insight into the workings of the Syrian regime as witness after witness has taken the stand describing horrific torture, including the systematic rape of men and women. Raslan denies all the charges and his defence has not yet put its side of the case. A lower-ranking Syrian intelligence service employee who helped arrest protesters who were later tortured and murdered was found guilty by the Koblenz court in February and sentenced to more than four years in prison. If Raslan is found guilty he could spend the rest of his life behind bars. McKeigue told ""Ivan"" that he was concerned about the evidence Cija was submitting to the Koblenz trial. He and his co-authors suspected that Cija had originated as a covert UK government strategic communications programme aimed at disseminating false news to discredit President Assad's government and that it might be using its documents to make the Syrian government seem more vicious than it really was. One of the documents submitted by Cija to the court, in order to paint a picture of the system within which Raslan was working, contains a letter from an official to a detention facility to complain about the torture methods being used, including glass bottles being inserted into people's anal passages. The staff are reminded to use ""pre-approved protocols"" for interrogation. A photo taken by Cija at the Raqqa General Intelligence Directorate - one of many sources of documents Another important document in Cija's possession are the minutes from a 2011 meeting of the so-called Central Crisis Management Cell or CCMC, a committee made up of Syrian ministers, heads of the security and intelligence services and the military. It was a top-level body akin to a war cabinet. The minutes in Cija's archive show the CCMC discussing and formalising a list of targets who they wanted arrested and detained, including people who participated in protests, people who funded protests, anyone who ""besmirched the name of Syria"" in comments to the foreign media. Bill Wiley says that he has collected documentary evidence showing that the CCMC decision was passed through the chain of command unamended all the way down to local security intelligence branches and that it lent a structure and formality to the thousands of arrests that followed. The Syrian president was not present at that particular meeting but the minutes Cija has in its possession were taken to him for his personal signature. ""From a legal point of view, this is quite important because it incorporates the members of the CCMC, who took that decision,"" explains Wiley. It is evident, he says, that there was a very conscious decision to arrest unarmed protesters and put them in detention facilities where they would be tortured and possibly killed and that the decision went all the way to the very top of the Syrian regime. In his emails McKeigue told ""Ivan"" that he was concerned about the authenticity of this Cija document but also about the evidence being presented to the court by an anonymous defector known by the alias Caesar. Army defector ""Caesar"", who began leaking images to Syrian opposition groups in 2011, speaking in Washington DC in 2020 Caesar was a state photographer whose job was to document the dead bodies of torture victims, and who in 2013 defected from Syria with a hard drive containing 53,275 photographs. They show more than 6,000 individual victims, men women and children, who display signs of unimaginable torture, including many who have their eyes gouged out. Forensic investigators in Europe have examined the photographs and the metadata they contain and pronounced them genuine. Wiley's team in Syria has also found documents that detail where individual prisoners shown in Caesar's pictures were held - each was photographed with a number painted on their skin, or stuck on their body, and the same prisoner numbers are used in Cija documents. More than 700 victims have been identified by their families after photos were cropped and put online so that relatives could search for missing loved ones. Stephen Rapp, the former US Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues, and a member of Cija's board, says there is no doubt about the Caesar evidence. ""It's proven rock solid. We've got better evidence on the Syrian regime, frankly, than the prosecutors two generations ago had against the Nazis. The one thing that they didn't have was pictures of each of those individual victims with a card in front of them, identifying the unit that had killed them,"" he says. ""And so in that sense, when you throw in the Caesar photos, it adds up to better evidence than they had at Nuremberg."" An exhibition of photographs smuggled out of Syria documenting the atrocities carried out by the Assad regime (Washington DC, 2015) McKeigue seemed far from convinced, though. The Working Group had analysed the Caesar photographs and - according to the emails - decided the victims might be captives executed by opposition groups. With the knowledge that courts across Europe had determined that Caesar's identity needed to be protected, the academic asked Ivan to tell him who Caesar was. ""Do you have any more information about his identity and the Syrian opposition group that he is affiliated with?"" he asked. McKeigue told me he believes the Syrian state knows who Caesar is and so his identity does not need to be protected. But the identities both of evidence gatherers, like Caesar, and of regime officials who are named in the documents Cija has gathered need to be confidential because, says Bill Wiley, they are at risk of reprisals, not just from the Syrian regime but also from members of the public. He recounts how, during the televised trial of Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 2005, two Iraqi officials were murdered days after their names appeared in a document displayed on a screen in the courtroom. At times during their correspondence McKeigue appeared to talk remarkably freely with ""Ivan"". A couple of months into their exchange the professor claimed that his co-author, Piers Robinson, and the Damascus-based blogger, Vanessa Beeley, could be reached through a Russian diplomat in Geneva, Sergey Krutskikh. The BBC approached the diplomat for comment, but got no reply. Vanessa Beeley has always maintained she's independent, not incentivised by any government and that her concern is getting to the truth. Piers Robinson said that, like all good researchers, during the course of his writing he is in contact with senior government officials, politicians and members of the military from many states. McKeigue's readiness to expose British academics and journalists to investigation by a man who dropped clues he was a Russian agent, is repeated in some of the later emails with regard to people in far more vulnerable positions. He drew ""Ivan's"" attention to a journalist for the Russian state-funded media outlet, Ruptly, who had been employing local journalists in Douma to look into the attack, and who had shared some information about his results in several emails to McKeigue and Piers Robinson. Douma, on the outskirts of Damascus, at the time of the chemical attack in April 2018 Here was an opportunity to prove that the Douma attack was faked. But things didn't go as they imagined. Ruptly found a witness who said his children and wife had all been killed in the chemical attack. McKeigue then wrote to Ivan, inviting him to spy on the Ruptly journalist. ""I suggest that your office keeps an eye on what [he] and his stringers (if they exist) are doing, without letting him know that anyone has raised concerns."" McKeigue also shared the entire Ruptly email correspondence. Had ""Ivan"" been a real agent he would now have had in his possession the details of a Syrian witness whose evidence ran contrary to the national narrative. Earlier this month the UK government published its Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy in which it mentioned Russia 14 times as posing ""the most acute threat to our security"". Asked to comment on McKeigue's correspondence with ""Ivan"", Edinburgh University said that freedom of expression within the law is central to the concept of a university, and that they seek to foster a culture that enables this kind of expression to take place. Paul McKeigue declined invitations for an interview but told me in an email that he believed he was the victim of an elaborate entrapment operation. ""I think the effort put into this operation makes it obvious that I have annoyed some state-level actors,"" he said. In a statement published on the Working Group's website he said: ""The people on the other end of this sting managed to get me to reveal information provided by others that was not intended to be shared, along with other information that may have been embellished. This was a failure on my part for which I accept responsibility and have apologised to those concerned."" Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, the director of the NGO Doctors Under Fire, which campaigns against attacks on hospitals in war zones, reacted angrily when told that McKeigue repeatedly referred to him in emails to ""Ivan"" as a ""known MI6 agent"". ""Potentially this guy's putting lots of people's lives [at risk] and potentially one of them is mine,"" he said. Approximately 400,000 civilians will be deprived of healthcare after a hospital in Idlib was targeted earlier this week De Bretton-Gordon says he has never worked for the intelligence services. Dr Mohammed Idrees Ahmad from Stirling University, one of those whom McKeigue wanted Ivan to gather information on, said he was not surprised by the revelation, as he has come under attack from the Working Group before. He accused them of spreading rumours first that he was working for the CIA, and later that he was employed by MI6. Bill Wiley says he was forced to carry out the three-month deception because it was the only legal means he could use to work out whether there had been any security breaches which might endanger his staff and the archive. ""This wasn't some kind of revenge operation. It was driven entirely by concerns for our security, and ultimately our findings justified those concerns,"" he says. ""Aside from protecting our sources, witnesses and our personnel, we need to protect our reputation. Because if our reputation is dragged through the mud, our funding will stop. And if the funding stops that will have a highly negative impact on justice.""

LiveLiveCovid infections levelling off in the UK3 minutes ago,"The number testing positive for coronavirus is levelling off in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and has risen in Scotland, official figures suggest Infection levels in secondary school-age children rose slightly in England although they fell in older teenagers, according to the Office for National Statistics The UK's R number has narrowed slightly to 0.7-0.9 from 0.6-0.9 last week - it shows the epidemic is still shrinking because it remains below 1 The UK's daily figures show another 6,187 confirmed cases and 70 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test France has accused the UK of ""blackmail"" over its handling of coronavirus vaccine exports, amid continuing tensions over supply chains Germany's disease control agency says there are very clear signs the third Covid-19 wave could be much worse than the previous two ""Stay-local"" rules will lift in Wales from Saturday and unrestricted travel within Wales will be allowed The US has passed 30 million recorded coronavirus cases, the highest number of cases in the world Edited by Chris Clayton and Sarah Collerton Today's live page is
coming to a close now. Thank you for joining us. It was brought to you by Chris Clayton, Sarah Collerton, Alexandra
Fouche, George Bowden and Jo Couzens. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Restrictions are continuing to ease across the UK. In Wales, a ""stay-local"" rule ends tomorrow, with some overnight accommodation reopening, allowing people to travel within the country. Meanwhile, outdoor gatherings of up to six people, or two households, in England will be allowed from Monday - including in private gardens. People will no longer be required to stay at home wherever possible, although everyone will be encouraged to stay local. Find out the rules in your areahere. BBC World Service France's foreign minister has accused Russia of using its Sputnik coronavirus vaccine as an instrument of aggressive diplomacy. Jean-Yves Le Drian contrasted the fanfare around a recent Russian delivery of a consignment of Sputnik V to Tunisia with that given to the much larger delivery through the UN-backed global Covax initiative. He made a similar contrast with a delivery of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine in Senegal with Covax consignments. Russia had announced ""with a lot of media attention"" that it would deliver 30,000 vaccine doses to Tunisia, the minister is quoted as  telling French radio by the AFP news agency. By then, the UN-backed initiative had already delivered 100,000 doses to the north African country, AFP adds, quoting the minister. The manufacturers of Sputnik V have not yet applied for market authorisation for the vaccine in the European Union, although EU regulators have begun a rolling review of test data. Yes, so do we. Well, we've got some good news (some are coming back this summer!) - and some bad news (others aren't just yet...) We heard earlier that TRNSMT festival in Glasgowhas been movedfrom its traditional July slot to September. Want to know which other festivals are still going ahead?We've compiled a handy list for you, but here's what's going on with some of the big ones: Boris Johnson spoke to US President Joe Biden this afternoon, discussing the fight against coronavirus and the UK and US Covid-19 vaccine rolllouts. Downing Street said the prime minister had ""stressed that global access to vaccines will be key to defeating the pandemic"". âThe prime minister and president agreed that combatting climate change will be a crucial component of building back better from the pandemic,"" said a Number 10 spokesperson. The two also talked about shared international challenges, including their shared commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland. Facebook, Twitter and Google have been urged by a US lawmaker to ban a dozen people who it is claimed are spreading the vast majority of disinformation about Covid vaccinations. Representative Mike Doyle made the call to remove their accounts during a US congressional session on how the three firms were dealing with fake news. He challenged Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Google's Sundar Pinchai to deplatform the dozen people in question immediately. None have responded to the call so far. Facebook said it was looking into the matter to see if the accounts violated its community standards. Twitter and Google have not responded to the BBC on the specific request to remove the accounts.

A further 6,187 confirmed cases across the UK were announced today. That compares with 4,802 a week ago. A further 70 deaths across the UK within 28 days of a positive test were also reported earlier - compared with 101 last Friday. Meanwhile, the vaccine rollout is continuing, with around half of all UK adults having now received a first dose. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent We heard earlier today that hauliers travelling from continental Europe have been told that theywill be required to take a Covid test. We're now hearing more - an industry source has said they have been told that the measures are expected to start on 6 April onwards. All lorry and van drivers are required to take the test if they stay in the UK for more than 48 hours. They will need to get tested within 48 hours of arriving and will also be required to complete a passenger locator form so that they can be contacted while in the UK. The tests will be free and available at the existing government haulier sites previously set up to test drivers travelling out of the UK to certain European countries that require them, such as Denmark or Germany. Those who donât comply have been warned they can expect to be fined Â£2,000.
If drivers stay for longer, a second test is required within five days of arrival. If drivers stay longer than five days, they are required to take a third test within eight days of arrival. Drivers arriving from the EU to make deliveries should only leave their cabs for essential purposes, which include eating and using washing facilities. The Department for Transport has previously said it was carefully monitoring the increase in cases in Europe and would keep all measures under review. The head of the World Head Organization (WHO) has urged countries to donate 10 million vaccine doses ""immediately"" to help meet vaccination targets for poorer countries. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the international Covax vaccine-sharing programme needed the doses as a stop-gap measure. ""Covax is ready to deliver, but we can't deliver vaccines we
don't have. Bilateral deals, export bans and vaccine
nationalism have caused distortions in the market with gross
inequities in supply and demand,"" he told a news conference. ""There are plenty of countries who can afford to donate doses with little disruption to their own Covid-19 vaccination plans. 

The more countries that donate ASAP, the more doses we will have to share with countries who need them desperately,"" he added. Read more about Covax here British High Street photographic equipment chainJessops has filed a notice to appoint administratorsafter being severely impacted by the pandemic. The camera retailer, which employs 120 staff and has 17 stores, is owned by Dragons' Den star Peter Jones. Jessops said it had hired advisers FRP to help it restructure the business. The notice of intent provides the business with protection for 10 days from existing or pending creditor claims. The retailer said it planned to continue to trade when lockdown restrictions lift in April. It is considering a rescue deal in the form of a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Lockdown is, step-by-step, beginning to ease across the UK.But with infection rates rising in Europe, the British public is also being warned of the risk of a third wave. While the outbreaks in Europe have been portrayed as the threat, we should not forget the virus is still lurking here. Infection rates have dropped dramatically since the turn of the year - there has been a 12-fold fall in daily cases being reported. But that still leaves more than enough infection circulating that could easily take off. The Office for National Statistics estimates that, along with asymptomatic cases, there could be more than 100,000 infectious people out there. Already there are signs of a slight increase in cases among children following the return to schools in England. Read more here. British holidaymakers are beingwarned ""not to put the summer at risk""by travelling to the South West of England before lockdown restrictions ease. Under the UK government's roadmap, 12 April is the earliest date attractions and some self-contained accommodation is allowed to open. Devon County Council said it would give tourists a warm welcome ""when the guidelines allow, but not before"", warning visitors it is ""illegal"" and ""dangerous"" to travel down any earlier. ""After all our hard work to keep Covid-19 cases in Devon so low, we do not want to risk things now,"" said Keri Denton, Devon County Council's head of economy, skills and enterprise. Coping with cancer is difficult enough - and, for these young people, the pandemic has made their road to recovery even more challenging. Hospital treatments have been affected due to Covid restrictions. Many people had to attend appointments and treatment sessions alone. Mia Mackin, 24, and Lauren Lester, 25, spoke to BBC News NI about the added loneliness and fear that coronavirus brought to their journey with cancer. This video can not be played This video can not be played We told you earlier about somecountries' plans for vaccine passports. It is a way of opening up society once a large number of people get the jab, as well as enabling foreign travel further down the line. Estonia's Kalle Killar, who is undersecretary for e-health and Innovation at the country's ministry of social affairs, tells the BBC's Newsday programme about their own plans - their version of the digital vaccination certificate will come in the form of a QR code. ""In Estonia, we are very keen on providing all our citizens with digital services, and vaccine certificates is one of them. What we are able to do is that people can save this QR code to their phone or read it out or show it online. ""We are trying to do the best in order to provide our citizens with the best possible digital information, no matter where it will be used - whether at border crossings or some other usage that is still open."" It's been a family favourite for a century but Blackpool tourism bosses fear the Lancashire seaside resort may take five years to recover from Covid. The resort's head of tourism, Philip Welsh, said private sector partners had ""taken a hit"" during the pandemic. He told a meeting that Blackpool was preparing for an ""influx of visitors"" this year as restrictions lift. However, the council warned it would be tougher to sustain tourism past the summer months and as holidays abroad take off once more. Read morehere. And we've now heard from the WHO about the timing or the release of the report into the origins of the virus. The head of the team that went to Wuhan has said its content has now been finalised and he expects the report to be completed and released in the next few days, Reuters news agency reports. The head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, Mike Ryan, says the report will first be shared with member states for discussion and then released publicly. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst WHO members have been investigating the origins of Covid-19 in Wuhan A Chinese official has outlined the ""major findings"" of the China-WHO joint team investigation into the origins of Covid-19 in the city of Wuhan carried out earlier this
year, the national Global Times newspaper has reported. Feng Zijian, the deputy
director general of Chinaâs Centre for Disease Control and Prevention - and member of the joint team - spoke earlier today ahead of a briefing on the long-awaited
report, arranged by Chinaâs foreign ministry. Diplomats from
some 50 countries attended the press conference, Global Times said. Feng said the source-tracing work had been finalised with the consensus
that more work needed to be done on identifying the potential natural host of
the virus. According to the newspaper, he said ""experts found a highly
similar virus to Covid-19 in bats and pangolins in terms of virus sequencing"" but that those assessed were ""proven not to be a direct ancestor"". It was his view that ""more animal species, including mink and cats [were]
worthy of inquiry"" as potential natural hosts. ""We need to not only focus on bats while ignoring other
possibilities, as many other species are also vulnerable to the virus,"" he said. Feng said China had done much work on collecting bat samples but there was a ""lack of relevant work in research and sampling in neighbouring countries of
China and other countries across the world"", and suggested wider study
overseas, reported the Global Times. China has long refuted suggestions that Covid-19 might have maliciously entered into the world
from Wuhan, and has criticised references to the virus as the ""China virus"" or the ""Wuhan virus"". Members of the WHO team have previously
commented on the unlikelihood of the virus leaking from a Wuhan lab. State media have repeatedly
commented that other countries need to show the same willingness as China in
letting scientists investigate whether the virus might have originated elsewhere. Allowing shops in England to stay open until 22:00 six days a week will help people return to high streets safely, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said. Announcing changes to licencing, he said longer opening would give people greater flexibility to avoid peak times and ease transport pressures when non-essential shops open on 12 April at the earliest. The government is also extending flexible working hours on construction sites, allowing food deliveries to supermarkets over more time periods, and keeping the flexibility for pubs and restaurants to put up marquees to help increase seating capacity. Mr Jenrick said the move would help with ""protecting jobs, reducing pressure on public transport and supporting people and communities to continue to visit their high streets safely and shop locally"". French Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran receives a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine The EU has been criticised for the pace of its vaccination programme - only 14% of its population have received the jab, compared with 47% in the UK. In June 2020, all 27 member states joined up to a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines. However, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca, whichcaused supply problems,external. It also signed deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which ran into early problems with production and distribution. But the EU is concerned that the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom are based within the EU. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ships stuck in 'traffic jam' outside Suez CanalThe queue has grown rapidly since a container vessel became wedged, a sailor says.","More than 230 ships are waiting to enter the Suez Canal, through which all navigation has been suspended The blockage of Egypt's Suez canal by a giant container ship is causing a ""traffic jam"" in the Red Sea, according to a merchant seaman on a nearby ship. Joe Reynolds, chief engineer of the Maersk Ohio, told the BBC the number of vessels waiting at the canal's southern entrance was ""growing exponentially"". ""It's going to affect shipping schedules around the world,"" he warned. Tugboats and dredgers are trying to dislodge the Ever Given, which is wedged diagonally across the waterway. The 400m-long (1,300ft), 200,000-tonne vessel ran aground on Tuesday morning amid high winds and a sandstorm that affected visibility. Specialist salvage companies have been brought in to help refloat the ship, and an adviser to Egypt's president has said he hopes the situation will be resolved within two to three days. But experts have said it could take weeks if the vessel's containers need to be removed. 'Our customers are worried about the Suez blockage' How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal About 12% of global trade passes through the 193km (120-mile) canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. An alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, can take two weeks longer. Mr Reynolds told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the Maersk Ohio, a US-flagged container ship that is 292m long and weighs 50,000 tonnes, was ""stacked up"" alongside dozens of other vessels near Port Suez. ""I think you can imagine there was a queue of ships waiting to go through to begin with, and now that queue has just grown exponentially,"" he said. ""Standing outside, as you look, everywhere around you is ships."" This video can not be played A salvage company, working to free the Ever Given, says the operation could take weeks He said there was still a lot of work to be done on board his ship, and that he and his fellow crewmembers had not yet had a chance to communicate with the other vessels. ""It's just a long waiting game. There's not a lot to see... We are ships sitting at anchor, just waiting as if you were in a traffic jam on the M5,"" he added, referring to a British motorway. Despite the delay, Mr Reynolds expressed sympathy for the Ever Given's 25 Indian crew members. ""As sailors, we complain a lot about things. But we also understand when other sailors are in a fix or other seamen are working really hard day and night to try to correct a situation. We've all been there,"" he said. About 10 tugboats and two dredger vessels are working to refloat the Ever Given. Diggers and other machinery operating on the banks are also assisting. The Ever Given is almost as long as Manhattan's Empire State Building is high The Ever Given's technical mangers, Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement, said another attempt to refloat the vessel on Friday had failed, and that the salvage operation was now focused on removing sand and mud from around the port (left) side of the vessel's bow. A specialised suction dredger, which can shift 2,000 cubic metres (70,000 cubic feet) of material every hour, arrived on site on Thursday, it added. Arrangements are also being made for high-capacity pumps to reduce the water levels in the vessel's forward void space and the bow thruster room. Another two tugs will arrive by Sunday, when a higher tide is expected. Dredging vessels are working around the clock to help refloat the Ever Given John Denholm, president of the UK Chamber of Shipping, told the BBC that if the diggers and tugs were not successful, salvage teams would have to start the slow process of ""lightering"" the ship - transferring its cargo to another vessel or the canal bank. That would involve bringing in specialist equipment, including a crane that would need to stretch more than 60m (200ft) high, he said. ""If we go through the lightering process, I suspect we're talking weeks."" Mr Reynolds said the Maersk Ohio, which started its voyage in the Gulf and was headed to northern Europe via the Mediterranean, still had a ""little wriggle-room"" in its schedule. ""If it goes more than five days, then we start to see our schedule back up. I'm sure other ships are on a much tighter schedule than we were... It's going to affect shipping schedules all around the world."" Service provider Leth Agencies said a total of 237 vessels were waiting in the area on Friday - 107 at Port Suez in the Red Sea, 41 at the canal's midway point in the Great Bitter Lake, and 89 at Port Said in the Mediterranean. Almost 19,000 ships passed through the Suez Canal last year The blockage is holding up an estimated $9.6bn (Â£7bn) of goods each day - or $400m an hour - according to data from Lloyd's List. The shipping journal said two major companies, Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, were looking into whether to re-route their vessels. The first container ship to opt for the longer journey around the Cape of Good Hope was the Ever Given's sister ship, the Ever Greet, both of which are operated by the Taiwanese firm Evergreen Marine, it added. Richard Meade, the editor of Lloyd's List, told the BBC that the risk of piracy to vessels off the coast of Africa had been overblown to some extent. ""Obviously, we did see a major piracy surge a few years ago off the Somali coast. That has largely been brought under control,"" he told the BBC. ""The Gulf of Guinea is the hotspot. But I think realistically you would see ships move well outside the Gulf of Guinea as the route."" Did you witness the incident? Are you on board another vessel on the Suez Canal?

Ex-PM Cameron cleared by lobbying watchdog,"Former Prime Minister David Cameron has been cleared by a watchdog looking at whether he engaged in lobbying for which he should have been registered. The Registrar of Consultant Lobbyists investigated after reports he had contacted officials on behalf of financial firm Greensill Capital. It concluded that Mr Cameron's activities had not fallen within the criteria that required registration. The contact is said to have taken place after Mr Cameron was prime minister. On Wednesday, a source close to him said he was exempt from the register as he had been an in-house employee for Greensill. The company, which collapsed earlier this month, was a key backer of UK giant Liberty Steel. Ex-PM Cameron to be investigated by lobbying body Government on steel rescue standby again Labour seeks probe over Cameron Greensill lobbying Last week, Labour called for an investigation into claims Mr Cameron had met Treasury officials to lobby on behalf of Greensill, a role he took up after leaving the job of prime minister. The Financial Times,externalreported that Mr Cameron had tried to increase the specialist bank's access to government-backed Covid-19 emergency loan schemes. The Treasury said it had had a meeting but decided not to take things further. The office which runs the lobbying register was set up following theTransparency of Lobbying, Non-Party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Act 2014,external, when Mr Cameron was prime minister.

Liberty Steel boss asks government for Â£170m bailoutConcerns over Liberty Steel's future have grown after its key backer Greensill Capital went bust.Business,"The owner of Liberty Steel has asked the government for Â£170m in financial support. In a letter sent to the Department of Business last night, Sanjeev Gupta said the support was required to pay day-to-day operating expenses and absorb recent losses. Concerns over the future of Liberty Steel have grown after key financial backer, Greensill Capital, went bust. Liberty Steel employs about 5,000 people in the UK. ""The collapse of Greensill has put financial pressure on the GFG Alliance and our British steel operations,"" Mr Gupta writes in the letter. ""We are still refining the details with my management team and our external advisors, but preliminary indications are that the steel manufacturing and processing operations would need in the range of Â£170m to fund working capital and some additional capital to fund operating losses in the short term, which we are in the process of finalising."" Sanjeev Gupta's GFG Alliance employs a total of 5,000 people in the UK - 3,000 of them in steel and aluminium businesses across 12 UK sites. There have been grave concerns for the future of Liberty Steel since its main financial backer Greensill Capital went bust in early March. 'If the steelworks shuts it will destroy Rotherham' Liberty Steel: Government looking at 'all options' Liberty Steel asks customers to pay up front Government sources told the BBC they have not yet responded and have concerns about the ""opaque"" nature of Mr Gupta's empire. GFG employs 35,000 worldwide and given its international footprint the government would certainly need assurances any support would not find its way abroad. Mr Gupta said he envisaged the support ""could be structured in a way that works to ensure value for money and appropriate protections for the taxpayer"". Government sources also indicated that it was unlikely government support would be offered to the company with its current structure and management - with any assistance likely to come after an administration process. A spokeswoman for the government said: ""The government is closely monitoring developments around Liberty Steel and continues to engage closely with the company, the broader UK steel industry and trade unions."" Both the Business Secretary and the Prime Minister have pledged in recent days to look at all options to ensure the business survives.

Asda workers win key appeal in equal pay fightSupreme Court rules shop workers are free to pursue fight to gain equal pay with warehouse staff.Business,"Thousands of Asda supermarket workers have won a major victory at the Supreme Court in their battle for equal pay. The court upheld an earlier court ruling that lower-paid shop staff, who are mostly women, can compare themselves with higher paid warehouse workers, who are mostly men. The judge stressed the ruling did not mean the 44,000 claimants had won the right to equal pay. However, they are now free to take further action. Lauren Lougheed, a Leigh Day lawyer representing Asda store staff, said: ""We are delighted that our clients have cleared such a big hurdle in their fight for equal pay. ""Already an employment tribunal, the employment appeal tribunal and the Court of Appeal ruled that these roles can be compared, and now the Supreme Court has come to the same conclusion. ""It's our hope that Asda will now stop dragging its heels and pay their staff what they are worth."" The GMB union has members involved in the case. Its legal director, Susan Harris, said: ""Asda has wasted money on lawyers' bills chasing a lost cause, losing appeal after appeal, while tens of thousands of retail workers remain out of pocket. ""We now call on Asda to sit down with us to reach agreement on the back pay owed to our members - which could run to hundreds of millions of pounds."" Wendy Arundale, who worked for Asda for 32 years, said: ""I loved my job, but knowing that male colleagues working in distribution centres were being paid more left a bitter taste in my mouth. ""It's not much to ask to be paid an equal wage for work of equal value."" But an Asda spokesman said there was a long way to go before the issues were finally settled: ""This ruling relates to one stage of a complex case that is likely to take several years to reach a conclusion. ""We are defending these claims because the pay in our stores and distribution centres is the same for colleagues doing the same jobs regardless of their gender. Retail and distribution are very different sectors with their own distinct skill sets and pay rates."" It said it remained confident in its case. Lawyers say the ruling will have implications for supermarkets and other retailers. ""It would be difficult to underestimate the significance of this judgment which will send shockwaves far beyond Asda,"" said Anne Pritam, partner and employment lawyer at Stephenson Harwood. ""It is a watershed moment for the rest of the retail industry, particularly those defending their own equal pay claims - such as Sainsbury's, Tesco, Morrisons and Next - and which have similar staffing models and pay structures."" ""Ultimately, if all of the retailers lose their equal pay claims, it is estimated they could face Â£8bn in compensation payments to employees."" Co-op faces equal pay claims from shop workers Covid has 'devastating' impact on gender equality Asda store workers argued they were paid less because most store workers are women, while most distribution depot staff are men. Lawyers representing the store workers say depot workers were paid between Â£1.50-3.00 an hour more. Asda said it had always paid the correct rate for the job, whether male or female, and pointed out that both men and women worked in both supermarkets and the warehouses. Asda store workers may have won this battle in their long running equal pay claim - but the war is far from over. The Supreme Court has ruled that for the purposes of equal pay the work of the mainly male distribution workers can be compared to the mainly female shop floor workers. But next they need to prove their work is of equal value - in terms of skills and training. And finally that gender is the key reason that their pay is different. The stakes here are high. Supermarkets could find themselves on the hook for more than Â£8bn in back pay. And it could reverberate around other businesses too - where a majority of women carry out a certain role. In 2016, an employment tribunal decided that Asda store workers were entitled to compare themselves to distribution staff and that decision was upheld by Court of Appeal judges in 2019. Asda bosses then appealed to the Supreme Court. Lawyers say litigation could run on for years. There are three stages in equal pay action: Are the jobs comparable? If the jobs are comparable, are they of equal value? If they are of equal value, is there a reason why the roles should not be paid equally? Following the Supreme Court ruling, lawyers say the next stage would involve an employment tribunal deciding whether specific store and distribution jobs were of ""equal value"". If judges decided that different jobs were of ""equal value"", the litigation would then enter a third stage. Under this, a tribunal would then consider whether there were reasons - other than gender - why people working in stores should not get the same pay rates as people working in distribution centres.

Western brands vanish as Xinjiang backlash grows,"H&M is one of several global brands targeted China is targeting more Western clothes retailers as international backlash grows over claims of abuses in the cotton-growing Xinjiang region. Several major brands have expressed concern over allegations that members of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority group are being used as forced labour. Some companies' online shops are blocked and their stores have vanished from some digital maps. It comes afterseveral Western countries imposed sanctions on China. China initially targeted H&M and Nikebut that has widened to include Burberry, Adidas and Converse, among others. While H&M's physical stores in China remain, it is no longer possible to hail a taxi to the shops using an app and consumers can't shop online. Instead China is championing local brands. China is accused of committing serious human rights violations against Uighurs in Xinjiang. It is alleged that Uighur people are forced to pick cotton that supplies the global market Beijing denies this, and has hit back with retaliatory sanctions on European lawmakers, scholars and institutions - withthe latest imposed on UK entities and individuals on Friday. In December the BBC published an investigation based on new research showingChina was forcing hundreds of thousands of minorities including Uighurs into manual labour in Xinjiang's cotton fields. China has now got other brands in its crosshairs - but will this campaign actually work? In just 24 hours H&M has been all but erased from China's digital world; you can't buy its tops and dresses on the biggest online retail platforms, you can't get a taxi to take you to one of its shops on the biggest ride hailing app. The physical stores are still there and open - almost all of them - but in the sphere where China's ruling Communist Party can coordinate most quickly, H&M has disappeared. Only sales figures and decisions from the firm's Sweden HQ will accurately reveal the impact this campaign is having. But previous efforts, targeting South Korea's Lotte chain in particular, show how effective it can be. Lotte stores are no more here after it got caught up in a diplomatic row between Beijing and Seoul. The challenge for foreign brands has always been about how to sell your stuff to China's 1.4 billion at the same time as satisfying your global customers' growing demands to get your ethics right. That's become even more salient in the era of Xinjiang abuses. Some see it as simply Sales vs Ethics; they choose which side to come down on. Others try to find a way to achieve both. The Xinjiang cotton campaign began on Wednesday when Chinese state media outlets and netizens singled out H&M over a statement made last year, and soon expanded to include many other brands. A H&M outlet in Urumqi, Xinjiang was shuttered on Thursday with its store signs covered up They have now called for boycotts of brands associated with the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) - a non-profit group that promotes sustainable cotton production - whose members include Nike, Adidas, New Balance, Burberry, Puma, and Tommy Hilfiger. BCI said in October it had suspended activities in Xinjiang as well as licensing of the region's cotton, citing allegations and ""increasing risks"" of forced labour,according to the cached version of a statement that is no longer accessible on the BCI website,external. ""If you boycott Xinjiang cotton, we'll boycott you,"" one person commented on Weibo. Inside China's scheme to transfer Uighurs into work 'Their goal is to destroy everyone' China's hidden camps Where are my children? Top celebrities in China, including singer Eason Chan and movie stars Zhang Yixing and Bai Jingting, have since said they would sever ties with some of these brands. Chinese tech giant Tencent also halted its partnership with the British luxury brand Burberry, which had designed outfits forHonor Of Kings, one of China's biggest video games. Top Chinese sportswear brand Li Ning is one of several being championed Meanwhile, state media have highlighted a number of Chinese brands including Li Ning, Anta, Peak, and Meters/bonwe, with trending hashtags on Weibo praising the companies for specifically using Xinjiang cotton - Li Ning for instance lists this on its clothing tags. Anta, the world's third biggest sportswear company, said on Weibo it was a member of BCI, but was pulling out of the initiative. ""We have always bought and used cotton produced in China, including Xinjiang cotton, and in the future we will continue to do so,"" it said. Japanese sportswear label Asics also pledged support for Xinjiang cotton, while Japanese retailer Muji - which at one point had marketed a ""Xinjiang cotton"" line of products-told the Global Times it was still selling such items in China.,external. Xinjiang, China's biggest region, produces about a fifth of the world's cotton. An autonomous region in theory, in reality it faces restrictions which have only increased in recent years Millions of China's Uighurs, a Muslim minority that sees itself as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations, live in Xinjiang In recent decades, mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) to Xinjiang has fuelled tensions with Uighurs which has at points flared into deadly violence This has resulted in a massive security crackdown and an extensive state surveillance programme, which critics say violate Uighur human rights. China says such measures are necessary to combat separatism and terrorism Uighurs have been detained at camps whereallegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged.China has denied these claims saying the camps are ""re-education"" facilities aimed at lifting Uighurs out of poverty Read more:Who are the Uighurs?

Asda workers win key appeal in equal pay fight,"Thousands of Asda supermarket workers have won a major victory at the Supreme Court in their battle for equal pay. The court upheld an earlier court ruling that lower-paid shop staff, who are mostly women, can compare themselves with higher paid warehouse workers, who are mostly men. The judge stressed the ruling did not mean the 44,000 claimants had won the right to equal pay. However, they are now free to take further action. Lauren Lougheed, a Leigh Day lawyer representing Asda store staff, said: ""We are delighted that our clients have cleared such a big hurdle in their fight for equal pay. ""Already an employment tribunal, the employment appeal tribunal and the Court of Appeal ruled that these roles can be compared, and now the Supreme Court has come to the same conclusion. ""It's our hope that Asda will now stop dragging its heels and pay their staff what they are worth."" The GMB union has members involved in the case. Its legal director, Susan Harris, said: ""Asda has wasted money on lawyers' bills chasing a lost cause, losing appeal after appeal, while tens of thousands of retail workers remain out of pocket. ""We now call on Asda to sit down with us to reach agreement on the back pay owed to our members - which could run to hundreds of millions of pounds."" Wendy Arundale, who worked for Asda for 32 years, said: ""I loved my job, but knowing that male colleagues working in distribution centres were being paid more left a bitter taste in my mouth. ""It's not much to ask to be paid an equal wage for work of equal value."" But an Asda spokesman said there was a long way to go before the issues were finally settled: ""This ruling relates to one stage of a complex case that is likely to take several years to reach a conclusion. ""We are defending these claims because the pay in our stores and distribution centres is the same for colleagues doing the same jobs regardless of their gender. Retail and distribution are very different sectors with their own distinct skill sets and pay rates."" It said it remained confident in its case. Lawyers say the ruling will have implications for supermarkets and other retailers. ""It would be difficult to underestimate the significance of this judgment which will send shockwaves far beyond Asda,"" said Anne Pritam, partner and employment lawyer at Stephenson Harwood. ""It is a watershed moment for the rest of the retail industry, particularly those defending their own equal pay claims - such as Sainsbury's, Tesco, Morrisons and Next - and which have similar staffing models and pay structures."" ""Ultimately, if all of the retailers lose their equal pay claims, it is estimated they could face Â£8bn in compensation payments to employees.""

'Stay-local' rule in Wales to end from SaturdayWales will be the first UK nation to scrap travel restrictions since lockdowns were re-imposed.Wales politics,"Resorts like Llandudno will be able to welcome visitors, but only from other parts of Wales ""Stay-local"" rules will lift in Wales from Saturday and unrestricted travel within its borders will be allowed. It means Wales will be the first UK nation toscrap travel restrictions,externalwithin country boundaries since lockdowns were re-imposed in winter. Self-contained tourist accommodation - including many hotels and cottages - will also be able to open on Saturday. But non-essential travel to and from other UK nations will be banned for at least two weeks. The move by the Welsh government will also see six people from two households able to meet up outside, an increase from the current four-person limit. Organised outdoor activities and sports for under-18s can resume, and libraries and archives will be able to reopen their doors. Rules will also allow a limited opening of outdoor areas of some historical places and gardens. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the ""public health position remains stable"" and there was ""headroom"" to make changes. Responding to criticism that England has a roadmap further into the future, he said: ""There's no guarantee those dates will turn out to mean anything in reality, that's why I'm reluctant to provide what I think of as a spurious certainty about what can happen that far into the future. ""We will do things where we can be definite... we will try to be as definite as we can. I want to give sectors sufficient warning, but I don't want to be suggesting that we can see the future that far ahead sufficiently precisely."" Deio, Gwenlli and Osian are looking forward to seeing their grandparents The relaxation of rules on who and how many people you can meet outdoors means Deio, Gwenlli and Osian will be able to meet their grandparents - at a safe distance - for the first time since Christmas Day. The children live near Llanbrynmair, Powys, while their grandparents live about 40 miles (64km) away in Llangwyryfon, Ceredigion. ""It's been very, very difficult not seeing them,"" said Osian, 15. ""I'm looking forward to seeing family and friends, and hopefully getting back to playing football and things like that."" Gwenlli, 10, said it had been ""sad"" not being able to see her grandparents, but she understood it was for a good reason. ""I would love to go shopping again and do gymnastics in my gymnastics club,"" she added. Deio, 12, said it had been ""hard"" but was looking forward to going on a picnic with his grandparents. Matt Childs, the RNLI's lifesaving manager for south Wales, says sea temperatures are very cold at this time of year The ending of Wales' Covid travel restrictions coincides with the Easter school holiday and a spell of warmer weather. Welsh beaches ""were much busier last year"" as more people took holiday staycations because of coronavirus travel restrictions abroad, and lifeguards are expecting this year to also be busy. But people who may be considering heading to the beach have been warned they could get in difficulty with cold seas and many unseen strong currents. ""The sea around the Welsh coast has still not warmed up,"" said Matt Childs, the RNLI's lifesaving manager for south Wales. ""It is really cold and you're likely to get yourself into difficulty with cold water shock hitting you. The sea only needs to be 13 to 15 degrees to be in trouble and its much colder than that now."" Huw Pendleton said he expected his caravan parks to be extremely busy at the weekend Huw Pendleton, the managing director of Celtic Holiday Parks in Pembrokeshire, said he expected to be ""extremely busy"" at the weekend. He said all three of his parks were fully booked and they were expecting up to 600 people to arrive over the weekend. ""We will be very grateful to let people back into the business,"" he said. ""We hope that people will act responsibly because health comes first. But these communities are very reliant on tourism."" Kevin Burt of Llandegfedd Visitor and Watersports Centre, near Pontypool, said: ""We know that people have been desperate to get out, to enjoy the countryside, to enjoy the walks and to take it all in. ""We're really excited to welcome our customers back, but we are very conscious as well that it needs to be safe for them and for the people who work here as well."" Leighton Phillips, owner of Aeron Coast Holiday Park, says he has been receiving calls from static caravan owners Leighton Phillips, is the owner of Aeron Coast Holiday Park in Aberaeron, Ceredigion, which has 200 static caravans and space for 100 tourers. About 90% of the statics are owned by people from south Wales, many of whom have been calling Mr Phillips, asking when they can come back. The park's shared facilities - the club, children's playroom, gym and pool - have to stay closed, but Mr Phillips is expecting a busy weekend. ""I suppose from one minute past 12 they could come, but they will be coming I'm sure from eight o'clock on in the morning,"" he said. ""I think mainly they want to be able to just get out, have a stroll around and see people at a distance. ""They're so used - as we all have been - to being locked in at home and looking at the garden wall or what's outside. Now they really want to see their friends and they're a very very close community here."" Tegryn Jones, chief executive of the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park Authority, told BBC Radio Wales ""there is concern"" about an influx of visitors, and urged people to ""act responsibly"". Jim Jones says there is a ""palpable sense of frustration"" among hospitality and attraction businesses Meanwhile, the chief executive of North Wales Tourism welcomed the further easing, but said it was ""a great shame"" that many attractions and hospitality businesses will not be allowed to reopen at the same time. ""There is still a real and palpable sense of frustration in the sector, as it feels that the Welsh government haven't been listening to the mood on the ground,"" said Jim Jones. ""If they had, then we would have a plan to take us forward post April.Â ""It is very difficult to understand why they won't map this out, especially as the other three home nations have now done so."" Speaking on BBC Radio Wales'Breakfastprogramme, Mr Drakeford said people in England were expected to be able to travel from 12 April, and if those restrictions are lifted they will be able to come to Wales. In the meantime, people taking bookings are expected to ensure they are only taking them from people living in Wales. Mr Drakeford said: ""Avoid crowded places. We are such a lucky country, we've got so many fantastic places people can explore and visit. Look for those other opportunities, respect other people, keep a distance. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Tourism businesses 'ready to go' if given go-ahead Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales ""If there are people knowingly and deliberately breaking the law then action will be taken."" He added vaccine passports for entering pubs was something which ""we should be exploring"". Not at the moment. Travel in and out of Wales is not permitted unless you have areasonable excuse,externalwhich includes: To meet other people in yoursupport bubble To escape a risk of illness or injury, such as victims or people at risk of domestic abuse To provide or receive emergency services To attend a wedding, civil partnership or funeral, if you are invited To vote in an election For elite athletes to train, compete or provide coaching or similar support to an elite athlete There is also a list of reasons deemed ""reasonably necessary,external"", which include accessing education or childcare when ""there is no practicable alternative"". When the next review of the regulations takes place on Thursday, Welsh ministers will consider allowing people to travel outside of Wales from 12 April. England's travel restrictions are also expected to end on 12 April so, subject to law changes in by both governments, travel into England could be possible. The same goes for Scotland and Northern Ireland - in Scotland, travel to other parts of the UK should bepermitted from 26 April or soon afterand in Northern Ireland the stay-at-home message is expected to be relaxed from 12 April. Stay local travel rules, which had been in force for two weeks, will end on Saturday Retailers may be allowed to fully reopen, and teaching of pupils not yet back in school could restart, from 12 April. Primary schools and some secondary school children have already resumed classes. A decision on whether to permit pubs, restaurants and cafes to reopen outdoors will not be takenuntil at least 22 April. The UK government does not plan to ease stay at home restrictions in England until 29 March, but ministers will urge people to remain local as much as possible. It plans to allow trips to self-catering accommodation from 12 April. The Welsh government said the level of restrictions was ""starting"" to move from alert level four to alert level three. Maria McLean from Dylan's restaurant wants a road map out of lockdown for the industry Members of the Welsh Hospitality industry are backing an appeal for money to fund a legal challenge to the rules on the reopening of pubs and restaurants in Wales. The chairman of Cardiff Licensees forum said he was ""100%"" behind a bid to raise money for a judicial review of the Welsh government's timeline. It follows a similar challenge of the UK government's rules in England. Cerys Furlong runs The Grange pub, the Milkwood restaurant and The Lansdowne pub Nick Newman, chairman of Cardiff Licensees Forum, said he has had ""a terrific response"" to a crowdfunding proposal by Matt Connolly, the owner of a restaurant in Cardiff. Dylan's, which has restaurants in Menai Bridge, Criccieth and Llandudno, has called for a road map of of lockdown for the industry. Maria McLean from the company said: ""Hospitality is at the heart of a lot of what we do in north Wales and we run the risk of undoing all that good work we've done to promote this fabulous destination over the last 10 or so years. ""If we're not open and the destination across the border are, it makes it very difficult for us to compete on an even footing."" Cerys Furlong, who owns two pubs and a restaurant in Cardiff, called for more financial support for the sector. ""It really is urgent, funding is running out in five days for many businesses and people are really, really feeling the strain,"" she told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales. ""To fail at this last hurdle, to provide this support that is necessary, would just be catastrophic."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said: ""It's a difficult balance to strike... but I think one of the areas I don't think the Welsh government are getting it right is giving sufficient forewarning to businesses. ""Having a series of dates as far out as June is excessive... but businesses tell us the one thing they need is notice."" Calum Davies, from the Welsh Conservatives, said: ""This change is very welcome, better late than never, really, but this is the first step of what businesses need to hear especially in the tourism industry. ""We still need more clarity and detail in other areas. Jane Dodds, leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, said: ""This will come as welcome news to many who have been cut off for a long time. ""The public have a duty to follow these new rules carefully as the virus is still very much circulating amongst us. I hope this will the start of the end of our final lockdown."" Stay local rules were in place for just two weeks, replacing a stay-at-home order - in place since the start of the third national Welsh lockdown. Lockdown was imposed in Wales at the end of December after a rise in cases increased pressure on the Welsh NHS. Wales' case rate has been below 50 cases per 100,000 people - the threshold used as the guide for bringing areas into lockdown last year - for the past 21 days. At the moment it is 38.5 per 100,000 over the past seven days compared to the peak on 17 December, when it was 636 per 100,000.

Jackie Weaver: Don't stop virtual council meetingsThe council officer says more people get involved with council meetings when they take place online.UK Politics,"Jackie Weaver has joined critics of a government move to end virtual council meetings in England from May. Minister Luke Hall haswritten to local authorities,externalsaying the government is under too much pressure to fit in legislation to allow them to continue. Ms Weaver, who rose to fame aftera meeting of Handforth Parish Council went viral, said it would be ""dreadful"" to bring them to an end. The Local Government Association also called for the decision to be reversed. Chair of the organisation, Councillor James Jamieson, said reintroducing face-to-face meetings ""could easily involve up to 200 people in one room, even before adding in members of the public and reporters"" - so their return would pose a ""significant challenge"" to councils to make them Covid-secure. Lawyers in local government, along with Hertfordshire County Council, have now made an application to the courts to declare authorities already have the powers needed to hold online meetings. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it had asked councils to share their experiences of remote meetings, saying they will use the evidence ""to inform any potential future legislation regarding their use beyond the pandemic"". English councils battling financial ruin Should local council power be 'turbo-charged'? Parish council Zoom host 'surprised' by reaction Like many other organisations, local councils were forced to go online in 2020 due to the pandemic and restrictions on public meetings. Emergency legislation was passed in the Commons to give them the power to do business over video conferencing tools, but the temporary law is due to run out the day after the local elections on 6 May. In his letter, Mr Hall - the minister for regional growth and local government - praised the efforts of local authorities in England, saying they had ""risen magnificently to the challenges of this period"". But he said extending virtual meetings past May would involved primary legislation in the Commons, which would have a ""significant impact... on the government's legislative programme, which is already under severe pressure in these unprecedented times"". This video can not be played Viral moments like this Handforth Parish Council meeting could come to an end - but there are more serious reasons for concern too Mrs Weaver - the chief officer of the Cheshire Association of Local Councils - told BBC Radio Derby it would be ""dreadful"" to bring virtual meetings to an end. She added: ""I think all the evidence is out there to show that actually Zoom has done more... [and] has been instrumental in getting people involved. ""We can see it in the figures [with] people turning up. We are seeing it in the people that are showing interest in elections. ""I am not saying all council meetings should be held virtually and I know a lot of my councils are keen to get back to face-to-face meetings, but it would be so helpful, so valuable to be able to hold Zoom meetings."" Mr Jamieson agreed the move risked ""damaging the gains seen in public participation in remote council meetings during the pandemic and our vital local democratic process"". He also pointed to the imbalance when it came to the rules in Westminster. ""MPs will retain the right to participate remotely until at least 21 June, but the powers-that-be in the House of Commons will not make time available to legislate for councillors to do the same,"" he added. The County Councils Network said the government's decision was ""deeply disappointing, considering the success of remote meetings"". Its chairman, Councillor David Williams, said he had concerns over whether face-to-face council meetings could be done safely, adding: ""The decision is illogical when you bear in mind the government's own guidance stipulates that indoor events cannot be organised until 17 May at the earliest."" Asked for a response to the criticism, the ministry sent a statement from Mr Hall, who said: ""Councils continue to play a vital role in our response to the pandemic and I am grateful for how they have used emergency powers introduced a year ago to continue to operate at a difficult time. ""As the vaccine roll-out continues and restrictions are lifted, councils holding face-to-face meetings from 7 May are being given the support and guidance they need to do so in a safe and secure way."" He added: ""I am keen to hear from councils and local residents about their experiences of virtual meetings so that we can properly consider whether to make these a permanent option.""

PM 'stands firmly' with MPs after China sanctions,"Iain Duncan Smith, Nusrat Ghani and Tom Tugendhat have been banned from entering China Five UK parliamentarians sanctioned by China have released a joint statement vowing to ""redouble"" their efforts to campaign against human rights abuses. Three MPs, including ex-Tory leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, and two peers said the action by China was an attempt to stifle ""free and open debate"". The PM said he ""stands firmly"" with those targeted by China for criticising its treatment of the Uighur people. The sanctions follow similar moves by the UK, US, Canada and the EU on China. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US president Joe Biden ""expressed their concern about retaliatory action taken by China,"" during a phone call on Friday, Downing Street said. China hasimposed sanctions on nine UK citizens in total- including the five parliamentarians - who are among its most vocal critics in the UK. It said it was sanctioning the group for spreading what it called ""lies and disinformation"" about China. In response, Sir Iain, along with MPs Nusrat Ghani and Tim Loughton, and the peers Lord Alton and Baroness Kennedy, said: ""Today's sanctions have unmasked the Chinese Communist Party. ""These actions are not only an attack on us as individuals but an attempt to stifle the free and open debate that is at the heart of our parliamentary democracy."" The group added that ""intimidation"" would only encourage them to ""redouble"" their efforts, as they pledged to continue advocating on behalf of ""the Uighurs, Tibetans, Hong Kongers and all other persecuted groups in China"". ""These are the true victims of the Chinese government's authoritarian rule, not us,"" they added. In common with the government, the group also called for ""international investigations into the alleged abuses"" in Xingjian against the Uighur people. Britain's relations with China are going from bad to worse. On Monday, the UK imposed its first ever sanctions on Chinese officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang. Now Beijing has retaliated, announcing sanctions on some of its most vocal critics in Britain. It matters because the government is trying to strike a balance in its relations with Beijing. In its recent foreign policy review, the UK described China as a ""systemic competitor"" and ""the biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security"". But it also spoke of pursuing ""a positive trade and investment relationship"" and co-operating with China on climate change and biodiversity. All that just became a little harder still. On Friday afternoon, the Foreign Office (FCDO) said the minister for Asia, Nigel Adams, had summoned Yang Xiaoguang, the Chinese embassy in London's chargÃ© d'affaires, over Beijing's actions. An FCDO spokesperson said Mr Adams had made it clear that China's decision to impose sanctions on Britons and UK entities was ""unwarranted and unacceptable"". Mr Adams also noted that China's decision to target those ""seeking to shine a light on human rights violations"" would ""not distract attention away from those very violations taking place in Xinjiang"". Earlier Prime Minister Boris Johnsontweeted,externalthat the British citizens facing sanctions were ""performing a vital role"" in highlighting the treatment of Uighur Muslims, adding: ""Freedom to speak out in opposition to abuse is fundamental and I stand firmly with them."" Western states sanction China for Uighur 'abuses' Who are the Uighurs? Uighur camp detainees allege systematic rape Nike, H&M face China fury over Xinjiang cotton More than a million Uighurs and other minorities are estimated to have been detained at camps in the north-west region of Xinjiang, where allegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged. Uighurs living in the region speak their own language, similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. The Chinese government has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on Uighur women and separating children from their families. It has denied the allegations of abuse and claimed the camps are ""re-education"" facilities used to combat terrorism. Sanctions were imposed on Chinese officials on Monday, as part of a co-ordinated action by the European Union and the UK, the US and Canada. After UK sanctions were announced on Monday, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the abuse of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang ""one of the worst human rights crises of our time"". Mr Raab also said that if Beijing wanted to ""credibly rebut"" the claims, it should allow the United Nation's commissioner for human rights to access Xinjiang. The nine Britons now facing sanctions from China are:,external Tory MPs Sir Iain, Nusrat Ghani and Tim Loughton, and peers Baroness Kennedy and Lord Alton, who are all members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China Tory MPs Tom Tugendhat and Neil O'Brien, who lead the China Research Group Lawyer Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, chair of the Uighur Tribunal, which is investigating atrocities against the minority group Newcastle University academic Jo Smith Finley, whose research focuses on the Uighurs They will all be banned from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau, their property in China will be frozen and Chinese citizens and institutions will be prohibited from doing business with them. Ms Ghani said the move had made her ""even even more determined"" to speak out about the Uighurs, while Sir Iain argued that those who lived free lives ""must speak for those who have no voice"". Mr Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, told the BBC: ""I view this as a direct assault on British democracy and an attempt to silence the British people who have chosen me to speak for them."" He added that the government had been too soft on China, which he said had been ""constantly and continuously seeking to intervene"" in the internal matters of the UK. Academic Dr Smith Finleytweeted:,external""I have no regrets for speaking out, and I will not be silenced."" China has created a sprawling network of detention camps for minorities in the Xinjiang region Four groups have also been sanctioned - the China Research Group, the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, the Uighur Tribunal, and Essex Court Chambers. A legal opinion by senior barristers at Essex Court Chambers had concluded there was a ""very credible case"" that the Chinese government was committing genocide against the Uighurs. Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the sanctions were a ""direct attempt to silence those who criticise the actions of the Chinese government"". A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the UK's decision to impose sanctions ""flagrantly breaches international law and basic norms governing international relations, grossly interferes in China's internal affairs, and severely undermines China-UK relations"". He added that the Chinese foreign ministry had summoned the British Ambassador to China to ""lodge solemn representations, expressing firm opposition and strong condemnation"". Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese foreign ministry, later told a press briefing China was forced to act ""in self-defence"" in response to UK sanctions ""based on lies"".

"Ex-firearms chief 'singled out' trade unionistA staff member's integrity was questioned because of his union activities, a tribunal has ruled.Northern Ireland","Nichola Murphy is a former PSNI head of firearms and explosives The PSNI's former head of firearms and explosives singled out a member of staff because of his trade union activities, a tribunal has ruled. It awarded claimant Gavin Walsh Â£3,000 for injury to feelings after finding Nichola Murphy had made ""unfounded allegations"" about his integrity. ""We believe Ms Murphy was motivated by a desire to undermine the claimant in his Nipsa role,"" said panel members. ""He had been a thorn in her side for some months."" The tribunal panel heard the relationship between Ms Murphy and Mr Walsh became fractious and confrontational as a result of unrest and discontent within the PSNI's firearms branch. Mr Walsh had tried to resolve the issues, but this was not to the liking of senior PSNI management, including Nichola Murphy, the tribunal panel was told. The situation escalated when the claimant - who had worked for the police for more than 30 years - made an application to have his firearms certificate conditions varied. Ms Murphy mistakenly alleged he had jumped the applications' queue by using his Nipsa union role within the firearms branch to obtain preferential treatment for his application, said the tribunal. It said the allegations in an email she sent to Mr Walsh's Nipsa colleague were ""damaging and defamatory"". However, when Ms Murphy later discovered he had not sought to jump the queue, she failed to tell his Nipsa colleague. This showed ""Ms Murphy had no regard for the damage she could have caused to the claimant's reputation"", said the panel. It also questioned why another person within the firearms branch had specifically picked out Mr Walsh's application from thousands of others, and brought it to Ms Murphy's attention. The tribunal members said it was not credible that Ms Murphy could not remember which staff member had made her aware of the application form. ""As the respondent accepted, there were thousands of applications in the process and it seems more than unfortunate that the claimant's claim form was the one singled out for scrutiny in this way,"" said the panel. They described Ms Murphy's actions as ""completely inappropriate"". ""We believe that this action was only taken because the claimant is a trade union representative and its sole or main purpose was to penalise the claimant for being such a representative,"" they said. After a direct request from Ms Murphy to Nipsa, a union colleague took on Mr Walsh's trade union duties in the firearms branch, leaving him with less involvement there. ""We believe that Ms Murphy was motivated by a desire to undermine the claimant in his Nipsa role,"" said the panel members. ""He had been a thorn in her side for some months and this was an opportunity to discredit him in his role.""

before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Restrictions are continuing to ease across the UK. In Wales, a ""stay-local"" rule ends tomorrow, with some overnight accommodation reopening, allowing people to travel within the country. Meanwhile, outdoor gatherings of up to six people, or two households, in England will be allowed from Monday - including in private gardens. People will no longer be required to stay at home wherever possible, although everyone will be encouraged to stay local. Find out the rules in your areahere. BBC World Service France's foreign minister has accused Russia of using its Sputnik coronavirus vaccine as an instrument of aggressive diplomacy. Jean-Yves Le Drian contrasted the fanfare around a recent Russian delivery of a consignment of Sputnik V to Tunisia with that given to the much larger delivery through the UN-backed global Covax initiative. He made a similar contrast with a delivery of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine in Senegal with Covax consignments. Russia had announced ""with a lot of media attention"" that it would deliver 30,000 vaccine doses to Tunisia, the minister is quoted as  telling French radio by the AFP news agency. By then, the UN-backed initiative had already delivered 100,000 doses to the north African country, AFP adds, quoting the minister. The manufacturers of Sputnik V have not yet applied for market authorisation for the vaccine in the European Union, although EU regulators have begun a rolling review of test data. Yes, so do we. Well, we've got some good news (some are coming back this summer!) - and some bad news (others aren't just yet...) We heard earlier that TRNSMT festival in Glasgowhas been movedfrom its traditional July slot to September. Want to know which other festivals are still going ahead?We've compiled a handy list for you, but here's what's going on with some of the big ones: Boris Johnson spoke to US President Joe Biden this afternoon, discussing the fight against coronavirus and the UK and US Covid-19 vaccine rolllouts. Downing Street said the prime minister had ""stressed that global access to vaccines will be key to defeating the pandemic"". âThe prime minister and president agreed that combatting climate change will be a crucial component of building back better from the pandemic,"" said a Number 10 spokesperson. The two also talked about shared international challenges, including their shared commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland. Facebook, Twitter and Google have been urged by a US lawmaker to ban a dozen people who it is claimed are spreading the vast majority of disinformation about Covid vaccinations. Representative Mike Doyle made the call to remove their accounts during a US congressional session on how the three firms were dealing with fake news. He challenged Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Google's Sundar Pinchai to deplatform the dozen people in question immediately. None have responded to the call so far. Facebook said it was looking into the matter to see if the accounts violated its community standards. Twitter and Google have not responded to the BBC on the specific request to remove the accounts.

A further 6,187 confirmed cases across the UK were announced today. That compares with 4,802 a week ago. A further 70 deaths across the UK within 28 days of a positive test were also reported earlier - compared with 101 last Friday. Meanwhile, the vaccine rollout is continuing, with around half of all UK adults having now received a first dose. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent We heard earlier today that hauliers travelling from continental Europe have been told that theywill be required to take a Covid test. We're now hearing more - an industry source has said they have been told that the measures are expected to start on 6 April onwards. All lorry and van drivers are required to take the test if they stay in the UK for more than 48 hours. They will need to get tested within 48 hours of arriving and will also be required to complete a passenger locator form so that they can be contacted while in the UK. The tests will be free and available at the existing government haulier sites previously set up to test drivers travelling out of the UK to certain European countries that require them, such as Denmark or Germany. Those who donât comply have been warned they can expect to be fined Â£2,000.
If drivers stay for longer, a second test is required within five days of arrival. If drivers stay longer than five days, they are required to take a third test within eight days of arrival. Drivers arriving from the EU to make deliveries should only leave their cabs for essential purposes, which include eating and using washing facilities. The Department for Transport has previously said it was carefully monitoring the increase in cases in Europe and would keep all measures under review. The head of the World Head Organization (WHO) has urged countries to donate 10 million vaccine doses ""immediately"" to help meet vaccination targets for poorer countries. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the international Covax vaccine-sharing programme needed the doses as a stop-gap measure. ""Covax is ready to deliver, but we can't deliver vaccines we
don't have. Bilateral deals, export bans and vaccine
nationalism have caused distortions in the market with gross
inequities in supply and demand,"" he told a news conference. ""There are plenty of countries who can afford to donate doses with little disruption to their own Covid-19 vaccination plans. 

The more countries that donate ASAP, the more doses we will have to share with countries who need them desperately,"" he added. Read more about Covax here British High Street photographic equipment chainJessops has filed a notice to appoint administratorsafter being severely impacted by the pandemic. The camera retailer, which employs 120 staff and has 17 stores, is owned by Dragons' Den star Peter Jones. Jessops said it had hired advisers FRP to help it restructure the business. The notice of intent provides the business with protection for 10 days from existing or pending creditor claims. The retailer said it planned to continue to trade when lockdown restrictions lift in April. It is considering a rescue deal in the form of a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Lockdown is, step-by-step, beginning to ease across the UK.But with infection rates rising in Europe, the British public is also being warned of the risk of a third wave. While the outbreaks in Europe have been portrayed as the threat, we should not forget the virus is still lurking here. Infection rates have dropped dramatically since the turn of the year - there has been a 12-fold fall in daily cases being reported. But that still leaves more than enough infection circulating that could easily take off. The Office for National Statistics estimates that, along with asymptomatic cases, there could be more than 100,000 infectious people out there. Already there are signs of a slight increase in cases among children following the return to schools in England. Read more here. British holidaymakers are beingwarned ""not to put the summer at risk""by travelling to the South West of England before lockdown restrictions ease. Under the UK government's roadmap, 12 April is the earliest date attractions and some self-contained accommodation is allowed to open. Devon County Council said it would give tourists a warm welcome ""when the guidelines allow, but not before"", warning visitors it is ""illegal"" and ""dangerous"" to travel down any earlier. ""After all our hard work to keep Covid-19 cases in Devon so low, we do not want to risk things now,"" said Keri Denton, Devon County Council's head of economy, skills and enterprise. Coping with cancer is difficult enough - and, for these young people, the pandemic has made their road to recovery even more challenging. Hospital treatments have been affected due to Covid restrictions. Many people had to attend appointments and treatment sessions alone. Mia Mackin, 24, and Lauren Lester, 25, spoke to BBC News NI about the added loneliness and fear that coronavirus brought to their journey with cancer. This video can not be played This video can not be played We told you earlier about somecountries' plans for vaccine passports. It is a way of opening up society once a large number of people get the jab, as well as enabling foreign travel further down the line. Estonia's Kalle Killar, who is undersecretary for e-health and Innovation at the country's ministry of social affairs, tells the BBC's Newsday programme about their own plans - their version of the digital vaccination certificate will come in the form of a QR code. ""In Estonia, we are very keen on providing all our citizens with digital services, and vaccine certificates is one of them. What we are able to do is that people can save this QR code to their phone or read it out or show it online. ""We are trying to do the best in order to provide our citizens with the best possible digital information, no matter where it will be used - whether at border crossings or some other usage that is still open."" It's been a family favourite for a century but Blackpool tourism bosses fear the Lancashire seaside resort may take five years to recover from Covid. The resort's head of tourism, Philip Welsh, said private sector partners had ""taken a hit"" during the pandemic. He told a meeting that Blackpool was preparing for an ""influx of visitors"" this year as restrictions lift. However, the council warned it would be tougher to sustain tourism past the summer months and as holidays abroad take off once more. Read morehere. And we've now heard from the WHO about the timing or the release of the report into the origins of the virus. The head of the team that went to Wuhan has said its content has now been finalised and he expects the report to be completed and released in the next few days, Reuters news agency reports. The head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, Mike Ryan, says the report will first be shared with member states for discussion and then released publicly. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst WHO members have been investigating the origins of Covid-19 in Wuhan A Chinese official has outlined the ""major findings"" of the China-WHO joint team investigation into the origins of Covid-19 in the city of Wuhan carried out earlier this
year, the national Global Times newspaper has reported. Feng Zijian, the deputy
director general of Chinaâs Centre for Disease Control and Prevention - and member of the joint team - spoke earlier today ahead of a briefing on the long-awaited
report, arranged by Chinaâs foreign ministry. Diplomats from
some 50 countries attended the press conference, Global Times said. Feng said the source-tracing work had been finalised with the consensus
that more work needed to be done on identifying the potential natural host of
the virus. According to the newspaper, he said ""experts found a highly
similar virus to Covid-19 in bats and pangolins in terms of virus sequencing"" but that those assessed were ""proven not to be a direct ancestor"". It was his view that ""more animal species, including mink and cats [were]
worthy of inquiry"" as potential natural hosts. ""We need to not only focus on bats while ignoring other
possibilities, as many other species are also vulnerable to the virus,"" he said. Feng said China had done much work on collecting bat samples but there was a ""lack of relevant work in research and sampling in neighbouring countries of
China and other countries across the world"", and suggested wider study
overseas, reported the Global Times. China has long refuted suggestions that Covid-19 might have maliciously entered into the world
from Wuhan, and has criticised references to the virus as the ""China virus"" or the ""Wuhan virus"". Members of the WHO team have previously
commented on the unlikelihood of the virus leaking from a Wuhan lab. State media have repeatedly
commented that other countries need to show the same willingness as China in
letting scientists investigate whether the virus might have originated elsewhere. Allowing shops in England to stay open until 22:00 six days a week will help people return to high streets safely, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said. Announcing changes to licencing, he said longer opening would give people greater flexibility to avoid peak times and ease transport pressures when non-essential shops open on 12 April at the earliest. The government is also extending flexible working hours on construction sites, allowing food deliveries to supermarkets over more time periods, and keeping the flexibility for pubs and restaurants to put up marquees to help increase seating capacity. Mr Jenrick said the move would help with ""protecting jobs, reducing pressure on public transport and supporting people and communities to continue to visit their high streets safely and shop locally"". French Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran receives a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine The EU has been criticised for the pace of its vaccination programme - only 14% of its population have received the jab, compared with 47% in the UK. In June 2020, all 27 member states joined up to a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines. However, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca, whichcaused supply problems,external. It also signed deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which ran into early problems with production and distribution. But the EU is concerned that the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom are based within the EU. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

China bans UK MPs after Uighur abuse sanctions,"Iain Duncan Smith, Nusrat Ghani and Tom Tugendhat have been banned from entering China China has imposed sanctions on nine UK citizens - including five MPs - for spreading what it called ""lies and disinformation"" about the country. The group are among the most vocal critics of China in the UK. It comes in retaliation for measures taken by the UK government on Monday over human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslim minority group. Boris Johnson said those sanctioned were ""shining a light"" on ""gross human rights violations"". ""Freedom to speak out in opposition to abuse is fundamental and I stand firmly with them,"" the prime ministersaid in a tweet,external. The foreign secretary said if Beijing wanted to ""credibly rebut"" the claims it should allow UN access to Xinjiang. Those targeted by China include former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, two peers, a lawyer and an academic. Sir Iain said he would wear the sanctions ""as a badge of honour"". The response by China follows similar sanctions imposed on the European Union, which was part of the co-ordinated action on Monday, along with the UK, the US and Canada.

'I'd still be homeless if not for the pandemic',"Martin used to sleep rough under a bridge, but now is in privately-rented accommodation A scheme to bring all rough sleepers indoors at the start of the pandemic has seen a large disparity in the outcomes of those supported across England, new data has revealed. In some areas over 80% of those helped are in longer-term accommodation. In others it is less than 15%. The charity Crisis said the government must provide a clear national strategy. Rough sleeping minister Eddie Hughes said many councils were ""doing an exceptional job"". He said local authorities were best placed to allocate funding in their area, and that the UK government had provided Â£4.6bn of support to be spent by them. Martin, from Shrewsbury, was one of those helped by Everyone In. He slept rough in a concrete alcove under a bridge next to the River Severn for a year prior to the pandemic. ""I used to have a bit of carpet underneath me, and a sleeping bag and a pillow basically. And that's it,"" he said. ""I never felt so down in my whole life."" He said he had asked his local council for support when he first became homeless, and was told he did not qualify as he was not considered a priority need. Martin said when he asked for support before the pandemic, he was told he was not eligible Then on 26 March 2020, the government announced all rough sleepers in England should be brought indoors regardless of their situation. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland had similar schemes. Over the course of a few days, thousands of vulnerable people were placed in emergency housing. Martin was given a hotel room - and has since been helped into privately rented accommodation. He admits to being ""a bit emotional"" when he first found out he would be living in his new home. ""It's just opened doors for me. I'm now able to work again,"" he said. The stability had also enabled him to become closer to his family and given him a sense of purpose again, he added. He said he believed he would still be homeless if it was not for the pandemic. The scheme has so far helped around 37,000 people. But figures obtained by the BBC through the Freedom of Information Act, from 174 councils that responded, have shown a disparity in the levels of long-term support provided by different local authorities. Among the top 20 best-performing councils, on average 82.5% of those helped by the scheme have been moved into supported or settled accommodation. This includes social housing, privately rented homes, longer-term placements in hostels and refuges, and self-contained accommodation with support worker visits. But in the worst-performing councils, an average of just 13% have had that same outcome. Jasmine Basran, policy manager at Crisis, said the government's decision to end its emergency funding for the scheme in May created a ""lack of clarity"" for councils. She said it meant there was no longer the nationwide approach that had proved so successful at the start of the pandemic. This led to vulnerable people's housing needs being affected by their local authority's financial situation and individual decision-making as to who remained eligible for support, she added, alongside the availability of social housing. Crisis said the government must ensure England moved away from ""a postcode lottery approach"". It has written an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, alongside charities The Trussell Trust and Joseph Rowntree Foundation, calling for a long-term strategy to tackle poverty and destitution. Jasmine Basran from Crisis said the government must lead the way with a clear, national strategy According to the latest government figures, of the 37,000 helped by the Everyone In scheme in England, 11,263 are currently in emergency housing. Paul, in Oxford, has been in emergency accommodation since the start of the pandemic. He said being housed had been a ""blessing"", enabling him to get better support for his medical conditions and ease his mental health problems. ""The depression began to fall away,"" he said. But he now fears that support will run out. Paul said he was worried about what would happen to him if his emergency accommodation ended Originally from Zimbabwe, he has lived in the UK for 21 years. But as he has an immigration status, there is no duty for the council to help him long-term. ""The uncertainty of not knowing what the future holds means the anxiety is starting to creep back into life,"" he said. ""[If the scheme ends] it's back to square one, isn't it?"" Minister Eddie Hughes said councils had always had to make ""difficult decisions"", but the government had been working to help ensure those with an immigration status could access support where eligible. He said its Rough Sleeper Accommodation Programme would be providing 3,000 new homes this year, and 6,000 in total. The Welsh government has said it plans to ensure all those placed in emergency accommodation during the pandemic are helped into permanent housing. Scotland has said it is ""transforming temporary accommodation by transitioning to rapid rehousing [of homeless individuals] by default"".

Who are the Uighurs?,"The Uyghurs are the largest minority ethnic group in China's north-western province of Xinjiang China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Human rights groups believe China has detained more than one million Uyghurs against their will over the past few years in a large network of what the state calls ""re-education camps"", and sentenced hundreds of thousands to prison terms. A series of police files obtained by the BBC in 2022 has revealed details of China's use of these camps and described the routine use of armed officers and the existence of a shoot-to-kill policy for those trying to escape. The US is among several countries to have previously accused China of committing genocide in Xinjiang. The leading human rights groups Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have published reports accusing China of crimes against humanity. China denies all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The Chinese government - speaking after details of the Xinjiang Police Files were published - said the peace and prosperity brought to Xinjiang as a result of its anti-terrorism measures were the best response to ""all sorts of lies"". Satellite images show rapid construction of camps in Xinjiang, like this one near Dabancheng There are about 12 million Uyghurs, mostly Muslim, living in Xinjiang, which is officially known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). The Uyghurs speak their own language, which is similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. They make up less than half of the Xinjiang population. Recent decades have seen a mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) into Xinjiang, allegedly orchestrated by the state to dilute the minority population there. China has also been accused oftargeting Muslim religious figuresand banning religious practices in the region, as well as destroying mosques and tombs. Uyghur activists say they fear that the group's culture is under threat of erasure.

Like Tibet, it is autonomous, meaning - in theory - it has some powers of self-governance. But in practice, both regions are subjected to major restrictions by the central government. Xinjiang is a mostly desert region and produces about a fifth of the world's cotton. Human rights groups have voiced concerns that much of that cotton export is picked by forced labour, and in 2021 some Western brands removed Xinjiang cotton from their supply chains, leading to a backlash against the brands from Chinese celebrities and netizens. In December 2020, research seen by the BBC showed that up to half a million people were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang. There is evidence that new factories have been built within the grounds of the re-education camps. The region is also rich in oil and natural gas and because of its proximity to Central Asia and Europe is seen by Beijing as an important trade link. In the early 20th Century, the Uyghurs briefly declared independence for the region but it was brought under the complete control of China's new Communist government in 1949. Uyghur women pick cotton in Xinjiang. Rights groups have voiced concerns about forced labour in the region Several countries, including the US, UK, Canada and the Netherlands, have accused China of committing genocide - defined byinternational convention,externalas the ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"". The declarations follow reports that, as well as interning Uyghurs in camps,China has been forcibly mass sterilising Uyghur womento suppress the population, separating children from their families, and attempting to break the cultural traditions of the group. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has saidChina is committing ""genocide and crimes against humanity"". The UK parliament declared in April 2021 that China was committing a genocide in Xinjiang. A UN human rights committee in 2018 said it had credible reports that China was holding up to a million people in ""counter-extremism centres"" in Xinjiang. TheAustralian Strategic Policy Institute,externalfound evidence in 2020 of more than 380 of these ""re-education camps"" in Xinjiang, an increase of 40% on previous estimates. Analysis of data contained in the latest police documents, called theXinjiang Police Files, showed that almost 23,000 residents - or more than 12% of the adult population of one county - were in a camp or prison in the years 2017 and 2018. If applied to Xinjiang as a whole, the figures would mean the detention of more than 1.2 million Uyghur and other Turkic minority adults. The UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the files contained ""shocking details of China's human rights violations"". This video can not be played In 2018, the BBC found all reporting was tightly controlled Earlier, leaked documents known as the China Cables made clear that the camps were intended to be run as high security prisons, with strict discipline and punishments. People who have managed to escape the camps have reported physical, mental and sexual torture. Women have spoken of mass rape and sexual abuse. Anti-Han and separatist sentiment rose in Xinjiang from the 1990s, sometimes flaring into violence. In 2009 about 200 people died in clashes in Xinjiang, which the Chinese blamed on Uyghurs who wanted their own state. But in recent years a massive security crackdown has crushed dissent. Xinjiang is now covered by a pervasive network of surveillance, including police, checkpoints, and cameras that scan everything from number plates to individual faces. According to Human Rights Watch, police are also using a mobile app to monitor people's behaviour, such as how much electricity they are using and how often they use their front door. Since 2017, when President Xi Jinping issued an order saying all religions in China should be Chinese in orientation, there have been further crackdowns. Campaigners say China is trying to eradicate Uyghur culture. The Xinjiang Police Files, which all date from before 2019, shed further light on Uyghurs being punished for alleged crimes that took place years ago. Many appear to have been targeted for their mobile phone use, for listening to ""illegal lectures"" or not using their phones enough, which is regarded as a sign the user is trying to evade digital surveillance. This video can not be played China's ambassador: ""There is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang"" China denies all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. In response to the Xinjiang Police Files, China's foreign ministry spokesman told the BBC that the documents were ""the latest example of anti-China voices trying to smear China"". He said Xinjiang enjoyed stability and prosperity and residents were living happy, fulfilled lives. China says the crackdown in Xinjiang is necessary to prevent terrorism and root out Islamist extremism and the camps are an effective tool for re-educating inmates in its fight against terrorism. It insists that Uyghur militants are waging a violent campaign for an independent state by plotting bombings, sabotage and civic unrest, but it is accused of exaggerating the threat in order to justify repression of the Uyghurs. China has dismissed claims it is trying to reduce the Uyghur population through mass sterilisations as ""baseless"", and says allegations of forced labour are ""completely fabricated"".

coming to a close now. Thank you for joining us. It was brought to you by Chris Clayton, Sarah Collerton, Alexandra
Fouche, George Bowden and Jo Couzens. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Restrictions are continuing to ease across the UK. In Wales, a ""stay-local"" rule ends tomorrow, with some overnight accommodation reopening, allowing people to travel within the country. Meanwhile, outdoor gatherings of up to six people, or two households, in England will be allowed from Monday - including in private gardens. People will no longer be required to stay at home wherever possible, although everyone will be encouraged to stay local. Find out the rules in your areahere. BBC World Service France's foreign minister has accused Russia of using its Sputnik coronavirus vaccine as an instrument of aggressive diplomacy. Jean-Yves Le Drian contrasted the fanfare around a recent Russian delivery of a consignment of Sputnik V to Tunisia with that given to the much larger delivery through the UN-backed global Covax initiative. He made a similar contrast with a delivery of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine in Senegal with Covax consignments. Russia had announced ""with a lot of media attention"" that it would deliver 30,000 vaccine doses to Tunisia, the minister is quoted as  telling French radio by the AFP news agency. By then, the UN-backed initiative had already delivered 100,000 doses to the north African country, AFP adds, quoting the minister. The manufacturers of Sputnik V have not yet applied for market authorisation for the vaccine in the European Union, although EU regulators have begun a rolling review of test data. Yes, so do we. Well, we've got some good news (some are coming back this summer!) - and some bad news (others aren't just yet...) We heard earlier that TRNSMT festival in Glasgowhas been movedfrom its traditional July slot to September. Want to know which other festivals are still going ahead?We've compiled a handy list for you, but here's what's going on with some of the big ones: Boris Johnson spoke to US President Joe Biden this afternoon, discussing the fight against coronavirus and the UK and US Covid-19 vaccine rolllouts. Downing Street said the prime minister had ""stressed that global access to vaccines will be key to defeating the pandemic"". âThe prime minister and president agreed that combatting climate change will be a crucial component of building back better from the pandemic,"" said a Number 10 spokesperson. The two also talked about shared international challenges, including their shared commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland. Facebook, Twitter and Google have been urged by a US lawmaker to ban a dozen people who it is claimed are spreading the vast majority of disinformation about Covid vaccinations. Representative Mike Doyle made the call to remove their accounts during a US congressional session on how the three firms were dealing with fake news. He challenged Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Google's Sundar Pinchai to deplatform the dozen people in question immediately. None have responded to the call so far. Facebook said it was looking into the matter to see if the accounts violated its community standards. Twitter and Google have not responded to the BBC on the specific request to remove the accounts. Read more here. The average number of new daily cases in the UK has fallen substantially in recent weeks - but it now appears to be levelling off. A further 6,187 confirmed cases across the UK were announced today. That compares with 4,802 a week ago. A further 70 deaths across the UK within 28 days of a positive test were also reported earlier - compared with 101 last Friday. Meanwhile, the vaccine rollout is continuing, with around half of all UK adults having now received a first dose. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent We heard earlier today that hauliers travelling from continental Europe have been told that theywill be required to take a Covid test. We're now hearing more - an industry source has said they have been told that the measures are expected to start on 6 April onwards. All lorry and van drivers are required to take the test if they stay in the UK for more than 48 hours. They will need to get tested within 48 hours of arriving and will also be required to complete a passenger locator form so that they can be contacted while in the UK. The tests will be free and available at the existing government haulier sites previously set up to test drivers travelling out of the UK to certain European countries that require them, such as Denmark or Germany. Those who donât comply have been warned they can expect to be fined Â£2,000.
If drivers stay for longer, a second test is required within five days of arrival. If drivers stay longer than five days, they are required to take a third test within eight days of arrival. Drivers arriving from the EU to make deliveries should only leave their cabs for essential purposes, which include eating and using washing facilities. The Department for Transport has previously said it was carefully monitoring the increase in cases in Europe and would keep all measures under review. The head of the World Head Organization (WHO) has urged countries to donate 10 million vaccine doses ""immediately"" to help meet vaccination targets for poorer countries. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the international Covax vaccine-sharing programme needed the doses as a stop-gap measure. ""Covax is ready to deliver, but we can't deliver vaccines we
don't have. Bilateral deals, export bans and vaccine
nationalism have caused distortions in the market with gross
inequities in supply and demand,"" he told a news conference. ""There are plenty of countries who can afford to donate doses with little disruption to their own Covid-19 vaccination plans. 

The more countries that donate ASAP, the more doses we will have to share with countries who need them desperately,"" he added. Read more about Covax here British High Street photographic equipment chainJessops has filed a notice to appoint administratorsafter being severely impacted by the pandemic. The camera retailer, which employs 120 staff and has 17 stores, is owned by Dragons' Den star Peter Jones. Jessops said it had hired advisers FRP to help it restructure the business. The notice of intent provides the business with protection for 10 days from existing or pending creditor claims. The retailer said it planned to continue to trade when lockdown restrictions lift in April. It is considering a rescue deal in the form of a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Lockdown is, step-by-step, beginning to ease across the UK.But with infection rates rising in Europe, the British public is also being warned of the risk of a third wave. While the outbreaks in Europe have been portrayed as the threat, we should not forget the virus is still lurking here. Infection rates have dropped dramatically since the turn of the year - there has been a 12-fold fall in daily cases being reported. But that still leaves more than enough infection circulating that could easily take off. The Office for National Statistics estimates that, along with asymptomatic cases, there could be more than 100,000 infectious people out there. Already there are signs of a slight increase in cases among children following the return to schools in England. Read more here. British holidaymakers are beingwarned ""not to put the summer at risk""by travelling to the South West of England before lockdown restrictions ease. Under the UK government's roadmap, 12 April is the earliest date attractions and some self-contained accommodation is allowed to open. Devon County Council said it would give tourists a warm welcome ""when the guidelines allow, but not before"", warning visitors it is ""illegal"" and ""dangerous"" to travel down any earlier. ""After all our hard work to keep Covid-19 cases in Devon so low, we do not want to risk things now,"" said Keri Denton, Devon County Council's head of economy, skills and enterprise. Coping with cancer is difficult enough - and, for these young people, the pandemic has made their road to recovery even more challenging. Hospital treatments have been affected due to Covid restrictions. Many people had to attend appointments and treatment sessions alone. Mia Mackin, 24, and Lauren Lester, 25, spoke to BBC News NI about the added loneliness and fear that coronavirus brought to their journey with cancer. This video can not be played This video can not be played We told you earlier about somecountries' plans for vaccine passports. It is a way of opening up society once a large number of people get the jab, as well as enabling foreign travel further down the line. Estonia's Kalle Killar, who is undersecretary for e-health and Innovation at the country's ministry of social affairs, tells the BBC's Newsday programme about their own plans - their version of the digital vaccination certificate will come in the form of a QR code. ""In Estonia, we are very keen on providing all our citizens with digital services, and vaccine certificates is one of them. What we are able to do is that people can save this QR code to their phone or read it out or show it online. ""We are trying to do the best in order to provide our citizens with the best possible digital information, no matter where it will be used - whether at border crossings or some other usage that is still open."" It's been a family favourite for a century but Blackpool tourism bosses fear the Lancashire seaside resort may take five years to recover from Covid. The resort's head of tourism, Philip Welsh, said private sector partners had ""taken a hit"" during the pandemic. He told a meeting that Blackpool was preparing for an ""influx of visitors"" this year as restrictions lift. However, the council warned it would be tougher to sustain tourism past the summer months and as holidays abroad take off once more. Read morehere. And we've now heard from the WHO about the timing or the release of the report into the origins of the virus. The head of the team that went to Wuhan has said its content has now been finalised and he expects the report to be completed and released in the next few days, Reuters news agency reports. The head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, Mike Ryan, says the report will first be shared with member states for discussion and then released publicly. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst WHO members have been investigating the origins of Covid-19 in Wuhan A Chinese official has outlined the ""major findings"" of the China-WHO joint team investigation into the origins of Covid-19 in the city of Wuhan carried out earlier this
year, the national Global Times newspaper has reported. Feng Zijian, the deputy
director general of Chinaâs Centre for Disease Control and Prevention - and member of the joint team - spoke earlier today ahead of a briefing on the long-awaited
report, arranged by Chinaâs foreign ministry. Diplomats from
some 50 countries attended the press conference, Global Times said. Feng said the source-tracing work had been finalised with the consensus
that more work needed to be done on identifying the potential natural host of
the virus. According to the newspaper, he said ""experts found a highly
similar virus to Covid-19 in bats and pangolins in terms of virus sequencing"" but that those assessed were ""proven not to be a direct ancestor"". It was his view that ""more animal species, including mink and cats [were]
worthy of inquiry"" as potential natural hosts. ""We need to not only focus on bats while ignoring other
possibilities, as many other species are also vulnerable to the virus,"" he said. Feng said China had done much work on collecting bat samples but there was a ""lack of relevant work in research and sampling in neighbouring countries of
China and other countries across the world"", and suggested wider study
overseas, reported the Global Times. China has long refuted suggestions that Covid-19 might have maliciously entered into the world
from Wuhan, and has criticised references to the virus as the ""China virus"" or the ""Wuhan virus"". Members of the WHO team have previously
commented on the unlikelihood of the virus leaking from a Wuhan lab. State media have repeatedly
commented that other countries need to show the same willingness as China in
letting scientists investigate whether the virus might have originated elsewhere. Allowing shops in England to stay open until 22:00 six days a week will help people return to high streets safely, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said. Announcing changes to licencing, he said longer opening would give people greater flexibility to avoid peak times and ease transport pressures when non-essential shops open on 12 April at the earliest. The government is also extending flexible working hours on construction sites, allowing food deliveries to supermarkets over more time periods, and keeping the flexibility for pubs and restaurants to put up marquees to help increase seating capacity. Mr Jenrick said the move would help with ""protecting jobs, reducing pressure on public transport and supporting people and communities to continue to visit their high streets safely and shop locally"". French Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran receives a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine The EU has been criticised for the pace of its vaccination programme - only 14% of its population have received the jab, compared with 47% in the UK. In June 2020, all 27 member states joined up to a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines. However, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca, whichcaused supply problems,external. It also signed deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which ran into early problems with production and distribution. But the EU is concerned that the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom are based within the EU. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

worthy of inquiry"" as potential natural hosts. ""We need to not only focus on bats while ignoring other
possibilities, as many other species are also vulnerable to the virus,"" he said. Feng said China had done much work on collecting bat samples but there was a ""lack of relevant work in research and sampling in neighbouring countries of
China and other countries across the world"", and suggested wider study
overseas, reported the Global Times. China has long refuted suggestions that Covid-19 might have maliciously entered into the world
from Wuhan, and has criticised references to the virus as the ""China virus"" or the ""Wuhan virus"". Members of the WHO team have previously
commented on the unlikelihood of the virus leaking from a Wuhan lab. State media have repeatedly
commented that other countries need to show the same willingness as China in
letting scientists investigate whether the virus might have originated elsewhere. Allowing shops in England to stay open until 22:00 six days a week will help people return to high streets safely, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said. Announcing changes to licencing, he said longer opening would give people greater flexibility to avoid peak times and ease transport pressures when non-essential shops open on 12 April at the earliest. The government is also extending flexible working hours on construction sites, allowing food deliveries to supermarkets over more time periods, and keeping the flexibility for pubs and restaurants to put up marquees to help increase seating capacity. Mr Jenrick said the move would help with ""protecting jobs, reducing pressure on public transport and supporting people and communities to continue to visit their high streets safely and shop locally"". French Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran receives a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine The EU has been criticised for the pace of its vaccination programme - only 14% of its population have received the jab, compared with 47% in the UK. In June 2020, all 27 member states joined up to a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines. However, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca, whichcaused supply problems,external. It also signed deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which ran into early problems with production and distribution. But the EU is concerned that the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom are based within the EU. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Jackie Weaver: Don't stop virtual council meetingsThe council officer says more people get involved with council meetings when they take place online.,"Jackie Weaver has joined critics of a government move to end virtual council meetings in England from May. Minister Luke Hall haswritten to local authorities,externalsaying the government is under too much pressure to fit in legislation to allow them to continue. Ms Weaver, who rose to fame aftera meeting of Handforth Parish Council went viral, said it would be ""dreadful"" to bring them to an end. The Local Government Association also called for the decision to be reversed. Chair of the organisation, Councillor James Jamieson, said reintroducing face-to-face meetings ""could easily involve up to 200 people in one room, even before adding in members of the public and reporters"" - so their return would pose a ""significant challenge"" to councils to make them Covid-secure. Lawyers in local government, along with Hertfordshire County Council, have now made an application to the courts to declare authorities already have the powers needed to hold online meetings. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it had asked councils to share their experiences of remote meetings, saying they will use the evidence ""to inform any potential future legislation regarding their use beyond the pandemic"". English councils battling financial ruin Should local council power be 'turbo-charged'? Parish council Zoom host 'surprised' by reaction Like many other organisations, local councils were forced to go online in 2020 due to the pandemic and restrictions on public meetings. Emergency legislation was passed in the Commons to give them the power to do business over video conferencing tools, but the temporary law is due to run out the day after the local elections on 6 May. In his letter, Mr Hall - the minister for regional growth and local government - praised the efforts of local authorities in England, saying they had ""risen magnificently to the challenges of this period"". But he said extending virtual meetings past May would involved primary legislation in the Commons, which would have a ""significant impact... on the government's legislative programme, which is already under severe pressure in these unprecedented times"". This video can not be played Viral moments like this Handforth Parish Council meeting could come to an end - but there are more serious reasons for concern too Mrs Weaver - the chief officer of the Cheshire Association of Local Councils - told BBC Radio Derby it would be ""dreadful"" to bring virtual meetings to an end. She added: ""I think all the evidence is out there to show that actually Zoom has done more... [and] has been instrumental in getting people involved. ""We can see it in the figures [with] people turning up. We are seeing it in the people that are showing interest in elections. ""I am not saying all council meetings should be held virtually and I know a lot of my councils are keen to get back to face-to-face meetings, but it would be so helpful, so valuable to be able to hold Zoom meetings."" Mr Jamieson agreed the move risked ""damaging the gains seen in public participation in remote council meetings during the pandemic and our vital local democratic process"". He also pointed to the imbalance when it came to the rules in Westminster. ""MPs will retain the right to participate remotely until at least 21 June, but the powers-that-be in the House of Commons will not make time available to legislate for councillors to do the same,"" he added. The County Councils Network said the government's decision was ""deeply disappointing, considering the success of remote meetings"". Its chairman, Councillor David Williams, said he had concerns over whether face-to-face council meetings could be done safely, adding: ""The decision is illogical when you bear in mind the government's own guidance stipulates that indoor events cannot be organised until 17 May at the earliest."" Asked for a response to the criticism, the ministry sent a statement from Mr Hall, who said: ""Councils continue to play a vital role in our response to the pandemic and I am grateful for how they have used emergency powers introduced a year ago to continue to operate at a difficult time. ""As the vaccine roll-out continues and restrictions are lifted, councils holding face-to-face meetings from 7 May are being given the support and guidance they need to do so in a safe and secure way."" He added: ""I am keen to hear from councils and local residents about their experiences of virtual meetings so that we can properly consider whether to make these a permanent option.""

Asda loses Supreme Court appeal in equal pay fight,"Thousands of Asda supermarket workers have won a major victory at the Supreme Court in their battle for equal pay. The court upheld an earlier court ruling that lower-paid shop staff, who are mostly women, can compare themselves with higher paid warehouse workers, who are mostly men. The judge stressed the ruling did not mean the 44,000 claimants had won the right to equal pay. However, they are now free to take further action. Lauren Lougheed, a Leigh Day lawyer representing Asda store staff, said: ""We are delighted that our clients have cleared such a big hurdle in their fight for equal pay. ""Already an employment tribunal, the employment appeal tribunal and the Court of Appeal ruled that these roles can be compared, and now the Supreme Court has come to the same conclusion. ""It's our hope that Asda will now stop dragging its heels and pay their staff what they are worth."" The GMB union has members involved in the case. Its legal director, Susan Harris, said: ""Asda has wasted money on lawyers' bills chasing a lost cause, losing appeal after appeal, while tens of thousands of retail workers remain out of pocket. ""We now call on Asda to sit down with us to reach agreement on the back pay owed to our members - which could run to hundreds of millions of pounds."" Wendy Arundale, who worked for Asda for 32 years, said: ""I loved my job, but knowing that male colleagues working in distribution centres were being paid more left a bitter taste in my mouth. ""It's not much to ask to be paid an equal wage for work of equal value."" But an Asda spokesman said there was a long way to go before the issues were finally settled: ""This ruling relates to one stage of a complex case that is likely to take several years to reach a conclusion. ""We are defending these claims because the pay in our stores and distribution centres is the same for colleagues doing the same jobs regardless of their gender. Retail and distribution are very different sectors with their own distinct skill sets and pay rates."" It said it remained confident in its case. Lawyers say the ruling will have implications for supermarkets and other retailers. ""It would be difficult to underestimate the significance of this judgment which will send shockwaves far beyond Asda,"" said Anne Pritam, partner and employment lawyer at Stephenson Harwood. ""It is a watershed moment for the rest of the retail industry, particularly those defending their own equal pay claims - such as Sainsbury's, Tesco, Morrisons and Next - and which have similar staffing models and pay structures."" ""Ultimately, if all of the retailers lose their equal pay claims, it is estimated they could face Â£8bn in compensation payments to employees."" Co-op faces equal pay claims from shop workers Covid has 'devastating' impact on gender equality Asda store workers argued they were paid less because most store workers are women, while most distribution depot staff are men. Lawyers representing the store workers say depot workers were paid between Â£1.50-3.00 an hour more. Asda said it had always paid the correct rate for the job, whether male or female, and pointed out that both men and women worked in both supermarkets and the warehouses. Asda store workers may have won this battle in their long running equal pay claim - but the war is far from over. The Supreme Court has ruled that for the purposes of equal pay the work of the mainly male distribution workers can be compared to the mainly female shop floor workers. But next they need to prove their work is of equal value - in terms of skills and training. And finally that gender is the key reason that their pay is different. The stakes here are high. Supermarkets could find themselves on the hook for more than Â£8bn in back pay. And it could reverberate around other businesses too - where a majority of women carry out a certain role. In 2016, an employment tribunal decided that Asda store workers were entitled to compare themselves to distribution staff and that decision was upheld by Court of Appeal judges in 2019. Asda bosses then appealed to the Supreme Court. Lawyers say litigation could run on for years. There are three stages in equal pay action: Are the jobs comparable? If the jobs are comparable, are they of equal value? If they are of equal value, is there a reason why the roles should not be paid equally? Following the Supreme Court ruling, lawyers say the next stage would involve an employment tribunal deciding whether specific store and distribution jobs were of ""equal value"". If judges decided that different jobs were of ""equal value"", the litigation would then enter a third stage. Under this, a tribunal would then consider whether there were reasons - other than gender - why people working in stores should not get the same pay rates as people working in distribution centres.

EU stops short of vaccine export ban at summit,"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen urged AstraZeneca to ""honour its contract"" European Union leaders have stopped short of banning vaccine exports after a protracted row with the Anglo-Swedish manufacturer AstraZeneca. At a summit on Thursday they gave backing in principle for toughening export controls. But a post-summit statement emphasised the importance of global supply chains needed to produce vaccinations. Elements of the AstraZeneca vaccination are manufactured in a number of EU states. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said AstraZeneca must ""catch up"" on deliveries to the EU before exporting doses elsewhere. French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters this marked ""the end of naivety"" from the EU. Vaccine rollouts in EU states have started sluggishly, and the bloc has blamed pharmaceutical companies - primarily AstraZeneca - for not delivering promised doses. AstraZeneca has denied that it is failing to honour its contract. The EU is expecting to receive about 30 million AstraZeneca doses by the end of March, less than a third of what it was hoping for. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? Where is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine made? EU tussle with UK over AstraZeneca jabs escalates ""I think it is clear that first of all the company has to catch up,"" Mrs von der Leyen told a news conference after the virtual leaders' summit. ""[It] has to honour the contract it has with European member states before it can engage again in exporting vaccines,"" she said. ""We want to explain to our European citizens that they [can] get their fair share."" The EU was accused, primarily by the UK and the World Health Organization (WHO), of so-called vaccine nationalism after it introduced export controls on jabs produced within the bloc. In response, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that ""blockades"" were not ""sensible"". He said a ban would imperil the UK's vaccination drive, which has so far been more successful than EU member states' vaccine programmes. Mr Johnson also warned that a ban that extended beyond AstraZeneca's disputed supply could also block jabs produced for BioNTech/Pfizer in Belgium. France's foreign minister said on Friday that the EU ""shouldn't be paying the price"" for the UK's vaccination policy. ""One can't play with blackmail, having given a lot of first jabs and then run into problems with the second,"" Jean-Yves Le Drian told France Info radio. Mrs von der Leyen said on Thursday that EU was the ""region that exports most vaccines worldwide"" and invited other countries to ""match our openness"". Her comments came a day after the EU issued a joint statement with the UK in which both sides pledged to work together after weeks of tensions over the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab. Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron backed the EU's export controls. ""I support the fact that we must block all exports for as long as some drug companies don't respect their commitments with Europeans,"" he said. Earlier, he expressed frustration at the slow pace of much of Europe's vaccine rollout. ""We didn't shoot for the stars,"" he told the Greek television channel ERT before the summit. ""We were wrong to lack ambition."" Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said while his fellow leaders had found the Commission's tougher export measures ""acceptable"", he hoped they would never be used - a message echoed by his Belgian counterpart, Alexander De Croo. Both those two countries are home to factories involved in the production of the AstraZeneca shot, which it's suggested may soon be sending increased supplies to European nations - a move that may assuage some EU anger, BBC Brussels correspondent Nick Beake reports. Mr Rutte said an agreement with the UK over AstraZeneca components produced in the Netherlands could be announced this weekend. Following the virtual summit, the EU's 27 member states agreed to try and ramp up the production of vaccines within the bloc. ""Accelerating the production, delivery and deployment of vaccines remains essential and urgent to overcome the crisis. Efforts to this end must be further intensified,"" they said in a joint statement. ""We underline the importance of transparency as well as of the use of export authorisations,"" they added. The EU also called on vaccine manufacturers to ""ensure predictability of their vaccine production and respect contractual delivery deadlines"". This video can not be played Juncker: ""We are not in war, we are not enemies"" US President Joe Biden also attended the virtual meeting, in an effort to repair ties with the EU after the strained relationship between the bloc and his predecessor, Donald Trump. Ahead of Thursday's meeting, a former president of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, urged the bloc to avoid a ""stupid vaccine war"" with the UK. ""We are not in war, and we are not enemies,"" he told the BBC's Hardtalk programme. He added that threats of export bans could cause ""major reputational damage"" to the EU. A third wave of infections is sweeping across much of mainland Europe. EU states have seen some of the deadliest outbreaks of the pandemic, with Italy recording more than 106,000 deaths, France 93,000, Germany 75,000 and Spain 73,000. Yet recent figures show just 12.9 doses of vaccine have been administered per 100 people in the EU compared with 44.7 in the UK and 37.2 in the US. Speaking earlier this week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the British variant had become the dominant strain circulating in Germany and amounted to ""a new pandemic"". ""The situation is serious,"" she said. ""Case numbers are rising exponentially and intensive care beds are filling up again."" Lockdowns have been re-imposed or extended in countries like Belgium or the Netherlands but there isparticular concern over eastern EU states. Poland will close nurseries, pre-schools and hairdressers for two weeks from Saturday after coronavirus cases surged.

Wendy Arundale, who worked for Asda for 32 years, said: ""I loved my job, but knowing that male colleagues working in distribution centres were being paid more left a bitter taste in my mouth. ""It's not much to ask to be paid an equal wage for work of equal value."" But an Asda spokesman said there was a long way to go before the issues were finally settled: ""This ruling relates to one stage of a complex case that is likely to take several years to reach a conclusion. ""We are defending these claims because the pay in our stores and distribution centres is the same for colleagues doing the same jobs regardless of their gender. Retail and distribution are very different sectors with their own distinct skill sets and pay rates."" It said it remained confident in its case. Lawyers say the ruling will have implications for supermarkets and other retailers. ""It would be difficult to underestimate the significance of this judgment which will send shockwaves far beyond Asda,"" said Anne Pritam, partner and employment lawyer at Stephenson Harwood. ""It is a watershed moment for the rest of the retail industry, particularly those defending their own equal pay claims - such as Sainsbury's, Tesco, Morrisons and Next - and which have similar staffing models and pay structures."" ""Ultimately, if all of the retailers lose their equal pay claims, it is estimated they could face Â£8bn in compensation payments to employees."" Co-op faces equal pay claims from shop workers Covid has 'devastating' impact on gender equality Asda store workers argued they were paid less because most store workers are women, while most distribution depot staff are men. Lawyers representing the store workers say depot workers were paid between Â£1.50-3.00 an hour more. Asda said it had always paid the correct rate for the job, whether male or female, and pointed out that both men and women worked in both supermarkets and the warehouses. Asda store workers may have won this battle in their long running equal pay claim - but the war is far from over. The Supreme Court has ruled that for the purposes of equal pay the work of the mainly male distribution workers can be compared to the mainly female shop floor workers. But next they need to prove their work is of equal value - in terms of skills and training. And finally that gender is the key reason that their pay is different. The stakes here are high. Supermarkets could find themselves on the hook for more than Â£8bn in back pay. And it could reverberate around other businesses too - where a majority of women carry out a certain role. In 2016, an employment tribunal decided that Asda store workers were entitled to compare themselves to distribution staff and that decision was upheld by Court of Appeal judges in 2019. Asda bosses then appealed to the Supreme Court. Lawyers say litigation could run on for years. There are three stages in equal pay action: Are the jobs comparable? If the jobs are comparable, are they of equal value? If they are of equal value, is there a reason why the roles should not be paid equally? Following the Supreme Court ruling, lawyers say the next stage would involve an employment tribunal deciding whether specific store and distribution jobs were of ""equal value"". If judges decided that different jobs were of ""equal value"", the litigation would then enter a third stage. Under this, a tribunal would then consider whether there were reasons - other than gender - why people working in stores should not get the same pay rates as people working in distribution centres.

Suez blockage is holding up Â£7bn of goods a day,"This video can not be played A salvage company, working to free the Ever Given, says the operation could take weeks The stranded Ever Given mega-container ship in the Suez Canal is holding up an estimated $9.6bn (Â£7bn) of goods each day, according to shipping data. This works out at $400m an hour in trade along the waterway which is a vital passageway between east and west. Data from shipping expert Lloyd's List values the canal's westbound traffic at roughly $5.1bn a day, and eastbound daily traffic at around $4.5bn. Despite efforts to free the ship, it could take weeks to remove experts say. How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? Egypt's Suez Canal blocked by huge container ship In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal The Ever Given, operated by the Taiwanese company Evergreen Marine, is the length of four football pitches and one of the world's biggest container vessels. The 200,000-tonne ship is capable of carrying 20,000 containers. Its blockage is causing huge tailbacks of other ships trying to pass through the Suez Canal. The canal, which separates Africa from the Middle East and Asia, is one of the busiest trade routes in the world, with about 12% of total global trade moving through it. According to Lloyd's List tracking data there are more than 160 vessels waiting at either end of the canal. These include 41 bulk carriers and 24 crude tankers. Along with oil, the sea traffic is largely consumer products such as clothing, furniture, manufacturing components and car parts. ""We're hearing reports now that shipping companies are starting to divert their ships around the southern tip of Africa, the Cape of Good Hope, which adds about 3,500 miles to the journey and up to 12 days,"" Guy Platten, the secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, told the BBC's Today programme. He said the ship appeared to be ""hard fast aground"", adding that freeing the vessel from the bank was taking much longer and was more complicated than had been initially expected. Mr Platten added there would be ""some major real-world effects on the supply chain"", explaining that consumers would would ultimately bear the cost. The Ever Givenhad been scheduled to arrive in the port of Felixstowe,externalin early April. Container ships have nearly doubled in size in the past decade as global trade expands, making the job of moving them much harder when they get stuck. ""What are we thinking? Have vessels gotten too large? Containers being jettisoned overboard, delayed transits due to terminal congestion and let us not forget the long line of vessels at many ports waiting for a berth,"" said Jon Monroe, who runs his own ocean transportation consultancy. Work continues on freeing the Ever Given mega-container ship. BIMCO, an international shipping association, says the delays will only continue to grow and affect supplies. ""For each day of delay my thought is it will take two days to undo the delays,"" said Alan Baer, president of logistics provider OL USA. ""Right now three days creates six days of ongoing delays.  I'm not sure this is a perfect formula, but it will be close,"" he told the BBC. In addition to delaying thousands of containers loaded with consumer items, the stranded ship has also tied up empty containers which are needed for exports. If the delays are short, most companies will absorb the extra delay in transit times. But salvage officials said the congestion could last days or even weeks, in a blow to global supply chains already strained by the Covid-19 pandemic. Some companies will be considering flying replacement merchandise for higher value products, or transporting them via trains. Two major shipping companies, Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, said they are looking into options to avoid the Suez Canal. Egypt's Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said it was doing all it could to refloat the ship with tug boats, dredgers and heavy earth-moving equipment. Kitack Lim, secretary general of the International Maritime Organisation, said: "" I am aware of the implications of the temporary closure of the canal, and I ask for patience from stakeholders across the supply chain as everyone works to ensure that the ship, its crew, its cargo and the environment remain protected.""

Lorry drivers 'must expect Covid test to enter UK',"Hauliers expect to have to take a Covid test when coming to the UK from mainland Europe A haulage industry source has said they have been told by the government to expect drivers to have to take a Covid test when coming into the UK from mainland Europe. The tests are expected to take place on the UK side. Lorry drivers had previously been exempt from testing coming into the UK. The Department for Transport said it was ""carefully monitoring"" an increase in cases in Europe and would keep all measures under review. Four days ago Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that a third wave of the pandemic in Europe could ""wash up on the UK's shores."" This week Germany was due to extend its lockdown over Easter due to a third wave of infections, although it soon reversed the decision. France's president Emmanuel Macron said he wanted vaccinations ""morning, noon and night"" afteran increase in intensive care cases and hospital admissions. Now, some in the haulage industry say they've been told to expect that lorry drivers will be required to take a Covid test after travelling from mainland Europe to England. France has stopped mandatory testing for haulierstravelling from the UK to France, a measure that had been in place from December due concerns about a UK variant of the disease. Hauliers travelling from the UK to Denmark, Germany or the Netherlands still require a test. The Department for Transport said: ""We are carefully monitoring the increase in cases in Europe and will keep all measures under review as we cautiously remove restrictions throughout our roadmap."" The government has been encouraging international hauliers due to be in the UK for more than 48 hours to take a free coronavirus test. Hauliers leaving the UK can also take a free test. Trade volumes with the continent declined in January due to Covid-19 restrictions and the impact of new arrangements under Brexit. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that UK goods exported to the European Union fell 40.7% in January, while imports tumbled 28.8%. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister has indicated the government might further tighten restrictions on arrivals from France, including hauliers, to stop new variants of the Covid-19 virus spreading from the rest of Europe. Britain has banned foreign travel until at least 17 May, except for essential work, education or health reasons. Ministers are due to review that position in April. Questioning the PM at the Liaison Committee on Thursday, Labour's Yvette Cooper said every week 20,000 people arrived from France, and two-thirds of them - including lorry drivers - were exempt from those restrictions.

LiveLiveWales to lift 'stay-local' rule as Covid curbs ease7 minutes ago,"The number testing positive for coronavirus is levelling off in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and has risen in Scotland, official figures suggest Infection levels in secondary school-age children rose slightly in England although they fell in older teenagers, according to the Office for National Statistics The UK's R number has narrowed slightly to 0.7-0.9 from 0.6-0.9 last week - it shows the epidemic is still shrinking because it remains below 1 The UK's daily figures show another 6,187 confirmed cases and 70 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test France has accused the UK of ""blackmail"" over its handling of coronavirus vaccine exports, amid continuing tensions over supply chains Germany's disease control agency says there are very clear signs the third Covid-19 wave could be much worse than the previous two ""Stay-local"" rules will lift in Wales from Saturday and unrestricted travel within Wales will be allowed The US has passed 30 million recorded coronavirus cases, the highest number of cases in the world Edited by Chris Clayton and Sarah Collerton Today's live page is
coming to a close now. Thank you for joining us. It was brought to you by Chris Clayton, Sarah Collerton, Alexandra
Fouche, George Bowden and Jo Couzens. Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but,
before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: Restrictions are continuing to ease across the UK. In Wales, a ""stay-local"" rule ends tomorrow, with some overnight accommodation reopening, allowing people to travel within the country. Meanwhile, outdoor gatherings of up to six people, or two households, in England will be allowed from Monday - including in private gardens. People will no longer be required to stay at home wherever possible, although everyone will be encouraged to stay local. Find out the rules in your areahere. BBC World Service France's foreign minister has accused Russia of using its Sputnik coronavirus vaccine as an instrument of aggressive diplomacy. Jean-Yves Le Drian contrasted the fanfare around a recent Russian delivery of a consignment of Sputnik V to Tunisia with that given to the much larger delivery through the UN-backed global Covax initiative. He made a similar contrast with a delivery of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine in Senegal with Covax consignments. Russia had announced ""with a lot of media attention"" that it would deliver 30,000 vaccine doses to Tunisia, the minister is quoted as  telling French radio by the AFP news agency. By then, the UN-backed initiative had already delivered 100,000 doses to the north African country, AFP adds, quoting the minister. The manufacturers of Sputnik V have not yet applied for market authorisation for the vaccine in the European Union, although EU regulators have begun a rolling review of test data. Yes, so do we. Well, we've got some good news (some are coming back this summer!) - and some bad news (others aren't just yet...) We heard earlier that TRNSMT festival in Glasgowhas been movedfrom its traditional July slot to September. Want to know which other festivals are still going ahead?We've compiled a handy list for you, but here's what's going on with some of the big ones: Boris Johnson spoke to US President Joe Biden this afternoon, discussing the fight against coronavirus and the UK and US Covid-19 vaccine rolllouts. Downing Street said the prime minister had ""stressed that global access to vaccines will be key to defeating the pandemic"". âThe prime minister and president agreed that combatting climate change will be a crucial component of building back better from the pandemic,"" said a Number 10 spokesperson. The two also talked about shared international challenges, including their shared commitment to protecting the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland. Facebook, Twitter and Google have been urged by a US lawmaker to ban a dozen people who it is claimed are spreading the vast majority of disinformation about Covid vaccinations. Representative Mike Doyle made the call to remove their accounts during a US congressional session on how the three firms were dealing with fake news. He challenged Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Google's Sundar Pinchai to deplatform the dozen people in question immediately. None have responded to the call so far. Facebook said it was looking into the matter to see if the accounts violated its community standards. Twitter and Google have not responded to the BBC on the specific request to remove the accounts.

A further 6,187 confirmed cases across the UK were announced today. That compares with 4,802 a week ago. A further 70 deaths across the UK within 28 days of a positive test were also reported earlier - compared with 101 last Friday. Meanwhile, the vaccine rollout is continuing, with around half of all UK adults having now received a first dose. Caroline DaviesTransport correspondent We heard earlier today that hauliers travelling from continental Europe have been told that theywill be required to take a Covid test. We're now hearing more - an industry source has said they have been told that the measures are expected to start on 6 April onwards. All lorry and van drivers are required to take the test if they stay in the UK for more than 48 hours. They will need to get tested within 48 hours of arriving and will also be required to complete a passenger locator form so that they can be contacted while in the UK. The tests will be free and available at the existing government haulier sites previously set up to test drivers travelling out of the UK to certain European countries that require them, such as Denmark or Germany. Those who donât comply have been warned they can expect to be fined Â£2,000.
If drivers stay for longer, a second test is required within five days of arrival. If drivers stay longer than five days, they are required to take a third test within eight days of arrival. Drivers arriving from the EU to make deliveries should only leave their cabs for essential purposes, which include eating and using washing facilities. The Department for Transport has previously said it was carefully monitoring the increase in cases in Europe and would keep all measures under review. The head of the World Head Organization (WHO) has urged countries to donate 10 million vaccine doses ""immediately"" to help meet vaccination targets for poorer countries. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the international Covax vaccine-sharing programme needed the doses as a stop-gap measure. ""Covax is ready to deliver, but we can't deliver vaccines we
don't have. Bilateral deals, export bans and vaccine
nationalism have caused distortions in the market with gross
inequities in supply and demand,"" he told a news conference. ""There are plenty of countries who can afford to donate doses with little disruption to their own Covid-19 vaccination plans. 

The more countries that donate ASAP, the more doses we will have to share with countries who need them desperately,"" he added. Read more about Covax here British High Street photographic equipment chainJessops has filed a notice to appoint administratorsafter being severely impacted by the pandemic. The camera retailer, which employs 120 staff and has 17 stores, is owned by Dragons' Den star Peter Jones. Jessops said it had hired advisers FRP to help it restructure the business. The notice of intent provides the business with protection for 10 days from existing or pending creditor claims. The retailer said it planned to continue to trade when lockdown restrictions lift in April. It is considering a rescue deal in the form of a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA), an insolvency process that allows a business to reach an agreement with its creditors to pay off all or part of its debts. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Lockdown is, step-by-step, beginning to ease across the UK.But with infection rates rising in Europe, the British public is also being warned of the risk of a third wave. While the outbreaks in Europe have been portrayed as the threat, we should not forget the virus is still lurking here. Infection rates have dropped dramatically since the turn of the year - there has been a 12-fold fall in daily cases being reported. But that still leaves more than enough infection circulating that could easily take off. The Office for National Statistics estimates that, along with asymptomatic cases, there could be more than 100,000 infectious people out there. Already there are signs of a slight increase in cases among children following the return to schools in England. Read more here. British holidaymakers are beingwarned ""not to put the summer at risk""by travelling to the South West of England before lockdown restrictions ease. Under the UK government's roadmap, 12 April is the earliest date attractions and some self-contained accommodation is allowed to open. Devon County Council said it would give tourists a warm welcome ""when the guidelines allow, but not before"", warning visitors it is ""illegal"" and ""dangerous"" to travel down any earlier. ""After all our hard work to keep Covid-19 cases in Devon so low, we do not want to risk things now,"" said Keri Denton, Devon County Council's head of economy, skills and enterprise. Coping with cancer is difficult enough - and, for these young people, the pandemic has made their road to recovery even more challenging. Hospital treatments have been affected due to Covid restrictions. Many people had to attend appointments and treatment sessions alone. Mia Mackin, 24, and Lauren Lester, 25, spoke to BBC News NI about the added loneliness and fear that coronavirus brought to their journey with cancer. This video can not be played This video can not be played We told you earlier about somecountries' plans for vaccine passports. It is a way of opening up society once a large number of people get the jab, as well as enabling foreign travel further down the line. Estonia's Kalle Killar, who is undersecretary for e-health and Innovation at the country's ministry of social affairs, tells the BBC's Newsday programme about their own plans - their version of the digital vaccination certificate will come in the form of a QR code. ""In Estonia, we are very keen on providing all our citizens with digital services, and vaccine certificates is one of them. What we are able to do is that people can save this QR code to their phone or read it out or show it online. ""We are trying to do the best in order to provide our citizens with the best possible digital information, no matter where it will be used - whether at border crossings or some other usage that is still open."" It's been a family favourite for a century but Blackpool tourism bosses fear the Lancashire seaside resort may take five years to recover from Covid. The resort's head of tourism, Philip Welsh, said private sector partners had ""taken a hit"" during the pandemic. He told a meeting that Blackpool was preparing for an ""influx of visitors"" this year as restrictions lift. However, the council warned it would be tougher to sustain tourism past the summer months and as holidays abroad take off once more. Read morehere. And we've now heard from the WHO about the timing or the release of the report into the origins of the virus. The head of the team that went to Wuhan has said its content has now been finalised and he expects the report to be completed and released in the next few days, Reuters news agency reports. The head of the WHO's health emergencies programme, Mike Ryan, says the report will first be shared with member states for discussion and then released publicly. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst WHO members have been investigating the origins of Covid-19 in Wuhan A Chinese official has outlined the ""major findings"" of the China-WHO joint team investigation into the origins of Covid-19 in the city of Wuhan carried out earlier this
year, the national Global Times newspaper has reported. Feng Zijian, the deputy
director general of Chinaâs Centre for Disease Control and Prevention - and member of the joint team - spoke earlier today ahead of a briefing on the long-awaited
report, arranged by Chinaâs foreign ministry. Diplomats from
some 50 countries attended the press conference, Global Times said. Feng said the source-tracing work had been finalised with the consensus
that more work needed to be done on identifying the potential natural host of
the virus. According to the newspaper, he said ""experts found a highly
similar virus to Covid-19 in bats and pangolins in terms of virus sequencing"" but that those assessed were ""proven not to be a direct ancestor"". It was his view that ""more animal species, including mink and cats [were]
worthy of inquiry"" as potential natural hosts. ""We need to not only focus on bats while ignoring other
possibilities, as many other species are also vulnerable to the virus,"" he said. Feng said China had done much work on collecting bat samples but there was a ""lack of relevant work in research and sampling in neighbouring countries of
China and other countries across the world"", and suggested wider study
overseas, reported the Global Times. China has long refuted suggestions that Covid-19 might have maliciously entered into the world
from Wuhan, and has criticised references to the virus as the ""China virus"" or the ""Wuhan virus"". Members of the WHO team have previously
commented on the unlikelihood of the virus leaking from a Wuhan lab. State media have repeatedly
commented that other countries need to show the same willingness as China in
letting scientists investigate whether the virus might have originated elsewhere. Allowing shops in England to stay open until 22:00 six days a week will help people return to high streets safely, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick has said. Announcing changes to licencing, he said longer opening would give people greater flexibility to avoid peak times and ease transport pressures when non-essential shops open on 12 April at the earliest. The government is also extending flexible working hours on construction sites, allowing food deliveries to supermarkets over more time periods, and keeping the flexibility for pubs and restaurants to put up marquees to help increase seating capacity. Mr Jenrick said the move would help with ""protecting jobs, reducing pressure on public transport and supporting people and communities to continue to visit their high streets safely and shop locally"". French Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran receives a dose of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine The EU has been criticised for the pace of its vaccination programme - only 14% of its population have received the jab, compared with 47% in the UK. In June 2020, all 27 member states joined up to a scheme giving the EU central responsibility for buying vaccines. However, the EU was slower than the UK to negotiate a contract with AstraZeneca, whichcaused supply problems,external. It also signed deals with Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, which ran into early problems with production and distribution. But the EU is concerned that the UK has had an unfair advantage in contracts it signed with vaccine manufacturers, some of whom are based within the EU. Read more here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Suez blockage is holding up Â£7bn of goods a dayThe stranding of ship Ever Given is causing huge tailbacks and Â£292m an hour in goods that can't be moved.,"This video can not be played A salvage company, working to free the Ever Given, says the operation could take weeks The stranded Ever Given mega-container ship in the Suez Canal is holding up an estimated $9.6bn (Â£7bn) of goods each day, according to shipping data.

Retail sales stage partial recovery in February,"Retail sales rose 2.1% in February, recovering some ground from a steep fall in January. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalsaid sales were still down by 3.7% on a year earlier, before the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Food and mixed department stores benefitted from essential retailers remaining open, it said, though clothing shops continued to struggle. Outdoor furniture and DIY sales were strong with people stuck at home. Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics, said anecdotal evidence from retailers suggested people had been spending on home improvements and on outdoor furniture, as people prepared for lockdown easing, which will allow gatherings in gardens again in England and Northern Ireland next week. Scotland and Wales already have already eased rules about outdoor mixing. Mr Athow said that in February, despite national restrictions, ""retail sales partially recovered from the hit they took in January"" when they fell by 8.2%. He said mixed stores, including retailers such as B&M Bargains and Wilko, which were allowed to stay open as they sold some foodstuffs, had benefitted, with budget-end department stores also increasing sales. Online sales continued to grow and hit a record 36.1% of all UK sales. Cheaper clothes and cars push inflation lower John Lewis to permanently close eight more shops The rise of new 'young DIY-ers' boosts B&Q-owner Clothing retailers have been hit the worst over the past year, the ONS said, seeing a 50.4% drop in sales volumes when compared with February 2020, before the first Covid lockdown measures were introduced. Fuel sales have also fallen sharply, down 26.5% from a year earlier as travel restrictions continue to curb demand. Susannah Streeter, analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said the sales figures showed people had been making some significant changes to their homes. ""With working from home at least for part of the week, likely to be the new normal going forward, many employees have been trying to create a more permanent alternative to the kitchen table or corner of the bedroom. ""Dividing open plan rooms and building garden offices are among the building projects being undertaken, as workers settle in at home for the long haul.""

Long-term help for rough sleepers 'varies by area',"Martin used to sleep rough under a bridge, but now is in privately-rented accommodation A scheme to bring all rough sleepers indoors at the start of the pandemic has seen a large disparity in the outcomes of those supported across England, new data has revealed. In some areas over 80% of those helped are in longer-term accommodation. In others it is less than 15%. The charity Crisis said the government must provide a clear national strategy. Rough sleeping minister Eddie Hughes said many councils were ""doing an exceptional job"". He said local authorities were best placed to allocate funding in their area, and that the UK government had provided Â£4.6bn of support to be spent by them. Martin, from Shrewsbury, was one of those helped by Everyone In. He slept rough in a concrete alcove under a bridge next to the River Severn for a year prior to the pandemic. ""I used to have a bit of carpet underneath me, and a sleeping bag and a pillow basically. And that's it,"" he said. ""I never felt so down in my whole life."" He said he had asked his local council for support when he first became homeless, and was told he did not qualify as he was not considered a priority need. Martin said when he asked for support before the pandemic, he was told he was not eligible Then on 26 March 2020, the government announced all rough sleepers in England should be brought indoors regardless of their situation. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland had similar schemes. Over the course of a few days, thousands of vulnerable people were placed in emergency housing. Martin was given a hotel room - and has since been helped into privately rented accommodation. He admits to being ""a bit emotional"" when he first found out he would be living in his new home. ""It's just opened doors for me. I'm now able to work again,"" he said. The stability had also enabled him to become closer to his family and given him a sense of purpose again, he added. He said he believed he would still be homeless if it was not for the pandemic. The scheme has so far helped around 37,000 people. But figures obtained by the BBC through the Freedom of Information Act, from 174 councils that responded, have shown a disparity in the levels of long-term support provided by different local authorities. Among the top 20 best-performing councils, on average 82.5% of those helped by the scheme have been moved into supported or settled accommodation. This includes social housing, privately rented homes, longer-term placements in hostels and refuges, and self-contained accommodation with support worker visits. But in the worst-performing councils, an average of just 13% have had that same outcome. Jasmine Basran, policy manager at Crisis, said the government's decision to end its emergency funding for the scheme in May created a ""lack of clarity"" for councils. She said it meant there was no longer the nationwide approach that had proved so successful at the start of the pandemic. This led to vulnerable people's housing needs being affected by their local authority's financial situation and individual decision-making as to who remained eligible for support, she added, alongside the availability of social housing. Crisis said the government must ensure England moved away from ""a postcode lottery approach"". It has written an open letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, alongside charities The Trussell Trust and Joseph Rowntree Foundation, calling for a long-term strategy to tackle poverty and destitution. Jasmine Basran from Crisis said the government must lead the way with a clear, national strategy According to the latest government figures, of the 37,000 helped by the Everyone In scheme in England, 11,263 are currently in emergency housing. Paul, in Oxford, has been in emergency accommodation since the start of the pandemic. He said being housed had been a ""blessing"", enabling him to get better support for his medical conditions and ease his mental health problems. ""The depression began to fall away,"" he said. But he now fears that support will run out. Paul said he was worried about what would happen to him if his emergency accommodation ended Originally from Zimbabwe, he has lived in the UK for 21 years. But as he has an immigration status, there is no duty for the council to help him long-term. ""The uncertainty of not knowing what the future holds means the anxiety is starting to creep back into life,"" he said. ""[If the scheme ends] it's back to square one, isn't it?"" Minister Eddie Hughes said councils had always had to make ""difficult decisions"", but the government had been working to help ensure those with an immigration status could access support where eligible. He said its Rough Sleeper Accommodation Programme would be providing 3,000 new homes this year, and 6,000 in total. The Welsh government has said it plans to ensure all those placed in emergency accommodation during the pandemic are helped into permanent housing. Scotland has said it is ""transforming temporary accommodation by transitioning to rapid rehousing [of homeless individuals] by default"".

Hauliers 'must expect Covid test to enter UK',"Hauliers expect to have to take a Covid test when coming to the UK from mainland Europe A haulage industry source has said they have been told by the government to expect drivers to have to take a Covid test when coming into the UK from mainland Europe. The tests are expected to take place on the UK side. Lorry drivers had previously been exempt from testing coming into the UK. The Department for Transport said it was ""carefully monitoring"" an increase in cases in Europe and would keep all measures under review. Four days ago Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that a third wave of the pandemic in Europe could ""wash up on the UK's shores."" This week Germany was due to extend its lockdown over Easter due to a third wave of infections, although it soon reversed the decision. France's president Emmanuel Macron said he wanted vaccinations ""morning, noon and night"" afteran increase in intensive care cases and hospital admissions. Now, some in the haulage industry say they've been told to expect that lorry drivers will be required to take a Covid test after travelling from mainland Europe to England. France has stopped mandatory testing for haulierstravelling from the UK to France, a measure that had been in place from December due concerns about a UK variant of the disease. Hauliers travelling from the UK to Denmark, Germany or the Netherlands still require a test. The Department for Transport said: ""We are carefully monitoring the increase in cases in Europe and will keep all measures under review as we cautiously remove restrictions throughout our roadmap."" The government has been encouraging international hauliers due to be in the UK for more than 48 hours to take a free coronavirus test. Hauliers leaving the UK can also take a free test. Trade volumes with the continent declined in January due to Covid-19 restrictions and the impact of new arrangements under Brexit. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that UK goods exported to the European Union fell 40.7% in January, while imports tumbled 28.8%. Nevertheless, the Prime Minister has indicated the government might further tighten restrictions on arrivals from France, including hauliers, to stop new variants of the Covid-19 virus spreading from the rest of Europe. Britain has banned foreign travel until at least 17 May, except for essential work, education or health reasons. Ministers are due to review that position in April. Questioning the PM at the Liaison Committee on Thursday, Labour's Yvette Cooper said every week 20,000 people arrived from France, and two-thirds of them - including lorry drivers - were exempt from those restrictions.

Ex-firearms chief 'singled out' trade unionist,"Nichola Murphy is a former PSNI head of firearms and explosives The PSNI's former head of firearms and explosives singled out a member of staff because of his trade union activities, a tribunal has ruled. It awarded claimant Gavin Walsh Â£3,000 for injury to feelings after finding Nichola Murphy had made ""unfounded allegations"" about his integrity. ""We believe Ms Murphy was motivated by a desire to undermine the claimant in his Nipsa role,"" said panel members. ""He had been a thorn in her side for some months."" The tribunal panel heard the relationship between Ms Murphy and Mr Walsh became fractious and confrontational as a result of unrest and discontent within the PSNI's firearms branch. Mr Walsh had tried to resolve the issues, but this was not to the liking of senior PSNI management, including Nichola Murphy, the tribunal panel was told. The situation escalated when the claimant - who had worked for the police for more than 30 years - made an application to have his firearms certificate conditions varied. Ms Murphy mistakenly alleged he had jumped the applications' queue by using his Nipsa union role within the firearms branch to obtain preferential treatment for his application, said the tribunal. It said the allegations in an email she sent to Mr Walsh's Nipsa colleague were ""damaging and defamatory"". However, when Ms Murphy later discovered he had not sought to jump the queue, she failed to tell his Nipsa colleague. This showed ""Ms Murphy had no regard for the damage she could have caused to the claimant's reputation"", said the panel. It also questioned why another person within the firearms branch had specifically picked out Mr Walsh's application from thousands of others, and brought it to Ms Murphy's attention. The tribunal members said it was not credible that Ms Murphy could not remember which staff member had made her aware of the application form. ""As the respondent accepted, there were thousands of applications in the process and it seems more than unfortunate that the claimant's claim form was the one singled out for scrutiny in this way,"" said the panel. They described Ms Murphy's actions as ""completely inappropriate"". ""We believe that this action was only taken because the claimant is a trade union representative and its sole or main purpose was to penalise the claimant for being such a representative,"" they said. After a direct request from Ms Murphy to Nipsa, a union colleague took on Mr Walsh's trade union duties in the firearms branch, leaving him with less involvement there. ""We believe that Ms Murphy was motivated by a desire to undermine the claimant in his Nipsa role,"" said the panel members. ""He had been a thorn in her side for some months and this was an opportunity to discredit him in his role.""

UK lost 'significant' access to EU police data,"Britain has lost ""significant"" access to EU policing data under the Brexit deal negotiated at the end of last year, a House of Lords report has said. It also concluded that post-Brexit law enforcement arrangements are ""complex"" and ""untested"". And peers warned it would take much longer for vital data to be passed to frontline police officers. A government spokesman said the UK ""continues to be one of the safest countries in the world"". 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal Brexit deal 'will make UK safer', Priti Patel says New Brexit security arrangements 'a downgrade' When the UK left the EU it lost automatic access to EU databases with information on criminal records, fingerprints and wanted persons. Under a deal struck between the two sides at the end of last year, the UK secured access to certain sets of information, for example air passenger data. The Lords EU Security and Justice Sub-Committee has been examining the deal reached. It found that the agreement ""avoids a cliff-edge departure"" by ensuring data, such as DNA, fingerprints and criminal records could still be shared. Committee chairman Lord Ricketts, a former national security adviser, said the government had ""succeeded in avoiding an abrupt end to years of effective UK-EU joint working, which would have put the safety of citizens in the UK and across the EU at greater risk."" However he added that there were ""grounds for considerable caution"". He said new arrangements were ""complex and untested... and their effectiveness will depend crucially on how they are implemented at the operational level"". Specifically the report draws attention to the UK's loss of access to the EU's criminal database - the Schengen Information System (SIS II). Leaving the system meant the UK lost access to 40,000 alerts about investigations in other European countries. The committee said this represented a ""most significant gap"" for law enforcement and that the SIS II replacement meant information was available in ""a matter of hours, not seconds"". It also warned that data sharing between the sides meant the EU would hold the UK to ""higher standards"" on data protection and could suspend any agreement ""if the UK chooses not to stay aligned with EU data protection rules in the future"". Responding to the report, Home Office Minister Kevin Foster said: ""The UK agreed a comprehensive security agreement with the EU that ensures the UK continues to be one of the safest countries in the world. ""We continue to work closely with domestic and EU partners to monitor the new arrangements and have excellent cooperation with EU member states on a wide range of law enforcement and criminal justice issues.""

China sanctions UK MPs over Uighur abuses response,"Iain Duncan Smith, Nusrat Ghani and Tom Tugendhat have been banned from entering China China has imposed sanctions on nine UK citizens - including five MPs - for spreading what it called ""lies and disinformation"" about the country. The group are among the most vocal critics of China in the UK. It comes in retaliation for measures taken by the UK government on Monday over human rights abuses against the Uighur Muslim minority group. Boris Johnson said those sanctioned were ""shining a light"" on ""gross human rights violations"". ""Freedom to speak out in opposition to abuse is fundamental and I stand firmly with them,"" the prime ministersaid in a tweet,external. The foreign secretary said if Beijing wanted to ""credibly rebut"" the claims it should allow UN access to Xinjiang. Those targeted by China include former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, two peers, a lawyer and an academic. Sir Iain said he would wear the sanctions ""as a badge of honour"". The response by China follows similar sanctions imposed on the European Union, which was part of the co-ordinated action on Monday, along with the UK, the US and Canada. China has detained Uighurs at camps in the north-west region of Xinjiang, where allegations of torture, forced labour and sexual abuse have emerged. It has denied the allegations of abuse, claiming the camps are ""re-education"" facilities used to combat terrorism. Western states sanction China for Uighur 'abuses' Who are the Uighurs? Uighur camp detainees allege systematic rape Nike, H&M face China fury over Xinjiang cotton The nine people facing sanctions,externalare: Tory MPs Sir Iain, Nusrat Ghani and Tim Loughton, and peers Baroness Kennedy and Lord Alton, who are all members of the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China Tory MPs Tom Tugendhat and Neil O'Brien, who lead the China Research Group Lawyer Sir Geoffrey Nice QC, chair of the Uighur Tribunal, which is investigating atrocities against the minority group Newcastle University academic Jo Smith Finley, whose research focuses on the Uighurs They will all be banned from entering China, Hong Kong and Macau, their property in China will be frozen and Chinese citizens and institutions will be prohibited from doing business with them. Sir Iain said: ""Those of us who live free lives under the rule of law must speak for those who have no voice. If that brings the anger of China down upon me then I shall wear that as a badge of honour."" Mr Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee, told the BBC: ""I view this as a direct assault on British democracy and an attempt to silence the British people who have chosen me to speak for them."" He added that the government had been too soft on China, which he said had been ""constantly and continuously seeking to intervene"" in the internal matters of the UK. Ms Ghani told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the move was a ""wake-up call"" for democratic countries, that China would sanction law-makers who were just doing their job. She added: ""I won't be intimidated. This has now made me even more determined to speak out about the Uighurs."" Academic Dr Smith Finleytweeted:,external""I have no regrets for speaking out, and I will not be silenced."" Lord Alton said: ""The imposition of tit-for-tat sanctions is a crude attempt to silence criticism,"" adding that the ""first duty of a parliamentarian is to use their voice on behalf of those whose voices have been silenced"". This retaliation by the Chinese government was not unexpected. From the moment the UK imposed its first ever sanctions on Chinese officials earlier in the week, a response from Beijing was inevitable. But that does not mean the tit-for-tat exchange of sanctions is unimportant. It will ensure that the UK's already poor relationship with China will deteriorate further. And that matters because the government is trying to strike a balance in its relations with Beijing. In its recent foreign policy review, the UK described China as a ""systemic competitor"" and ""the biggest state-based threat to the UK's economic security"". But it also spoke of pursuing ""a positive trade and investment relationship"" and co-operating with China on climate change and biodiversity. All that just became a little harder still. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government ""stands in total solidarity"" with those sanctioned by China. ""It's not going to stop them, it's not going to stop the British government speaking up about the industrial scale human rights abuses taking place in Xinjiang,"" he told the BBC. He added that China should allow access to Xinjiang for the United Nation's commissioner for human rights if it wanted to continue with ""blanket denials"". Labour's shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy said the sanctions were a ""direct attempt to silence those who criticise the actions of the Chinese government"". She welcomed Mr Raab's condemnation of the sanctions but criticised the government's ""mixed messages"" on trade deals with China. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the UK's decision to impose sanctions ""flagrantly breaches international law and basic norms governing international relations, grossly interferes in China's internal affairs, and severely undermines China-UK relations"". He added that the Chinese foreign ministry had summoned the British Ambassador to China to ""lodge solemn representations, expressing firm opposition and strong condemnation"". A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, later told a press briefing China was forced to act ""in self-defence"" in response to UK sanctions ""based on lies"". A spokesman from the Chinese embassy in London criticised the UK's use of sanctions adding that China ""never provokes confrontation"" but if others do ""we are ready to keep them company"". China has gone for the people exerting the most pressure on Boris Johnson to be tough on China. It's gone for the people who say ""genocide"" has happened in Xinjiang. The measures are essentially tokenistic - it's unlikely these people or entities did any business with Chinese firms or people anyway. Targeting Neil O'Brien is personal for the UK prime minister. The MP is in charge of leading policy in Downing Street. Going after Essex Court Chambers - a group of self-employed barristers - for a legal opinion it reached also shows you how China views an independent judicial system. It doesn't believe in them. Four groups have also been sanctioned - the China Research Group, the Conservative Party Human Rights Commission, the Uighur Tribunal, and Essex Court Chambers. A legal opinion by senior barristers at Essex Court Chambers had concluded there was a ""very credible case"" that the Chinese government was committing genocide against the Uighurs. An Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China spokesman said: ""The decision to sanction five of our British members is a flagrant assault on those parliamentarians' rights to conduct their duties. ""We will be making urgent representations to ministers and the House authorities to see that they're protected from danger or harm as a result of the communist party's bullying."" After UK sanctions were announced on Monday, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the abuse of Uighur Muslims in Xinjiang ""one of the worst human rights crises of our time"". More than a million Uighurs and other minorities are estimated to have been detained in camps in Xinjiang. Xinjiang lies in the north-west of China and is the country's biggest region. Like Tibet, it is autonomous, meaning - in theory - it has some powers of self-governance. But in practice, both face major restrictions by the central government. Uighurs living in the region speak their own language, similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. The Chinese government has been accused of carrying out forced sterilisations on Uighur women and separating children from their families. The country initially denied the existence of the camps, before defending them as a necessary measure against terrorism. It has denied allegations of human rights abuses. China is forcing hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other minorities into hard, manual labour in the vast cotton fields of Xinjiang, according to research seen by the BBC. It's the first clear picture of the potential scale of forced labour in the picking of a crop that accounts for a fifth of the world's cotton supply and is used widely throughout the global fashion industry.

VideoJuncker: Pull back from vaccine war,"This video can not be played The European Commission and the UK government should not be discussing the distribution of coronavirus vaccines in an atmosphere of war, former president of the European Commission Jean Claude Juncker has said. While he understood the recent move of the president of the Commission to threaten export bans, it could create a major reputational damage to the European Union - which used to be the world free-trade champion - and was not the right way to act, he told BBC Hardtalk. EU leaders are holding virtual talksto discuss ways of boosting supplies of coronavirus vaccines and how they are distributed across the bloc on Thursday. The Commission is seeking added controls on exports. The UK and the EU announced they wanted to âcreate a win-win situation and expand vaccine supply for allâ earlier this week.

Suez blockage is holding up $9.6bn of goods a day,"This video can not be played A salvage company, working to free the Ever Given, says the operation could take weeks The stranded Ever Given mega-container ship in the Suez Canal is holding up an estimated $9.6bn (Â£7bn) of goods each day, according to shipping data. This works out at $400m an hour in trade along the waterway which is a vital passageway between east and west. Data from shipping expert Lloyd's List values the canal's westbound traffic at roughly $5.1bn a day, and eastbound daily traffic at around $4.5bn. Despite efforts to free the ship, it could take weeks to remove experts say. How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? Egypt's Suez Canal blocked by huge container ship In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal The Ever Given, operated by the Taiwanese company Evergreen Marine, is the length of four football pitches and one of the world's biggest container vessels. The 200,000-tonne ship is capable of carrying 20,000 containers. Its blockage is causing huge tailbacks of other ships trying to pass through the Suez Canal. The canal, which separates Africa from the Middle East and Asia, is one of the busiest trade routes in the world, with about 12% of total global trade moving through it. According to Lloyd's List tracking data there are more than 160 vessels waiting at either end of the canal. These include 41 bulk carriers and 24 crude tankers. Along with oil, the sea traffic is largely consumer products such as clothing, furniture, manufacturing components and car parts. ""We're hearing reports now that shipping companies are starting to divert their ships around the southern tip of Africa, the Cape of Good Hope, which adds about 3,500 miles to the journey and up to 12 days,"" Guy Platten, the secretary general of the International Chamber of Shipping, told the BBC's Today programme. He said the ship appeared to be ""hard fast aground"", adding that freeing the vessel from the bank was taking much longer and was more complicated than had been initially expected. Mr Platten added there would be ""some major real-world effects on the supply chain"", explaining that consumers would would ultimately bear the cost. The Ever Givenhad been scheduled to arrive in the port of Felixstowe,externalin early April. Container ships have nearly doubled in size in the past decade as global trade expands, making the job of moving them much harder when they get stuck. ""What are we thinking? Have vessels gotten too large? Containers being jettisoned overboard, delayed transits due to terminal congestion and let us not forget the long line of vessels at many ports waiting for a berth,"" said Jon Monroe, who runs his own ocean transportation consultancy. Work continues on freeing the Ever Given mega-container ship. BIMCO, an international shipping association, says the delays will only continue to grow and affect supplies. ""For each day of delay my thought is it will take two days to undo the delays,"" said Alan Baer, president of logistics provider OL USA. ""Right now three days creates six days of ongoing delays.  I'm not sure this is a perfect formula, but it will be close,"" he told the BBC. In addition to delaying thousands of containers loaded with consumer items, the stranded ship has also tied up empty containers which are needed for exports. If the delays are short, most companies will absorb the extra delay in transit times. But salvage officials said the congestion could last days or even weeks, in a blow to global supply chains already strained by the Covid-19 pandemic. Some companies will be considering flying replacement merchandise for higher value products, or transporting them via trains. Two major shipping companies, Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd, said they are looking into options to avoid the Suez Canal. Egypt's Suez Canal Authority (SCA) said it was doing all it could to refloat the ship with tug boats, dredgers and heavy earth-moving equipment. Kitack Lim, secretary general of the International Maritime Organisation, said: "" I am aware of the implications of the temporary closure of the canal, and I ask for patience from stakeholders across the supply chain as everyone works to ensure that the ship, its crew, its cargo and the environment remain protected.""

US and UK ratchet up sanctions on Myanmar's military,"As violence against Myanmar's civilians mounts, Western powers have been ratcheting up economic pressure on the country's military following its internationally condemned coup on 1 February. The US and UK, for instance, have imposed sanctions on Myanmar's two military conglomerates - Myanmar Economic Corporation (MEC) and Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd (MEHL) - which control significant portions of Myanmar's economy and have interests across many major industries. The US Treasury Department has also blocked assets and transactions with Myanmar's state-run gem company, a key source of income for the military authorities, while the EU has imposed sanctions on several individuals linked to the military. Human rights groups and democracy activists have long pushed for sanctions, arguing that they fund the military's repression of protesters. More than 600 people have been killed by security forces since the coup began. ""These actions will specifically target those who led the coup, the economic interests of the military, and the funding streams supporting the Burmese military's brutal repression,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said. ""They are not directed at the people of Burma."" But while the West, most notably the US, has been keen to take the lead in imposing sanctions, Myanmar's biggest trade partners in Asia have rejected that approach. Can Asia help Myanmar find a way out of coup crisis? Critics worry that the uneven pressure won't be enough to force change. ""The leverage is not really there,"" said Richard Horsey, a Myanmar expert with the International Crisis Group. One example that lays out the complexity of imposing sanctions and enforcing them is Golden City, a Yangon mixed-use development with an unobstructed view of the city's most famous landmark Schwedagon Pagoda. The activist group Justice for Myanmar says the development is a cash cow for Myanmar's military that channels millions into the military department ""which buys weapons of war that are used on the people of Myanmar in the commission of war crimes and crimes against humanity."" Singapore-listed company Emerging Towns and Cities (ETC) - which owns a 49% stake in the development through a number of local companies - halted trading in February after Justice for Myanmar published the allegations, and the stock exchange demanded the company explain its part in the project. The company admits its partner in Myanmar has ties to the military. It makes lease payments for Golden City into an account administered by the Quartermaster General's Office, which reports to the Ministry of Defence. But ETC denies those funds could have been used to commit human rights abuses, saying that under Myanmar law, the Quartermaster General must turn over all funds to the government's budget account. And it told the Singapore stock exchange (SGX) that's where its responsibilities end. ""The company is entitled to assume that the application of funds administered by Myanmar government ministries is in conformity with existing provisions of Myanmar law, and as such, makes no comment on the actual use of the lease payments it is obligated to make,"" ETC said in its responses to questions from the SGX. Aung San Suu Kyi appears in Myanmar court on video Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Myanmar army sacks UN envoy after anti-coup speech The company suspended trading in early March on the Singapore exchange while it seeks out an ""independent"" review to clarify its dealings in Myanmar to investors. ETC declined interview requests, and Myanmar's embassy in Singapore didn't respond to requests for comment. The row over the development is a reflection of the fragmented international response to the 1 February coup.  Activists might cause headaches for ETC, but the company can't be in breach of sanctions because Singapore hasn't imposed any. Both critics and proponents of a tougher approach agree that up until now the sanctions  - which only targeted Myanmar's top brass - have been fairly weak. ""The Myanmar military are not going to fall down on the floor, cry and say 'oh my god, I've lost my visa to the US, my life is over'. They'll probably laugh,"" said Kishore Mahbubani, a former Singapore diplomat and a Distinguished Fellow at the Asia Research Institute at the National University of Singapore. More broadly, sanctions as a policy tool have a patchy record. Researchers from the Peterson Institute for International Economics (PIIE) evaluated over 200 cases and found thatonly a third were a complete or partial success,external. Others using the same data putthe hit rate at just 5%,external, arguing the PIIE researchers were too generous in their definition of success. Their track record in Myanmar - which was not part of the PIIE study - is hotly debated. Some say they played a key role in forcing the military regime to release Aung San Suu Kyi and reopen the country a decade ago, while others say they either weren't significant or only made a difference after the ruling junta decided to change course. Gary Hufbauer, who led the PIIE's research, said sanctions tend to have a higher chance of success against poor countries like Myanmar. But they tend to be most successful when the goals are modest, the target countries are not autocratic, and they lack external ""black knights"" who might throw their economy a lifeline. Previous sanctions on Myanmar have had a humanitarian impact. For example, the US state departmentestimated that a 2003 US ban,externalon Burmese textile imports cost 50-60,000 jobs (although orders from the EU mitigated the effect). This video can not be played Protester Thuta says he is prepared to die in the fight to restore democracy to Myanmar. Mr Horsey worries that ordinary people rather than the government could again pay the price, especially if the sanctions turn into a broader attempt to bankrupt the state.  But human rights groups say the current sanctions are more targeted than those Myanmar faced previously, and point out that democracy activists in Myanmar are themselves boycotting military-linked companies. ""We're not doing anything that the Myanmar people aren't doing themselves,"" said Phil Robertson of Human Rights Watch. If sanctions are aimed at hurting the military without shutting down the economy, the question then becomes whether or not foreign businesses can still operate in Myanmar while tiptoeing around the two conglomerates. Htwe Htwe Thein, an Associate Professor of International Business at Curtin University in Perth, said the two businesses are not all-encompassing, and many consumer goods companies could probably continue to operate. But the same isn't true for Myanmar's resources sector. ""The ownership of the military is rampant in there. It's everywhere in the extractive sector,"" she said. But if sanctions force western oil and gas companies to withdraw, Mr Horsey expects that businesses from China or Thailand would replace them. ""If companies like Woodside and Total are forced to divest, they're going to have to sell off their assets rather cheaply, and it's pretty obvious who's going to buy them up,"" said Mr Horsey. China and Thailand account for more than half of the country's trade volume, while Singapore is the single largest foreign investor, generating $11bn over the past five years according to Myanmar government figures. While the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) has called for a peaceful resolution to the crisis, the group has flatly rejected sanctions. Mr Mahbubani argues that quiet diplomacy behind the scenes could accomplish more. ""It's the southeast Asian way of avoiding confrontation. And frankly, you have to acknowledge that has kept Southeast Asia at peace for 30, 40 years now, finding diplomatic solutions, talking to each other and changing people's minds,"" he said. Phil Robertson attributes Asean's reluctance to self-interest. ""If it was left to Asean, nothing would happen at all,"" he said. ""And the idea that they're somehow going to be part of the solution is rather laughable"". Mr Mahbubani sees it very differently. He thinks the west's brash, critical approach during the Rohingya crisis, loudly condemning Aung San Suu Kyi for her reluctance to act, may have convinced the military that they could move against her because she no longer had allies. And he thinks it's unlikely that sanctions will change their mind now. ""They are very stubborn people. The more public pressure you put on them, the more they'll dig their heels in,"" he said.
