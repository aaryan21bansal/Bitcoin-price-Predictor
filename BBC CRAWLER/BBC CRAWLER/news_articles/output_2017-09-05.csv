Man's date gets trapped retrieving poo,"This video can not be played Ever had a date that ended like this? A woman who threw her poo out of her date's toilet window because it ""would not flush"" had to be rescued after she got stuck trying to retrieve it. The amateur gymnast was on a first date with Bristol student Liam Smith when she ""panicked"" and threw the faeces out of the window. It did not land in the garden, but became wedged between two non-opening windows. After climbing in head first after it, she became wedged. Mr Smith had to call the fire service for help. The story appeared on a crowdfunding page, set up by the University of Bristol student.

""We'd had a really nice evening,"" he said. ""We'd had a meal at a well-known chicken restaurant, had a few beers and then gone back to mine for a bottle of wine and a film."" After the fire service had ""composed themselves,"" Mr Smith said they set to work freeing his date from the window He said the woman went to the toilet and when she came back she had a ""panicked look in her eye"" and told him what she had done. He said the toilet window opened into a narrow gap separated by another double glazed window. ""It was into this twilight zone that my date had thrown her poo,"" he said. He went to find a hammer to smash the window, but she decided to ""climb in head first"" after the ""offending package"" and became jammed. ""I was starting to grow concerned, so I called the fire brigade and once they had composed themselves, they set to work removing her from the window."" Liam Smith relived the post-Nando's incident in a BBC interview The ""offending package"" was trapped between two ""non-opening"" double glazed windows Although the woman was rescued unharmed, Mr Smith said his bathroom window was destroyed. ""I'm not complaining, they did what they had to do,"" he said. ""Problem is, I've been quoted north of Â£300 to replace the window and as a postgraduate student, that is a significant chunk of my monthly budget."" Mr Smith originally set a crowdfunding target of Â£200, but has already raised more than Â£1,200. He said he and his date had decided to split the extra cash between two charities, one supporting firefighters and another that builds and maintains flushing toilets in developing countries. Unsurprisingly, the woman does not want to be named but Mr Smith said he had seen her since and ""who knows what the future holds"". ""We had a lovely night on the second date but it's too early to say if she's the one. But we got on very very well and she's a lovely girl,"" he said. ""And we've already got the most difficult stuff out of the way first."" Avon Fire and Rescue service confirmed it had received a call and freed a woman trapped between external and double glazing.

People seek shelter from Hurricane Irma,"This video can not be played Alison Strand told the BBC about the ""dangerous conditions"" in Anguilla Hurricane Irma, the most powerful Atlantic storm in a decade, has hit the Caribbean, with officials warning of its ""potentially catastrophic"" effects. The category five hurricane, the highest possible level, has sustained wind speeds reaching 300km/h (185mph). It first hit Antigua and Barbuda, before moving on to Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin. It is then expected to move on towards Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. In the US, Florida's Key West area has ordered a mandatory evacuation.

The mainland has not been hit by two category four hurricanes in one season since the storms were first recorded in 1851. Texan officials told the Associated Press that 60 people are dead, or are feared dead, from Hurricane Harvey. Not all of these are confirmed. A string of US stars, including BeyoncÃ©, George Clooney and Oprah Winfrey, have reportedly signed up to take part in a fundraising telethon for victims. Hurricane Harvey Relief will air on 12 September. Meanwhile, a third tropical storm, Jose, has formed further out in the Atlantic behind Irma, and is expected to become a hurricane by later on Wednesday, according to the US National Hurricane Center.

UK plan to 'curb low-skilled EU workers',"An estimated 250,000 nationals of other EU countries came to the UK last year Proposals aimed at cutting the numbers of low-skilled migrants from Europe following Brexit have been disclosed in a leaked Home Office paper. The document,obtained by The Guardian,external, suggests free movement will end upon exit in March 2019 and the UK will adopt a ""more selective approach"" based on the UK's economic and social needs. Access to labour in industries without shortages may be curbed, it suggests. The BBC understands the document has not been signed off by ministers. A spokesman for the government said it did not comment on ""leaked draft"" documents. They said ministers would be setting out their ""initial proposals"" for a new immigration system ""which takes back control of the UK's borders"" later in the autumn. Davis: Big differences over Brexit bill EU warning over Irish border post-Brexit EU citizen detention letters sent in error Downing Street has long maintained that the current right of EU citizens to live and work in the UK will come to an end on the day that the UK leaves the 28-member bloc. It is also likely that there will be an implementation period to minimise disruption to businesses and to the public services, many of which are heavily reliant on European labour. However, details of the likely shape of the UK's post-Brexit immigration policy remain hazy with a proposed immigration bill, one of eight pieces of Brexit-related legislation, yet to be published. The Home Office document obtained by the Guardian, entitled the Border, Immigration and Citizenship System After the UK Leaves the EU, is marked extremely sensitive and dated August 2017. Among the ideas set out, the 82-page document suggests low-skilled migrants would be offered residency for a maximum of two years while those in ""high-skilled occupations"" would be granted permits to work for a longer period of three to five years. Employers would be encouraged to focus recruitment on ""resident labour"" and EU nationals could be required to seek permission before taking up a job. While there would be no new border checks on entering the country, all EU citizens will be required to show a passport. ""The government will take a view on the economic and social needs of the country as regards EU migration, rather than leaving this decision entirely to those wishing to come here and employers,"" it states. It also floats the idea of ending the right to settle in Britain for most European migrants and placing new restrictions on their rights to bring in family members. Reality Check: Brexit catch-up Reality Check: Migration to the UK The new measures, it indicates, would only come fully into force at the end of a transition period, which could last up to three years. It is understood that the document is a draft, unfinished version of an upcoming White Paper circulated among senior officials and that there have been at least five earlier versions. A leading campaigner for tougher migration controls said the document's thinking was ""excellent news"". ""Uncontrolled migration from the EU simply cannot be allowed to continue,"" said Lord Green, chairman of Migration Watch. ""These proposals rightly focus on low-skilled migration and by doing so could reduce net migration from the EU by 100,000 a year over time. ""This would be an important step to achieving the government's immigration target."" UKIP also welcomed the proposals, saying they should be implemented ""without fudging"" and prioritise the needs of communities up and down the country as well as those of workers and businesses. However, Labour MP Yvette Cooper said the document appeared to fly in the face of Home Secretary Amber Rudd's commitment earlier this summer to consult on a post-Brexit immigration system. ""The process for developing its policy seems to be completely confused. What assessment has been done of the impact or the interrelationship between immigration proposals and any trade or single market deal?"" The TUC said the ""back of the envelope plans"" would ""create an underground economy, encouraging bad bosses to exploit migrants and undercut decent employers offering good jobs"". The government has said it is sticking by its target of cutting levels of net migration from about 250,000 last year to less than 100,000 despite calls from the opposition and some Conservative MPs for it to be dropped.

Universities want rethink on student costs,"More than a hundred universities are calling for a rethink on the costs for poorer students in England. Universities UK says ministers should look again at grants for living costs and interest rates for some graduates. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable told the BBC the existing system was ""politically difficult to sustain"". Ministers have defended current tuition fees of Â£9,250 a year as providing sustainable funding for universities and fairness for graduates. Universities UK, which represents higher education bodies, says the government must show it is listening to students. It says the main concern for young people is ""money in their pocket"" while they are studying. Vice chancellors are meeting this week amid growing political concern that the system no longer feels fair to young people. Prof Janet Beer, the new president of Universities UK, will call on ministers to look again at maintenance grants for students most in need of help with living costs. In England, grants for living costs were scrapped last year and replaced with loans,leading to predictions that students from the poorest families would have the largest debts. The Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated this would add up to debts of Â£57,000 for students from low income families. In an interview with the BBC, Prof Beer said: ""We've done a poor job at explaining the good things in the system, but there are things that can be looked at again, the threshold for repayment, interest rates and maintenance grants."" The board of Universities UK met on Tuesday and agreed to press ministers to look again at some aspects of the overall cost of a university education. The government has confirmed that from this autumn, a new higher interest rate of 6.1% will be levied on student tuition fee loans, calculated as RPI +3%. Now universities are calling for a rethink from ministers on the interest charges for some graduates. Universities UK has decided to call for different thresholds for interest rates for graduates that go on to become low or middle earners. Sir Vince Cable says ""we are already seeing the beginnings of a revolt"" Sir Vince oversawthe introduction of Â£9,000 tuition feesin government as business secretary. He still defends the principle of graduates contributing through their higher earnings to the funding of universities. But speaking exclusively to me this week he said: ""The system is becoming politically difficult to sustain."" The significant vote by young people for Labour - whose policy is to replace tuition fees with direct government subsidy to universities - has shifted the political landscape. Sir Vince said: ""We are already seeing the beginnings of a revolt."" And he signalled that other ways of taxing graduate wealth might need to be considered to make the system fairer. ""Those of us involved in trying to create a fairer system in the past have got to be willing to reopen some of the basic questions about how the system operates. The interest fixing is bizarre, economically nonsensical."" He also wants to see more support for living costs for students and better help for those who go through further education. Only the highest paid graduates are expected to pay off their tuition fee loans in full before the 30-year term expires. The rest is written off by the government, but unlike funding universities from current spending, the final bill does not appear as part of government borrowing. Jo Johnson, the minister for higher education, has argued that the fact many graduates do not repay their loans in full is not a sign of failure. In a speech earlier in the summer, he said the sharing of costs between students and the state was ""a conscious investment in the skills base of the country, not a symptom of a broken student finance system."" The government has to decide within weeks whether to confirm the inflation-linked increase in fees to about Â£9,500 expected by universities in England for 2018/19. Universities now rely heavily on the income from tuition fees, as the almost tripling of fees to Â£9,000 in 2012 coincided with the withdrawal of direct government funding.

Why I gave up being vegan,"Why are some people coming back from a vegan diet? ""Vegan food has got so much better in recent years,"" according to Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader says ""more and more"" of his friends are choosing the diet, which excludes all food that comes from animals - such as meat, dairy and eggs. And whilst cheese may be keeping him from fully committing, he is ""going through the process"" of making different food choices. But whilst some people are happy to go the whole hog - and leave the hog behind them - some vegans are making the choice to return to the meat market. John Nicholson and his partner became vegans in 1984, at the age of 23, when living on a farm in the north of Scotland. But 26 years later, the couple decided to return to eating meat for what they believed was the good of their health. ""We used to see the cattle being taken away to go to the slaughter house and the both of us thought we should stop,"" he said. ""Back then, we really did have to research what to eat. ""We started looking at Eastern and Indian food and were really expanding our cultural horizons from our bringing-up in the North East. ""And soon after, the government came out to speak about healthy eating - which it hadn't really before - so we thought, great, we are taking the moral choice and the healthy choice."" But as the years went by, the couple saw their health deteriorate and wondered what might be the cause. ""I suffered from IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) for 17 years,"" said John. ""Every time I ate, my stomach would get distended and it would be like a shelf you could put your glass on. ""Anything I ate would then leave me very quickly and some days it was so bad that I couldn't leave the house."" He also started to put on a lot of weight - standing at 5ft 10in (1.78m) but weighing 15st - and had the ""highest cholesterol in North Yorkshire"", according to his GP. At the same time, his partner was suffering with depression and a slow thyroid, and they both wanted to make a change. ""She said to me it was not what we were eating, but what we weren't eating, and making that change might make a difference. ""I was very cynical about it, but I wanted to support her."" The impact was almost immediate. Within 48 hours, John started to feel better and his IBS all but disappeared, and, for his partner, there was a marked improvement. John Nicholson in 2010 whilst he was a vegan (left), compared with after he returned to eating meat ""When you have been a vegan for 26 years, it becomes part of your identity,"" he said. ""I was worried that I must have been shallow, but me and my partner had talked long into the night about it and we just came to the decision that we wanted to put our health above that of the animals."" The pair are still against industrial farming practices and ethically source their meat from farms, choosing free range and organic produce. ""I think about what my grandma would have said to people being vegan,"" said John. ""She would have called it self-indulgent nonsense. ""But her generation knew how to feed themselves for where they were from and how they were made. Who am I to go against these generations of wisdom? ""What we are doing here is just going back to how things used to be before we got funny about our food and before processed food."" Estelle Silver had been a vegan for eight years before she made the switch back to eating meat. Little did she know it would also seem to help with her health problems. ""I went vegan because I was told I had a dairy sensitivity,"" she said. ""I had already been a strict vegetarian for 20 years and had wanted to become vegan anyway due to my feelings about animal abuse and farming methods, so it was a convenient excuse for me to take that final step."" To start with, Estelle was pleased with the effects as it helped clear up her skin - a problem she had faced since her 20s - but as time went on, she became tired, less able to cope with stress and developed anxiety. ""I became a bag of nerves whenever I went out and could barely speak to people, just clinging to my then-boyfriend all night,"" she said. ""I didn't make the connection with diet and so I stuck with it because ethically I felt so much better not supporting the animal food industry, and I had convinced myself that it was a healthy diet."" Estelle Silver went vegan after she was told she had a dairy sensitivity Eight years on, Estelle began craving meat and fish, and she started to have ""little cheat treats"". ""It was like my body was really grateful and I felt better every time I ate a bit of meat,"" she said. Later that year, she was diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), and a support group told her eating meat and fish would help her symptoms. ""Since then my health has improved hugely and my anxiety has completely gone,"" said Estelle. ""From an ethical point of view, I wish I could live without animal products, but I no longer believe that a vegan diet is a healthy one - my body just can't cope with it."" According to the NHS,external, vegans should be able to get all the nutrients they need if they eat a varied and balanced diet, and plan ahead. It suggests eating your five a day, basing meals on starchy carbohydrates - such as potatoes, rice and pasta - and having dairy alternatives, like soya drinks. But without monitoring what you eat, the NHS said vegans could miss out on important dietary elements, such as calcium, iron and B12. Heather Russell, a dietitian with the Vegan Society, said the group was working with the British Dietetic Association to get the message of planning out to people. ""As a vegan, you can enjoy delicious and nutritious food whilst making a really compassionate lifestyle choice,"" she said. ""It is possible to get all the nutrients your body needs from a vegan diet. ""If you need individual support regarding your vegan diet, it's a good idea to ask your doctor for a referral to a dietitian."" For Carrie Eddins, she believes her change in diet has improved her life. She has been a vegetarian since she was 10, but 18 months ago, at the age of 40, she decided to go vegan. ""I decided to make the change because the dairy industry upsets me and broke my heart,"" she said. ""And I was feeling sluggish from milk, and eggs."" Carrie Eddins says she feels ""sharper and calmer"" after going vegan Since cutting these out of her diet, Carrie said she has ""never felt better"", with improved digestion and a feeling that she is ""sharper"" and ""calmer."" Carrie now has to check menus more and carry around a pot of coconut oil to use as butter. When first making the change, she also admitted she felt very tired and had to have B12 vitamin patches to ""balance the system out"". ""But it works like a charm,"" said Carrie, ""much better than coffee."" Jeremy Corbyn and other vegetarian politicians Is going vegan for January worth it?

Travel disruption as Irma approaches,"This video can not be played The view inside Hurricane Irma Caribbean travel plans have been thrown into chaos as flights are disrupted by Hurricane Irma sweeping across the region towards the US coast. Irma, coming days after the US was hit by Hurricane Harvey, has been upgraded to a category five, the highest. Puerto Rico, a major flight transfer hub for the region, has declared a state of emergency. British Airways cancelled a flight from the UK on Tuesday and, with Virgin Atlantic, changed return schedules. On Tuesday, British Airways cancelled its flight to Antigua, which was then due to continue to Tobago. BA sent an empty aircraft to Antigua to bring travellers home early. The full flight of 326 passengers left the island early evening on Tuesday, UK time. Antigua's airport will be closed on Wednesday. ""The safety of our customers and crew is always our priority,"" BA said in statement. ""We have offered all customers due to travel to the region in the coming days a range of re-booking options and are keeping our flights to the entire region under review."" Virgin has brought forward its flight from Antigua to the UK by five hours. A spokesman said the airline was monitoring the strength and direction of Irma before changing more schedules. ""We may need to make some changes or cancellations,"" he said, and urged customers to check with the airline before travelling. Flights between many of the islands, which include the Dominican Republic, Guadeloupe, and the British Virgin Islands, have been cancelled. On Tuesday, American Airlines cancelled its schedules to the islands of St Kitts and St Maarten, Hurricane Irma 'extremely dangerous' Texas recovery from Harvey 'could cost $180bn' For Wednesday, Puerto Rico's San Juan airport has cancelled 85 flights, about 40% of services. The island's governor Ricardo Rossellodescribed the hurricane as ""something without precedent"". The US Virgin Islands' seaports were closed to everything except essential traffic. The threat of Irma to cruise ship tourism hit shares in big operators including Carnival, Norwegian Cruise Line, and Royal Caribbean Cruises. Their shares fell between 3%-4%. One hotelier on Antigua told the Reuters news agency that his property's window were being boarded up and that coconuts were being stripped from trees. ""I wasn't that nervous yesterday, but today I'm nervous,"" said Gary Randall, head of the Blue Waters Resort. He expected the beach to be swept away and the hotel to be flooded. Shares in insurance companies with an exposure to Florida slid as investors weighed up the likely financial impact of Irma. Heritage Insurance and Universal Insurance both fell more than 15%. TheNational Hurricane Center,external(NHC) said on Tuesday that Irma was ""potentially catastrophic"". It said the hurricane was currently on track to hit the northern Leeward Islands early on Wednesday, and possibly the Florida Keys by the weekend. Florida has also declared an emergency.

Davis: Big differences over Brexit bill,"Mr Davis said any financial settlement must accord with the law and a ""spirit"" of future partnership The differences between the UK and EU over the Brexit ""divorce bill"" remain significant, David Davis has said. The Brexit Secretary told MPs the UK was rigorously vetting the EU's demands and the two sides had ""very different legal stances"" over what was owed. While overall talks were proving ""tough and at times confrontational"", he said he hoped they could be widened to open dialogue on trade after October. Labour said ""fantasy was meeting brutal reality"" in what was achievable. The UK has said it is ready to ""intensify"" talks about the EU's exit - due to take effect in March 2019 -  rather than stick to its one-week-a-month schedule. EU officials have warned over the progress of negotiations and said the UK must ""start negotiating seriously"". Brexit: All you need to know Parliament Live: House of Commons What is the repeal bill? What is at stake in EU-UK talks? Updating MPs on the most recent round of talks as Parliament returned from the summer recess, Mr Davis said ""concrete progress"" had been made over the summer in areas such as protecting the rights of British expats in the EU to access healthcare and over the future of the Irish border. Characterising the UK's approach to the negotiations as ""much more flexible and pragmatic"" than the EU's, he said he still hoped ""if possible"" that a summit of EU leaders in October would decide to extend the talks to discuss the UK's future relationship with the EU. On the issue of money, while the UK and the EU would honour their ""financial obligations to each other on exit"", he said the EU was trying to use the tight timetable for concluding negotiations to pressure the UK into agreeing a deal. ""It is clear that the two sides have very different legal stances,"" he said. ""(EU chief negotiator) Michel Barnier and I agreed that we do not anticipate making incremental progress on the final shape of the financial deal in every round ... it is also clear there are significant differences to be bridged in this sector."" The UK would not be bounced into an agreement, he added. ""Does Labour want to pay Â£100bn to get progress in the next month?"", he told MPs. ""I hope not. We will do this the proper way."" European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said the final divorce bill could be around 60bn euros (Â£55bn) but Mr Davis has dismissed reports the UK secretly agreed a figure of up to Â£50bn. But shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the slow progress was ""becoming a real cause for concern"" and there would be serious consequences if talks on trade were pushed back. Critics of Brexit say the UK's assumptions are unrealistic ""Too many promises have been made about Brexit that cannot be kept"", he said. ""The Secretary of State has just said nobody was pretending that it would be easy - Mr Speaker, they were pretending it would be easy."" Former Conservative Chancellor Ken Clarke urged the government to remain in the single market and customs union during any Brexit transitional period, a position also supported by Labour. But Mr Davis said that while there was consensus for the need for an implementation period to bed in the changes, the UK was seeking entirely separate but parallel arrangements on customs and trade. Tory backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg warned the EU against demanding money ""with menaces"", saying it was ridiculous for the EU to seek a ""dowry"" from a country that was a net beneficiary to its budget. The minister's update comes as MPs prepare to debate for the first time the government's EU withdrawal bill, which will transfer existing EU legislation into domestic UK law. Labour has already announced it will vote against the bill at second reading - the first stage of its passage through the Commons - on Monday because they think it will allow ministers to ""grab powers from Parliament to slash rights at work and reduce protection for consumers and the environment"". It has also been suggested that some pro-EU Conservative MPs could back Labour attempts to make changes to the bill. Mr Davis said anyone actively opposing the bill would have to answer to their constituents, insisting that the legislation was a ""practical bill designed to protect the interests of British business and British citizens - that is what it is there for, nothing else"". Over the summer break, Labour changed its position to back the single market and customs union for a four-year transition period. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his MPs ""will not allow this government to destroy parliamentary democracy by giving themselves unlimited powers"". But, speaking in the Commons, Labour MP Kate Hoey said that while it was reasonable for details of the withdrawal bill to be scrutinised in committee, anyone voting against the principle of the legislation would be ""betraying the will"" of the people. The Scottish National Party, the third largest party in the Commons with 35 MPs, urged Labour to work with it to oppose the EU Withdrawal Bill. The SNP's Stephen Gethins said: ""This debate is about more than just one party or one part of the UK. It is up to parties and MPs from across these islands and the political spectrum to come together and work for a better deal and hold the Government to account.""

First date gets trapped retrieving poo,"This video can not be played Ever had a date that ended like this? A woman who threw her poo out of her date's toilet window because it ""would not flush"" had to be rescued after she got stuck trying to retrieve it. The amateur gymnast was on a first date with Bristol student Liam Smith when she ""panicked"" and threw the faeces out of the window. It did not land in the garden, but became wedged between two non-opening windows. After climbing in head first after it, she became wedged. Mr Smith had to call the fire service for help. The story appeared on a crowdfunding page, set up by the University of Bristol student. If this story yanks your chain, you might also like these: Tales of your worst dates Woman 'teleported' inside toilet Boy finds python lurking in toilet Hapless burglar caught stuck in window Mr Smith, who is raising funds to fix his broken window, wrote that he was on a Tinder date with the woman and they went back to the shared house he lives in. ""We'd had a really nice evening,"" he said. ""We'd had a meal at a well-known chicken restaurant, had a few beers and then gone back to mine for a bottle of wine and a film."" After the fire service had ""composed themselves,"" Mr Smith said they set to work freeing his date from the window He said the woman went to the toilet and when she came back she had a ""panicked look in her eye"" and told him what she had done. He said the toilet window opened into a narrow gap separated by another double glazed window. ""It was into this twilight zone that my date had thrown her poo,"" he said. He went to find a hammer to smash the window, but she decided to ""climb in head first"" after the ""offending package"" and became jammed. ""I was starting to grow concerned, so I called the fire brigade and once they had composed themselves, they set to work removing her from the window."" Liam Smith relived the post-Nando's incident in a BBC interview The ""offending package"" was trapped between two ""non-opening"" double glazed windows Although the woman was rescued unharmed, Mr Smith said his bathroom window was destroyed. ""I'm not complaining, they did what they had to do,"" he said. ""Problem is, I've been quoted north of Â£300 to replace the window and as a postgraduate student, that is a significant chunk of my monthly budget."" Mr Smith originally set a crowdfunding target of Â£200, but has already raised more than Â£1,200. He said he and his date had decided to split the extra cash between two charities, one supporting firefighters and another that builds and maintains flushing toilets in developing countries. Unsurprisingly, the woman does not want to be named but Mr Smith said he had seen her since and ""who knows what the future holds"". ""We had a lovely night on the second date but it's too early to say if she's the one. But we got on very very well and she's a lovely girl,"" he said. ""And we've already got the most difficult stuff out of the way first."" Avon Fire and Rescue service confirmed it had received a call and freed a woman trapped between external and double glazing.

How much leverage does China have over North Korea?,"The People's Republic of China, a country averse to binding, treaty-based commitments, has always enjoyed a particular relationship with its small, north-eastern neighbour. North Korea is the only country with which China has a legally binding mutual aid and co-operation treaty, signed in July 1961. There are only seven articles in the document. The second is the most important: ""The contracting parties undertake jointly to adopt all measures to prevent aggression against either of the contracting parties by any state. ""In the event of one of the contracting parties being subjected to the armed attack by any state or several states jointly and thus being involved in a state of war, the other contracting party shall immediately render military and other assistance by all means at its disposal."" In essence, therefore, if there is a simple answer to the question of what China would need to do if North Korea is unilaterally attacked by another power - say the US or South Korea - this sentence supplies the answer. It would, according to this treaty, be obliged to become involved - and on the North Koreans' side. This, more than anything else, shows the ways in which history continues to frame the relationship between the two. We have a very powerful precedent here. Even before the treaty in 1950, China committed a million troops to the Korean War once United Nations forces were involved. In defence of the North as a client state and buffer zone, it is more than likely to commit its much more formidable military assets. This agreement still stands, despite the immense changes to China since the period in which it was signed. A million Chinese troops were involved on North Korea's side in the Korean War After the death of Mao in 1976, the country shifted from its adherence to a utopian version of socialism, and undertook widespread reforms. These resulted in the hybrid, complex system the country has today. Its economy and geopolitical prominence have burgeoned. For North Korea, things have been different. Tepid attempts at controlled reform over the past three decades have had little success. In the early 2000s, the Chinese hosted its former leader, the late Kim Jong-Il, and showed him special economic zones in Shanghai and examples of how to create a manufacturing, export-orientated economy servicing the capitalist West but maintaining its Marxist-Leninist system. China censors discussion of North Korea's bomb test Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? North Korea crisis in 300 words North Korea: What can the outside world do? The attempt at persuasion evidently fell on deaf ears. North Korea's unique Juche ideology - a pure form of nationalism - meant that it resisted any attempts to copy models from elsewhere. To this day, the market, if it exists in North Korea in any shape or form, is highly circumscribed and geared towards supporting the country's military aims and regime survival. China's great points of leverage these days are trade, aid and energy. As the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, North Korea's most important patron vanished almost overnight. Since that point, the reliance on China has increased to the extent that is now almost a monopoly. Some 80% of the country's oil comes from its neighbour. Coal exports into China were immensely important - until sanctions stopped them in July last year after provocative behaviour. China has stuck to this agreement, with precipitous collapses in the North Korean economy in the ensuing year. Late North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il with former Chinese President Hu Jintao (R) in Beijing in January 2006 Almost all of North Korea's exports are either to China, or through China to elsewhere. Some 90% of its aid comes from China. China is the only country it has air links with, and a rail line into. It was, until the mid-2000s, the only country, too, whose banks had relations with North Korean counterparts, through accounts in Macau in particular. Monies here were frozen in a previous spate of sanctions. Even so, one of the new targets of UN-backed measures is Chinese banks, which continue, mostly indirectly, to deal with embargoed North Korean companies or intermediaries. The main point of Chinese leverage over North Korea is widely believed to be its oil. Stopping this would lead to an immediate, dramatic economic impact. A few years ago, for a matter of days, the oil pipes into North Korea were closed, around the time of a previous nuclear test. China has, therefore, been willing to flex its muscles here. North Korea's military consumes 25% of the country's GDP But wholesale stopping of the supply, rather than temporary glitches, is a different matter. Many believe this would trigger regime crisis, or even collapse. After all, the North Koreans are already living in a subsistence economy. Taking away this final lifeline could be fatal. There are powerful counter-arguments, however, that say things would not be so straightforward. North Korea devotes 25% of its GDP (gross domestic product) to military activity. The oil stocks there would last a few months. And that would give it time to embark on the devastating assault southwards that everyone fears, into the highly populated regions of South Korea. It would be a suicidal mission, but as the world knows from plenty of other examples, handling those with suicide on their minds is the greatest challenge. Nor would North Korea be compliant in other areas as it collapsed. Refugees would swarm across the border into China. A vacuum would appear. China would be faced with its worst nightmare - a space which the US and its allies might try to occupy. For all its seeming points of leverage and influence, therefore, the most remarkable thing about China and North Korea is the ways in which, at a time when the rest of the world is agonising over how to deal with a renascent, confident, powerful-looking China, this narrative is so brutally undermined by the ways in which its small, impoverished neighbour almost daily exposes its impotence. This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.

Drug bag 'exploded' in student's stomach,"Rebecca Brock (right) was found unresponsive in her room by hotel staff A teenager died in an Ibiza hotel room after a bag of ecstasy ""exploded"" in her stomach, an inquest heard. Rebecca Brock, 18, from Nottinghamshire was found unresponsive in her room by hotel staff in September 2015, the city's coroners' court was told. Spanish police began an investigation after the amount of the drug in her system was double the fatal dose level. Rebecca's mother Margarita said her daughter may have been forced to swallow the bag of drugs. Coroner Mairin Casey concluded the law student's death was ""drug-related"". Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands Rebecca's body was discovered at the Hotel Marco Polo on 28 September after she had travelled to the island for a friend's birthday. Her mother told the inquest that a medical examiner in Spain said a bag had ""exploded"" in her body. Mrs Brock said her daughter was unable to swallow tablets. She added Rebecca - who had been studying law in the Netherlands - had openly talked about experimenting with cocaine, but said she did not think she would have taken so much ecstasy in one go. ""The major crime squad were investigating rather than the police because of how she was found,"" she said. ""She wouldn't take any pills easily - I can't imagine that getting in her body at all. I can't see any other way than someone making that happen."" Mrs Brock added: ""Spanish authorities say five bags were found which were wrapped with elastic bands."" Coroner Mairin Casey said Rebecca flew to Ibiza from the Netherlands on 22 September and was captured on CCTV checking into her hotel. ""She didn't have contact with anyone after September 23,"" she said. ""On the morning of September 28 she was tragically found deceased in the hotel room. ""Spanish authorities gave the cause of death as an adverse reaction to drugs and a ruptured body pack. The date of death has been recorded as September 26. ""Becky died of MDMA intoxication commonly known as ecstasy. There was no evidence of a form of assault. ""I find it impossible to say how a pack or packs were ingested. How these bags were in her stomach, we will never know."" After the inquest, Mrs Brock said outside the court: ""There are some answers but there are also some clear gaps.""

Putin brands N Korea sanctions useless,"South Korea carries out live-fire drills amid continuing tension on the peninsula Russian President Vladimir Putin has said pursuing further sanctions against North Korea is ""useless"", saying ""they'd rather eat grass than give up their nuclear programme"". The US said on Monday it would table a new UN resolution on tougher sanctions in the wake of the latest test of a nuclear bomb by the North on Sunday. Mr Putin also said that the ramping up of ""military hysteria"" could lead to global catastrophe. He said diplomacy was the only answer. China, the North's main ally, has also called for a return to negotiations. How much leverage does China have over North Korea? What do we know about N Korea's nuclear site? How do you defend against North Korea? North Korea crisis in 300 words Meanwhile, North Korea's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Han Tae-song, said his country's recent ""self-defence measures"" were a ""gift package addressed to the US"". ""The US will receive more gift packages from my country as long as it relies on reckless provocations and futile attempts to put pressure on the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea),"" Reuters news agency quoted him as saying. The Russian leader was speaking at the meeting of the Brics group (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) in Xiamen, China. Although he condemned the North's test as ""provocative"", Mr Putin said: ""Sanctions of any kind would now be useless and ineffective. This video can not be played People in Seoul, South Korea, give their views about the nuclear test ""They'd rather eat grass than abandon their [nuclear weapons] programme unless they feel secure. And what can establish security? The restoration of international law. We should promote dialogue among all interested parties."" Citing a ""humanitarian aspect"", Mr Putin said millions of people would suffer under tougher measures, adding: ""Sanctions have been exhausted."" On Monday, at the United Nations in New York, US envoy Nikki Haley argued that only the strongest sanctions would enable the problem to be resolved through diplomacy. German Chancellor Angela Merkel backed that stance on Tuesday, saying more sanctions were urgently needed to counter the North's ""flagrant breach of international conventions"". North Korea's Han Tae-song said sanctions would never work and that his country would ""never under any circumstances put its nuclear test runs on the negotiating table"". Last month,the Security Council voted unanimously to ban North Korean exports and limit investmentsin the country. Ms Haley did not spell out what additional measures might be taken, but diplomats have suggested an oil embargo would have a crippling effect. This video can not be played South Korea carries out live-fire drills in response to the nuclear test There could also be a ban on the North's national airline, curbs on North Koreans working abroad, and asset freezes and travel bans on officials. On Tuesday, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said after a conversation with her Chinese counterpart that she believed Beijing ""could be open to more sanctions"". Mr Putin said Russia's trade with North Korea was negligible and did not violate current international sanctions. How should Trump handle North Korea? After telling the UN Security Council that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was ""begging for war"", Nikki Haley said: ""War is never something the United States wants. ""We don't want it now but our country's patience is not unlimited."" This video can not be played US ambassador Nikki Haley: ""Kim Jong-un is begging for war"" In talks overnight, US President Donald Trump and South Korea's Moon Jae-in agreed in principle to scrap a warhead weight limit on the South's missiles, which are currently capped at 500kg (1,100lb), giving it a greater strike force against North Korea. The South on Tuesday also carried out further live-fire exercises at sea, following missile drills on Monday that simulated the targeting of the Punggye-ri nuclear site where North Korea carried out its bomb test. Seoul has said there will be more live-fire drills this month. South Korea's Asia Business Daily quoted sources on Tuesday as saying the North had been observed moving a rocket towards its west coast. The rocket, which appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), was moved overnight to avoid surveillance, it said. The reports followed South Korean defence ministry statements on Monday that the North was preparing more missile tests. The South has also said it is deploying four more launchers of theUS Thaad (Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence) missile defence systemto join two already at a site in Seongju, south of Seoul. But Mr Putin said that ""ramping up military hysteria will lead to nothing good. It could lead to a global catastrophe. There's no other path apart from a peaceful one."" He said that given the North's range of weaponry, including long-range artillery, simply setting up missile defence systems made no sense. China also demanded a peaceful resolution. China's envoy to the UN, Liu Jieyi, said: ""China will never allow chaos and war on the peninsula."" Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent President Putin's comments underline the closeness of the positions of Russia and China on the North Korean crisis, making a further punitive sanctions resolution from the UN Security Council unlikely. Moscow and Beijing are pushing for a diplomatic opening but their ""roadmap"" has been rejected by Washington and it is far from clear what the Pyongyang regime's attitude is to potential talks. More significantly, what would talks be about? Reducing tensions certainly, but would Pyongyang be willing to halt or give up its nuclear and missile programmes? What kind of grand bargain might be struck if any? Mr Putin's comments also reflect Russia's own position as the target of US and EU economic sanctions, imposed in the wake of its seizure of the Crimea and its wider behaviour in eastern Ukraine. Read more from Jonathan On Sunday, the North tested a bomb underground, which was thought to have had a power range from 50 to 120 kilotonnes. A 50kt device would be about three times the size of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945. It was North Korea's sixth nuclear test to date.

Grenfell Tower survivor fraud charge,"A woman who falsely claimed her husband died in the Grenfell Tower fire, claiming Â£10,000 in funds allocated for survivors, has appeared in court. Joyce Msokeri, 46, of Ambleside Gardens, Sutton, south London, is charged with seven counts of fraud. It is alleged she also falsely claimed to have a child in intensive care following the blaze. Westminster Magistrates' Court heard Ms Msokeri made substantial claims on the basis she was a survivor of the fire. The charges allege she made false representations to the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea for money and accommodation at the Hilton hotel and to charities in order to obtain clothing and food. She is also alleged to have made false representations to HMRC and a GP surgery in Kensington and Chelsea. Sending the case to crown court, District Judge Elizabeth Roscoe said: ""It is a substantial amount of money. ""It is in circumstances where it is akin to a fraud on a vulnerable person who has been injured. ""It is similar to that in that of course there is a finite pot and the more that is taken out illegally, the less there is for those that deserve it."" Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea said it could not talk about individual cases, especially those under investigation, but whenever it suspected fraud it involved the police. ""If fraud on any level has been committed this would be appalling as it could directly, and negatively, impact [on] the council's efforts to give crucial help and support to the victims and survivors of the fire,"" a spokesman said. Ms Msokeri, who was arrested on 26 July, is due to next appear in custody at Southwark Crown Court on 3 October.

Baby stamp death 'danger signs missed',"This video can not be played Ayeeshia-Jayne Smith death: The council has apologised to the family Social workers missed signs of danger around a toddler who was stamped to death and focused too much on the condition of the mother who killed her, a serious case review has found. Ayeeshia-Jayne Smith wasmurdered by her mother Kathryn Smithin May 2014. The serious case review by the Derbyshire Safeguarding Children Board says professionals should have been more ""inquisitive"". However, the report said the girl's death could not have been predicted. Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands ""The birth father himself admitted to the review author that whilst he had many concerns about his ex-partner's behaviour, the people she associated with and her reliance on alcohol, at no time did he anticipate that she would fatally harm their daughter,"" the report stated. Kathryn Smith was found guilty of murder and Matthew Rigby was found guilty of causing or allowing Ayeeshia-Jayne's death Ayeeshia-Jayne, who was 21 months old, was attacked by her mother at her home in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, in May 2014. The mother and child had previously lived in Derbyshire, and had been in continued contact with social services at Derbyshire County Council. Smith was found guilty of murder, while her boyfriend Matthew Rigby - who was not Ayeeshia-Jayne's father - was found guilty of causing or allowing the child's death. The report described the couple's relationship as ""volatile"" and noted that police were called to several domestic incidents between them. One of the key findings said there was ""little recognition"" of the role that Rigby and Ayeeshia-Jayne's biological father played in the child's life, which resulted in ""a lack of professional assessment of both the benefits and risks they posed"" to the mother and child. Ayeeshia-Jayne suffered a fatal heart laceration - a type of injury usually only found in crash victims The author of the report noted that Kathryn Smith ""clearly loved and was attached to"" her child, and now has ""a long time to consider what it was that caused her to inflict such cruelty"". Smith herself was asked if she had information to share that could help other ""vulnerable"" young mothers and the professionals working with them. Her advice to young mothers was: ""Make sure you work with professional people and social services, don't just think they want to take your child away, they are actually just trying to help you, it's just you might not see it at the time."" For professionals working with other young women, she said: ""Make sure you see them alone, not with their partner all the time, it's not possible when in an abusive relationship to speak freely, ask the right questions, be really open about what your concerns are about, don't use written agreements to keep us away from abusive partners, as we can't control other people's actions."" Jane Parfrement, strategic director of children's services at the county council, said she ""fully"" accepted all of the findings of the report, but said ""there was good practice highlighted as well"". ""Clearly Ayeeshia-Jayne's death is an absolute tragedy and everyone that was involved with her is totally devastated,"" she said. ""I met with her family last night and her dad, and the impact on him has been totally and utterly devastating."" Ayeeshia-Jayne was taken to hospital twice in the months before her death May 2012- Kathryn Smith is referred to Derbyshire Children's Services while pregnant because of concerns about her mental health and possible risk for the baby. 15 July 2012- Ayeeshia-Jayne is born. June 2013- She is placed with foster parents because her mother was in an abusive relationship with a new boyfriend. October 2013- Ayeeshia-Jayne is returned to her mother, Kathryn Smith, who has started a relationship with another man, Matthew Rigby. November 2013- The infant is noted to be ""progressing well"" during a supervision network meeting with both birth parents. 3 February 2014- Ayeeshia-Jayne collapses and is taken to Queen's Hospital in Burton. She is misdiagnosed with a seizure and discharged, but after her death a bleed to the brain is found. March 2014- Kathryn Smith, now living in Burton-on-Trent, is visited by police following an anonymous call reporting a domestic incident at her home. At the end of the month, she takes her child to Queen's Hospital in Burton with a cut lip, saying she has banged her mouth on the side of the bath. April 2014- Further incidents of domestic abuse are reported at the property. There is concern by professionals that Kathryn Smith might be minimising the level of violence and her child may be at risk. 1 May 2014- Ayeeshia-Jayne is beaten in her own bedroom, resulting in a fatal laceration to her heart. She is taken to hospital, where she is pronounced dead. Ayeeshia's father Ricky Booth gave social services these photographs of his daughter's injuries weeks before her death Another key finding criticised hospital staff, stating they ""did not sufficiently consider whether child abuse or neglect was a possibility"" when Ayeeshia-Jayne was treated for medical issues during the last few months of her life. Magnus Harrison, medical director of Burton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, has apologised. ""This is an absolutely tragic event and to Ayeeshia-Jayne's family all I can say is absolute apologies from me, from the trust,"" he said. ""We didn't do what we could have done on two separate occasions and for that I'm sorry.""

Inflation-busting jobs: Why you should be a pilot,"Wage stagnation and an ever increasing cost of living have left many people feeling poorer over the last few years. But for some workers skills shortages mean pay has shot up. So is your job on the rise or is it time to explore the market?Try out our calculator, then scroll down to find out the jobs market's winners and losers...

Users of the Twitter mobile app or Google AMP may need to access the BBC News App or website directly to use it. Feature continues below... In many parts of the UK, people don't feel richer than they did five years ago. By May 2017, average weekly pay in the UK was 0.5% lower than the same time a year earlier after inflation was taken into account. But there have also been significant winners. Privatisation, unionisation, skills shortages and supply and demand can all play their part in determining how pay fluctuates. Here are the jobs with the biggest average pay rises and falls over the past five years, based on official analysis of the pay data collected by HMRC. Flying high: Pay for pilots has risen by 26% Pilots enjoyed an average pay rise of 26% between 2011 and 2016 - taking their average annual salary up to a cool Â£86,855. One young British Airways pilot says that while he didn't become a pilot for the money, there are certainly perks of the job. He requested that his name not be included. ""The pay was not a particular draw. Ever since I was a kid I never wanted to do anything else. It's not as good as it was - in the 80s and 90s the pay was crazy - they were on the starting salary that we are on now. But it's still a good lifestyle because they pay you pretty well for how much time we spend at work. ""I would encourage anybody to do it. It's a brilliant career - not as glamorous as it once was but it's still pretty good."" After the financial crisis, with some airlines close to going bust, pilots were allowed to work more hours.  Typically, they are paid at a higher rate when working over their basic hours. At the same time, demand is growing. A record number of passengers passed through UK airports in 2015, and about 600,000 new commercial airline pilots will be needed globally over the next two decades. The energy sector is facing a significant skills shortage Energy workers have seen their average pay shoot up by 29% in five years, as a skills shortage has started to bite. About 80% of power engineers are due to retire within the next 15 years and the energy and utilities sector predicts 221,000 vacancies arising in the next decade alone. Nick Turton from the Energy Institute says the increase in pay is to bring in fresh blood to the sector. He suggestsBrexit'is likely to become a further aggravating factor', pushing up wages further. ""We know from our most recent engagement that a majority in the sector see the availability of skilled, qualified labour as an acute concern, in the event of any restriction on freedom of movement. Many also believe this is likely to drive wage levels higher still, unless the government and industry can act to stem the contraction of analready shallow talent pool."" Pubs and bars may find it harder to recruit after Brexit It may not fit with Al Murray's grumpy persona, but recent years have been kind to pub landlords and managers in terms of pay. Domonic Naylor managed a gastropub for several years and now recruits for a premium hospitality business. He says there has been a ""huge increase"" in the average wage for most hospitality roles. ""As more independent pubs go under and are purchased by the industry giants they recognise that a competent manager is key to their continued success. ""Despite the fact that they are part of a larger corporation, the pub manager will drive the reputation that sees sales rise or fall. In order to attract and retain the best they are often essentially blackmailed into paying higher and higher wages."" Pay rose by an average of 29% between 2015 and October 2016, something Mr Naylor attributes to the lead up and immediateaftermath of the Brexit vote. ""The effect of Brexit is being felt across the industry already. A number of EU nationals felt, and still feel, that their futures were insecure so made the decision to head back to their home countries."" Air traffic controllers +54% Taxi and cab drivers and chauffeurs+44% Rubber process operatives +39% Electronics engineers +35% Publicans and managers of licensed premises +31% Tailors and dressmakers +31% Energy plant operatives +29% Aircraft pilots and flight engineers +26% Childminders and related occupations +24% Crane drivers +22% (figures are for full time workers only and don't account for inflation or include the self-employed) But the flipside is that in some jobs pay has been falling. Probation officers have been hit by the pubic sector pay cap Probation officers have seen their pay fall a whopping 20% in five years. Napo, the probation service union, says its members have been hit particularly hard by the 2010 public sector pay cap. Katie Lomas, Napo's vice chair says changes to pay increments means it now takes 23 years for a new officer to reach the next pay bracket. The pay increments officers received three times a year were reduced to one - but remained at just under 1%. Only 5% of prison staff to get pay boost 'Hold nerve over public sector pay', says Hammond Farewell to pay growth - Kamal Ahmed ""Because of the pay freeze most probation officers have given up hope of ever seeing the top of the pay scale. ""We are seeing people leave the sector because it does not pay like it used to. It was seen as a professional job and a probation officer could have a mortgage and provide for a family on a single income but that is not the case anymore and we see colleagues struggling with day to day living costs."" Advertising accounts managers and creative directors have seen their pay fall Television shows like Mad Men play tribute to the once-glamorous world of the advertising agency. But wages for accounts managers and chief executives within the sector have fallen by 14%. One factor could be the trend for firms to create advertising campaigns internally, rather than pay an agency. In the US, the Association of National Advertisers found in-house agencies increased by 16% between 2008 and 2013, with cost-cutting the main reason. Laura Jordan Bambach, chief creative officer and partner at independent agency Mr. President, says big agencies haven't been nimble enough to keep up with the evolution of the sector. ""Everyone is in every sector is feeling the pinch and clients are looking to do different types of work. ""You used to use one ad agency to do everything for you but the nature of advertising has changed and the bigger agencies who can't change as fast as the industry end up with quite inflexible structures and quite a lot of overheads."" Radiographers have also seen their average pay fall Richard Evans, chief executive of the Society of Radiographers, says the sector's 8% pay decline has to be seen in the context of stagnating NHS pay. ""We are seeing a gradual fall off in more senior people as they retire, and a slowing of promotion for others. The effect of economies having to be made in the NHS means people are not bring promoted as fast as they should be so when people leave from higher grades they are not being replaced as quickly. ""This is quite serious because you want to create circumstances in which people have ambition and want to deepen their practice."" This increased pressure also has knock-on effects for related professions. ""There is a national shortage of radiologists and one of the ways the service is compensating is that radiographers are taking some of the load off them, but that won't happen if we don't have the people to do it."" Complementary medicine practitioners (health associate professionals, other) -22% Probation officers -20% Coal miners -15% Advertising accounts managers -14% Precision instrument makers -14% School inspectors - 11% Shelf fillers -10% Museum archivists and curators -9% Hotel/caravan managers and owners -8% Radiographers - 8% (figures are for full time workers only and don't account for inflation or include the self-employed) All data used on this page is compiled and made available by the ONS'sAnnual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE),external- the most recent release was October 2016. The survey doesn't include self-employed workers or bonuses. We have chosen to use data for full-time workers only. The BBC has examined figures from 2011 to 2016 inclusive. We excluded jobs entirely if there was no figure for 2016. Sections may be hidden for certain jobs due to missing data. The only sheets we used are those referring to 'Gross annual pay' and 'Hourly pay - excluding overtime'. We used hourly pay to work out thegender pay gap,externaland annual pay for all other figures.

"Boy, 14, critical after double shooting","Police said there were ""serious concerns"" of retaliation and put extra officers on the streets A 14-year-old boy is in a critical condition in hospital and a 17-year-old has suffered ""life-changing"" injuries in a double shooting in east London. Police were called on Monday afternoon to Moore Walk, Forest Gate, and found the two teenagers with gunshot wounds. The Metropolitan Police said there were ""serious concerns"" of retaliation and put extra officers on the streets. Inquiries are continuing. No arrests have been made. The Met said the boys were taken to an east London hospital. Ch Supt Ade Adelekan said: ""Sadly today two young men have been shot on our streets, one of whom remains critically ill in hospital. ""We are only too well aware that this incident comes after a number of shootings and firearms discharges that are blighting our communities and seriously injuring our young men. ""Tonight [Monday] there will be extra officers on duty throughout our borough, and due to my serious concerns that others may retaliate in response to today's incident, I will be authorising my officers to use stop and search throughout the borough under Section 60."" Met Police figures published in April revealed a 42% spike in gun offences in the capital in the last year - up to 2,544 compared with 1,793 between April 2015 and 2016.

Caribbean braces for powerful hurricane,"This video can not be played The view inside Hurricane Irma Hurricane Irma has been upgraded to a category five - the highest category - making it ""extremely dangerous"" as it crosses the Caribbean. Irma now has sustained winds of 290km/h (180mph), making it the most powerful the Atlantic has seen in over a decade. It is projected to bring storm surges, life-threatening winds and torrential rainfall to the Leeward Islands. Florida, where it is due to arrive as a category four hurricane on Sunday, has declared a state of emergency. Flights cancelled as Irma approaches Nasa shares video of Hurrican Irma viewed from space Residents in Texas and Louisiana are still reeling from the effects of Hurricane Harvey, which struck as a category four storm in late August, causing heavy rain and destroying thousands of homes. However the National Hurricane Center (NHC) has warned that it is too early to forecast Irma's exact path or effects on the continental US. The US mainland has not been hit by two category four hurricanes in one hurricane season, since the storms were first recorded in 1851. Texas recovery from Harvey 'could cost $180bn' Uninsured and anxious, victims return home Irma, which has been moving at a speed of 22km/h (14mph), is set to reach the Leeward Islands, east of Puerto Rico, within the next 24 hours,the centre added,external. It issued a hurricane warning for the following islands: Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis Saba, St Eustatius and Sint Maarten Saint Martin and Saint Barthelemy The British Virgin Islands The US Virgin Islands Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra Guadeloupe and the Dominican Republic, which borders Haiti, are on hurricane watch. This video can not be played Hurricane Irma threatens Caribbean Rainfall of up to 30cm (12in) may occur in some northern areas and water levels may rise by up to 3.8m (12ft) above normal levels, the NHC said. Puerto Rico has declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard. Governor Ricardo Rossello described the hurricane as ""something without precedent"" and announced the closure of schools on Tuesday. The island has a population of 3.4 million people, and emergency shelters able to house up to 62,000 people have been opened. Long queues of people formed in shops, with residents stocking up on water, food, batteries, generators and other supplies. How hard has Harvey hit the local economy? Residents of Puerto Rico have been stocking water and other supplies On St Martin, a woman in a supermarket told AFP news agency: ""I [am] getting some stuff for the hurricane, because the hurricane is coming direct on us. They say that it's coming on us so then I start to pick up truly the things what I need."" A manager at the  supermarket said people had been stocking up on ""lots of canned food, cooked dishes, canned fish, paper towels, cleaning products, cakes, lots of cakes, and water, of course.""

Azerbaijan 'operated secret $3bn scheme',"There is evidence that the scheme was linked to President Aliyev, the report says Azerbaijan's ruling elite operated a secret $2.8bn (Â£2.2bn) slush fund for two years to pay off European politicians and make luxury purchases, an investigation suggests. The money was allegedly channelled through four UK-based opaque companies. People said to have been paid include European politicians who adopted a favourable attitude to the government. There is no suggestion that all the recipients were aware of the original source of the money, the report said. The investigation into the alleged secret fund, nicknamed the Azerbaijani Laundromat, was carried out by a consortium of European newspapers andpublished by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP).,external The report alleges that there is evidence of a link between the fund and Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev. President Aliyev has denied any involvement or wrongdoing. ""Attempts to link the president and his family are baseless, malicious and are of a provocative nature,"" the president's office said in a statement on Tuesday. The statement accused financier George Soros, whose Open Society Institute supports the OCCRP report, of being a ""fraud"" and a ""fake"" and called for the report's findings to be ""investigated"". According to the OCCRP, the scheme was used by Azerbaijan's ruling elite to launder funds through a series of shell companies in order to disguise their origin. It was allegedly used as a slush fund to pay people who served their interests. Azerbaijani Laundromat operated over a period of two years from 2012 to 2014, the OCCRP says. The money was channelled through four opaque UK companies; two based in England and two in Scotland. These companies have since been dissolved, according to thereport,external. The funds, managed by the UK companies, made their way to various countries including Germany, France, Turkey, Iran and Kazakhstan. The payments were sometimes repetitive, the report adds. The source of the funds is unclear, but the investigation alleges that there is ""ample evidence of its connection to the family of President Ilham Aliyev"". The OCCRP report says that the money appeared to originate in Azeri and Russian government circles. Some of the funds came directly from the Azerbaijani government, the investigation says. By Rayhan Demetrie, BBC News In 2012, a Berlin-based think-tank, the European Stability Initiative, published a report titled Caviar Diplomacy: How Azerbaijan silenced the Council of Europe. The report detailed efforts by Azeri officials to win the ""hearts and minds"" of the Council's members by giving luxurious gifts such as silk carpets, electronic gadgets, black caviar and money in exchange for supporting Azerbaijan. The 47-member council - not part of the European Union - monitors compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights, and judges in Strasbourg enforce it. In 2010 and 2013, Azerbaijan's allegedly rigged parliamentary and presidential elections were praised by members of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE). PACE members in 2013 voted down a human rights report criticising Azerbaijan. Oil and caviar rich Azerbaijan is one of the world's most authoritarian nations, where dissent is not tolerated and most government critics are either in jail or have been forced to leave the country. The country's ministry of emergency situations, ministry of defence and intelligence service are said to have provided $9m to the scheme. A Russian arms exports agency, Rosoboronexport, provided $29m, according to OCCRP. But almost half of the money, $1.4bn, came from private Baku-based company Baktelekom MMC, which bears no relation to the mobile phone giant Baktelecom. Offshore companies, usually registered in the UK with ""proxy directors and shareholders"", also allegedly contributed. Much of the money is said to have been paid to European politicians, lobbyists, journalists and businessmen. At the time the alleged scheme, the oil-rich ex-Soviet state was accused of systematic corruption, vote-rigging and abuses, including the jailing of opposition politicians, human rights activists and journalists. The OCCRP report says the money ""bought silence"". Azerbaijan's Deputy Prime Minister, Yaqub Eyyubov, is said to have benefitted from the scheme Recipients are said to include the family of Azerbaijan's Deputy Prime Minister, Yaqub Eyyubov, along with lobbyists tasked with tackling corruption in the country and members of parliament with links to businesses, such as pharmaceutical companies. Mr Eyyubov has not yet commented on the report's findings. The funds, the investigation says, were also used by the political elite in the capital, Baku, to purchase luxury items including private education for well-connected Azeri families living abroad. ""Over 13,000"" banking transactions were leaked to the media, according to the report. They show that millions of dollars in accounts of companies and individuals across the world were spent at luxury car dealerships, football clubs, travel agencies and hospitals, it adds. Azerbaijan country profile Corruption inquiry at Council of Europe over Azerbaijan One of Europe's leading banks, Danske Bank from Denmark, processed the payments to those companies via its branch office in Estonia.  It admitted it had not done enough to spot suspicious transactions. At least three European politicians, a journalist and a number of businessmen who praised the government were said to be among the recipients of the Azerbaijani Laundromat money. The four UK-based companies allegedly used to channel the funds were linked to anonymous tax haven entities based in the British Virgin Islands, Seychelles and Belize. According to theOCCRP report,external, the companies involved were: Polux Management and Hilux Services, which were set up in Glasgow; Metastar Invest in Birmingham; and LCM Alliance in Potters Bar, Hertfordshire. The investigation suggests that because numerous payments were made to several ""secretive shell companies"" in the UK, the scheme's reach may have been much larger than is currently known. According to the OCCRP, the scheme seemed to have been successful in, for example, persuading the Parliamentary Assembly of Council of Europe to vote against a report critical of Azerbaijan in 2013. The vote is currently under investigationand a report is expected by the end of the year.

News Daily: North Korea and Hurricane Irma,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: The US will table a resolution at the United Nations later, calling for further sanctions against North Korea, after the secretive state tested a nuclear bomb at least three times as powerful as that dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. Japan is reportedly developing plans to get 60,000 of its people out of South Korea in the event of war. Nikki Haley, US ambassador to the UN, said her country did not want conflict but its patience with North Korea was ""not unlimited"". Its leader, Kim Jong-un, was ""begging for war"", she added. North Korea's biggest ally, China, has called for dialogue, so the crisis can be ""resolved peacefully"". By Jonathan Marcus, diplomatic correspondent All-out war would be catastrophic in terms of lives lost. It might potentially involve the use of nuclear weapons - the first time since the closing stages of the Second World War - which could set a terrifying new precedent in international affairs. At its close, after terrible destruction, North Korea would no longer exist. That is a given, hence the hope that the Pyongyang regime is rational and understands the risks involved. Its behaviour, though, amounts to very, very high-stakes brinksmanship. Read the full article It's reached wind speeds of 220km/h (140mph), which are likely to strengthen in the next 48 hours, bringing torrential rain, storm surges and a threat to life.Hurricane Irma is expected to hit the Leeward Islands by the end of Tuesday(local time), although it's too early to predict its path after that, according to US weather forecasters. Florida and Puerto Rico have declared states of emergency in preparation for the possibility it will reach them. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Things have reportedly not gone very smoothly - or quickly - between UK and European Union negotiators during the early stages of trying to reach a Brexit deal. Later,Brexit Secretary David Davis will give the House of Commons his view on the talks, which Prime Minister Theresa May says she wants to ""intensify"". This comes ahead of a debate on Thursday on the government's EU withdrawal bill, which would transfer existing EU law into UK law. Labour wants to make six amendments to it - the government doesn't. By Chris Morris, BBC Reality Check At the moment, the main problem is money, which is hardly a surprise. The UK wants the bill for its financial obligations on exit to be as low as possible. All the other countries in the EU want it to be as high as possible, because when the UK leaves there will be a hole in the EU budget and they will have to cover the shortfall.

Caribbean braces for powerful Irma,"This video can not be played The view inside Hurricane Irma Hurricane Irma has been upgraded to a category five - the highest category - making it ""extremely dangerous"" as it crosses the Caribbean. Irma now has sustained winds of 290km/h (180mph), making it the most powerful the Atlantic has seen in over a decade. It is projected to bring storm surges, life-threatening winds and torrential rainfall to the Leeward Islands. Florida, where it is due to arrive as a category four hurricane on Sunday, has declared a state of emergency. Flights cancelled as Irma approaches Nasa shares video of Hurrican Irma viewed from space Residents in Texas and Louisiana are still reeling from the effects of Hurricane Harvey, which struck as a category four storm in late August, causing heavy rain and destroying thousands of homes. However the National Hurricane Center (NHC) has warned that it is too early to forecast Irma's exact path or effects on the continental US. The US mainland has not been hit by two category four hurricanes in one hurricane season, since the storms were first recorded in 1851. Texas recovery from Harvey 'could cost $180bn' Uninsured and anxious, victims return home Irma, which has been moving at a speed of 22km/h (14mph), is set to reach the Leeward Islands, east of Puerto Rico, within the next 24 hours,the centre added,external. It issued a hurricane warning for the following islands: Antigua, Barbuda, Anguilla, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis Saba, St Eustatius and Sint Maarten Saint Martin and Saint Barthelemy The British Virgin Islands The US Virgin Islands Puerto Rico, Vieques and Culebra Guadeloupe and the Dominican Republic, which borders Haiti, are on hurricane watch. This video can not be played Hurricane Irma threatens Caribbean Rainfall of up to 30cm (12in) may occur in some northern areas and water levels may rise by up to 3.8m (12ft) above normal levels, the NHC said. Puerto Rico has declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard. Governor Ricardo Rossello described the hurricane as ""something without precedent"" and announced the closure of schools on Tuesday. The island has a population of 3.4 million people, and emergency shelters able to house up to 62,000 people have been opened. Long queues of people formed in shops, with residents stocking up on water, food, batteries, generators and other supplies. How hard has Harvey hit the local economy? Residents of Puerto Rico have been stocking water and other supplies On St Martin, a woman in a supermarket told AFP news agency: ""I [am] getting some stuff for the hurricane, because the hurricane is coming direct on us. They say that it's coming on us so then I start to pick up truly the things what I need."" A manager at the  supermarket said people had been stocking up on ""lots of canned food, cooked dishes, canned fish, paper towels, cleaning products, cakes, lots of cakes, and water, of course."" In Florida, Governor Rick Scott said he had been assured by US President Donald Trump that ""the full resources of the federal government"" would be made available as the state prepared for the storm. Florida Keys officials have ordered a pre-emptive mandatory evacuation of visitors to the islands will start Wednesday, ahead of the projected storm.

Is this the next financial scandal waiting to happen?,"Sean Boulanger says initial coin offerings give small investors a chance to invest in start-ups A growing number of tech companies are raising funds through initial coin offerings - issuing their own digital currencies for investors to buy. But the practice is completely unregulated. Is another financial scandal just around the corner? Sean Boulanger, a senior community manager at a Cape Town digital agency, doesn't consider himself a serious investor. But he came across US tech company Civic, run by fellow South African entrepreneur Vinny Lingham. It was planning to raise money in a way Mr Boulanger had never heard of before. Instead of issuing shares and floating all or part of the company on the stock market - known as an initial public offering or IPO - Civic decided to issue its own tokens, or digital currency, to help fund the identity verification platform it was developing. Mr Boulanger was impressed with Civic's product and decided to invest. ""It has allowed me to jump in and invest in a start-up, which is very difficult in this country to do, especially with limited funds,"" says Mr Boulanger. ""The risk is high, but so is the reward."" Civic raised $33m (Â£26m) via this initial coin offering (ICO), as it's known. Civic founder Vinny Lingham says an initial coin offering was the ""right thing to do"" for his firm The cost of the new currency is set by the issuing company and investors hold the ""coins"" in digital wallets, hoping that their value will rise as the company flourishes. Several other companies developing blockchain-based applications have raised money this way, including Bancor ($153m) and Tezos ($232m) with more than $1bn being raised in total so far this year. Companies like ICOs because they are quick, easy, and free from regulatory red tape. ""Preparing an ICO takes only weeks and can be targeted directly at the interested investors and customers rather than going through venture capitalists,"" says Michael Marcovici, a director of Cayman Islands-based Digital Developers Fund. The Fund is currently offering tokens for sale to raise money for its own investments in crypto-currencies. But the lack of regulatory oversight is alarming many commentators. China bans initial coin offerings The USSecurities and Exchange Commission recently warned investors,externalagainst fake ICOs and ""pump and dump"" scams, whereby fraudsters spread rumours and false information about potential ICOs in the hope of boosting a company's share price. Once the share price rises, the fraudsters sell, or dump, the shares at a profit. Mr Boulanger says he was wary of the negative publicity surrounding scam ICOs before he invested - token launches taking place even before a viable product has been developed, for example. The 17th Century Tulip mania was the first investment bubble. Could ICOs be the latest? ""I found out that it's really still the Wild West out there,"" he says. But so far, at least, he doesn't regret it. He took the plunge with Civic because he trusted Mr Lingham - a proven entrepreneur and fellow South African who acknowledges that there are risks on both sides. ""This is uncharted territory, but we feel confident that it was the right thing to do for the company,"" says Mr Lingham, who aimed to make his firm's token sale as transparent as possible to avoid any future allegations of wrongdoing. ""There are unfortunately also many scams operating in this space,"" he warns. The worry is that ICOs are creating a classic investment bubble - similar to theTulip mania in the 17th Century- and attracting fraudsters and hackers to this new, unregulated market. Nearly 10% (about $150m) of the money invested in ICOs this year using Ethereum - the blockchain-based platform - has been stolen, according to a recent report by Chainalysis, a firm specialising in monitoring crypto-currency transactions. One of the risks of badly managed ICOs is hackers stealing the digital currency ""There are already stories of fraudsters capitalising on this somewhat irrational exuberance over ICOs,"" says Gray Sasser of US law firm Frost Brown Todd, a blockchain specialist. He believes that regulation is inevitable. Indeed, the SEC recently suggested ICOs should be registered in the same way as conventional investments. But advocates like Mr Marcovici believe investors should be left to carry out their own due diligence. ""There will be attempts [to regulate the sector] that is for sure, but as a manager of a fund I must say that regulations mainly add cost to the investor and reduce the options of investors drastically,"" he says. ""There will be money lost... but this will be an important step for self-regulation of the market."" Civic's Mr Lingham has no doubt that regulation will eventually come in. Would you take a ride in a pilotless sky taxi? Is 'killer robot' warfare closer than we think? How your digital self could 'live' on after you die Is 'tap and go' a better way to give to charity? ""We're in the early days of a very new industry,"" he says. ""I'm very happy to see that places like Zug in Switzerland and Singapore are creating regulatory frameworks for token sales to ensure that they can be controlled and benefit society."" But Mr Sasser fears that it may take a headline-grabbing fraud to force US regulators into action, given the current US administration's antipathy towards more regulation. The risk for firms that have pre-sold tokens before launching any underlying software, he warns, is that new regulation could raise compliance costs to such an extent that this wipes out any money already raised. ""It is only a matter of time before a disgruntled investor makes a securities fraud claim against an issuer,"" he says. ""Right now, both investors and issuers are playing without a net.""

Strictly's Ballas will be 'feisty and fair',"Ballas was in a dance class when she found out she had been hired as a judge New Strictly Come Dancing judge Shirley Ballas has said she will be ""fun, firm, feisty and fair"" when she takes over from Len Goodman. Ballas, 56, said she fell to her knees when she was told she was the new judge - because she ""couldn't believe it"". The 'Queen of Latin' said that while she ""may look and come across as quite strict"", she wants to give the celebrities ""comments to inspire them"". But she promised she would be ""honest and as forthright"" on the BBC One show. Strictly 2017: The line-up in full In pictures: Strictly red carpet Who is the new Strictly judge? ""If I ask [the celebrities] to do something and they don't deliver it the following week, I'm not going to tell them that it's okay,"" she said ahead of the programme's return on Saturday. ""I'm not that kind of judge. I will be expecting things from them and I hope that they will be expecting things from me, to be as honest and as forthright as I can [and] help them become the best dancer they can be."" This year's celebrities include pop stars Mollie King, Alexandra Burke and Aston Merrygold, along with comedians Susan Calman and Brian Conley, presenters Ruth Langsford, Simon Rimmer and Charlotte Hawkins, and Paralympian Jonnie Peacock. Actors Chizzy Akudolu, Gemma Atkinson, Davood Ghadami and Joe McFadden are also taking part, with TV and radio personality Debbie McGee and Anglican vicar the Reverend Richard Coles completing the line-up. The ""class of 2017"" includes three pop stars, a vicar and a Paralympian Former Latin dance champion Ballas was in a dance class when she got the call telling her she had landed the job and immediately rang her son Mark, a professional dancer. ""As soon as he answered he said, 'You got it didn't you?' I didn't even have to say it out loud,"" she is quoted as saying in promotional material for Strictly's new series. ""Mark was the one who had encouraged me. He always said 'you can do this' and 'it's going to be an amazing journey'."" After retiring from competitive dancing in 1996, Ballas became a coach to many top professional and amateur dancers and competition adjudicators. The main appeal of doing Strictly Come Dancing, she said, is that it's not just about the dancers and celebrities. ""There could be young or old people out there who are watching and they might also be inspired to take up dancing. I find that so special. ""Being able to inspire people is a really big part of what I want to share on Strictly and I can't wait to get started."" Shirley Ballas joins Bruno Tonioli, Darcey Bussell and Craig Revel Horwood on the panel Ballas was judged by Len Goodman when she started competing at the age of nine. She later trained with him as a dancer when she was a teenager. ""We have remained friends and at any dinner party we were at together, he was the life and soul of the party,"" she said of the 73-year-old,who stepped downas head judge after last year's series. ""Len always had great things to say about my dancing and I'm a big fan of his sense of humour and his insight into ballroom dancing. He played such an iconic role on Strictly and I know the viewers adored him."" Strictly Come Dancing's launch show is on 9  September on BBC One at 19:00 BST.
