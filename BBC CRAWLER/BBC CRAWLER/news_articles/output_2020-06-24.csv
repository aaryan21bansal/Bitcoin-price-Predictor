Illegal lockdown parties hosted in online rentals,"Several hosts said they had found gas cannisters, used for taking laughing gas, in their properties Lockdown parties hosted in properties booked via online sites, including Airbnb and Booking.com, are putting ""communities at risk"", the Bed and Breakfast Association has said. Hosts and residents have complained of groups of up to 30 breaking social-distancing rules and taking drugs. BBC News has been told of several such parties in the past month. Airbnb said it had gone further than its rivals to protect public health during the pandemic. However, last week a man was stabbed at a party in a south London property police believehad been rented out via the platform,external. Following a previous BBC News investigation into ""coronavirus retreats"", Airbnb had told users they could make bookings only if they were key workers or required âessential staysâ. But that restriction is to be lifted, in line with local rules on hotels and self-catering accommodation, in: Northern Ireland on 26 June England on 4 July Wales on 13 July Scotland on 15 July Rival platform Booking.com does not currently flag such limits. Evidence of drug taking was found at one property âWhile B&Bs and guest houses have been closed since 23 March, it seems these giant platforms have allowed bookings to be made and enabled the so-called 'lockdown parties', which have put guests, hosts, neighbours and communities at risk,â Bed and Breakfast Association chairman David Weston said. âIt is about time these global platforms took some responsibility for the safety of their guests, their accommodation and showed some respect for local communities.â Although the BBC saw evidence that some of the bookings involved were made via Airbnb, the hosts involved asked that their details not be shared with the company. As a result, the platform said it had seen no evidence to connect the incidents with its business. ""We have zero tolerance for illegal activity and Airbnb is the only platform to limit all UK bookings to essential travel for key workers until restrictions are lifted,"" the company said. ""We also explicitly ban party houses and our neighbourhood support tool enables anyone to contact us with concerns about a listing in their community, and we take action on issues brought to our attention."" Booking.com did not respond to a request for comment. Darya Simanovich, who runs Chelsea Creperie but rents out a property on both Airbnb and Booking.com for extra income, said it had been âtrashedâ many times since lockdown began, at the end of March, by guests posing as key workers, who had turned out to be organising illegal parties. âI wasnât able to meet the guest because of restrictions,"" she said of one instance. ""The key collection was contact-free. âBut because I live above the property, I saw lots of people going in, with music playing. ""So I had to ask them to leave. Ms Simanovich said she had found the detritus left behind by some guests âLetting out your home is all about trust. âItâs hard to think people are breaking the rules, especially when hosts have lost income. âI donât think the new guidelines will change anything. ""People will still bend the rules.â Danial Abbas, who also hosts a flat on both platforms, said a group of more than 10 people held a party there until 04:00 BST last week. âIâve had no problems at all until lockdown,â he said. âItâs disappointing that people would flout the rules and create disruption at a time when people are already feeling unnerved. ""Iâm sad that theyâve created an extra risk.â Another host, who asked to remain anonymous, had a group of younger adults partying in her property. âTheyâre less at risk,"" she said. ""They feel hard done by, as lockdown measures are largely for older people. âThey feel like theyâre missing out, so donât care if they break the rules.â Next month, people in England are allowed to meet indoors in groups of up to two households. But there is concern this will be difficult to enforce in short-term lets. âThe guidance as it stands is unenforceable,â Holiday Home Association chief executive Martin Sach said. âItâs too complicated and not law. ""So self-catering owners arenât able to police this. ""You canât verify the relationship of your guests.â Airbnb restricts UK bookings to coronavirus key workers Airbnb hosts defy lockdown laws with 'Covid-19 retreats' 'Why I want to go to lockdown raves' Merilee Karr, who chairs the UK Short Term Accommodation Association, which represents short-term rental businesses, including Airbnb, said people should have made bookings only if they had legitimate reasons to do so, such as being a key worker or needing hospital treatment. âWe have been vigilant and very strict about taking bookings during lockdown and have openly opposed anyone breaching the guidelines,"" she said. ""We totally disapprove of anyone that has falsely booked accommodation to hold an activity that falls outside of the government guidelines and take action where this would be discovered.â A neighbour to a rental property, who asked to remain anonymous, told BBC News: ""I live in a quiet area in London. ""But since the lockdown, and in the last four weeks, there have been four parties in my street. ""You can spot them right away. ""They only stay for one night, arrive in groups of up to 20 people, coming in and out of the house. ""Iâve been kept up all night by the loud music that has played until 05:00. ""And you can see and smell evidence of drug-taking. ""When it happens, Iâve wanted to knock on the door and confront them. ""But I have no idea who these people are, which can be scary and threatening, especially when we arenât meant to be in crowds. ""Itâs happening because people donât have anywhere else to go at the moment. ""And they want to drink and socialise. ""Action needs to be taken. ""Itâs not right to have a party house in the middle of a residential area, especially during a pandemic.""

"Increase car taxes to help climate, report says","Car taxes should be increased to help fund the battle against climate change, government advisers say. They say ministers should bring forward the date for ending sales of new conventional cars from 2035 to 2032. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) says the chancellor should also consider increasing the tax on gas for home heating. It says the changes should be made as the UK looks to recover from the Covid-19 crisis by creating jobs. The CCC also recommends the country aim to cut carbon emissions as part of a âgreen recoveryâ. It says the government has a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change society for the better. A government spokesperson said that tackling climate change should be at the heart of the UK's economic recovery. Ditch cars to meet climate targets, say MPs But the committee insists that ministers must send the right economic messages to consumers. The CCC chair, Lord Deben, says it makes sense to raises fuel prices when the cost of oil is low - and use the proceeds to subsidise low-emissions vehicles. He said: âIt seems perfectly clear that we should increase the tax on the very low oil prices we have at the moment. We need to make people who choose the right way to do so cheaper than those who choose the wrong way.â The committee was more cautious about increasing the price of heating gas, and Lord Deben said the poor must be protected from high prices. But it said the Treasuryâs forthcoming review of climate policies must tackle the issue, as home heating must shift from gas towards low-carbon alternatives. Another sector in urgent need of investment is the cooling of peopleâs homes, the report says. As much of the UK swelters,the CCC warns,externalthat elderly and sick people are vulnerable to overheating, with hospitals, care homes, prisons, and flats in the south of England particularly at risk. It projects that annual heat-related deaths could more than double by 2050 to 5,000 âthatâs even if emissions targets are achieved.,external It says refurbishing homes would improve lives and reduce emissions whilst also creating thousands of âgreenâ jobs. Ventilation could be improved, sun-shading could be fixed to windows, and trees could be planted to cool the air and provide shade. The report warns that the government will need to exceed its manifesto commitments on homes. It also says the post-Covid-19 changes will require whatâs known as a just transitionâ for workers whoâllneed to be re-trained from high-carbon to low-carbon jobs. The report warns ministers against protecting jobs in polluting industries because that will lock in higher emissions in the long term. It identifies key policy areas: Getting around: It must be easier for people to walk and cycle. Better broadband is needed for home working. The government's ambition toreduce the number of car journeysneeds policies. Trees: Planting projects and peatland restoration generate skilled employment as well as benefiting the climate, biodiversity, air quality, and flood prevention. Energy: Networks must be strengthened to support electrification of transport and heating. New infrastructure is needed for hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage. Innovation: Major investment is needed in research and development to give the UK a competitive advantage in clean industries. Baroness Brown of Cambridge, chair of the CCCâs adaptation committee, said: âCovid-19 has shown that planning for systemic risks is unavoidable. âWe have warned repeatedly that the UK is poorly prepared for the very serious impacts of climate change, including flooding, overheating and water shortages. Now is the moment to get our house in order.â A Government spokesperson said: ""We agree that tackling climate change should be at the heart of our economic recovery. ""We were the first major economy to commit to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. ""We believe that the actions we need to achieve that target can help to deliver a stronger, cleaner, more sustainable and more resilient economy after this pandemic."" The CCC has been one of many organisations urging a green recovery. Some of them think help should be refused to struggling high-carbon industries such as aviation unless âgreen stringsâ are attached. Among the voices is the employersâ organisation, the CBI, which said: âThe need to act urgently on climate change will remain just as important as before the outbreak of coronavirus.â A report from the green think-tank ECIU,externalsaid investing in low-carbon jobs can help to âlevel upâ the UK to benefit the so-called âRed Wallâ constituencies that proved pivotal in the 2019 General Election. And an overwhelming majority (79%) of Climate Assembly UK members â from many different backgrounds - said the government should support changes which help meet the UKâs net zero emissions target. The prime minister has said he wants to invest in a greener UK and heâs expected to to offer some policy details in coming weeks. Benny Peiser, from the libertarian group the Global Warming Policy Forum, doubts that heâll fully follow the committeeâs advice. He told BBC News: âAny policy that prioritises climate change policy over a rapid economic recovery would be suicidal for both the UK economy and the government. While Boris may talk the talk, he is unlikely to walk the walk.â The committee is also criticised â from the opposite direction - bythe authors of a report in the journal Climate Policy.,external Researchers concluded that planned UK emissions cuts are less than half as rigorous as needed for the country to contribute fairly towards restricting global climate heating to less than 2C. Co-author Prof Kevin Anderson told me: âThe trouble is that the committee isnât looking at what needs to be done â itâs looking at what it can say without being politically ignored. Thatâs very different.â Lord Deben replied: âThat is absolutely untrueâ.

Lockdown party victim lobbied MPs on youth attacks,"""Knowing he was taken from us in such a brutal way has left us devastated,"" say Cheriff Tall's family A man shot dead at a lockdown party had lobbied MPs on youth violence, a youth worker has said. Cheriff Tall, 21, was one of two men killed by a lone gunmanat the ""unplanned"" eventin Manchester. Akemia Minott, who had known Mr Tall since he was six, said he had recently lost a close friend in a violent attack. The experience had inspired him to travel to London to raise the issue, she said. Ms Minott, a youth worker in Moss Side, where Sunday's event was held, said she felt ""extremely privileged"" to have known Mr Tall for 15 years. She described him as being from a ""loving family"" and known to friends as the ""joker in the pack"". He had ""been through so much in recent years"", she said. ""He's been to the Houses of Parliament with us, challenged MPs on what they're going to do about youth violence and how they are going to address situations,"" she said. ""Which is obviously incredibly sad when you look at what's happened."" Mr Tall's parents also paid tribute, describing him as a ""model son"" whose brutal death had left them devastated. In a statement, they said: ""Cheriff was loved and respected by his brothers and sisters and to say they are broken is an understatement."" Relatives said he was ""popular and well-liked"" with a ""strong sense of loyalty"" and ""would always try to help anyone who needed it"". His parents said they were grateful for all messages of condolences and support but they had ""a long road ahead"" to try to come to terms with the death of their son. Lola Ajose said her husband was an ""amazing man"" and ""an amazing father"" Abayomi Ajose, 36, was also gunned down at the event. His widow Lola Ajose described her husband as ""the best man"" and an ""amazing father"". Father-of-three Mr Ajose, who was also known as Abi or Junior, worked for children's services at Manchester City Council.

UK councils fear bankruptcy amid Covid-19 costs,"Leeds City Council said the government needed to step in and help stabilise local authority finances Some of the largest UK councils say they may have to declare themselves effectively bankrupt unless the government agrees to further support. Nearly 150 authorities have forecast a combined budget shortfall of at least Â£3.2bn, the BBC found. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the government ""has got to recognise"" the financial situation facing councils. The government said it was working on a ""comprehensive plan"" for councils. A BBC investigation found across the UK: At least five English councils warned they may meet the criteria to issue a section 114 notice at some point without more government support, declaring themselves effectively bankrupt They include some of the UK's largest unitary authorities - Leeds, Wiltshire, Trafford, Tameside and Barnet Liverpool's Mayor Joe Andersonpreviously warned the city may decide to issue a section 114 noticebut the authority said on Wednesday it was now planning to set a revised budget in September to address a Â£58.6m shortfall Birmingham City Council - the largest authority in Europe - said ""given the size"" of its forecast shortfall of Â£212m across 2020-21 and 2021-22. after Â£70m government funding already received, a section 114 notice ""would not rectify this situation"" Of 173 local authorities who responded to the BBC's questions, 148 predicted a budget shortfall At least 20 local authorities plan to hold an emergency or in-year budget At Highland Council in Scotland, the estimated shortfall is equivalent to Â£411 for every resident Whitehall has alreadygiven Â£3.2bn funding to all English councilsin two tranches to help cover coronavirus costs. Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Sir Keir said: ""At the beginning of the pandemic, councils had to do lots of things to support their communities, whether that was provision of food, of services, care centres,bringing homeless people in, really important stuff. ""And they were told by [the government] 'we will stand by you - we'll support you - you get on and do what you need to do'. So they did."" He said lots of councils were now ""facing bankruptcy, or cutting back services, which is the last thing anybody needs, and the government has got to recognise this"". Lost business rates,council tax holidaysand emergency payments for families whose incomes have disappeared have all hit upper tier councils' income, at the same time as rising costs of adult care and providing protective equipment (PPE) for carers. Some of those councils would also typicallydepend on tourism for large chunks of income, such as dividends from airports they own or parking fees from visitors. Facilities like council-owned leisure centres, which would normally produce income for authorities, are also closed. Plummeting passenger numbers at Luton Airport are contributing to a Â£49m shortfall at the authority which owns it, Luton Borough Council.  A spokesman said it would have ""no option but to agree to unprecedented cuts to key services"" if more cash was not made available. Manchester City Council is losing out on more than Â£130m income this year from sources such as the council'spart-ownership of Manchester Airports Group (MAG). Sir Richard Leese, leader of Manchester City Council, said: ""It is no exaggeration to say that we are on the edge of a financial precipice."" England's Minister for Local Government, Simon Clarke, said the Â£3.2bn funding already given to local authorities was ""part of a wider package of support from across government for local communities and businesses - totalling over Â£27 billion - including grants, business rate relief and for local transport"". And Wiltshire Council's leader, Councillor Philip Whitehead, told Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett the authority was facing a ""perfect storm"". He said: ""We've had increased costs in adult social care, supplying PPE, making sure that workers cannot go from care home to care home. ""At the same time, we've lost car park income and leisure centre income which all helps to balance our budget."" However Councillor Whitehead said he was confident the government would come to the aid of councils. With the highest proportion of furloughed staff in Scotland, losing tourism income put extra pressure on Highland Council, its finance chief said About 230,000 people live in the Highlands but the area covers just under half the landmass of Scotland. Its main sources of income - tourist car parks, docking fees and the sale of marine fuel at its harbours - have been reduced to ""zero overnight"" as a result of the pandemic, Highland Council said. Head of finance Ed Foster said balancing its Â£96m deficit would not be possible ""without shed-loads of pain."" ""Because so much of our budget is tied up in staffing, in order to balance we would need to reduce headcount,"" he said. The BBC asked councils if they thought they would meet the criteria for issuing a section 114 notice. Barnet Council in London referred to a report from a committee meeting where it said the ""anticipated costs of the disruption remain within the available resources of the council, however without additional levels of funding, the council will move into significant risk of being unable to remain in balance should the period of disruption sustain"". A spokesman later stressed it did not anticipate a need to issue a section 114 notice, adding: ""We have financial reserves which are well in excess of the impact Covid-19 will have in the current year. ""This impact is being felt by all local authorities and we welcome the government support already received. We will remain in contact with the government about the importance of continued financial support for local authorities."" Alistair Jones, associate politics professor at the Local Governance Research Centre, De Montfort University in Leicester, said: ""Local governments are being left to flounder. ""The list of near-bankrupt councils is going to grow unless more support is available."" He said councils ""needed to be given more autonomy to raise their own revenue"" or further funding would be needed to support them in the long term. Alistair Jones said he was ""unsurprised"" councils were warning they could issue a section 114 notice Section 114 notices are issued in England when a council cannot achieve a balanced budget. In February 2018,Northamptonshire County Councilbecame the first local authority for almost 20 years to warn it may not meet its legal obligation to balance the books for that financial year. To cope with the coronavirus pandemic, councils revealed they were planning a mix of responses including using up cash reserves, reducing services and cancelling or postponing spending on big projects. The government was not aware of any English councils at ""imminent risk"" of issuing a section 114 notice, Jeremy Pocklington, the top official at the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Governmenttold MPs last week,external. Council bosses, however, previously said the funding they had received was ""not even close"" to covering the costs of what had already been spent during the pandemic. Mr Clarke said: ""We are working on a comprehensive plan to ensure councils' financial sustainability over the financial year ahead - we will continue to work closely with them to ensure they are managing their costs and we have a collective understanding of the costs they are facing."" A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""To date, Scotland's councils have received Â£405 million in advanced payments this financial year, and by the end of July this will have risen to Â£455 million. ""This funding, which included weekly advanced payments to councils until parliamentary approval was secured, will help prevent local authorities experiencing cash flow. Councils received an additional Â£150 million in May, Â£255 million in June, and will receive Â£50 million in July."" They added the Scottish government was working with local authorities and ""pressing the UK government for urgent additional funding and flexibility for our partners in local government."" Councillor James Jamieson, chairman of the Local Government Association, which represents councils' interests, said it was pleased the ""government had indicated it was working on a comprehensive plan to address the ongoing financial challenges,"" but ""urged the government to bring forward details... as soon as possible"".

US claims Huawei 'backed by Chinese military',"The US Defense Department has determined that 20 top Chinese firms, including Huawei, are either owned by or backed by the Chinese military. The list, seen by US media, features video surveillance firm Hikvision, China Telecoms, China Mobile and AVIC. The determination could lay the groundwork for new US financial sanctions against the firms. It comes as the US has pressured other countries, including the UK, to bar Huawei for national security reasons. The BBC understands that the list has been published in order to inform congressional committees, US businesses, investors and other potential partners of Chinese firms about the role such firms may play in transferring sensitive technology to the Chinese military. The list is also likely to grow. Under US law, the Defense Department is required to track firms ""owned or controlled"" by China's People's Liberation Army that are active in the US. Senator tells MPs Huawei puts US troops at risk Fresh UK review into Huawei role in 5G networks Eric Schmidt: Huawei has engaged in unacceptable practices The Pentagon has been under pressure in recent months from lawmakers of both the Democrats and Republican parties to publish and update the list. In November, US senators Tom Cotton and Chuck Schumer wrote a letter to Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, asking for an update on reviews of US policy that are mandated by the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 and the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act. Senators Chuck Schumer and Tom Cotton have called on the Commerce Department to investigate whether China has been stealing US technology with military applications In the letter,external, the senators emphasised their concerns about the danger of exporting critical US technologies to companies with Chinese ties. They also questioned why the Commerce Department had been slow to complete export-control reviews mandated by the two acts. The senators stressed that reviews should be conducted to assess whether the Chinese Communist Party had been stealing US technology with military applications, as well as whether it had been enlisting Chinese corporations to harness emerging civilian technologies for military purposes. ""What is the status of this review and implementation of the results? Will this review determine specific sectors of the US economy that the Chinese are targeting for espionage and forced technology-transfer efforts? Will you modify the scope of controls for military end uses and end-users in China? Will you make the results of this review public?,"" wrote Mr Cotton and Mr Schumer. ""We urge you to conduct these mandatory reviews as quickly and thoroughly as possible. Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter of national security."" The White House already taken several steps against Huawei and other Chinese firms, including barring US companies from selling them certain technology without permission. The administration has also said its trade war with China, which resulted in billions of dollars worth of tariffs, was a response to theft of US trade secrets. But it has faced calls by some in Washington to act more aggressively. Huawei has contested US claims against it as ""unsubstantiated allegations"".

CrossFit sold after George Floyd backlash,"The CrossFit fitness plan was developed by Greg Glassman CrossFit owner Greg Glassman has sold his fitness company, after stepping down as chief following outcry over remarks he made about George Floyd. The comments, in which he asked why he should mourn for Mr Floyd, had prompted athletes, gyms and sportswear firms to cut ties with the business. Incoming owner Eric Roza, a tech executive and co-founder of a successful CrossFit gym, said he would be ""working hard to rebuild bridges"". Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The value of the Crossfit business, which is based on a branded exercise regimen focused on high intensity workouts, has previously been estimated at about $4bn (Â£3.1bn). It is affiliated with about 13,000 gyms in 158 countries worldwide. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""In the past weeks, divisive statements and allegations have left many members of our community struggling to reconcile our transformative experiences in the local box with what we've been reading online,"" said Mr Roza, a former Oracle executive who is now working for US venture capitalists General Catalyst. ""My view is simple: Racism and sexism are abhorrent and will not be tolerated in CrossFit."" Tech executive Eric Roza credits CrossFit with changing his life a decade ago In early June, Mr Glassman had courted controversy by responding to a public health body on Twitter that was saying racism was a public health issue. Mr Glassman tweeted: ""It's FLOYD-19"", an apparent reference to the coronavirus. He followed it up with a second tweet saying: ""Your failed model quarantined us and now you're going to model a solution to racism? George Floyd's brutal murder sparked riots nationally."" He also called an affiliate ""delusional"" for questioning why CrossFit had been silent on the killing in Minneapolis. Hours before posting the fateful tweets, Mr Glassman had told gym owners on a private Zoom call that was leaked to reporters: ""We're not mourning for George Floyd - I don't think me or any of my staff are. ""Can you tell me why I should mourn for him? Other than that it's the white thing to do."" The comments prompted affiliate gyms to drop CrossFit branding and were rebuked by athletes, as well as Adidas-owned Reebok, which said it was ending its partnership with the brand. The backlash set off further reports that alleged incidents of sexism at the firm. In a statement this month,externalannouncing his retirement, Mr Glassman acknowledged that he had ""created a rift in the CrossFit community and unintentionally hurt many of its members"". He added: ""IÂ cannot let my behaviour stand in the way of HQ's or affiliates' missions. They are too important to jeopardise."" On Wednesday, in its announcement of the new owner, CrossFit shared a statement from Mr Glassman, which said it was ""time"" for him to move on. ""The world has changed but the magnificent human machine, the proven benefits of CrossFit, and its market opportunity remain unchanged,"" he said. Mr Glassman's retirement was the latest corporate fallout from the protests set off by George Floyd's death in the hands of police, which have reignited discussions of racism and prompted many firms to speak out.

Covid-19 antibody test lacks 'proper assessment',"Antibody tests are carried out in other countries, such as Russia Covid-19 antibody tests for NHS and care staff are being rolled out without ""adequate assessment"", experts warn. The tests could place an unnecessary burden on the NHS, the 14 senior academics say in a letter inthe BMJ,external. Last month, the government said it had bought 10 million antibody tests and asked NHS trusts and care homes to make them available to staff in England. Officials say the blood tests - to see if someone has had the virus - will play an ""increasingly important role"". Some patients and people having routine blood tests in England are being offered them too. They normally show if someone -  who has previously been unwell with a bug -  has developed antibodies that offer protection against future bouts of the illness. But how the immune system reacts to the Covid-19 virus remains uncertain. With the current laboratory tests, NHS England says, a positive result shows a person has had coronavirus. But crucially, it does not prove they have immunity against future attacks or whether they could transmit the virus to others. Smitha Mundasad, Health reporter The debate around antibody testing seems to centre on the potential benefits for an individual - versus the benefit to public health. What is clear is that when individuals get positive results they cannot let their guard down or change their behaviour. But antibody tests may help show how widespread the infection is, and give clues about who is most likely to get the virus and where. Some experts argue the best way to get this information is for the vast majority of antibody testing to take place in well-designed studies - rather than being offered to any health and care staff who want them. And a detailed review of evidence by the Cochrane group, suggests the timing of antibody tests is key - because if someone gets a test too early it may not work. The group suggests waiting at least two weeks after first getting symptoms. The team also concluded a lot of the studies published so far on antibody tests are too small. They are calling for better, larger, trials - particularly in people who have no or mild symptoms - to see how accurate the tests are in these groups. Nevertheless, health officials say gathering the results of these tests will help them understand more about the spread of disease. Public Health England has launcheda study of 10,000 healthcare workers,externalwhich involves antibody and other blood tests to learn more about immunity to the virus. The group of scientists say as a positive result is unable to prove immunity, the tests offer ""no benefit"" to hospitals and care staff. The results do not change what personal protective equipment staff must wear, for example. The academics also suggest there is little data on how well the test works for people at highest risk - including people belonging to some ethnic minorities and older patients. Instead, they call for other carefully designed strategies to help monitor the spread of the virus. Prof Sir John Bell from Oxford University, who has advised the government on antibody tests, said the academics who wrote to the BMJ had underestimated the value of the tests. ""We do need to know how many people out there have been infected and the only way to do this is antibody testing,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. But he said they were right to say there was not enough evidence that a positive test indicated immunity. ""You couldn't safely use it as a way of telling people whether they could be exposed or not,"" he said. Prof Martin Hibberd, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, described the tests as an important component of the public-health response. He added: ""If used successfully, the data generated will be important surveillance information for understanding the effectiveness of control measures put in place."" Meanwhile Dr Tom Wingfield, at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, said he shared the concerns raised in the academics' letter. He added: ""We don't yet have sufficient evidence on accuracy and interpretation of antibody tests."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen? A Public Health England official said all tests in the programme had been ""extensively validated by the manufacturers and have received CE marks"" indicating compliance with EU safety standards. Wales is currently working on its testing policies. Meanwhile, Scotland's chief medical officer has written to all health boards to say they should not offer ""on-demand"" antibody testing to NHS staff, care workers or patients.

Walsh: At last some good news,"It is a rare and welcome moment to be able to say something positive about the treatment of Covid-19. Until this week there was no medicine proven to save lives. Now we have dexamethasone, which cuts the risk of death for patients on a ventilator by a third, and for those on oxygen by a fifth. I seldom use the term ""breakthrough"", but it is worth it here. It came about due to the persistence and single-mindedness of a small team at Oxford University, the co-operation of hospitals across the UK and the agreement of thousands of patients and their families. The study that dexamethasone is part of is called Recovery - Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy. Clinical trials usually take months, even years to get under way and involve a few hundred patients. The Recovery trial was set up in nine days, and has recruited 11,500 Covid patients in 175 hospitals across the UK. Speed was vital in order to catch the rising wave of hospital admissions here and to do so before doctors were overwhelmed. The UK has had Europe's worst coronavirus outbreak with a terrible death toll. But that has also meant there were sufficient patient numbers here to create what is the world's biggest trial of Covid-19 treatments. The trial is led by Prof Peter Horby, who had spent recent years looking at how best to prepare for and respond to disease X, an unknown pathogen that could cause a pandemic. He told me he'd been frustrated that, during the last pandemic, of H1N1 swine flu, there was a ""massive failure to do proper drug trials"" and they emerged from it with ""zero evidence"" about whether any treatments actually worked. Horby and fellow lead investigator Prof Martin Landray were determined that would not happen with coronavirus. They decided to keep the trial simple. They would test a small number of repurposed or experimental drugs and ask one question - do they cut the risk of death? One of those drugs under evaluation in the randomised trial was low-dose dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory steroid which has been in use since the early 1960s. This was considered risky. At the start of the pandemic, most international guidelines strongly discouraged the use of steroids for Covid-19. Steroids had been tried during outbreaks of two other deadly coronaviruses, Sars and Mers, with mixed results. Dexamethasone is an immunosuppressive drug and there were fears it could make the illness worse, prolonging the infection, and increasing the likelihood of patients needing a ventilator. ""We had some senior doctors writing to us saying, 'You really shouldn't be doing this,' and that dampening down the immune system in patients trying to fight an infection was probably not a wise thing to do,"" says Landray. ""The reality was that nobody knew whether dexamethasone would be helpful or harmful."" What was missing, until now, was a randomised trial which was big enough to reach firm conclusions. This meant that some of the patients received dexamethasone, and their life or death outcomes were compared to those who did not. As the BBC's medical correspondent, I have reported on global disease threats such as bird flu, swine flu, Sars and Mers - both coronaviruses - and Ebola. You could say I've been waiting much of my career for a global pandemic. And yet when Covid-19 came along, the world was not as ready as it could have been. Sadly, we may have to live with coronavirus indefinitely. Here, I will be reflecting on that. The Recovery team was not expecting to release any results until July. But a week ago the data on dexamethasone came through. The findings were so good that they spent the next few days trying to break them. Did they really stack up? Was the data robust? Only when convinced the results were genuine did they rush out the findings. There are two distinct phases in coronavirus infection. Most people only undergo the first, where the virus invades the body and the immune system mounts an effective response. But for a minority, the disease alters about a week after infection. The immune system begins to overreact and cause inflammation. At this point it is not the virus, but the body's own response to infection which causes damage in the lungs and beyond. For some Covid patients the immune system can overreact and damage the lungs The trial found thatdexamethasonehelped only those hospital patients who needed oxygen or were on a ventilator. It appears to dampen the immune response, giving the lungs a better chance to recover It is not a magic bullet. On the Covid trial, 40 out of every 100 ventilated patients died. These were intensive care patients who were sedated and put on invasive ventilation, a machine that takes over your breathing for you.Dexamethasone reduced that number to 28, saving one life for every eight patients treated. For those on oxygen 25 out of every 100 patients died, but the drug cut that to about 20 in a 100. That is still a very high death toll. But it is a start and it will give hope to doctors, patients and their families. Better medicines may follow as a result. Overnight the drugbecame the standard of care and was given to all NHS Covid patientson oxygen or a ventilator. TheWorld Health Organization called it a ""lifesaving scientific breakthrough,external"", not least because the drug is  extremely cheap and used across the world for a range of conditions. The results were greeted with some scepticism in the US, where several experts said they would only accept them once all the data had been published and peer reviewed. In truth, top-line results of trials are often released at medical conferences, with full disclosure later. The Oxford team say they will publish the results within the next few weeks. The 20-strong Recovery team includes doctors, data analysts and medical statisticians So far, the only other drug proven to be effective against Covid-19 is the antiviral remdesivir. It has been shown to cut the duration of symptoms by about four days. In a trial of about 1,000 patients, those who received it had a slightly lower risk of dying, but it was not statistically significant. Remdesivir, which was developed by the US pharma company Gilead Sciences, has been in short supply. It was excluded from the Recovery trial as there were not enough doses available. Although Gilead is donating millions of doses during the pandemic, at one point it will need to set a price for the drug. One thing is sure, it won't be as cheap or as widely available as dexamethasone. The mental health crisis looming in ICU Was coronavirus here earlier than we thought? 'I was gobsmacked to test positive for coronavirus antibodies' The Recovery trial is also looking at another anti-inflammatory, as well as an HIV treatment, an antibiotic, and convalescent plasma from donors who've recovered from Covid-19. Last week themalaria drug hydroxychloroquinewas removed from Recovery after it showed no evidence of benefit. The WHO also halted its trials. Professors Horby and Landray are keen to stress that the Recovery trial is a team effort, involving about 20 staff in Oxford. Add to them the 3,500 doctors, nurses, research and admin staff across the UK who made the trial happen, and finally, the patients, without whom no medical progress would ever be made. Those who were well enough were asked to give their consent, and only after this did they find out whether or not they'd be getting a drug. In most cases it was their families who had to make that decision. With no hospital visits allowed, this was a leap of faith made by loved ones at a time of maximum stress. This video can not be played Katherine Millbank spent 15 days in hospital and was put on the drug trial ""I say to everyone involved that they should have a warm feeling about the results we are producing because this is how we advance medicine,"" says Prof Landray. The NHS is uniquely well placed to conduct large randomised trials, not just during pandemics but across all chronic diseases. So there are lessons to be learned here that could ultimately help patients with heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and a host of other conditions. Faster, bigger and simpler sometimes is the way to go. Follow@BBCFergusWalsh,externalon Twitter 40,000 DEATHS:Could they have been prevented? TESTING:Who can get a test and how?

Nurseries warn of 'mass closures' as lockdown lifts,"Nurseries are warning of ""mass closures"" which could leave parents struggling to find childcare when they return to work as the lockdown eases. England's early years providers have been operating at 37% of their capacity since early June when they were able to re-open, data analysts Ceeda has said. Providers will face huge losses if this continues at this rate, it said, and called for the government to step in. The government said it protected early years staff with job retention scheme. Childcare providers were ordered closed during lockdown until 1 June. Ceeda data, published by nursery sector body the Early Years Alliance, suggests nurseries are set to lose more than half their funding (55%) for every government subsidised three- and four-year-old place. For every two-year-old place, they stand to lose 68%. Lack of childcare 'forces key workers to stay home' And modelling suggests problems will continue even if parents start to send their children back in greater numbers. There are predicted to be significant shortfalls even if occupancy rates rise to 65%. Nurseries, pre-schools and childminders have been allowed to open to all children since 1 June. But due to the lockdown, they have had significantly reduced parental demand. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said the situation was ""simply not sustainable"". He said: ""Even in areas where parental demand for childcare places remains high, providers are currently restricted on how many children they can care for under government guidance, which is going to place even more financial pressure on them over the coming months. ""The early years sector is at a crunch point, and unless urgent action is taken, we are going to see many, many more settings forced to close their doors over the coming months. ""This could mean chaos for parents - and particularly mothers - trying to access childcare in order to return to work at a time when the government is desperately trying to restart the economy."" Ceeda managing director, Jo Verrill, said there was much rhetoric on the importance of early education, adding: ""Now more than ever, this must be matched by investment, if we are to protect the country's vital early years infrastructure.""

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The German Bundesliga returned in May - without fans in stadiums The return
of live events has been brought forward more than the Scottish government originally
planned for, Scotland's national clinical director confirms. It was not
thought these would be able to return until phase four but Proj Jason Leitch suggests sports events could begin behind closed down at the
beginning of August. The list of
indicative dates published today says it is unlikely this would happen before
23 July. Mr Leitch
says it is difficult give precise timescales at this stage  â but he would hope small crowds would be able to attend large venues in 2-3
monthsâ time. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's education secretary, John Swinney, has been accused of treating staff safety ""as an after thought"" and not engaging with trades unions as he plans an August return to school. Helen Meldrum, from the GMB, which represents cleaning, janitorial and catering staff, tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""We need more investment, more staff, PPE that's fit for purpose and sadly, as it stands at the moment, this is a Scottish government that is making the same mistakes as it made with social care."" She says a survey of staff last month found they were ""absolutely terrified about taking the virus into school and passing it to vulnerable children as well as taking it home"". ""The strategy so far for the educational recovery has been a compete shambles,"" she adds. ""There are just no safe plans or working practices in place yet and the prospect of 100% pupils back sounds even more unsafe for our members."" A Scottish government statement said that staff safety is paramount as it plans for the next academic year. Pubs are exploring apps that will let customers order drinks, and keep a record of their visit. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland One hotelier has had 220 bookings in four hours since opening the phone lines for business after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gave a provisional date for reopening. Stuart McPhee, of the Siberia Bar & Hotel in Aberdeen, tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""It is an Ikea moment. It is the next big thing that is opening up for people's lives. The struggle will be beyond that once the novelty dies off. ""I feel clear about the indicative dates and realise
they are not concrete, but it allows us to create some certainty for our
customers and ourselves."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland How do you
keep your business going when your key market is large events? Lynsey
Maxwell is the director of a catering company which normally serves parties.
But in the last few weeks the business has turned to delivering grazing boxes
for families to enjoy. âIt became
really popular. People send it as gifts, people order it for themselves. Itâs
great, itâs been very busy,â she tells Drivetime. What about
theatre? Actress Sarah Galbraith says her show Girls Night Oot has just
relaunched as Girls Night In â a ticketed Zoom event. âIt allows us
to bring our show to the masses without being in the theatre,â she explains. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Blair Drummond Safari Park, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary, is reopening Nearly 70% of Scotland's visitor attractions do not plan to take up the option of reopening on 15 July despite being given a provisional green light to do so by the Scottish government - and 15% have no plans to reopen by September. The figures have been revealed by Scottish Visitors Attractions chief executive Gordon Morrison, who tells BBC Radio Scotland that indoor sites, like museums and country houses, are the more reticent. ""There is a real concern about cost versus return when it comes to reopening,"" he says. The additional costs in adapting facilities to 2m social distancing, fears for the safety of older volunteers and a lack of international visitors were all factors among the 200 attractions that responded to a survey. ""The majority of outdoor sites, where you can experience grounds, gardens, zoos, wildlife parks, they are all raring to go,"" Mr Morrison adds. ""I would encourage people to visit these when they open because it is the only way they will be able to keep the doors open."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Many children's playgrounds have not been inspected during lockdown despite the Scottish government announcing that they can be reopened from Monday, an industry expert warns. Register of Playground Inspectors International board member Jon Dalton was asked on BBC Radio Scotland whether the facilities will be ready in time. ""It depends on what the playground owners have been doing in the meantime - some have just left them dormant, they have stopped inspecting,"" says. ""But playgrounds should be inspected on a regular basis. ""With playgrounds not being used, people have just not been inspecting them in our experience. ""Access will have been restricted in some way, so if the playground is open then it should be okay, but what we're saying as an organisation is that someone responsible for that playground gets in and checks it before they open it."" Hairdressing businesses in Scotland will be able to open next month - but it is unlikely to be business as usual. Norma Chesne from Uddingston in Lanarkshire, who has been cutting hair for over 30 years, has built a ""home studio salon"" in her garden which she says incorporates all the social distancing measures needed. Her protective equipment will include mask and visor, and she will see one client at a time. But, whatever the limitations, Norma can hardly wait to get started. ""I'm delighted,"" she said. ""I feel for my clients. ""They're all desperate to have their hair done. It's the feel-good factor. Plus I thoroughly enjoy doing it.""  Prof Pennington said the decision to reduce the distance is a political one The decision over the two-metre social distancing rule in Scotland is one of ""personality and politics"", a scientist has claimed. Prof Hugh Pennington said the decision to reduce the distance is a political one, given how new Covid-19 is and the fact advice being given to both administrations will be ""largely the same"". Writing in the Scottish Daily Mail,external, Prof Pennington said should there be a localised outbreak - in a place such as a bar - when the rule is relaxed then it could simply be shut down and the rest of the population will not be impacted. The first minister has said she has asked her scientific advisers to look into reducing the amount of social distancing in certain measures, with a report expected by 2 July. Prof Pennington said there is ""every reason"" Scotland should also reduce the social distancing rule. He wrote: ""But in my view there is absolutely no need for (Nicola Sturgeon's) caution. ""There is no reason we should not be following England and reducing the social distancing limit to one metre and every reason we should be in order to get the economy and education system going again. ""If we do see a localised outbreak of Covid, for example if there is an outbreak linked to a particularly busy pub, we can step in and close it down again. ""The whole country does not need to go back into lockdown."" He added: ""What we are seeing now is not about the science, it's about the personality and the politics."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Restrictions on travel for leisure and recreation will be relaxed on 3 July Scotlandâs
national clinical director urges people to continue following lockdown rules

College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. She tells
Drivetime it is important to review what has gone well and what hasnât so there
are better outcomes if a second wave occurs. It is very difficult to quantify what a second wave may look like, she explains, but she suggests it is likely there will be local outbreaks. These can be managed in a different way from full lockdown so long as management practices are in place, Prof Taylor adds. She says we will be living with the virus until a vaccine is rolled out â and until then we must ensure health and social care services work together and have the resources they require. Prof Taylor also insists on the importance of looking to lower the risk for vulnerable groups in particular, like those in the BME community, older people or the homeless. Allow Twitter content?

Eighteen patients who tested positive for coronaviruswere sent from North Tees hospitals into care homes as the pandemic worsened,it has emerged. Figures from North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust also revealed 311 people were discharged into homes without a Covid-19 test between 1 March and 15 April. After this date it was routine to test such patients for Covid-19 . Stockton North MP Alex Cunningham said the past stance on discharge was cause for ""grave concern"". A memorial for transport workers could be erected at London Victoria station in honour of Belly Mujinga,who died after being allegedly spat at by a man who claimed to have Covid-19. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps revealed he has been in discussions with trade unions over commemorating the 54 transport workers who have died from coronavirus. He told the Commons Transport Select Committee: ""I've spoken to the unions and others about doing something in slightly longer-term to commemorate transport workers' extraordinary input and effort to assist the country in this time of crisis, perhaps with some sort of commemoration or memorial. ""Perhaps even at Victoria station, where, sadly, Belly Mujinga worked but sadly died. ""I think that might be an appropriate location to remember all transport workers during this crisis."" The death of Mrs Mujinga sparked outrage and questions about why she was not protected at the time of the incident, which was not reported to British Transport Police (BTP) until seven weeks later.

While pubs and hairdressers in England have been given the all clear by government to reopen on 4 July,many businesses have been told to remain doors closed for now. Beautician Tara Williamson is frustrated by what she sees as a double standard from government, with hairdressers allowed to reopen but beauty salons staying closed. She runs The Beauty, Skin and Eyelash Lounge in Epping and had planned to open on 4 July. ""I don't really get it. I don't see a reason why we couldn't open and it will obviously be a big blow,"" she says. ""We've put screens in place, we've done a one-way system in the salon, we've prepared everything for the two metre distancing, we've staggered appointments, we've got sanitising stations,"" she says.

Lockdown party victim lobbied MPs on youth attacksThe family of Cheriff Tall - who was shot dead at the event in Moss Side - say they are 'broken'.Manchester,"""Knowing he was taken from us in such a brutal way has left us devastated,"" say Cheriff Tall's family A man shot dead at a lockdown party had lobbied MPs on youth violence, a youth worker has said. Cheriff Tall, 21, was one of two men killed by a lone gunmanat the ""unplanned"" eventin Manchester. Akemia Minott, who had known Mr Tall since he was six, said he had recently lost a close friend in a violent attack. The experience had inspired him to travel to London to raise the issue, she said. Ms Minott, a youth worker in Moss Side, where Sunday's event was held, said she felt ""extremely privileged"" to have known Mr Tall for 15 years. She described him as being from a ""loving family"" and known to friends as the ""joker in the pack"". He had ""been through so much in recent years"", she said. ""He's been to the Houses of Parliament with us, challenged MPs on what they're going to do about youth violence and how they are going to address situations,"" she said. ""Which is obviously incredibly sad when you look at what's happened."" Mr Tall's parents also paid tribute, describing him as a ""model son"" whose brutal death had left them devastated. In a statement, they said: ""Cheriff was loved and respected by his brothers and sisters and to say they are broken is an understatement."" Relatives said he was ""popular and well-liked"" with a ""strong sense of loyalty"" and ""would always try to help anyone who needed it"". His parents said they were grateful for all messages of condolences and support but they had ""a long road ahead"" to try to come to terms with the death of their son. Lola Ajose said her husband was an ""amazing man"" and ""an amazing father"" Abayomi Ajose, 36, was also gunned down at the event. His widow Lola Ajose described her husband as ""the best man"" and an ""amazing father"".

Walsh: At last some good coronavirus news,"It is a rare and welcome moment to be able to say something positive about the treatment of Covid-19. Until this week there was no medicine proven to save lives. Now we have dexamethasone, which cuts the risk of death for patients on a ventilator by a third, and for those on oxygen by a fifth. I seldom use the term ""breakthrough"", but it is worth it here. It came about due to the persistence and single-mindedness of a small team at Oxford University, the co-operation of hospitals across the UK and the agreement of thousands of patients and their families. The study that dexamethasone is part of is called Recovery - Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy. Clinical trials usually take months, even years to get under way and involve a few hundred patients. The Recovery trial was set up in nine days, and has recruited 11,500 Covid patients in 175 hospitals across the UK. Speed was vital in order to catch the rising wave of hospital admissions here and to do so before doctors were overwhelmed. The UK has had Europe's worst coronavirus outbreak with a terrible death toll. But that has also meant there were sufficient patient numbers here to create what is the world's biggest trial of Covid-19 treatments. The trial is led by Prof Peter Horby, who had spent recent years looking at how best to prepare for and respond to disease X, an unknown pathogen that could cause a pandemic. He told me he'd been frustrated that, during the last pandemic, of H1N1 swine flu, there was a ""massive failure to do proper drug trials"" and they emerged from it with ""zero evidence"" about whether any treatments actually worked. Horby and fellow lead investigator Prof Martin Landray were determined that would not happen with coronavirus. They decided to keep the trial simple. They would test a small number of repurposed or experimental drugs and ask one question - do they cut the risk of death? One of those drugs under evaluation in the randomised trial was low-dose dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory steroid which has been in use since the early 1960s. This was considered risky. At the start of the pandemic, most international guidelines strongly discouraged the use of steroids for Covid-19. Steroids had been tried during outbreaks of two other deadly coronaviruses, Sars and Mers, with mixed results. Dexamethasone is an immunosuppressive drug and there were fears it could make the illness worse, prolonging the infection, and increasing the likelihood of patients needing a ventilator. ""We had some senior doctors writing to us saying, 'You really shouldn't be doing this,' and that dampening down the immune system in patients trying to fight an infection was probably not a wise thing to do,"" says Landray. ""The reality was that nobody knew whether dexamethasone would be helpful or harmful."" What was missing, until now, was a randomised trial which was big enough to reach firm conclusions. This meant that some of the patients received dexamethasone, and their life or death outcomes were compared to those who did not. As the BBC's medical correspondent, I have reported on global disease threats such as bird flu, swine flu, Sars and Mers - both coronaviruses - and Ebola. You could say I've been waiting much of my career for a global pandemic. And yet when Covid-19 came along, the world was not as ready as it could have been. Sadly, we may have to live with coronavirus indefinitely. Here, I will be reflecting on that. The Recovery team was not expecting to release any results until July. But a week ago the data on dexamethasone came through. The findings were so good that they spent the next few days trying to break them. Did they really stack up? Was the data robust? Only when convinced the results were genuine did they rush out the findings. There are two distinct phases in coronavirus infection. Most people only undergo the first, where the virus invades the body and the immune system mounts an effective response. But for a minority, the disease alters about a week after infection. The immune system begins to overreact and cause inflammation. At this point it is not the virus, but the body's own response to infection which causes damage in the lungs and beyond. For some Covid patients the immune system can overreact and damage the lungs The trial found thatdexamethasonehelped only those hospital patients who needed oxygen or were on a ventilator. It appears to dampen the immune response, giving the lungs a better chance to recover It is not a magic bullet. On the Covid trial, 40 out of every 100 ventilated patients died. These were intensive care patients who were sedated and put on invasive ventilation, a machine that takes over your breathing for you.Dexamethasone reduced that number to 28, saving one life for every eight patients treated. For those on oxygen 25 out of every 100 patients died, but the drug cut that to about 20 in a 100. That is still a very high death toll. But it is a start and it will give hope to doctors, patients and their families. Better medicines may follow as a result. Overnight the drugbecame the standard of care and was given to all NHS Covid patientson oxygen or a ventilator. TheWorld Health Organization called it a ""lifesaving scientific breakthrough,external"", not least because the drug is  extremely cheap and used across the world for a range of conditions. The results were greeted with some scepticism in the US, where several experts said they would only accept them once all the data had been published and peer reviewed. In truth, top-line results of trials are often released at medical conferences, with full disclosure later. The Oxford team say they will publish the results within the next few weeks. The 20-strong Recovery team includes doctors, data analysts and medical statisticians So far, the only other drug proven to be effective against Covid-19 is the antiviral remdesivir. It has been shown to cut the duration of symptoms by about four days. In a trial of about 1,000 patients, those who received it had a slightly lower risk of dying, but it was not statistically significant. Remdesivir, which was developed by the US pharma company Gilead Sciences, has been in short supply. It was excluded from the Recovery trial as there were not enough doses available. Although Gilead is donating millions of doses during the pandemic, at one point it will need to set a price for the drug. One thing is sure, it won't be as cheap or as widely available as dexamethasone. The mental health crisis looming in ICU Was coronavirus here earlier than we thought? 'I was gobsmacked to test positive for coronavirus antibodies' The Recovery trial is also looking at another anti-inflammatory, as well as an HIV treatment, an antibiotic, and convalescent plasma from donors who've recovered from Covid-19. Last week themalaria drug hydroxychloroquinewas removed from Recovery after it showed no evidence of benefit. The WHO also halted its trials. Professors Horby and Landray are keen to stress that the Recovery trial is a team effort, involving about 20 staff in Oxford. Add to them the 3,500 doctors, nurses, research and admin staff across the UK who made the trial happen, and finally, the patients, without whom no medical progress would ever be made. Those who were well enough were asked to give their consent, and only after this did they find out whether or not they'd be getting a drug. In most cases it was their families who had to make that decision. With no hospital visits allowed, this was a leap of faith made by loved ones at a time of maximum stress. This video can not be played Katherine Millbank spent 15 days in hospital and was put on the drug trial ""I say to everyone involved that they should have a warm feeling about the results we are producing because this is how we advance medicine,"" says Prof Landray. The NHS is uniquely well placed to conduct large randomised trials, not just during pandemics but across all chronic diseases. So there are lessons to be learned here that could ultimately help patients with heart disease, diabetes, arthritis and a host of other conditions.

Airports giant set to halve UK workforce,"Swissport is set to cut more than half of its UK workforce as air companies struggle with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. The firm said it was consulting on cutting up to 4,556 jobs. Chief executive Jason Holt said the company had to reduce the size of its workforce to survive. Swissport operates at airports across the UK, including Heathrow and Gatwick, which are among those badly hit by the crisis. Air travel collapsed around the world after governments imposed travel restrictions during coronavirus lockdowns. Jet2 and Eurostar cut summer flights and trains Who's exempt from the quarantine rules? UK airlines warn quarantine will 'kill air travel' While some airlines are making plans to start flying some routes again as lockdowns lift, Swissport has said its revenue is forecast to be almost 50% lower than last year due to the crisis. Mr Holt said in a message to staff: ""We must do this to secure the lifeline of funding from lenders and investors to protect as many jobs as possible in the UK and Ireland. ""It's true that we've seen tough times before - volcanic cloud, 9/11, the financial crisis - and we've weathered these. But this time it's different. We have never seen anything like Covid-19 in our lifetimes. ""We are now facing a long period of uncertainty and reduced flight numbers, along with significant changes taking place to the way people travel and the way goods move around the world. ""There is no escaping the fact that the industry is now smaller than it was, and it will remain so for some time to come."" Swissport employs about 8,500 workers at airports, including baggage handlers and check-in staff. The GMB union said the announcement was ""devastating news"", with jobs set to be lost that were essential for regional economies. Unions are warning that the government needs to step in to prevent the air travel industry from collapsing Nadine Houghton, national officer of the GMB, said: ""With Swissport now considering job cuts on this scale, we have deep concerns about the viability of many of our regional airports and the benefits for regional connectivity that they bring."" Oliver Richardson, national officer of Unite, said: ""We can't wait any longer, the UK government needs to urgently intervene with a bespoke financial package and an extension of the 80% furlough scheme for the aviation industry."" The Unite union in Ireland confirmed that 287 workers at Belfast City Airport and Belfast International Airport face redundancy. ""This will be devastating news for these workers and their families. It is also entirely unnecessary - the government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme remains in place - these workers could continue to be furloughed. There is no need for any job-losses at this time. This is a disgraceful move solely rooted in the need to secure corporate profits,"" said George Brash, Unite Regional Officer for Swissport workers in Belfast. ""It is now absolutely imperative that we see urgent action in both Stormont and Westminster to safeguard our aviation sector, its workforce and the future of regional airports."" Staff at Swissport handle luggage after it's checked-in. They also de-ice and refuel planes and manage freight. The company provides essential services for most UK airports and airlines. Back in April Swissport UK warned it would have to slash thousands of jobs if more government support for the aviation sector was not forthcoming. This latest announcement demonstrates how the deep the damage to the aviation sector is. The pandemic has hit aviation hard and airlines and airports have already announced plans to scrap tens of thousands of jobs. The Department for Transport has consistently said that while the aviation sector is important to the UK economy, all firms, including aviation companies, should first explore existing government schemes and try to raise capital from investors before the government will consider the situation of individual firms. Industry association Airlines UK responded to Swissport's announcement by repeating its call for targeted government assistance for the sector. ""The need for a stimulus package of measures for the industry is now even more vital,"" said chief executive Tim Alderslade. Next Monday, the government is expected to make an announcement on international travel corridors, which would allow people from the UK to visit selected countries without having to face a 14-day quarantine on their return. Mr Alderslade welcomed that prospect, but added: ""The government needs to do much, much more to help a sector very much on its knees."" How are travel rules being relaxed?

Victim of lockdown party shooting a 'model son',"""Knowing he was taken from us in such a brutal way has left us devastated,"" say Cheriff Tall's family A man shot dead at a lockdown party had lobbied MPs on youth violence, a youth worker has said. Cheriff Tall, 21, was one of two men killed by a lone gunmanat the ""unplanned"" eventin Manchester. Akemia Minott, who had known Mr Tall since he was six, said he had recently lost a close friend in a violent attack. The experience had inspired him to travel to London to raise the issue, she said. Ms Minott, a youth worker in Moss Side, where Sunday's event was held, said she felt ""extremely privileged"" to have known Mr Tall for 15 years. She described him as being from a ""loving family"" and known to friends as the ""joker in the pack"". He had ""been through so much in recent years"", she said. ""He's been to the Houses of Parliament with us, challenged MPs on what they're going to do about youth violence and how they are going to address situations,"" she said. ""Which is obviously incredibly sad when you look at what's happened."" Mr Tall's parents also paid tribute, describing him as a ""model son"" whose brutal death had left them devastated. In a statement, they said: ""Cheriff was loved and respected by his brothers and sisters and to say they are broken is an understatement."" Relatives said he was ""popular and well-liked"" with a ""strong sense of loyalty"" and ""would always try to help anyone who needed it"". His parents said they were grateful for all messages of condolences and support but they had ""a long road ahead"" to try to come to terms with the death of their son. Lola Ajose said her husband was an ""amazing man"" and ""an amazing father"" Abayomi Ajose, 36, was also gunned down at the event. His widow Lola Ajose described her husband as ""the best man"" and an ""amazing father"". Father-of-three Mr Ajose, who was also known as Abi or Junior, worked for children's services at Manchester City Council.

CrossFit CEO quits after George Floyd remarks,"The CrossFit fitness plan was developed by Greg Glassman The chief executive of CrossFit has quit after causing offence with remarks about the death of George Floyd and the resulting protests. Greg Glassman stepped down after athletes, gyms and sportswear firms cut ties with his $4bn (Â£3.1bn) brand. Mr Glassman acknowledged having caused a ""rift"" in the CrossFit community. His exit came on the day of Floyd's funeral in Texas. The unarmed black man died last month after a policeman in Minneapolis knelt on his neck. CrossFit is a branded exercise regimen that involves high-intensity group workouts with a focus on strength and conditioning. Gyms around the world offer classes. Calls for racial justice at George Floyd's funeral In reply to a public health body saying racism was a public health issue, Greg Glassman tweeted on Saturday night: ""It's FLOYD-19"", an apparent reference to Covid-19. He followed it up with a second tweet saying: ""Your failed model quarantined us and now you're going to model a solution to racism? George Floyd's brutal murder sparked riots nationally."" He also called an affiliate ""delusional"" for questioning why CrossFit had been silent on the killing in Minneapolis. According to Buzzfeed, hours before posting the fateful tweets, Mr Glassman had told gym owners on a private Zoom call: ""We're not mourning for George Floyd - I don't think me or any of my staff are. ""Can you tell me why I should mourn for him? Other than that it's the white thing to do."" In a statement on Tuesday,external, Mr Glassman said: ""I'm stepping down as CEO of CrossFit, Inc, and I have decided to retire. ""On Saturday I created a rift in the CrossFit community and unintentionally hurt many of its members."" He added: ""IÂ cannot let my behaviour stand in the way of HQ's or affiliates' missions. They are too important to jeopardise."" This video can not be played George Floyd's niece: 'This is not just murder, but a hate crime' His statement was followed by another from Dave Castro, his successor at the helm of the company. The incoming CEO said: ""CrossFit is a community - one that is global, diverse, and tough."" He added: ""Our community is hurt, though. Our shared bond brings together millions of people with differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences."" Mr Glassman conceived the company as a high school gymnast in his parents' garage in California. It is now affiliated with an estimated 13,000 gyms worldwide. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? Hundreds of affiliate gyms have removed CrossFit from their branding. One of these gyms, Petworth Fitness in Washington DC - formerly CrossFit Petworth - wrote on Instagram: ""For a brand that has preached about being 'for all', the deafening silence on current and past issues of racism tells us all we need to know."" It added that it would donate its annual affiliate fee - $3,000 - to the Black Lives Matter DC and Know Your Rights anti-racist campaign groups. Adidas AG, which owns Reebok, also issued a statement confirming it was ending its relationship with CrossFit. ""Recently, we have been in discussions regarding a new agreement, however, in light of recent events, we have made the decision to end our partnership with CrossFit HQ,"" the company said in a statement to AFP news agency. Several CrossFit athletes also criticised the company. Four-time CrossFit Games champion Matthew Fraser praised a colleague for disaffiliating from the company, while Olympian and three-time CrossFit Games champion Tia-Clair Toomey said she was ""incredibly saddened, disappointed and frustrated"" with Mr Glassman's comments.

Take this quizto test your knowledge of the government's advice on coronavirus during the summer in the UK . Gym bosses say theyare ""extremely disappointed"" at the government's decision to allow pubs to reopenon 4 July but not indoor sports facilities. Humphrey Cobbold, head of the Pure Gym chain, told the BBC indoor gyms were not high risk for coronavirus and his sites were ready to reopen safely. And the boss of the David Lloyd group called the decision bizarre and illogical. The government hopes gyms can reopen in mid-July, subject to health guidance. The Theatre Royal in Newcastlehas followed its namesake in Plymouthin making a redundancy announcement. Theatres have been allowed to open from 4 July, but no live performances are allowed because of coronavirus restrictions. The venues are 400 miles apart and are not linked, apart from sharing a name. On Tuesday,the Devon theatre warnedthat 110 of its 350 jobs were at risk. A day later, the Newcastle venue said it had taken the ""the very difficult and heartbreaking decision"" to make 44 of its 89 staff redundant. The daily Downing Street news conferences became a fixture of the UK's coronavirus coverage. Now that they havebeen scrapped, here's a look back at the last three months' briefings. This video can not be played Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent Fancy a pint in the pub? From 4 July, you can have one - or indeed a mojito or an orange juice - in England. But you probably won't be able to stroll up to the bar and order what you fancy. And in many places, you may find you need an app for that. This video can not be played Davina de Campo: 'My house is now literally my theatre' Drag queen and singer Davina de Campo has explored how lockdown has affected the entertainment industry in his native West Yorkshire. The RuPaul's Drag Race UK runner-up has moved all of his events online due to the coronavirus, with many others forced to make similar adjustments. Theatres are now allowed to open from 4 July, but not with live performances. ""Our venues are going to look very different moving forward,"" de Campo said. Kathy, 39, is among the first of 300 volunteers who are taking part in this phase of the trial Three hundred healthy volunteers across England and the rest of the United Kingdomwill trial a new coronavirus vaccine,as part of studies by Prof Robin Shattock and his colleagues, at Imperial College London. It will be administered in two jabs, after tests in animals suggested the vaccine is safe and triggers an effective immune response. Experts at Oxford University have already started human trials. The trials are among many across the world - there are around 120 vaccine programmes under way. BBC Make A Difference Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Eighteen patients who tested positive for coronaviruswere sent from North Tees hospitals into care homes as the pandemic worsened,it has emerged. Figures from North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust also revealed 311 people were discharged into homes without a Covid-19 test between 1 March and 15 April. After this date it was routine to test such patients for Covid-19 . Stockton North MP Alex Cunningham said the past stance on discharge was cause for ""grave concern"". A memorial for transport workers could be erected at London Victoria station in honour of Belly Mujinga,who died after being allegedly spat at by a man who claimed to have Covid-19. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps revealed he has been in discussions with trade unions over commemorating the 54 transport workers who have died from coronavirus. He told the Commons Transport Select Committee: ""I've spoken to the unions and others about doing something in slightly longer-term to commemorate transport workers' extraordinary input and effort to assist the country in this time of crisis, perhaps with some sort of commemoration or memorial. ""Perhaps even at Victoria station, where, sadly, Belly Mujinga worked but sadly died. ""I think that might be an appropriate location to remember all transport workers during this crisis."" The death of Mrs Mujinga sparked outrage and questions about why she was not protected at the time of the incident, which was not reported to British Transport Police (BTP) until seven weeks later. Eurostar staff furloughed during the lockdown are helping London schools with online French lessons. Rail staff not currently working, including train drivers, have volunteered to help pupils learning at home online. Manon Folligan, is one of the Eurostar staff who's been volunteering with online French lessons. Three-year-old Amelia's hopes of returning to play at her local park in Wiltshire, once coronavirus restrictions had been lifted, looked pretty bleak, after an arson attack left it in charred ruins.

While pubs and hairdressers in England have been given the all clear by government to reopen on 4 July,many businesses have been told to remain doors closed for now. Beautician Tara Williamson is frustrated by what she sees as a double standard from government, with hairdressers allowed to reopen but beauty salons staying closed. She runs The Beauty, Skin and Eyelash Lounge in Epping and had planned to open on 4 July. ""I don't really get it. I don't see a reason why we couldn't open and it will obviously be a big blow,"" she says. ""We've put screens in place, we've done a one-way system in the salon, we've prepared everything for the two metre distancing, we've staggered appointments, we've got sanitising stations,"" she says. ""It just seems crazy that we have no guidelines of when we can open and what is going to be happening."" Martin LewesReporter A school in Cumbria says it has managed to accommodate all the children whose parents want them back in school for the final four weeks of term, with help from the Westmorland County Show The need to space out children and teachers to reduce the risk of infection has caused problems for many schools, but Grasmere Primary School's staff turned to the show organisers and asked if it was possible to hire marquees. Two marquees are now being used as extra classrooms for four year groups, and staff there say they've added extra enjoyment as well. One of the most unforgettable moments of lockdown wasthe fundraising achievement of World War Two veteran Captain Tom Moore. The 100-year-old walked the same number of laps of his garden to raise Â£32m for the NHS, in time for his landmark birthday in April. As part of the 100 days of Make A Difference project, Three Counties Radio started an idea which spread nationwide, to create a mosaic of photos submitted by the public. And, on this 100th day of the BBC campaign, Capt Tom was presented with the mosaic, along with his grandson Benjie. Pubs and restaurants reopening from 4 July should keep music at a low volume to avoid people needing to shout, which increases the risk of transmission from tiny droplets in the air, known as aerosols. Customers will be also encouraged to book in advance and order food and drink direct to their tables through a smartphone app. Pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers are among the venues which will be allowed to reopen in England Visitor attractions such as the Yorkshire Wildlife Park have only just reopened following the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Not only are the animals getting used to receiving 'guests' once again, but there is also the small matter of the day's heatwave. Â© 2025 BBC.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also said the five-mile travel limit will be lifted from 3 July, while beer gardens can re-open from 6 July. Hairdressers and barbers can open from 15 July, as can holiday accommodation. Ms Sturgeon said the move was possible thanks to the ""real sustained progress"" made in suppressing coronavirus.

Advisors are still reviewing whether the 2m (6ft 6in) physical distancing rule should be eased, but a range of different shops and services can now begin planning for re-opening in mid-July. The government'srevised routemap,externalsaid shopping centres and dental practices could fully re-open from 13 July, while optometrists can begin to scale up work. From 15 July, all holiday accommodation can open up, along with indoor areas of pubs and restaurants and hairdressers and barbers. These moves depend on safety measures being put in place, and hospitality businesses will have to retain contact details for customers for four weeks. Museums, galleries, cinemas and libraries will be allowed to resume business from the same date, as long as physical distancing and other safety measures are enforced. However live entertainment venues like theatres, nightclubs and bingo halls ""will not reopen until a later date"", while ""further consideration"" is being given to the opening of indoor gyms and restrictions on weddings and funerals. 29 June - Most non-essential shops, many indoor workplaces, visitor attractions including zoos, outdoor sports courts and playgrounds 3 July - Five mile travel distance relaxed, most self-catering holiday homes and second homes can be used 6 July - Outdoor hospitality such as beer gardens can reopen 10 July - People can meet in extended groups outdoors and with two other households indoors 13 July - Shopping centres can reopen, organised outdoor contact sports for children can resume, dentists can reopen for most routine care 15 July - Pubs, restaurants and all holiday accommodation can reopen, as can hairdressers, barbers, museums, cinemas, libraries and childcare Read more about the lockdown easing timeline here Ministers have already announced that they are planning forschools to return full-time from 11 Augustwith no physical distancing between pupils. Ms Sturgeon said that on 1 May, it was estimated that about 25,000 people in Scotland had the virus - but that she expected that figure to be ""around 2,000"" when new figures are published on Thursday. She said this was ""down to people doing the right thing and following the rules"", saying: ""The sacrifices that have been made have suppressed the virus, protected the NHS and undoubtedly saved a significant number of lives."" Scotland will not decide whether to follow England in relaxing the 2m rules until at least next week The first minister said Scots ""must not be complacent"" about the dangers of Covid-19, but said if progress continued to be made then ""the prize is getting greater normality back in our lives, maybe more quickly than we would have envisaged a few weeks ago"". Many of the changes mirrorthose announced for Englandby Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday, but with dates around two weeks later. Most Scottish council areas record zero Covid deaths Ms Sturgeon accepted that Scotland's pace in exiting lockdown ""is slightly slower than England's"", saying this was ""in my view right for our circumstances and I hope more likely to be sustainable than if we went faster"". The Scottish Conservatives said the delay ""will cost millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line"", saying that ""Scotland has to look on while the rest of the UK and Europe resumes normal life"". Ms Sturgeon said she was not prepared to take part in ""some kind of reckless race"" with other parts of the country, saying opposition attacks were ""grubby political opportunism at a time of national crisis"". None of the changes Nicola Sturgeon announced today take immediate effect. Instead she has offered a series of dates to pencil into our diaries - the promise of further freedoms to come. The first minister acknowledged that the pace of easing lockdown in Scotland is ""slightly slower"" than in England, but said she wanted to continue to move carefully to reduce the chance of a coronavirus resurgence. When (non-essential) high street retailers reopen on Monday in Scotland, similar shops in England will have been trading for a fortnight. But not everything is happening later here. If new plans for the full return of schooling go ahead in August - when Scottish schools normally go back from their summer break - Scotland could be the first part of the UK to achieve that. Everything is of course conditional on the continued suppression of the virus. The signs in Scotland are good, with a further reduction in the weekly number of virus-related deaths being reported by the National Records of Scotland today. Ms Sturgeon accused her opponents of ""grubby political opportunism"" Ms Sturgeon said each step towards easing lockdown ""depends on us continuing to beat the virus back"" and could potentially be reversed. She said: ""Our challenge, not an easy one, is to manage all of this change while keeping the virus firmly under control. If at any stage there appears to be a risk of its resurgence, our path out of lockdown will be halted and we may even have to go backwards. ""To avoid that, we must get as close as possible to elimination of the virus now, and build confidence in our ability to control it in future through surveillance, testing, contact tracing and, where necessary, targeted suppression measures."" Information leaflets about the government's contact tracing system are being delivered to every household in Scotland, while ministers are considering whether to make face coverings mandatory in shops.

Quiet music and orders via app for venues reopening,"Screens between customers are among the safety measures suggested for hairdressers Music should be kept quiet and customers encouraged to order through apps, under updated guidance for businesses reopening from 4 July. Pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers are among the venues which will be allowed to reopen in England. There is also advice to reconfigure seating, minimise self-service, cancel live acts and stagger arrivals. It comes after Boris Johnson announced sweeping changes to England's lockdown, including a relaxing of the 2m rule. Meanwhile, the latest figures show a further 154 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, across all settings, taking the total to 43,081. Lifting lockdown: A round-up Who are we allowed to meet up with? Is it safe to relax the 2m rule? The updated government guidance,externalincludes some general advice for all businesses as well as guidance for specific sectors. It says businesses should carry out a Covid-19 risk assessment to ensure the safety of their workplace, which should be shared on their website, and also develop cleaning and hygiene procedures. Guidance for close contact services such as hairdressers says employees should wear a visor where it is not possible to maintain distance and customers could also be separated from each other by screens. Places like pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers are asked to keep a temporary record of customers and visitors for 21 days, to support thetest and trace system. Pubs and restaurants should keep music at a low volume to avoid people needing to shout, which increases the risk of transmission from tiny droplets in the air, known as aerosols. Customers will be encouraged to book in advance and order food and drink direct to their tables through a smartphone app. Pubs are among the venues which will be allowed to open in England from 4 July Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he expected people to continue to use ""common sense"" and follow government guidelines. But he said there was a ""legal duty"" for businesses to keep their employees safe and the Health and Safety Executive could take action if not. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of trade union body the TUC, said the more the government relaxes lockdown ""the tougher it needs to get on health and safety at work"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it should be a legal requirement for employers to publish risk assessments on their website, adding too many companies were ""not doing the right thing"". Adam Regan, who runs the Hare and Hounds pub in Birmingham, said the guidelines were ""very, very difficult to navigate safely"". He told BBC Radio 5 Live extra staff would be needed to monitor entrances and serve tables, while some customers might not be comfortable giving their contact details on arrival. Mr Regan said another concern was that people would become more relaxed and less conscious of social distancing after drinking alcohol. What will a reopened pub actually be like? Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said while there was ""a lot to welcome"" in the guidance, ""ideally, small firms would have been given weeks rather than days to prepare for their reopenings"". He said the new measures would also bring extra costs for companies and called for government support to help businesses which could not afford to reconfigure their premises. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that while he supported the easing of the lockdown,a more effective test and trace system was needed for the plan to work safely. This video can not be played Boris Johnson is cheered as he announces English pubs can reopen from 4 July In the biggest easing of lockdown yet, Mr Johnson also said the 2m social-distancing rule would be replaced with a ""one-metre plus"" rule in England. This means people should stay at least 2m (6ft) apart where possible, but otherwise should remain at least 1m apart while taking steps to reduce the risk of transmission, such as wearing face coverings. The 2m rule will remain in Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland,ministers have said social distancing of 1m is ""safe and appropriate"" for children at school. Announcing the changes on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the following venues would be able to reopen from 4 July: Pubs, bars and restaurantsbut only with a table service indoors, and owners will be asked to keep contact details of customers to help with contact tracing Hotels, holiday apartments, campsites and caravan parksbut shared facilities must be cleaned properly Theatres and music hallsbut they will not be allowed to hold live performances In other changesweddingswill be allowed to have 30 attendees, andplaces of worshipwill be allowed to hold services but singing will be banned Hair salonsandbarberswill be able to reopen but must have protective measures, such as visors, in place Libraries, community centresandbingo halls Cinemas,museumsandgalleries Funfairs, theme parks, adventure parks, amusement arcades, outdoor skating rinksandmodel villages Indoor attractions where animals are exhibited, such as atzoos,aquariums,farms,safari parksandwildlife centres Some other venues will remain closed by law, including nightclubs, casinos, indoor play areas, nail bars and beauty salons, swimming pools and indoor gyms. It comes asstruggling retailers must pay their quarterly rentto landlords on Wednesday. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowdensaid in a tweet,externalthat the government's ""aspiration"" was to reopen gyms and leisure facilities in England in mid-July. However, Mark Sesnan, chief executive of Greenwich Leisure, which runs leisure centres for councils across the country, said he was ""shocked and disappointed"" that such sites would not be allowed to reopen on 4 July. ""We had been led to believe that we would be,"" he told the BBC, adding that the company had ""incurred quite a lot of expense"" getting facilities ready. He said most swimming pools and sports halls were ""very large spaces"", making social distancing easier. Scientists also say chlorinated water should kill the virus. What might swimming pools be like after lockdown? Anger as indoor sports facilities remain closed Why are gyms still closed? And other questions The shops that won't be reopening The Betting and Gaming Council said it was ""inconsistent and frankly nonsensical"" that casinos were not able to reopen along with other parts of the hospitality industry. ""Casinos have done everything that they were asked to do by the government and they have pulled out all the stops to ensure they are able to open their doors safely for both staff and customers from 4 July,"" chief executive Michael Dugher said. Mr Sharma said he understood the ""frustration"" of businesses that were not yet allowed to reopen but ""the proximity that you have to someone in some of these closer settings"" posed ""a greater risk"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen? In Scotland, outdoor hospitality areas such as beer gardens will be able to open on 6 July, while shopping centres, holiday accommodation, hairdressers, pubs and restaurants will be able to reopen on 15 July. There is not yet a date for when pubs and restaurants might reopen in Wales, although the government has said discussions on a potential phased reopening will be held in July. In Northern Ireland, hotels, pubs and restaurants can reopen from 3 July.

Virus impact on economy worse than predicted - IMF,"New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to quarantine people coming from hard-hit US states The move comes as half of US states are seeing a surge in new cases The IMF says economic activity in 2020 is likely to decline by almost 5% - almost double the April prediction The UK economy may contract by 10% - but Italy, France and Spain will be worse off Globally there are now 9.2 million cases and almost 477,000 deaths More than 100,000 people have now died in Latin America Health experts are saying infection rates still have not peaked in many countries Hamish Mackay Thatâs it for our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today. Thanks for joining us. Weâll be back on Thursday with more live updates from the UK and around the world. Today's coverage was brought to you by Hamish Mackay, Claudia Allen, Joshua Nevett, Mal Siret, George Bowden, Victoria Lindrea, Hugo Bachega, Joshua Cheetham, Vanessa Buschschluter, Toby Luckhurst, Krutika Pathi, Yvette Tan and Owen Amos. In case you missed them, these were some of the biggest developments of the day: We reported earlier on the Welsh food factory linked to almost 100 coronavirus cases. Now a further factory in Cambridgeshire, England, has closed for deep cleaning after 14 positive test results among staff. Health ministers have said coronaviruses thrive in cold, damp environments and survive for longer indoors and particularly on smooth surfaces - but not food itself. This is believed to pose a particular challenge to the food manufacturing industry. Outbreaks at food factories and wholesale food markets have also been reported in Germany and China. Read morehere. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent Fancy a pint in the pub? From 4 July, you can have one - or indeed a mojito or an orange juice - in England. But you probably won't be able to stroll up to the bar and order what you fancy. In many places, you may find you need an app for that. The government has published alengthy document, giving guidance to restaurants, pubs and takeaways,externalon all the measures they will need to take to operate safely. You can read analysis of those measures here. A food factory in Wales is linked to nearly 100 cases of coronavirus. The country's health minister has confirmed that 97 people have now tested positive after staff became ill at Rowan Foods. One trade union has accused the company of not dealing with health and safety concerns urgently. Two other food processing plants have had confirmed cases in Wales, with the largest number at 2 Sisters in Anglesey. Read morehere. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Crowds gathered to watch a spectacular military display as Russia celebrated the 75th anniversary of its victory over the Nazis in World War Two. The parade had been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, but President Vladimir Putin recently declared it safe to go ahead - despite the fact that the virus is still present in Russia. Watch as thousands of soldiers marched across Red Square in Moscow. This video can not be played Russia WW2 parade goes ahead despite coronavirus fears The number of reported coronavirus deaths in France rose by 11 to 29,731 on
Wednesday, down sharply from Tuesday, when the weekly data for
nursing homes were included. It is the lowest increase in Covid-19 fatalities in five
days. France's death toll is the fifth-highest in the world.

Masood Khan spent weeks on a ventilator in Wakefield's Pinderfields Hospital in England, cared for by ICU nurse Jackie Wright among others, but is now beginning to recover. ""I had a tube in my throat and I couldn't speak for two months,"" Masood says. ""It was very difficult, it was very painful."" ""He was probably one of the sickest patients that we've ever had,"" Jackie reflects. Demand for transport of all kinds has dropped to historic lows during the coronavirus pandemic. In response to this dip in demand,airline Jet2 and rail firm Eurostar have said they will scale back their flights and trains this summer. Eurostar said its train timetable would focus on routes between major cities such as London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, where demand was highest. Eurostar's direct summer services to Lyon, Avignon and Marseilles, which were meant to start in May, will no longer run at all in 2020 or 2021. Jet2 said it would be reducing its flying programme for 2020 and 2021, citing ""complicated"" challenges relating to the coronavirus crisis and ""changes on an almost daily basis"". ""Sadly, the overall effect of these reductions has been the need to propose a number of colleague redundancies across our business,â the airline said. The airline is proposing to cut 102 pilot jobs, the pilots' union Balpa said on Wednesday. Bournemouth beach was especially busy on Wednesday evening People in the UK are enjoying the country's warmest day of the year so far by flocking to beaches on the south coast of England. Pictures show busy beaches in Brighton and Bournemouth, where thousands of sun and sea enthusiasts are enjoying the exceptionally hot weather. Temperatures hit a high of 28C in Bournemouth - but it was hotter still in other parts of England People in England have been able to travel across the country to spend time outdoors since last month as part of a gradual easing of coronavirus restrictions. A beach in Brighton on England's south coast Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The outbreak in the Americas has not yet peaked, with an increase in cases of between 25% and 50% in the last week, the head of health emergencies for the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Mike Ryan, has said. Dr Ryan said the virus exploited ""weak health systems"" and ""poor government"", and said that for governments to understand how to tackle the outbreak, they needed to look at the actions of countries which had succeeded in suppressing transmission. Dr Mike Ryan, the head of emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO), has praised the UK for the way it is easing restrictions. He said there had been a ""steady, slow and step-wise exit from lockdown conditions"" in the country. Dr Ryan said the government had communicated the changes to the population at large and to the WHO â with a consistent dialogue between the four nations of the UK over regional differences. He said testing in the UK had now increased and the ""surveillance system is capable of understand where the disease is"". His comments came after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the next level of lockdown easing would take place on 4 July, when businesses such as pubs and restaurants can reopen under government guidelines. The US states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will require visitors from Covid-19 hotspots elsewhere in the country to quarantine for 14 days, officials have said. The governors of the three north-eastern states - once coronavirus hotspots themselves - announced the joint travel advisory today. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he did not want visitors from other states bringing Covid-19 in with them, because ""we worked very hard to get the viral transmission down"". The quarantine rule will apply to visitors from states where 10% of the population is infected with Covid-19 on a seven-day rolling average, Mr Cuomo said. Nine states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Texas, currently meet that high infection rate threshold. The quarantine will come into effect on Thursday. With more than 31,000 deaths and 412,000 cases to date, New York was the epicentre of the pandemic at one stage, but now other southern and western states are seeing a rise in infections. This video can not be played Covid-19: A brief look back at the government briefings The daily Downing Street news conferences became a fixture of the UK's coronavirus coverage - and on previous days, we would have just finished one at about this time. But now that they havebeen scrapped, here's a look back at the last three months' briefings. Around 45,000 runners usually take part in the marathon every year Another major event has been cancelled because of the pandemic: this year's Berlin Marathon in Germany. Organisers say the event - originally scheduled to take place on 26-27 September - will not go ahead citing Covid-19 restrictions and health concerns. They say holding the marathon was not possible given the German government's social-distancing rules. And, following a review, they decided the event could not be held at a later date this year either. ""As hard as we have tried, it is currently not possible to organise the BMW Berlin-Marathon with its usual Berlin charm,"" the organisers said. ""Your health, as well as all of our health, is our first priority."" Around 45,000 runners usually take part in the marathon every year in the German capital. Earlier, we reported that this year's marathon in New York had been scrapped also because of the pandemic. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine trials in Africa: What you need to know Scientists are scrambling to develop an effective vaccine against Covid-19, with trials taking place worldwide. One of those trials is being carried out in South Africa, where a vaccine made by Oxford University is being tested. Scientists say that it is vital for Africans to take part in these trials, arguing that not doing so could jeopardise efforts to find a vaccine that works across the globe. But critics cite a history of Western exploitation of Africa and unethical drug trials in the past as a reason not to participate. Why are vaccine trials such a sensitive issue in Africa? BBC Africa's Joice Etutu explains in the video above. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was ""confident"" that an arrangement could be reached US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said he is ""confident"" the US and the EU will be able to agree arrangements for the resumption of international travel. There have been reports that the European Union could block Americans from resuming travel to EU countries because of the prevalence of coronavirus in the US. Pompeo told reporters: ""I'm confident that we'll find a set of conditions that create sufficient health and safety protection. ""We're working on finding the right way to do that, the right timing to do it, the right tactics to have in place. We certainly don't want to cause problems any place else."" We have more on the EU discussions here. Volunteers have begun being immunised with a new UK coronavirus vaccine. About 300 people will have the vaccine over the coming weeks, as part of a trial led by Prof Robin Shattock and his colleagues, at Imperial College London. Tests on animals suggest the vaccine is safe and triggers an effective immune response. Many traditional vaccines are based on a weakened or modified form of virus, but the Imperial vaccine is based on a new approach, using synthetic strands of genetic code, called RNA, which mimic the virus. There are more than 120 coronavirus vaccines in early development across the world. A further 13 are now in clinical trials: five in China, three in the United States, two in the UK, one in Australia, Germany and Russia. Vaccine teams are keen to stress that they are not in a race against each other, but against the virus. If there are to be enough doses to protect the world, several vaccine approaches will need to be successful,writes the BBC's medical correspondent Fergus Walsh. Dr Tedros said rising case numbers were a ""sober reminder"" of our responsibilities The World Health Organization (WHO) says it expects to see the number of cases of Covid-19 reach 10 million within the next week. ""More than 9.1 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to the WHO, and more than 470,000 deaths,"" the health body chief, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told reporters in Geneva. ""In the first month of this outbreak, less than 10,000 cases were reported. In the last month, almost four million cases have been reported. ""We expect to reach a total of 10 million cases within the next week."" He called it a ""sober reminder"" of our ""urgent responsibility to do everything we can... to suppress transmission and save lives"". The Americas have become the epicentre of the pandemic.Find out more about where cases are still rising. Vivienne NunisBusiness reporter, BBC News Louise Parkinson runs a cleaning business in Chippenham, Wiltshire Cleaners across England are facing huge financial challenges as a result of the pandemic Since the lockdown, lots of people have stopped using cleaning services. Some simply can't afford the additional cost, while others find it too much of a disruption to have people cleaning the house while they're working and educating children from home. And some clients are shielding or worried about the risk of catching Covid-19 from workers entering their properties. Where the work has continued, many businesses have been left to come up with their own safety protocols. Husband-and-wife team Liam and Louise Parkinson, who are based in Chippenham, Wiltshire, say their customer base has been reduced ""from 30 customers down to one or two"" becuase of the pandemic. Cleaning staff are permitted to work in people's homes, but industry leaders say there hasn't been clear guidance from the government advising cleaners how to keep themselves and their clients safe. ""There's nothing that we can adhere to, we've just got to decide for ourselves what's appropriate,"" says Stephen Munton, director of the trade body the Domestic Cleaning Alliance.

West Bengal was going to ease its lockdown on 30 June The Indian state of West Bengal has extended its lockdown until 31 July to stem the spread of Covid-19 after a spike in infections nationwide. The lockdown in the eastern state was supposed to expire on 30 June. But as new infections continue to rise across the country, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, said it was necessary to keep restrictions in place to ""help the entire nation"". Schools, colleges and universities would remain shut as part of the continued curbs, but some relaxations would go ahead, the minister said. India's infections jumped by almost 16,000 to more than 456,000 on Wednesday, the highest daily rise in the country. The death toll stands at more than 14,000. There have been 14,728 confirmed cases and 580 deaths in West Bengal. In the capital Delhi, which reported a record daily increase on Wednesday with 3,788 new cases, soldiers have been deployed to assist medics in treating Covid-19 patients.

Brooklyn Nine-Nine bins episodes after Floyd death,"Terry Crews hosts America's Got Talent as well as starring in Brooklyn Nine-Nine Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Terry Crews has said four new episodes of the police comedy were thrown ""in the trash"" in the wake of the death of George Floyd. Crews said the show would ""start over"" in light of the anti-racism protests. He said: ""We've had a lot of sombre talks about it and deep conversations and we hope through this we're going to make something that will be truly groundbreaking this year. ""We have an opportunity and we plan to use it in the best way possible."" Co-creator Dan Goor had four episodes ""all ready to go"" before Mr Floyd's death a month ago prompted widespread Black Lives Matter protests as well as soul-searching in society in the US and beyond, Crews said. ""They just threw them in the trash,""he told Access Hollywood,external. ""We have to start over. Right now we don't know which direction it's going to go in."" Crews (second right) with the rest of the cast of Brooklyn Nine-Nine Brooklyn Nine-Nine follows the exploits of a team of detectives in the fictional 99th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. In 2014 it won two Golden Globe Awards, including best TV comedy series. Crews did not give details of the content of the four scrapped episodes. The actor and America's Got Talent presenter also recounted his own dealings with the police, saying police officers had pointed guns at him, mistakenly, before he became a well-known face.

Single mums take legal action against government,"The mothers say they are struggling to provide for their children Four single mothers have told the government they are seeking a judicial review into unpaid child maintenance. The women said they wanted to ""challenge the persistent failure"" of the Child Maintenance Service. Latest figures show Â£354m is owed by absent parents, but less than 10% of that has been clawed back. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), which runs the service, said anyone ""abusing the system at this difficult time"" could face prosecution. The women, from Yorkshire, London, Surrey and the North West, said they were owed payments of between Â£2,000 and Â£8,000 dating back a number of years. They have notified the DWP that they intend to seek a judicial review after they were left in ""financial difficulty and, in some cases, in poverty"". The mothers are being supported by the charity Gingerbread and parenting website Mumsnet They have told how they have to use food banks, take on credit card debt and rely on other people's generosity in order to keep their children clothed and fed. In-work poverty hits 2.9 million children More news and stories from across Yorkshire Children 'face poverty over lockdown support cuts' One mother, who lives near Selby in North Yorkshire, said: ""My children go without every single day because their father absolutely refuses to put his hand in his pocket and the Child Maintenance Service, despite having a huge raft of powers at its disposal, does nothing meaningful to force him to cough up. ""Birthday money sent to my boys by relatives is saved up and spent on necessities like school shoes, instead of them being able to have a little treat of their choosing. ""I go without so my children don't. I never go out, I never spend money on myself - I'd rather use the little we have so they can go on things like school trips. I don't want my boys to be stigmatised."" One mother says she is owed more than Â£8,000 Gingerbread, a charity which works with single parent families, said it was supporting the women in their legal action. According to the charity, the Child Maintenance Service has collected little over Â£30m through enforcement actions, which is less than 10% of what is owed to single parents across the UK. Charity chief executive Victoria Benson said: ""It is a child's legal right to be supported by both parents, and yet the service designed to protect this right is failing them. ""It simply cannot be right that a government service is responsible for leaving children of single parents in poverty."" According to Gingerbread, there areabout 1.8 million single-parent households.and about 90% of single parents are women. A spokesperson for the DWP said: ""No-one will get away with giving false information to avoid paying what they owe and all decisions carry rights of appeal, so either parent can dispute a decision. ""Those found to be abusing the system at this difficult time will find themselves subject to the full extent of our enforcement powers - including prosecution through the courts.""

UK must prepare for second wave - health leaders,"Boris Johnson announced further easing of lockdown measures on Tuesday Health leaders are calling for an urgent review to determine whether the UK is properly prepared for the ""real risk"" of a second wave of coronavirus. In an open letter published in theBritish Medical Journal,external, ministers were warned that urgent action would be needed to prevent further loss of life. The presidents of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons, Nursing, Physicians, and GPs all signed the letter. It comes after Boris Johnson announced sweeping changes to England's lockdown. The Department of Health said it would continue to be guided by the latest scientific advice and would give the NHS ""whatever it needs"". Meanwhile, the latest figures show a further 154 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, across all settings, taking the total to 43,081. Why are swimming pools still closed? Your questions answered On Tuesday, the prime minister said pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers will be able to reopen from 4 July. The 2m social-distancing rule will be replaced with a ""one-metre plus"" rule, meaning people should stay at least 2m apart where possible, but otherwise should remain at least 1m apart while taking steps to reduce the risk of transmission, such as wearing face coverings. The 2m rule will remain in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, however. Both the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and the chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty stressed Mr Johnson's plan was not ""risk-free"" at Tuesday'sfinal daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing. New guidance for businesses in England Lifting lockdown: A round-up Is a second wave of coronavirus on the way? Following the announcement, health leaders called for a ""rapid and forward-looking assessment"" of how prepared the UK would be for a new outbreak. ""While the future shape of the pandemic in the UK is hard to predict, the available evidence indicates that local flare-ups are increasingly likely and a second wave a real risk,"" they wrote. ""Many elements of the infrastructure needed to contain the virus are beginning to be put in place, but substantial challenges remain."" The authors of the letter, also signed by the chair of the British Medical Association, urged ministers to set up a cross-party group with a ""constructive, non-partisan, four nations approach"", tasked with developing recommendations. ""The review should not be about looking back or attributing blame,"" they said, and instead should focus on ""areas of weakness where action is needed urgently to prevent further loss of life and restore the economy as fully and as quickly as possible"". Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the liaison committee, told BBC Two's Politics Live he supported a ""lessons learned"" enquiry and had broached the subject with the government following the BMJ letter. He said it wasn't a ""full-blooded inquiry but ""about setting up a process that learns lessons"". He said: ""If you look at the papers the Cabinet Office had going into this [pandemic], there was nothing about massive PPE procurement; there was nothing about massive tracking and tracing and testing; there was nothing about a lockdown. ""This has turned out to be a massively different pandemic than the government was prepared for."" Former Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett that he did not think it was the right time for a public inquiry, which would take up a lot of ministerial time. But he thought there was a ""very real risk"" of a second wave. Pointing to an outbreak at a meat processing plant in Germany and South Korea having to trace 1,700 contacts after an incident at a nightclub, he said: ""In the places which are the best in the world they are dealing with these spikes and we have to recognise there is a very real risk of that here too."" Talk of a dreaded second wave will dominate the coming weeks and months. The UK will need to be prepared for one. But as the health leaders acknowledge, it's not possible to predict for sure if one will actually happen. What is certainly a given, is there will be local flare-ups where we see clusters of infections in places. This has already happened in Leicester, Anglesey and Cleckheaton. But what is important to recognise is that the UK is in a completely different position to where it was in March when the first wave hit. Testing capacity has gone from a few thousand a day to 200,000 to identify those infected. There is a network of contact tracers to find those that might be infected. There are still weaknesses - some tests take too long to turn around, while the tracing system is still bedding in and the app is not ready. But there is a realistic chance if these continue to improve and, importantly, the public keeps playing its part by both continuing to adhere to social distancing and complying with requests to self-isolate if they test positive or are identified as a close contact of an infected person, that the virus will be largely kept at bay. Read more analysis from Nickhere. A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""Thanks to the dedication of NHS staff, hospitals have not been overwhelmed and intensive care capacity continues to meet the needs of patients. ""Effective local management of any outbreak is the first line of protection against a second wave. In the event the local response is not sufficient to contain outbreaks, the government would reintroduce measures if necessary to contain the virus and stop it spreading to the wider population."" Is it safe to relax the 2m rule? Who are we allowed to meet up with? In the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said he did not believe there was ""a risk of a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the NHS"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson is cheered as he announces English pubs can reopen from 4 July Announcing the biggest easing of lockdown yet, he said two households in England would be able to meet indoors and stay overnight - with social distancing. He warned all the steps were ""reversible"" but confirmed the following venues could reopen: Pubs, bars and restaurantsbut only with a table service indoors, and owners will be asked to keep contact details of customers to help with contact tracing Hotels, holiday apartments, campsites and caravan parksbut shared facilities must be cleaned properly Theatres and music hallsbut they will not be allowed to hold live performances In other changesweddingswill be allowed to have 30 attendees, andplaces of worshipwill be allowed to hold services but singing will be banned Hair salonsandbarberswill be able to reopen but must have protective measures, such as visors, in place Libraries, community centresandbingo halls Cinemas,museumsandgalleries Funfairs, theme parks, adventure parks, amusement arcades, outdoor skating rinksandmodel villages Indoor attractions where animals are exhibited, such as atzoos,aquariums,farms,safari parksandwildlife centres Some other venues will remain closed by law, including nightclubs, casinos, indoor play areas, nail bars and beauty salons, swimming pools and indoor gyms.

Professor John Edmunds, who attends Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) meetings, said the switch to ""one metre-plus"" restrictions, plus the reopening of pubs and restaurants, meant a risk ""transmission will take off again"" and the Test and Trace system had to be ""working well"" to stamp out infections.

Quiet music and orders via app for venues reopeningPubs and hairdressers are among the places which will be allowed to reopen in England from 4 July.UKComments,"Screens between customers are among the safety measures suggested for hairdressers Music should be kept quiet and customers encouraged to order through apps, under updated guidance for businesses reopening from 4 July. Pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers are among the venues which will be allowed to reopen in England. There is also advice to reconfigure seating, minimise self-service, cancel live acts and stagger arrivals. It comes after Boris Johnson announced sweeping changes to England's lockdown, including a relaxing of the 2m rule. Meanwhile, the latest figures show a further 154 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, across all settings, taking the total to 43,081. Lifting lockdown: A round-up Who are we allowed to meet up with? Is it safe to relax the 2m rule? The updated government guidance,externalincludes some general advice for all businesses as well as guidance for specific sectors. It says businesses should carry out a Covid-19 risk assessment to ensure the safety of their workplace, which should be shared on their website, and also develop cleaning and hygiene procedures. Guidance for close contact services such as hairdressers says employees should wear a visor where it is not possible to maintain distance and customers could also be separated from each other by screens. Places like pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers are asked to keep a temporary record of customers and visitors for 21 days, to support thetest and trace system. Pubs and restaurants should keep music at a low volume to avoid people needing to shout, which increases the risk of transmission from tiny droplets in the air, known as aerosols. Customers will be encouraged to book in advance and order food and drink direct to their tables through a smartphone app. Pubs are among the venues which will be allowed to open in England from 4 July Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he expected people to continue to use ""common sense"" and follow government guidelines. But he said there was a ""legal duty"" for businesses to keep their employees safe and the Health and Safety Executive could take action if not. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of trade union body the TUC, said the more the government relaxes lockdown ""the tougher it needs to get on health and safety at work"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it should be a legal requirement for employers to publish risk assessments on their website, adding too many companies were ""not doing the right thing"". Adam Regan, who runs the Hare and Hounds pub in Birmingham, said the guidelines were ""very, very difficult to navigate safely"". He told BBC Radio 5 Live extra staff would be needed to monitor entrances and serve tables, while some customers might not be comfortable giving their contact details on arrival. Mr Regan said another concern was that people would become more relaxed and less conscious of social distancing after drinking alcohol. What will a reopened pub actually be like? Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said while there was ""a lot to welcome"" in the guidance, ""ideally, small firms would have been given weeks rather than days to prepare for their reopenings"". He said the new measures would also bring extra costs for companies and called for government support to help businesses which could not afford to reconfigure their premises. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that while he supported the easing of the lockdown,a more effective test and trace system was needed for the plan to work safely.

Quiet music and orders via app for venues reopeningPubs and hairdressers are among the places which will be allowed to reopen in England from 4 July.,"Screens between customers are among the safety measures suggested for hairdressers Music should be kept quiet and customers encouraged to order through apps, under updated guidance for businesses reopening from 4 July. Pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers are among the venues which will be allowed to reopen in England. There is also advice to reconfigure seating, minimise self-service, cancel live acts and stagger arrivals. It comes after Boris Johnson announced sweeping changes to England's lockdown, including a relaxing of the 2m rule. Meanwhile, the latest figures show a further 154 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, across all settings, taking the total to 43,081. Lifting lockdown: A round-up Who are we allowed to meet up with? Is it safe to relax the 2m rule? The updated government guidance,externalincludes some general advice for all businesses as well as guidance for specific sectors. It says businesses should carry out a Covid-19 risk assessment to ensure the safety of their workplace, which should be shared on their website, and also develop cleaning and hygiene procedures. Guidance for close contact services such as hairdressers says employees should wear a visor where it is not possible to maintain distance and customers could also be separated from each other by screens. Places like pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers are asked to keep a temporary record of customers and visitors for 21 days, to support thetest and trace system. Pubs and restaurants should keep music at a low volume to avoid people needing to shout, which increases the risk of transmission from tiny droplets in the air, known as aerosols. Customers will be encouraged to book in advance and order food and drink direct to their tables through a smartphone app. Pubs are among the venues which will be allowed to open in England from 4 July Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he expected people to continue to use ""common sense"" and follow government guidelines. But he said there was a ""legal duty"" for businesses to keep their employees safe and the Health and Safety Executive could take action if not. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of trade union body the TUC, said the more the government relaxes lockdown ""the tougher it needs to get on health and safety at work"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it should be a legal requirement for employers to publish risk assessments on their website, adding too many companies were ""not doing the right thing"". Adam Regan, who runs the Hare and Hounds pub in Birmingham, said the guidelines were ""very, very difficult to navigate safely"". He told BBC Radio 5 Live extra staff would be needed to monitor entrances and serve tables, while some customers might not be comfortable giving their contact details on arrival. Mr Regan said another concern was that people would become more relaxed and less conscious of social distancing after drinking alcohol. What will a reopened pub actually be like? Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said while there was ""a lot to welcome"" in the guidance, ""ideally, small firms would have been given weeks rather than days to prepare for their reopenings"". He said the new measures would also bring extra costs for companies and called for government support to help businesses which could not afford to reconfigure their premises. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that while he supported the easing of the lockdown,a more effective test and trace system was needed for the plan to work safely.

In case you missed them, these were some of the biggest developments of the day: We reported earlier on the Welsh food factory linked to almost 100 coronavirus cases. Now a further factory in Cambridgeshire, England, has closed for deep cleaning after 14 positive test results among staff. Health ministers have said coronaviruses thrive in cold, damp environments and survive for longer indoors and particularly on smooth surfaces - but not food itself. This is believed to pose a particular challenge to the food manufacturing industry. Outbreaks at food factories and wholesale food markets have also been reported in Germany and China. Read morehere. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent Fancy a pint in the pub? From 4 July, you can have one - or indeed a mojito or an orange juice - in England. But you probably won't be able to stroll up to the bar and order what you fancy. In many places, you may find you need an app for that. The government has published alengthy document, giving guidance to restaurants, pubs and takeaways,externalon all the measures they will need to take to operate safely. You can read analysis of those measures here. A food factory in Wales is linked to nearly 100 cases of coronavirus. The country's health minister has confirmed that 97 people have now tested positive after staff became ill at Rowan Foods. One trade union has accused the company of not dealing with health and safety concerns urgently. Two other food processing plants have had confirmed cases in Wales, with the largest number at 2 Sisters in Anglesey. Read morehere.

""I had a tube in my throat and I couldn't speak for two months,"" Masood says. ""It was very difficult, it was very painful."" ""He was probably one of the sickest patients that we've ever had,"" Jackie reflects. Demand for transport of all kinds has dropped to historic lows during the coronavirus pandemic. In response to this dip in demand,airline Jet2 and rail firm Eurostar have said they will scale back their flights and trains this summer. Eurostar said its train timetable would focus on routes between major cities such as London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, where demand was highest. Eurostar's direct summer services to Lyon, Avignon and Marseilles, which were meant to start in May, will no longer run at all in 2020 or 2021. Jet2 said it would be reducing its flying programme for 2020 and 2021, citing ""complicated"" challenges relating to the coronavirus crisis and ""changes on an almost daily basis"". ""Sadly, the overall effect of these reductions has been the need to propose a number of colleague redundancies across our business,â the airline said. The airline is proposing to cut 102 pilot jobs, the pilots' union Balpa said on Wednesday. Bournemouth beach was especially busy on Wednesday evening People in the UK are enjoying the country's warmest day of the year so far by flocking to beaches on the south coast of England.

Temperatures hit a high of 28C in Bournemouth - but it was hotter still in other parts of England People in England have been able to travel across the country to spend time outdoors since last month as part of a gradual easing of coronavirus restrictions. A beach in Brighton on England's south coast Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The outbreak in the Americas has not yet peaked, with an increase in cases of between 25% and 50% in the last week, the head of health emergencies for the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Mike Ryan, has said. Dr Ryan said the virus exploited ""weak health systems"" and ""poor government"", and said that for governments to understand how to tackle the outbreak, they needed to look at the actions of countries which had succeeded in suppressing transmission. Dr Mike Ryan, the head of emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO), has praised the UK for the way it is easing restrictions. He said there had been a ""steady, slow and step-wise exit from lockdown conditions"" in the country. Dr Ryan said the government had communicated the changes to the population at large and to the WHO â with a consistent dialogue between the four nations of the UK over regional differences. He said testing in the UK had now increased and the ""surveillance system is capable of understand where the disease is"". His comments came after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the next level of lockdown easing would take place on 4 July, when businesses such as pubs and restaurants can reopen under government guidelines. The US states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will require visitors from Covid-19 hotspots elsewhere in the country to quarantine for 14 days, officials have said. The governors of the three north-eastern states - once coronavirus hotspots themselves - announced the joint travel advisory today. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he did not want visitors from other states bringing Covid-19 in with them, because ""we worked very hard to get the viral transmission down"". The quarantine rule will apply to visitors from states where 10% of the population is infected with Covid-19 on a seven-day rolling average, Mr Cuomo said. Nine states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Texas, currently meet that high infection rate threshold. The quarantine will come into effect on Thursday. With more than 31,000 deaths and 412,000 cases to date, New York was the epicentre of the pandemic at one stage, but now other southern and western states are seeing a rise in infections. This video can not be played Covid-19: A brief look back at the government briefings The daily Downing Street news conferences became a fixture of the UK's coronavirus coverage - and on previous days, we would have just finished one at about this time. But now that they havebeen scrapped, here's a look back at the last three months' briefings. Around 45,000 runners usually take part in the marathon every year Another major event has been cancelled because of the pandemic: this year's Berlin Marathon in Germany. Organisers say the event - originally scheduled to take place on 26-27 September - will not go ahead citing Covid-19 restrictions and health concerns. They say holding the marathon was not possible given the German government's social-distancing rules. And, following a review, they decided the event could not be held at a later date this year either. ""As hard as we have tried, it is currently not possible to organise the BMW Berlin-Marathon with its usual Berlin charm,"" the organisers said. ""Your health, as well as all of our health, is our first priority."" Around 45,000 runners usually take part in the marathon every year in the German capital. Earlier, we reported that this year's marathon in New York had been scrapped also because of the pandemic. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine trials in Africa: What you need to know Scientists are scrambling to develop an effective vaccine against Covid-19, with trials taking place worldwide. One of those trials is being carried out in South Africa, where a vaccine made by Oxford University is being tested. Scientists say that it is vital for Africans to take part in these trials, arguing that not doing so could jeopardise efforts to find a vaccine that works across the globe. But critics cite a history of Western exploitation of Africa and unethical drug trials in the past as a reason not to participate. Why are vaccine trials such a sensitive issue in Africa? BBC Africa's Joice Etutu explains in the video above. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was ""confident"" that an arrangement could be reached US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said he is ""confident"" the US and the EU will be able to agree arrangements for the resumption of international travel. There have been reports that the European Union could block Americans from resuming travel to EU countries because of the prevalence of coronavirus in the US. Pompeo told reporters: ""I'm confident that we'll find a set of conditions that create sufficient health and safety protection. ""We're working on finding the right way to do that, the right timing to do it, the right tactics to have in place. We certainly don't want to cause problems any place else."" We have more on the EU discussions here. Volunteers have begun being immunised with a new UK coronavirus vaccine. About 300 people will have the vaccine over the coming weeks, as part of a trial led by Prof Robin Shattock and his colleagues, at Imperial College London. Tests on animals suggest the vaccine is safe and triggers an effective immune response. Many traditional vaccines are based on a weakened or modified form of virus, but the Imperial vaccine is based on a new approach, using synthetic strands of genetic code, called RNA, which mimic the virus. There are more than 120 coronavirus vaccines in early development across the world. A further 13 are now in clinical trials: five in China, three in the United States, two in the UK, one in Australia, Germany and Russia. Vaccine teams are keen to stress that they are not in a race against each other, but against the virus. If there are to be enough doses to protect the world, several vaccine approaches will need to be successful,writes the BBC's medical correspondent Fergus Walsh. Dr Tedros said rising case numbers were a ""sober reminder"" of our responsibilities The World Health Organization (WHO) says it expects to see the number of cases of Covid-19 reach 10 million within the next week. ""More than 9.1 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to the WHO, and more than 470,000 deaths,"" the health body chief, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told reporters in Geneva. ""In the first month of this outbreak, less than 10,000 cases were reported. In the last month, almost four million cases have been reported. ""We expect to reach a total of 10 million cases within the next week."" He called it a ""sober reminder"" of our ""urgent responsibility to do everything we can... to suppress transmission and save lives"".

Vivienne NunisBusiness reporter, BBC News Louise Parkinson runs a cleaning business in Chippenham, Wiltshire Cleaners across England are facing huge financial challenges as a result of the pandemic Since the lockdown, lots of people have stopped using cleaning services. Some simply can't afford the additional cost, while others find it too much of a disruption to have people cleaning the house while they're working and educating children from home. And some clients are shielding or worried about the risk of catching Covid-19 from workers entering their properties. Where the work has continued, many businesses have been left to come up with their own safety protocols. Husband-and-wife team Liam and Louise Parkinson, who are based in Chippenham, Wiltshire, say their customer base has been reduced ""from 30 customers down to one or two"" becuase of the pandemic. Cleaning staff are permitted to work in people's homes, but industry leaders say there hasn't been clear guidance from the government advising cleaners how to keep themselves and their clients safe. ""There's nothing that we can adhere to, we've just got to decide for ourselves what's appropriate,"" says Stephen Munton, director of the trade body the Domestic Cleaning Alliance.

West Bengal was going to ease its lockdown on 30 June The Indian state of West Bengal has extended its lockdown until 31 July to stem the spread of Covid-19 after a spike in infections nationwide. The lockdown in the eastern state was supposed to expire on 30 June. But as new infections continue to rise across the country, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, said it was necessary to keep restrictions in place to ""help the entire nation"". Schools, colleges and universities would remain shut as part of the continued curbs, but some relaxations would go ahead, the minister said. India's infections jumped by almost 16,000 to more than 456,000 on Wednesday, the highest daily rise in the country. The death toll stands at more than 14,000. There have been 14,728 confirmed cases and 580 deaths in West Bengal.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The German Bundesliga returned in May - without fans in stadiums The return
of live events has been brought forward more than the Scottish government originally
planned for, Scotland's national clinical director confirms. It was not
thought these would be able to return until phase four but Proj Jason Leitch suggests sports events could begin behind closed down at the
beginning of August. The list of
indicative dates published today says it is unlikely this would happen before
23 July. Mr Leitch
says it is difficult give precise timescales at this stage  â but he would hope small crowds would be able to attend large venues in 2-3
monthsâ time. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's education secretary, John Swinney, has been accused of treating staff safety ""as an after thought"" and not engaging with trades unions as he plans an August return to school. Helen Meldrum, from the GMB, which represents cleaning, janitorial and catering staff, tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""We need more investment, more staff, PPE that's fit for purpose and sadly, as it stands at the moment, this is a Scottish government that is making the same mistakes as it made with social care."" She says a survey of staff last month found they were ""absolutely terrified about taking the virus into school and passing it to vulnerable children as well as taking it home"". ""The strategy so far for the educational recovery has been a compete shambles,"" she adds. ""There are just no safe plans or working practices in place yet and the prospect of 100% pupils back sounds even more unsafe for our members."" A Scottish government statement said that staff safety is paramount as it plans for the next academic year. Pubs are exploring apps that will let customers order drinks, and keep a record of their visit. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland One hotelier has had 220 bookings in four hours since opening the phone lines for business after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gave a provisional date for reopening. Stuart McPhee, of the Siberia Bar & Hotel in Aberdeen, tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""It is an Ikea moment. It is the next big thing that is opening up for people's lives. The struggle will be beyond that once the novelty dies off. ""I feel clear about the indicative dates and realise
they are not concrete, but it allows us to create some certainty for our
customers and ourselves."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland How do you

Maxwell is the director of a catering company which normally serves parties.
But in the last few weeks the business has turned to delivering grazing boxes

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Blair Drummond Safari Park, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary, is reopening Nearly 70% of Scotland's visitor attractions do not plan to take up the option of reopening on 15 July despite being given a provisional green light to do so by the Scottish government - and 15% have no plans to reopen by September. The figures have been revealed by Scottish Visitors Attractions chief executive Gordon Morrison, who tells BBC Radio Scotland that indoor sites, like museums and country houses, are the more reticent. ""There is a real concern about cost versus return when it comes to reopening,"" he says. The additional costs in adapting facilities to 2m social distancing, fears for the safety of older volunteers and a lack of international visitors were all factors among the 200 attractions that responded to a survey. ""The majority of outdoor sites, where you can experience grounds, gardens, zoos, wildlife parks, they are all raring to go,"" Mr Morrison adds. ""I would encourage people to visit these when they open because it is the only way they will be able to keep the doors open."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Many children's playgrounds have not been inspected during lockdown despite the Scottish government announcing that they can be reopened from Monday, an industry expert warns. Register of Playground Inspectors International board member Jon Dalton was asked on BBC Radio Scotland whether the facilities will be ready in time. ""It depends on what the playground owners have been doing in the meantime - some have just left them dormant, they have stopped inspecting,"" says. ""But playgrounds should be inspected on a regular basis. ""With playgrounds not being used, people have just not been inspecting them in our experience. ""Access will have been restricted in some way, so if the playground is open then it should be okay, but what we're saying as an organisation is that someone responsible for that playground gets in and checks it before they open it."" Hairdressing businesses in Scotland will be able to open next month - but it is unlikely to be business as usual. Norma Chesne from Uddingston in Lanarkshire, who has been cutting hair for over 30 years, has built a ""home studio salon"" in her garden which she says incorporates all the social distancing measures needed. Her protective equipment will include mask and visor, and she will see one client at a time. But, whatever the limitations, Norma can hardly wait to get started. ""I'm delighted,"" she said. ""I feel for my clients. ""They're all desperate to have their hair done. It's the feel-good factor. Plus I thoroughly enjoy doing it.""  Prof Pennington said the decision to reduce the distance is a political one The decision over the two-metre social distancing rule in Scotland is one of ""personality and politics"", a scientist has claimed. Prof Hugh Pennington said the decision to reduce the distance is a political one, given how new Covid-19 is and the fact advice being given to both administrations will be ""largely the same"". Writing in the Scottish Daily Mail,external, Prof Pennington said should there be a localised outbreak - in a place such as a bar - when the rule is relaxed then it could simply be shut down and the rest of the population will not be impacted. The first minister has said she has asked her scientific advisers to look into reducing the amount of social distancing in certain measures, with a report expected by 2 July. Prof Pennington said there is ""every reason"" Scotland should also reduce the social distancing rule. He wrote: ""But in my view there is absolutely no need for (Nicola Sturgeon's) caution. ""There is no reason we should not be following England and reducing the social distancing limit to one metre and every reason we should be in order to get the economy and education system going again. ""If we do see a localised outbreak of Covid, for example if there is an outbreak linked to a particularly busy pub, we can step in and close it down again. ""The whole country does not need to go back into lockdown."" He added: ""What we are seeing now is not about the science, it's about the personality and the politics.""

Pointing to the fact that pubs and restaurants have been given a date, she asks: ""Is it because they contribute more to the economy and now it is all about wealth instead of health? ""If it is, it is a very sad day. If they can show me the science, I will hold up my hands and admit I was wrong, but I have not seen it."" Ms Elliot's partner owns a gym and adds: ""I have been in the fitness industry for along time and in my time the cleanliness of a gym is absolutely paramount.

Jackie Taylor is one of the signatories of the letter as president of the Royal

Drivetime it is important to review what has gone well and what hasnât so there
are better outcomes if a second wave occurs. It is very difficult to quantify what a second wave may look like, she explains, but she suggests it is likely there will be local outbreaks. These can be managed in a different way from full lockdown so long as management practices are in place, Prof Taylor adds. She says we will be living with the virus until a vaccine is rolled out â and until then we must ensure health and social care services work together and have the resources they require. Prof Taylor also insists on the importance of looking to lower the risk for vulnerable groups in particular, like those in the BME community, older people or the homeless. Allow Twitter content?

Quiet music and orders via app for venues reopeningPubs and hairdressers are among the places which will be allowed to reopen in England from 4 July.UK,"Screens between customers are among the safety measures suggested for hairdressers Music should be kept quiet and customers encouraged to order through apps, under updated guidance for businesses reopening from 4 July. Pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers are among the venues which will be allowed to reopen in England. There is also advice to reconfigure seating, minimise self-service, cancel live acts and stagger arrivals. It comes after Boris Johnson announced sweeping changes to England's lockdown, including a relaxing of the 2m rule. Meanwhile, the latest figures show a further 154 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, across all settings, taking the total to 43,081. Lifting lockdown: A round-up Who are we allowed to meet up with? Is it safe to relax the 2m rule? The updated government guidance,externalincludes some general advice for all businesses as well as guidance for specific sectors. It says businesses should carry out a Covid-19 risk assessment to ensure the safety of their workplace, which should be shared on their website, and also develop cleaning and hygiene procedures. Guidance for close contact services such as hairdressers says employees should wear a visor where it is not possible to maintain distance and customers could also be separated from each other by screens. Places like pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers are asked to keep a temporary record of customers and visitors for 21 days, to support thetest and trace system. Pubs and restaurants should keep music at a low volume to avoid people needing to shout, which increases the risk of transmission from tiny droplets in the air, known as aerosols. Customers will be encouraged to book in advance and order food and drink direct to their tables through a smartphone app. Pubs are among the venues which will be allowed to open in England from 4 July Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he expected people to continue to use ""common sense"" and follow government guidelines. But he said there was a ""legal duty"" for businesses to keep their employees safe and the Health and Safety Executive could take action if not. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of trade union body the TUC, said the more the government relaxes lockdown ""the tougher it needs to get on health and safety at work"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it should be a legal requirement for employers to publish risk assessments on their website, adding too many companies were ""not doing the right thing"". Adam Regan, who runs the Hare and Hounds pub in Birmingham, said the guidelines were ""very, very difficult to navigate safely"". He told BBC Radio 5 Live extra staff would be needed to monitor entrances and serve tables, while some customers might not be comfortable giving their contact details on arrival. Mr Regan said another concern was that people would become more relaxed and less conscious of social distancing after drinking alcohol. What will a reopened pub actually be like? Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said while there was ""a lot to welcome"" in the guidance, ""ideally, small firms would have been given weeks rather than days to prepare for their reopenings"". He said the new measures would also bring extra costs for companies and called for government support to help businesses which could not afford to reconfigure their premises. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that while he supported the easing of the lockdown,a more effective test and trace system was needed for the plan to work safely. This video can not be played Boris Johnson is cheered as he announces English pubs can reopen from 4 July In the biggest easing of lockdown yet, Mr Johnson also said the 2m social-distancing rule would be replaced with a ""one-metre plus"" rule in England. This means people should stay at least 2m (6ft) apart where possible, but otherwise should remain at least 1m apart while taking steps to reduce the risk of transmission, such as wearing face coverings. The 2m rule will remain in Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland,ministers have said social distancing of 1m is ""safe and appropriate"" for children at school. Announcing the changes on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the following venues would be able to reopen from 4 July: Pubs, bars and restaurantsbut only with a table service indoors, and owners will be asked to keep contact details of customers to help with contact tracing Hotels, holiday apartments, campsites and caravan parksbut shared facilities must be cleaned properly Theatres and music hallsbut they will not be allowed to hold live performances In other changesweddingswill be allowed to have 30 attendees, andplaces of worshipwill be allowed to hold services but singing will be banned Hair salonsandbarberswill be able to reopen but must have protective measures, such as visors, in place Libraries, community centresandbingo halls Cinemas,museumsandgalleries Funfairs, theme parks, adventure parks, amusement arcades, outdoor skating rinksandmodel villages Indoor attractions where animals are exhibited, such as atzoos,aquariums,farms,safari parksandwildlife centres Some other venues will remain closed by law, including nightclubs, casinos, indoor play areas, nail bars and beauty salons, swimming pools and indoor gyms. It comes asstruggling retailers must pay their quarterly rentto landlords on Wednesday. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowdensaid in a tweet,externalthat the government's ""aspiration"" was to reopen gyms and leisure facilities in England in mid-July. However, Mark Sesnan, chief executive of Greenwich Leisure, which runs leisure centres for councils across the country, said he was ""shocked and disappointed"" that such sites would not be allowed to reopen on 4 July. ""We had been led to believe that we would be,"" he told the BBC, adding that the company had ""incurred quite a lot of expense"" getting facilities ready. He said most swimming pools and sports halls were ""very large spaces"", making social distancing easier. Scientists also say chlorinated water should kill the virus. What might swimming pools be like after lockdown? Anger as indoor sports facilities remain closed Why are gyms still closed? And other questions The shops that won't be reopening The Betting and Gaming Council said it was ""inconsistent and frankly nonsensical"" that casinos were not able to reopen along with other parts of the hospitality industry. ""Casinos have done everything that they were asked to do by the government and they have pulled out all the stops to ensure they are able to open their doors safely for both staff and customers from 4 July,"" chief executive Michael Dugher said. Mr Sharma said he understood the ""frustration"" of businesses that were not yet allowed to reopen but ""the proximity that you have to someone in some of these closer settings"" posed ""a greater risk"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen? In Scotland, outdoor hospitality areas such as beer gardens will be able to open on 6 July, while shopping centres, holiday accommodation, hairdressers, pubs and restaurants will be able to reopen on 15 July. There is not yet a date for when pubs and restaurants might reopen in Wales, although the government has said discussions on a potential phased reopening will be held in July. In Northern Ireland, hotels, pubs and restaurants can reopen from 3 July.

In case you missed them, these were some of the biggest developments of the day: We reported earlier on the Welsh food factory linked to almost 100 coronavirus cases. Now a further factory in Cambridgeshire, England, has closed for deep cleaning after 14 positive test results among staff. Health ministers have said coronaviruses thrive in cold, damp environments and survive for longer indoors and particularly on smooth surfaces - but not food itself. This is believed to pose a particular challenge to the food manufacturing industry. Outbreaks at food factories and wholesale food markets have also been reported in Germany and China. Read morehere. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent Fancy a pint in the pub? From 4 July, you can have one - or indeed a mojito or an orange juice - in England. But you probably won't be able to stroll up to the bar and order what you fancy. In many places, you may find you need an app for that. The government has published alengthy document, giving guidance to restaurants, pubs and takeaways,externalon all the measures they will need to take to operate safely. You can read analysis of those measures here. A food factory in Wales is linked to nearly 100 cases of coronavirus. The country's health minister has confirmed that 97 people have now tested positive after staff became ill at Rowan Foods. One trade union has accused the company of not dealing with health and safety concerns urgently. Two other food processing plants have had confirmed cases in Wales, with the largest number at 2 Sisters in Anglesey. Read morehere.

""He was probably one of the sickest patients that we've ever had,"" Jackie reflects. Demand for transport of all kinds has dropped to historic lows during the coronavirus pandemic. In response to this dip in demand,airline Jet2 and rail firm Eurostar have said they will scale back their flights and trains this summer. Eurostar said its train timetable would focus on routes between major cities such as London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, where demand was highest. Eurostar's direct summer services to Lyon, Avignon and Marseilles, which were meant to start in May, will no longer run at all in 2020 or 2021. Jet2 said it would be reducing its flying programme for 2020 and 2021, citing ""complicated"" challenges relating to the coronavirus crisis and ""changes on an almost daily basis"". ""Sadly, the overall effect of these reductions has been the need to propose a number of colleague redundancies across our business,â the airline said.

Bournemouth beach was especially busy on Wednesday evening People in the UK are enjoying the country's warmest day of the year so far by flocking to beaches on the south coast of England. Pictures show busy beaches in Brighton and Bournemouth, where thousands of sun and sea enthusiasts are enjoying the exceptionally hot weather. Temperatures hit a high of 28C in Bournemouth - but it was hotter still in other parts of England People in England have been able to travel across the country to spend time outdoors since last month as part of a gradual easing of coronavirus restrictions. A beach in Brighton on England's south coast Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The outbreak in the Americas has not yet peaked, with an increase in cases of between 25% and 50% in the last week, the head of health emergencies for the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Mike Ryan, has said. Dr Ryan said the virus exploited ""weak health systems"" and ""poor government"", and said that for governments to understand how to tackle the outbreak, they needed to look at the actions of countries which had succeeded in suppressing transmission. Dr Mike Ryan, the head of emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO), has praised the UK for the way it is easing restrictions. He said there had been a ""steady, slow and step-wise exit from lockdown conditions"" in the country. Dr Ryan said the government had communicated the changes to the population at large and to the WHO â with a consistent dialogue between the four nations of the UK over regional differences. He said testing in the UK had now increased and the ""surveillance system is capable of understand where the disease is"". His comments came after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the next level of lockdown easing would take place on 4 July, when businesses such as pubs and restaurants can reopen under government guidelines. The US states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will require visitors from Covid-19 hotspots elsewhere in the country to quarantine for 14 days, officials have said. The governors of the three north-eastern states - once coronavirus hotspots themselves - announced the joint travel advisory today. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he did not want visitors from other states bringing Covid-19 in with them, because ""we worked very hard to get the viral transmission down"". The quarantine rule will apply to visitors from states where 10% of the population is infected with Covid-19 on a seven-day rolling average, Mr Cuomo said. Nine states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Texas, currently meet that high infection rate threshold. The quarantine will come into effect on Thursday. With more than 31,000 deaths and 412,000 cases to date, New York was the epicentre of the pandemic at one stage, but now other southern and western states are seeing a rise in infections. This video can not be played Covid-19: A brief look back at the government briefings The daily Downing Street news conferences became a fixture of the UK's coronavirus coverage - and on previous days, we would have just finished one at about this time. But now that they havebeen scrapped, here's a look back at the last three months' briefings. Around 45,000 runners usually take part in the marathon every year Another major event has been cancelled because of the pandemic: this year's Berlin Marathon in Germany. Organisers say the event - originally scheduled to take place on 26-27 September - will not go ahead citing Covid-19 restrictions and health concerns. They say holding the marathon was not possible given the German government's social-distancing rules. And, following a review, they decided the event could not be held at a later date this year either. ""As hard as we have tried, it is currently not possible to organise the BMW Berlin-Marathon with its usual Berlin charm,"" the organisers said. ""Your health, as well as all of our health, is our first priority."" Around 45,000 runners usually take part in the marathon every year in the German capital. Earlier, we reported that this year's marathon in New York had been scrapped also because of the pandemic. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine trials in Africa: What you need to know Scientists are scrambling to develop an effective vaccine against Covid-19, with trials taking place worldwide. One of those trials is being carried out in South Africa, where a vaccine made by Oxford University is being tested. Scientists say that it is vital for Africans to take part in these trials, arguing that not doing so could jeopardise efforts to find a vaccine that works across the globe. But critics cite a history of Western exploitation of Africa and unethical drug trials in the past as a reason not to participate. Why are vaccine trials such a sensitive issue in Africa? BBC Africa's Joice Etutu explains in the video above. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was ""confident"" that an arrangement could be reached US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said he is ""confident"" the US and the EU will be able to agree arrangements for the resumption of international travel. There have been reports that the European Union could block Americans from resuming travel to EU countries because of the prevalence of coronavirus in the US. Pompeo told reporters: ""I'm confident that we'll find a set of conditions that create sufficient health and safety protection. ""We're working on finding the right way to do that, the right timing to do it, the right tactics to have in place. We certainly don't want to cause problems any place else."" We have more on the EU discussions here. Volunteers have begun being immunised with a new UK coronavirus vaccine. About 300 people will have the vaccine over the coming weeks, as part of a trial led by Prof Robin Shattock and his colleagues, at Imperial College London. Tests on animals suggest the vaccine is safe and triggers an effective immune response. Many traditional vaccines are based on a weakened or modified form of virus, but the Imperial vaccine is based on a new approach, using synthetic strands of genetic code, called RNA, which mimic the virus. There are more than 120 coronavirus vaccines in early development across the world. A further 13 are now in clinical trials: five in China, three in the United States, two in the UK, one in Australia, Germany and Russia. Vaccine teams are keen to stress that they are not in a race against each other, but against the virus. If there are to be enough doses to protect the world, several vaccine approaches will need to be successful,writes the BBC's medical correspondent Fergus Walsh. Dr Tedros said rising case numbers were a ""sober reminder"" of our responsibilities The World Health Organization (WHO) says it expects to see the number of cases of Covid-19 reach 10 million within the next week. ""More than 9.1 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to the WHO, and more than 470,000 deaths,"" the health body chief, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told reporters in Geneva. ""In the first month of this outbreak, less than 10,000 cases were reported. In the last month, almost four million cases have been reported. ""We expect to reach a total of 10 million cases within the next week."" He called it a ""sober reminder"" of our ""urgent responsibility to do everything we can... to suppress transmission and save lives"". The Americas have become the epicentre of the pandemic.Find out more about where cases are still rising. Vivienne NunisBusiness reporter, BBC News Louise Parkinson runs a cleaning business in Chippenham, Wiltshire Cleaners across England are facing huge financial challenges as a result of the pandemic Since the lockdown, lots of people have stopped using cleaning services. Some simply can't afford the additional cost, while others find it too much of a disruption to have people cleaning the house while they're working and educating children from home. And some clients are shielding or worried about the risk of catching Covid-19 from workers entering their properties. Where the work has continued, many businesses have been left to come up with their own safety protocols. Husband-and-wife team Liam and Louise Parkinson, who are based in Chippenham, Wiltshire, say their customer base has been reduced ""from 30 customers down to one or two"" becuase of the pandemic. Cleaning staff are permitted to work in people's homes, but industry leaders say there hasn't been clear guidance from the government advising cleaners how to keep themselves and their clients safe. ""There's nothing that we can adhere to, we've just got to decide for ourselves what's appropriate,"" says Stephen Munton, director of the trade body the Domestic Cleaning Alliance.

West Bengal was going to ease its lockdown on 30 June The Indian state of West Bengal has extended its lockdown until 31 July to stem the spread of Covid-19 after a spike in infections nationwide. The lockdown in the eastern state was supposed to expire on 30 June. But as new infections continue to rise across the country, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, said it was necessary to keep restrictions in place to ""help the entire nation"". Schools, colleges and universities would remain shut as part of the continued curbs, but some relaxations would go ahead, the minister said. India's infections jumped by almost 16,000 to more than 456,000 on Wednesday, the highest daily rise in the country. The death toll stands at more than 14,000. There have been 14,728 confirmed cases and 580 deaths in West Bengal.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The German Bundesliga returned in May - without fans in stadiums The return
of live events has been brought forward more than the Scottish government originally
planned for, Scotland's national clinical director confirms. It was not
thought these would be able to return until phase four but Proj Jason Leitch suggests sports events could begin behind closed down at the
beginning of August. The list of
indicative dates published today says it is unlikely this would happen before
23 July. Mr Leitch
says it is difficult give precise timescales at this stage  â but he would hope small crowds would be able to attend large venues in 2-3
monthsâ time. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's education secretary, John Swinney, has been accused of treating staff safety ""as an after thought"" and not engaging with trades unions as he plans an August return to school. Helen Meldrum, from the GMB, which represents cleaning, janitorial and catering staff, tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""We need more investment, more staff, PPE that's fit for purpose and sadly, as it stands at the moment, this is a Scottish government that is making the same mistakes as it made with social care."" She says a survey of staff last month found they were ""absolutely terrified about taking the virus into school and passing it to vulnerable children as well as taking it home"". ""The strategy so far for the educational recovery has been a compete shambles,"" she adds. ""There are just no safe plans or working practices in place yet and the prospect of 100% pupils back sounds even more unsafe for our members."" A Scottish government statement said that staff safety is paramount as it plans for the next academic year. Pubs are exploring apps that will let customers order drinks, and keep a record of their visit. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland One hotelier has had 220 bookings in four hours since opening the phone lines for business after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gave a provisional date for reopening. Stuart McPhee, of the Siberia Bar & Hotel in Aberdeen, tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""It is an Ikea moment. It is the next big thing that is opening up for people's lives. The struggle will be beyond that once the novelty dies off. ""I feel clear about the indicative dates and realise
they are not concrete, but it allows us to create some certainty for our
customers and ourselves."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland How do you
keep your business going when your key market is large events? Lynsey
Maxwell is the director of a catering company which normally serves parties.
But in the last few weeks the business has turned to delivering grazing boxes
for families to enjoy. âIt became
really popular. People send it as gifts, people order it for themselves. Itâs
great, itâs been very busy,â she tells Drivetime. What about
theatre? Actress Sarah Galbraith says her show Girls Night Oot has just
relaunched as Girls Night In â a ticketed Zoom event. âIt allows us
to bring our show to the masses without being in the theatre,â she explains. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Blair Drummond Safari Park, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary, is reopening Nearly 70% of Scotland's visitor attractions do not plan to take up the option of reopening on 15 July despite being given a provisional green light to do so by the Scottish government - and 15% have no plans to reopen by September. The figures have been revealed by Scottish Visitors Attractions chief executive Gordon Morrison, who tells BBC Radio Scotland that indoor sites, like museums and country houses, are the more reticent. ""There is a real concern about cost versus return when it comes to reopening,"" he says. The additional costs in adapting facilities to 2m social distancing, fears for the safety of older volunteers and a lack of international visitors were all factors among the 200 attractions that responded to a survey. ""The majority of outdoor sites, where you can experience grounds, gardens, zoos, wildlife parks, they are all raring to go,"" Mr Morrison adds. ""I would encourage people to visit these when they open because it is the only way they will be able to keep the doors open."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Many children's playgrounds have not been inspected during lockdown despite the Scottish government announcing that they can be reopened from Monday, an industry expert warns. Register of Playground Inspectors International board member Jon Dalton was asked on BBC Radio Scotland whether the facilities will be ready in time. ""It depends on what the playground owners have been doing in the meantime - some have just left them dormant, they have stopped inspecting,"" says. ""But playgrounds should be inspected on a regular basis. ""With playgrounds not being used, people have just not been inspecting them in our experience. ""Access will have been restricted in some way, so if the playground is open then it should be okay, but what we're saying as an organisation is that someone responsible for that playground gets in and checks it before they open it."" Hairdressing businesses in Scotland will be able to open next month - but it is unlikely to be business as usual. Norma Chesne from Uddingston in Lanarkshire, who has been cutting hair for over 30 years, has built a ""home studio salon"" in her garden which she says incorporates all the social distancing measures needed. Her protective equipment will include mask and visor, and she will see one client at a time. But, whatever the limitations, Norma can hardly wait to get started. ""I'm delighted,"" she said. ""I feel for my clients. ""They're all desperate to have their hair done. It's the feel-good factor. Plus I thoroughly enjoy doing it.""  Prof Pennington said the decision to reduce the distance is a political one The decision over the two-metre social distancing rule in Scotland is one of ""personality and politics"", a scientist has claimed. Prof Hugh Pennington said the decision to reduce the distance is a political one, given how new Covid-19 is and the fact advice being given to both administrations will be ""largely the same"". Writing in the Scottish Daily Mail,external, Prof Pennington said should there be a localised outbreak - in a place such as a bar - when the rule is relaxed then it could simply be shut down and the rest of the population will not be impacted. The first minister has said she has asked her scientific advisers to look into reducing the amount of social distancing in certain measures, with a report expected by 2 July. Prof Pennington said there is ""every reason"" Scotland should also reduce the social distancing rule. He wrote: ""But in my view there is absolutely no need for (Nicola Sturgeon's) caution. ""There is no reason we should not be following England and reducing the social distancing limit to one metre and every reason we should be in order to get the economy and education system going again. ""If we do see a localised outbreak of Covid, for example if there is an outbreak linked to a particularly busy pub, we can step in and close it down again. ""The whole country does not need to go back into lockdown."" He added: ""What we are seeing now is not about the science, it's about the personality and the politics."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Restrictions on travel for leisure and recreation will be relaxed on 3 July Scotlandâs
national clinical director urges people to continue following lockdown rules
for the next few weeks â or they will put easing at risk. The Scottish government has set out the dates when it plans torelax more of the lockdown restrictions. Prof Jason
Leitch admits healthcare professionals and advisors like him are ânervousâ about
the relaxation of rules, but following guidelines for now mean the public will
be reward in the future. The easing
of lockdown is being introduce gradually because a the potential for the need

Pointing to the fact that pubs and restaurants have been given a date, she asks: ""Is it because they contribute more to the economy and now it is all about wealth instead of health? ""If it is, it is a very sad day. If they can show me the science, I will hold up my hands and admit I was wrong, but I have not seen it."" Ms Elliot's partner owns a gym and adds: ""I have been in the fitness industry for along time and in my time the cleanliness of a gym is absolutely paramount. To suggest they are not clean enough, I can't understand it.

leaders are calling for an urgent review to determine whether the UK is

Jackie Taylor is one of the signatories of the letter as president of the Royal
College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. She tells
Drivetime it is important to review what has gone well and what hasnât so there
are better outcomes if a second wave occurs. It is very difficult to quantify what a second wave may look like, she explains, but she suggests it is likely there will be local outbreaks. These can be managed in a different way from full lockdown so long as management practices are in place, Prof Taylor adds. She says we will be living with the virus until a vaccine is rolled out â and until then we must ensure health and social care services work together and have the resources they require. Prof Taylor also insists on the importance of looking to lower the risk for vulnerable groups in particular, like those in the BME community, older people or the homeless. Allow Twitter content?

In case you missed them, these were some of the biggest developments of the day: We reported earlier on the Welsh food factory linked to almost 100 coronavirus cases. Now a further factory in Cambridgeshire, England, has closed for deep cleaning after 14 positive test results among staff. Health ministers have said coronaviruses thrive in cold, damp environments and survive for longer indoors and particularly on smooth surfaces - but not food itself. This is believed to pose a particular challenge to the food manufacturing industry. Outbreaks at food factories and wholesale food markets have also been reported in Germany and China. Read morehere.

In response to this dip in demand,airline Jet2 and rail firm Eurostar have said they will scale back their flights and trains this summer. Eurostar said its train timetable would focus on routes between major cities such as London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, where demand was highest. Eurostar's direct summer services to Lyon, Avignon and Marseilles, which were meant to start in May, will no longer run at all in 2020 or 2021. Jet2 said it would be reducing its flying programme for 2020 and 2021, citing ""complicated"" challenges relating to the coronavirus crisis and ""changes on an almost daily basis"". ""Sadly, the overall effect of these reductions has been the need to propose a number of colleague redundancies across our business,â the airline said.

A beach in Brighton on England's south coast Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The outbreak in the Americas has not yet peaked, with an increase in cases of between 25% and 50% in the last week, the head of health emergencies for the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Mike Ryan, has said. Dr Ryan said the virus exploited ""weak health systems"" and ""poor government"", and said that for governments to understand how to tackle the outbreak, they needed to look at the actions of countries which had succeeded in suppressing transmission. Dr Mike Ryan, the head of emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO), has praised the UK for the way it is easing restrictions. He said there had been a ""steady, slow and step-wise exit from lockdown conditions"" in the country. Dr Ryan said the government had communicated the changes to the population at large and to the WHO â with a consistent dialogue between the four nations of the UK over regional differences. He said testing in the UK had now increased and the ""surveillance system is capable of understand where the disease is"". His comments came after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the next level of lockdown easing would take place on 4 July, when businesses such as pubs and restaurants can reopen under government guidelines. The US states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will require visitors from Covid-19 hotspots elsewhere in the country to quarantine for 14 days, officials have said. The governors of the three north-eastern states - once coronavirus hotspots themselves - announced the joint travel advisory today. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he did not want visitors from other states bringing Covid-19 in with them, because ""we worked very hard to get the viral transmission down"". The quarantine rule will apply to visitors from states where 10% of the population is infected with Covid-19 on a seven-day rolling average, Mr Cuomo said. Nine states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Texas, currently meet that high infection rate threshold. The quarantine will come into effect on Thursday. With more than 31,000 deaths and 412,000 cases to date, New York was the epicentre of the pandemic at one stage, but now other southern and western states are seeing a rise in infections. This video can not be played Covid-19: A brief look back at the government briefings The daily Downing Street news conferences became a fixture of the UK's coronavirus coverage - and on previous days, we would have just finished one at about this time. But now that they havebeen scrapped, here's a look back at the last three months' briefings. Around 45,000 runners usually take part in the marathon every year Another major event has been cancelled because of the pandemic: this year's Berlin Marathon in Germany. Organisers say the event - originally scheduled to take place on 26-27 September - will not go ahead citing Covid-19 restrictions and health concerns. They say holding the marathon was not possible given the German government's social-distancing rules. And, following a review, they decided the event could not be held at a later date this year either. ""As hard as we have tried, it is currently not possible to organise the BMW Berlin-Marathon with its usual Berlin charm,"" the organisers said. ""Your health, as well as all of our health, is our first priority."" Around 45,000 runners usually take part in the marathon every year in the German capital. Earlier, we reported that this year's marathon in New York had been scrapped also because of the pandemic. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine trials in Africa: What you need to know Scientists are scrambling to develop an effective vaccine against Covid-19, with trials taking place worldwide. One of those trials is being carried out in South Africa, where a vaccine made by Oxford University is being tested. Scientists say that it is vital for Africans to take part in these trials, arguing that not doing so could jeopardise efforts to find a vaccine that works across the globe. But critics cite a history of Western exploitation of Africa and unethical drug trials in the past as a reason not to participate. Why are vaccine trials such a sensitive issue in Africa? BBC Africa's Joice Etutu explains in the video above. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was ""confident"" that an arrangement could be reached US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said he is ""confident"" the US and the EU will be able to agree arrangements for the resumption of international travel. There have been reports that the European Union could block Americans from resuming travel to EU countries because of the prevalence of coronavirus in the US. Pompeo told reporters: ""I'm confident that we'll find a set of conditions that create sufficient health and safety protection. ""We're working on finding the right way to do that, the right timing to do it, the right tactics to have in place. We certainly don't want to cause problems any place else."" We have more on the EU discussions here. Volunteers have begun being immunised with a new UK coronavirus vaccine. About 300 people will have the vaccine over the coming weeks, as part of a trial led by Prof Robin Shattock and his colleagues, at Imperial College London. Tests on animals suggest the vaccine is safe and triggers an effective immune response. Many traditional vaccines are based on a weakened or modified form of virus, but the Imperial vaccine is based on a new approach, using synthetic strands of genetic code, called RNA, which mimic the virus. There are more than 120 coronavirus vaccines in early development across the world. A further 13 are now in clinical trials: five in China, three in the United States, two in the UK, one in Australia, Germany and Russia. Vaccine teams are keen to stress that they are not in a race against each other, but against the virus. If there are to be enough doses to protect the world, several vaccine approaches will need to be successful,writes the BBC's medical correspondent Fergus Walsh. Dr Tedros said rising case numbers were a ""sober reminder"" of our responsibilities The World Health Organization (WHO) says it expects to see the number of cases of Covid-19 reach 10 million within the next week. ""More than 9.1 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to the WHO, and more than 470,000 deaths,"" the health body chief, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told reporters in Geneva. ""In the first month of this outbreak, less than 10,000 cases were reported. In the last month, almost four million cases have been reported. ""We expect to reach a total of 10 million cases within the next week."" He called it a ""sober reminder"" of our ""urgent responsibility to do everything we can... to suppress transmission and save lives"".

Vivienne NunisBusiness reporter, BBC News Louise Parkinson runs a cleaning business in Chippenham, Wiltshire Cleaners across England are facing huge financial challenges as a result of the pandemic Since the lockdown, lots of people have stopped using cleaning services. Some simply can't afford the additional cost, while others find it too much of a disruption to have people cleaning the house while they're working and educating children from home. And some clients are shielding or worried about the risk of catching Covid-19 from workers entering their properties. Where the work has continued, many businesses have been left to come up with their own safety protocols. Husband-and-wife team Liam and Louise Parkinson, who are based in Chippenham, Wiltshire, say their customer base has been reduced ""from 30 customers down to one or two"" becuase of the pandemic. Cleaning staff are permitted to work in people's homes, but industry leaders say there hasn't been clear guidance from the government advising cleaners how to keep themselves and their clients safe. ""There's nothing that we can adhere to, we've just got to decide for ourselves what's appropriate,"" says Stephen Munton, director of the trade body the Domestic Cleaning Alliance.

West Bengal was going to ease its lockdown on 30 June The Indian state of West Bengal has extended its lockdown until 31 July to stem the spread of Covid-19 after a spike in infections nationwide. The lockdown in the eastern state was supposed to expire on 30 June. But as new infections continue to rise across the country, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, said it was necessary to keep restrictions in place to ""help the entire nation"". Schools, colleges and universities would remain shut as part of the continued curbs, but some relaxations would go ahead, the minister said. India's infections jumped by almost 16,000 to more than 456,000 on Wednesday, the highest daily rise in the country. The death toll stands at more than 14,000. There have been 14,728 confirmed cases and 580 deaths in West Bengal.

UK must prepare for second wave - health leadersThe warning comes as the prime minister announced sweeping relaxations to lockdown rules in England.UKComments,"Boris Johnson announced further easing of lockdown measures on Tuesday Health leaders are calling for an urgent review to determine whether the UK is properly prepared for the ""real risk"" of a second wave of coronavirus. In an open letter published in theBritish Medical Journal,external, ministers were warned that urgent action would be needed to prevent further loss of life. The presidents of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons, Nursing, Physicians, and GPs all signed the letter. It comes after Boris Johnson announced sweeping changes to England's lockdown. The Department of Health said it would continue to be guided by the latest scientific advice and would give the NHS ""whatever it needs"". Meanwhile, the latest figures show a further 154 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, across all settings, taking the total to 43,081. Why are swimming pools still closed? Your questions answered On Tuesday, the prime minister said pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers will be able to reopen from 4 July. The 2m social-distancing rule will be replaced with a ""one-metre plus"" rule, meaning people should stay at least 2m apart where possible, but otherwise should remain at least 1m apart while taking steps to reduce the risk of transmission, such as wearing face coverings. The 2m rule will remain in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, however. Both the government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and the chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty stressed Mr Johnson's plan was not ""risk-free"" at Tuesday'sfinal daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing. New guidance for businesses in England Lifting lockdown: A round-up Is a second wave of coronavirus on the way? Following the announcement, health leaders called for a ""rapid and forward-looking assessment"" of how prepared the UK would be for a new outbreak. ""While the future shape of the pandemic in the UK is hard to predict, the available evidence indicates that local flare-ups are increasingly likely and a second wave a real risk,"" they wrote. ""Many elements of the infrastructure needed to contain the virus are beginning to be put in place, but substantial challenges remain."" The authors of the letter, also signed by the chair of the British Medical Association, urged ministers to set up a cross-party group with a ""constructive, non-partisan, four nations approach"", tasked with developing recommendations. ""The review should not be about looking back or attributing blame,"" they said, and instead should focus on ""areas of weakness where action is needed urgently to prevent further loss of life and restore the economy as fully and as quickly as possible"". Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin, chairman of the liaison committee, told BBC Two's Politics Live he supported a ""lessons learned"" enquiry and had broached the subject with the government following the BMJ letter. He said it wasn't a ""full-blooded inquiry but ""about setting up a process that learns lessons"". He said: ""If you look at the papers the Cabinet Office had going into this [pandemic], there was nothing about massive PPE procurement; there was nothing about massive tracking and tracing and testing; there was nothing about a lockdown. ""This has turned out to be a massively different pandemic than the government was prepared for."" Former Conservative health secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Radio 5 Live's Emma Barnett that he did not think it was the right time for a public inquiry, which would take up a lot of ministerial time. But he thought there was a ""very real risk"" of a second wave. Pointing to an outbreak at a meat processing plant in Germany and South Korea having to trace 1,700 contacts after an incident at a nightclub, he said: ""In the places which are the best in the world they are dealing with these spikes and we have to recognise there is a very real risk of that here too."" Talk of a dreaded second wave will dominate the coming weeks and months. The UK will need to be prepared for one. But as the health leaders acknowledge, it's not possible to predict for sure if one will actually happen. What is certainly a given, is there will be local flare-ups where we see clusters of infections in places. This has already happened in Leicester, Anglesey and Cleckheaton. But what is important to recognise is that the UK is in a completely different position to where it was in March when the first wave hit. Testing capacity has gone from a few thousand a day to 200,000 to identify those infected. There is a network of contact tracers to find those that might be infected. There are still weaknesses - some tests take too long to turn around, while the tracing system is still bedding in and the app is not ready. But there is a realistic chance if these continue to improve and, importantly, the public keeps playing its part by both continuing to adhere to social distancing and complying with requests to self-isolate if they test positive or are identified as a close contact of an infected person, that the virus will be largely kept at bay. Read more analysis from Nickhere. A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""Thanks to the dedication of NHS staff, hospitals have not been overwhelmed and intensive care capacity continues to meet the needs of patients. ""Effective local management of any outbreak is the first line of protection against a second wave. In the event the local response is not sufficient to contain outbreaks, the government would reintroduce measures if necessary to contain the virus and stop it spreading to the wider population."" Is it safe to relax the 2m rule? Who are we allowed to meet up with? In the Commons on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said he did not believe there was ""a risk of a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the NHS"".

From 6 July outdoor hospitality areas such as beer gardens will be able to open. People will be able to meet indoors from 10 July. Professor John Edmunds, who attends Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) meetings, said the switch to ""one metre-plus"" restrictions, plus the reopening of pubs and restaurants, meant a risk ""transmission will take off again"" and the Test and Trace system had to be ""working well"" to stamp out infections.

"Brooklyn Nine-Nine bins episodes after Floyd deathThe US police comedy will ""start over"" and reflect the anti-racist movement, one of its stars says.Entertainment & Arts","Terry Crews hosts America's Got Talent as well as starring in Brooklyn Nine-Nine Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Terry Crews has said four new episodes of the police comedy were thrown ""in the trash"" in the wake of the death of George Floyd. Crews said the show would ""start over"" in light of the anti-racism protests. He said: ""We've had a lot of sombre talks about it and deep conversations and we hope through this we're going to make something that will be truly groundbreaking this year. ""We have an opportunity and we plan to use it in the best way possible."" Co-creator Dan Goor had four episodes ""all ready to go"" before Mr Floyd's death a month ago prompted widespread Black Lives Matter protests as well as soul-searching in society in the US and beyond, Crews said. ""They just threw them in the trash,""he told Access Hollywood,external. ""We have to start over. Right now we don't know which direction it's going to go in."" Crews (second right) with the rest of the cast of Brooklyn Nine-Nine Brooklyn Nine-Nine follows the exploits of a team of detectives in the fictional 99th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. In 2014 it won two Golden Globe Awards, including best TV comedy series. Crews did not give details of the content of the four scrapped episodes. The actor and America's Got Talent presenter also recounted his own dealings with the police, saying police officers had pointed guns at him, mistakenly, before he became a well-known face. ""It's something that every black man has been through and it's hard to really try to get other people to understand,"" he said.

Earlier this month, Goor and the castmade a $100,000 (Â£79,000) donation,externalto the National Bail Fund Network to support ""the many people who are protesting police brutality"". Actor Kendrick Sampson spoke at a Black Lives Matter protest in Los Angeles earlier this month Meanwhile, more than 300 black artists and executives - including Michael B Jordan, Idris Elba and Viola Davis - have signed an open letter calling on Hollywood to invest in black communities and stop the ""glorification of police corruption"" on screen. The letter,published by Variety,external, was written by Insecure actor Kendrick Sampson, who was hit with police batons and shot with rubber bullets during the recent protests. ""The way that Hollywood and mainstream media have contributed to the criminalisation of black people, the misrepresentation of the legal system, and the glorification of police corruption and violence has had dire consequences on Black lives,"" it read. It also demanded greater opportunities for black creatives off-camera and in senior management roles, as well as guaranteeing that marketing budgets were no longer slashed due to ""myths of limited international sales and lack of universality of Black-led stories"". This video can not be played The stars of Queen & Slim both say they can relate to the film's story of police brutality and race The letter noted how ""distribution and marketing processes are often marred, filtered, and manipulated by the white gaze"". The open call comes in the same week that, in the UK, the BBC committed to investing Â£100m of its TV budget over a three year period to produce ""diverse and inclusive content"".

MP's aide tried to save park attack stab victims,"Scientist David Wails, 49, US citizen Joe Ritchie-Bennett, 39, and history teacher James Furlong, 36, were killed in the knife attack A parliamentary assistant tried to save the lives of three men who were stabbed to death in a park in Reading. James Furlong, David Wails and Joe Ritchie-Bennettwere killed in the knife attack in Reading's Forbury Gardens on Saturday. James Antell, who works for West Dorset Conservative MP Chris Loder, used his shirt in an effort to stem their bleeding. He said he had been ""shaken"" by the attack which was ""all a bit of a blur"". Police are continuing to question Khairi Saadallah, 25, who has been arrested under the Terrorism Act. He came to the UK from Libya in 2012. James Antell has been praised for his ""remarkable and extraordinary effort"" Mr Antell said: ""I tried my very best to identify where the injuries were and took my shirt and tried to apply pressure. ""It was certainly a big relief when the police did arrive to those of us that were with the victims."" He said he still felt ""a little bit shaken"" by the ""hideous and callous"" attack, but added his overriding thoughts were with the victims, including three people who needed hospital treatment for injuries, and their families. ""It's all a bit of a blur - I was concerned for my safety and for the safety of others around,"" Mr Antell said. ""As much as this is a story of terror and violence and hate, it also exemplifies the bravery and resilience of the public. ""Looking back I was heartened by the response from members of the public and the emergency services and the wider Reading community who in the hours afterwards were providing sanctuary and doing all that they could to help."" Reading stabbings: What we know so far Who were the Reading park attack victims? 'Reading weeps' as town mourns stab deaths Mr Loder said in the Commons that he was ""extremely proud"" of his parliamentary assistant for his ""remarkable and extraordinary effort"". He told MPs Mr Antell ""ran courageously towards danger, his only focus to help the injured"". Reading Borough Council has announced it plans to create a permanent memorial in Forbury Gardens to 49-year-old scientist Mr Wails, US citizen Mr Ritchie-Bennett, 39, and 36-year-old history teacher Mr Furlong. The authority said it would work with the victims' families and the community to create a memorial ""where people can pay their respects to those who lost their lives, and everyone affected by the tragic events"".

People in Scotland can meet indoors from 10 July,"Scottish pub and restaurant businesses have been shut down by the coronavirus lockdown People in Scotland will be allowed to meet up with two other households indoors from 10 July and pubs and restaurants can re-open from 15 July. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also said the five-mile travel limit will be lifted from 3 July, while beer gardens can re-open from 6 July. Hairdressers and barbers can open from 15 July, as can holiday accommodation. Ms Sturgeon said the move was possible thanks to the ""real sustained progress"" made in suppressing coronavirus. But she said the changes depended on keeping the virus under control, and could be reversed if there was a fresh outbreak. And they will not apply to people who are shielding, who will be given further advice ""before the end of July"". Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland Which Scottish lockdown rules will change next - and when? Lifting lockdown across the UK: All you need to know The first minister was speaking as new data showed that the coronavirus death rate has continued to fall for the eighth week in a row, with Ms Sturgeon saying these ""clear trends"" meant ""firmer milestones"" for the journey out of lockdown could be set. Advisors are still reviewing whether the 2m (6ft 6in) physical distancing rule should be eased, but a range of different shops and services can now begin planning for re-opening in mid-July. The government'srevised routemap,externalsaid shopping centres and dental practices could fully re-open from 13 July, while optometrists can begin to scale up work. From 15 July, all holiday accommodation can open up, along with indoor areas of pubs and restaurants and hairdressers and barbers. These moves depend on safety measures being put in place, and hospitality businesses will have to retain contact details for customers for four weeks. Museums, galleries, cinemas and libraries will be allowed to resume business from the same date, as long as physical distancing and other safety measures are enforced. However live entertainment venues like theatres, nightclubs and bingo halls ""will not reopen until a later date"", while ""further consideration"" is being given to the opening of indoor gyms and restrictions on weddings and funerals. 29 June - Most non-essential shops, many indoor workplaces, visitor attractions including zoos, outdoor sports courts and playgrounds 3 July - Five mile travel distance relaxed, most self-catering holiday homes and second homes can be used 6 July - Outdoor hospitality such as beer gardens can reopen 10 July - People can meet in extended groups outdoors and with two other households indoors 13 July - Shopping centres can reopen, organised outdoor contact sports for children can resume, dentists can reopen for most routine care 15 July - Pubs, restaurants and all holiday accommodation can reopen, as can hairdressers, barbers, museums, cinemas, libraries and childcare Read more about the lockdown easing timeline here Ministers have already announced that they are planning forschools to return full-time from 11 Augustwith no physical distancing between pupils. Ms Sturgeon said that on 1 May, it was estimated that about 25,000 people in Scotland had the virus - but that she expected that figure to be ""around 2,000"" when new figures are published on Thursday. She said this was ""down to people doing the right thing and following the rules"", saying: ""The sacrifices that have been made have suppressed the virus, protected the NHS and undoubtedly saved a significant number of lives."" Scotland will not decide whether to follow England in relaxing the 2m rules until at least next week The first minister said Scots ""must not be complacent"" about the dangers of Covid-19, but said if progress continued to be made then ""the prize is getting greater normality back in our lives, maybe more quickly than we would have envisaged a few weeks ago"". Many of the changes mirrorthose announced for Englandby Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday, but with dates around two weeks later. Most Scottish council areas record zero Covid deaths Ms Sturgeon accepted that Scotland's pace in exiting lockdown ""is slightly slower than England's"", saying this was ""in my view right for our circumstances and I hope more likely to be sustainable than if we went faster"". The Scottish Conservatives said the delay ""will cost millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line"", saying that ""Scotland has to look on while the rest of the UK and Europe resumes normal life"". Ms Sturgeon said she was not prepared to take part in ""some kind of reckless race"" with other parts of the country, saying opposition attacks were ""grubby political opportunism at a time of national crisis"". None of the changes Nicola Sturgeon announced today take immediate effect. Instead she has offered a series of dates to pencil into our diaries - the promise of further freedoms to come. The first minister acknowledged that the pace of easing lockdown in Scotland is ""slightly slower"" than in England, but said she wanted to continue to move carefully to reduce the chance of a coronavirus resurgence. When (non-essential) high street retailers reopen on Monday in Scotland, similar shops in England will have been trading for a fortnight. But not everything is happening later here. If new plans for the full return of schooling go ahead in August - when Scottish schools normally go back from their summer break - Scotland could be the first part of the UK to achieve that. Everything is of course conditional on the continued suppression of the virus. The signs in Scotland are good, with a further reduction in the weekly number of virus-related deaths being reported by the National Records of Scotland today. Ms Sturgeon accused her opponents of ""grubby political opportunism"" Ms Sturgeon said each step towards easing lockdown ""depends on us continuing to beat the virus back"" and could potentially be reversed. She said: ""Our challenge, not an easy one, is to manage all of this change while keeping the virus firmly under control. If at any stage there appears to be a risk of its resurgence, our path out of lockdown will be halted and we may even have to go backwards. ""To avoid that, we must get as close as possible to elimination of the virus now, and build confidence in our ability to control it in future through surveillance, testing, contact tracing and, where necessary, targeted suppression measures."" Information leaflets about the government's contact tracing system are being delivered to every household in Scotland, while ministers are considering whether to make face coverings mandatory in shops.

Lockdown party shooting victim was 'peacemaker',"Lola Ajose said her husband was a ""kind man"" and ""an amazing father"" A father-of-three was ""trying to keep the peace"" when he was shot dead with another man at a lockdown party in Manchester, his family have said. Abayomi Ajose, 36, and a 21-year-old were killed by a lone gunman in Caythorpe Street, Moss Side, on Sunday. Mr Ajose, known as Abi or Junior, was at the party,attended by ""hundreds"" of people including a DJ, looking after a friend, his family said. Police and community workers have appealed for help to catch the killer. Lekan Oyekanmi said there had been a community event for children earlier in the day which his brother-in-law Mr Ajose attended with his family. ""Everyone had such a good time and wanted it to continue for the adults in the evening,"" he said. ""He [Mr Ajose] stayed on and was looking out for his friend who wasn't in the right frame of mind."" Lekan Oyekanmi said the shootings were a big shock Mr Oyekanmi said the gunfire caused a stampede and after the second shot he saw two men on the floor, one of whom was his brother-in-law. ""I thought he was looking for his friend but whatever must have been going on - I know he was trying to keep the peace,"" he added. ""He was the peacemaker of everything."" Mr Ajose, who worked for children's services at Manchester City Council, was described by his family as a ""go-to"" person for people who needed help in the community. His widow Lola said: ""He was a kind man, everyone loved him. He worked in children's services and was passionate about it. ""I couldn't do the job he does - he is just a natural. It takes a strong person to deal with vulnerable children like that."" She described her husband as ""the best man"" and an ""amazing father"". This video can not be played Footage showed hundreds of people at the party before the shootings at about 01:00 BST Youth worker Akemia Minott said the deaths brought a ""new layer of devastation"" to the Moss Side community but bringing the killer to justice would be ""part of the healing process"". Greater Manchester Police previously said finding the killer was ""our absolute top priority"". The force said it did not break the party up because of ""public disorder"" fears.

"Swissport set to halve its UK workforceMore than 4,500 jobs could be lost at the ground handling firm due to coronavirus effects on air travel.","Swissport is set to cut more than half of its UK workforce as air companies struggle with the effects of the coronavirus crisis. The firm said it was consulting on cutting up to 4,556 jobs. Chief executive Jason Holt said the company had to reduce the size of its workforce to survive. Swissport operates at airports across the UK, including Heathrow and Gatwick, which are among those badly hit by the crisis. Air travel collapsed around the world after governments imposed travel restrictions during coronavirus lockdowns. Jet2 and Eurostar cut summer flights and trains Who's exempt from the quarantine rules? UK airlines warn quarantine will 'kill air travel' While some airlines are making plans to start flying some routes again as lockdowns lift, Swissport has said its revenue is forecast to be almost 50% lower than last year due to the crisis. Mr Holt said in a message to staff: ""We must do this to secure the lifeline of funding from lenders and investors to protect as many jobs as possible in the UK and Ireland. ""It's true that we've seen tough times before - volcanic cloud, 9/11, the financial crisis - and we've weathered these. But this time it's different. We have never seen anything like Covid-19 in our lifetimes. ""We are now facing a long period of uncertainty and reduced flight numbers, along with significant changes taking place to the way people travel and the way goods move around the world. ""There is no escaping the fact that the industry is now smaller than it was, and it will remain so for some time to come."" Swissport employs about 8,500 workers at airports, including baggage handlers and check-in staff. The GMB union said the announcement was ""devastating news"", with jobs set to be lost that were essential for regional economies. Unions are warning that the government needs to step in to prevent the air travel industry from collapsing Nadine Houghton, national officer of the GMB, said: ""With Swissport now considering job cuts on this scale, we have deep concerns about the viability of many of our regional airports and the benefits for regional connectivity that they bring."" Oliver Richardson, national officer of Unite, said: ""We can't wait any longer, the UK government needs to urgently intervene with a bespoke financial package and an extension of the 80% furlough scheme for the aviation industry."" The Unite union in Ireland confirmed that 287 workers at Belfast City Airport and Belfast International Airport face redundancy. ""This will be devastating news for these workers and their families. It is also entirely unnecessary - the government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme remains in place - these workers could continue to be furloughed. There is no need for any job-losses at this time. This is a disgraceful move solely rooted in the need to secure corporate profits,"" said George Brash, Unite Regional Officer for Swissport workers in Belfast. ""It is now absolutely imperative that we see urgent action in both Stormont and Westminster to safeguard our aviation sector, its workforce and the future of regional airports."" Staff at Swissport handle luggage after it's checked-in. They also de-ice and refuel planes and manage freight. The company provides essential services for most UK airports and airlines. Back in April Swissport UK warned it would have to slash thousands of jobs if more government support for the aviation sector was not forthcoming. This latest announcement demonstrates how the deep the damage to the aviation sector is. The pandemic has hit aviation hard and airlines and airports have already announced plans to scrap tens of thousands of jobs. The Department for Transport has consistently said that while the aviation sector is important to the UK economy, all firms, including aviation companies, should first explore existing government schemes and try to raise capital from investors before the government will consider the situation of individual firms. Industry association Airlines UK responded to Swissport's announcement by repeating its call for targeted government assistance for the sector. ""The need for a stimulus package of measures for the industry is now even more vital,"" said chief executive Tim Alderslade. Next Monday, the government is expected to make an announcement on international travel corridors, which would allow people from the UK to visit selected countries without having to face a 14-day quarantine on their return. Mr Alderslade welcomed that prospect, but added: ""The government needs to do much, much more to help a sector very much on its knees."" How are travel rules being relaxed?

Last year the social network attracted advertising revenue of almost $70bn (Â£56bn). Facebook, and its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, have often been criticised for the handling of controversial subjects. This month the company's staff spoke outagainst the tech giant's decision not to remove or flag a post by US President Donald Trump. The same message was shared on Twitter, where it washidden behind a warning labelon the grounds that it ""glorified violence"".

UK's internet use surges to new highs in lockdown,"Video-conferencing has proved one of the biggest hits of lockdown UK adults spent a quarter of their waking day online during lockdown - a record high, according to Ofcom. During April, adults spent an average of four hours a day online, up from three-and-a-half in September 2019, the communications watchdog said. And seven in 10 people made video calls at least once a week during lockdown, with millions turning to Zoom for the first time. The pandemic has radically changed online behaviour, said Ofcom. The regulator's Online Nation report,externalfound that people are seeking new ways to keep connected, informed, entertained and fit during lockdown. Twitch, the livestreaming platform for gamers, saw visitors increase from 2.3 million in January to 4.2 million in April. TikTok, which allows users to create and share short videos, reached 12.9 million UK visitors in April, up from 5.4 million in January. Much of Ofcom's report focused on people's online habits in September 2019, before the coronavirus struck. At that point, nine in 10 adults and almost all children spent time on platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram, according to the study. And nearly half of adults watch videos on such platforms several times a day, rising to 73% for children aged eight to 15. People are no longer just passive consumers, with two in five adults uploading videos to TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat or Instagram. Video conferencing app Zoom has proved the big hit of lockdown - up from 659,000 users in January to 13 million in April as the nation turned to it to chat to family and friends, and take part in quizzes and games. The app has not been without controversy, with questions about how secure it was, with some people falling victim to zoom-bombing, where an uninvited guest joins a call to cause mischief or share unpleasant or hateful material. People have turned online to entertain themselves and even to exercise Even before the pandemic, people were moving away from landline calls and text messages in favour of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, the report indicates. Lockdown seems to have accelerated the adoption of such services. Nearly half of UK adults used WhatsApp to make video calls at least weekly, with Facebook Messenger not far behind on 41% and Apple's FaceTime being used by 30%. Ofcom's director of strategy and research Yih-Choung Teh said: ""Lockdown may leave a lasting digital legacy. Coronavirus has radically changed the way we live, work and communicate online, with millions of people using online video services for the first time."" People remain wary about online safety though, with 87% of adults saying that they had concerns over children using video-sharing websites and other apps.

Man who helped stab victims 'heartened' by publicJames Antell used his shirt to try to stop the bleeding of three men stabbed to death in Reading.Berkshire,"Scientist David Wails, 49, US citizen Joe Ritchie-Bennett, 39, and history teacher James Furlong, 36, were killed in the knife attack A parliamentary assistant tried to save the lives of three men who were stabbed to death in a park in Reading. James Furlong, David Wails and Joe Ritchie-Bennettwere killed in the knife attack in Reading's Forbury Gardens on Saturday. James Antell, who works for West Dorset Conservative MP Chris Loder, used his shirt in an effort to stem their bleeding. He said he had been ""shaken"" by the attack which was ""all a bit of a blur"". Police are continuing to question Khairi Saadallah, 25, who has been arrested under the Terrorism Act. He came to the UK from Libya in 2012. James Antell has been praised for his ""remarkable and extraordinary effort"" Mr Antell said: ""I tried my very best to identify where the injuries were and took my shirt and tried to apply pressure. ""It was certainly a big relief when the police did arrive to those of us that were with the victims."" He said he still felt ""a little bit shaken"" by the ""hideous and callous"" attack, but added his overriding thoughts were with the victims, including three people who needed hospital treatment for injuries, and their families. ""It's all a bit of a blur - I was concerned for my safety and for the safety of others around,"" Mr Antell said. ""As much as this is a story of terror and violence and hate, it also exemplifies the bravery and resilience of the public. ""Looking back I was heartened by the response from members of the public and the emergency services and the wider Reading community who in the hours afterwards were providing sanctuary and doing all that they could to help."" Reading stabbings: What we know so far Who were the Reading park attack victims? 'Reading weeps' as town mourns stab deaths Mr Loder said in the Commons that he was ""extremely proud"" of his parliamentary assistant for his ""remarkable and extraordinary effort"". He told MPs Mr Antell ""ran courageously towards danger, his only focus to help the injured"". Reading Borough Council has announced it plans to create a permanent memorial in Forbury Gardens to 49-year-old scientist Mr Wails, US citizen Mr Ritchie-Bennett, 39, and 36-year-old history teacher Mr Furlong. The authority said it would work with the victims' families and the community to create a memorial ""where people can pay their respects to those who lost their lives, and everyone affected by the tragic events"". It added it would share its plans ""over the coming days and weeks"". Reading attack victims were 'true gentlemen' Reading stabbings: Who were the victims?

Rent day arrives for struggling retailers,"""We're almost 90% open with most of our retailers trading. It's a return to almost normality,"" says James Roberts the boss of Grosvenor Shopping centre in Northampton. But there's one big question.  How many of the 50 or so retailers and food outlets will be paying any rent this week. He laughs nervously when asked. ""Hopefully some, but we've only collected 56% in the last quarter,"" he says. UK landlords should be collecting at least Â£2.5bn on Wednesday for shop rents. Retail landlords traditionally get paid four times a year. On the last rent day in March, no more than half the total rent was handed over and landlords will be lucky to get a quarter of what they're owed today. Most high street shops, along with pubs and restaurants, have seen sales evaporate and have either been unable or refusing to pay rent. Bill Hughes says unless there's an appeal for long term investors like pension funds to invest in UK real estate, infrastructure won't get funded. Businesses are hoarding cash to survive. But the crisis is starving landlords of much needed income, too. The Grosvenor Shopping Centre is the kind of everyday mall you'd find in many of our towns and city centres. It's owned by Legal & General which invests in property to fund thousands of pensions. ""It's not well known, or particularly transparent to people, but most retail properties are effectively owned by the normal person on the street in the UK,"" said Bill Hughes, Legal and General's head of real assets. Recent research by Estates Gazette, a commercial property weekly, showed that as much as 60% of all UK retail space is owned either directly or indirectly by the public, including pension funds, the public sector and individual shareholders. It's been a secure form of income until now. ""The risk of loss of income is really important. The pension fund owners of the built environment of the UK, they rely upon the income being produced by what hitherto have been seen as being very stable assets. And that is at risk in a way that's never been there to the extent before."" said Mr Hughes. Landlords have enjoyed the good times over the decades with long leases and upward-only rent reviews. And rapidly expanding retailers were happy to sign up. But in recent years with sales shifting online, it's become far harder for shops to make a profit. The pandemic has accelerated this trend.  The Government extended its ban on evictions for non-payment of rent until the autumn. Occupiers are now frantically trying to secure better deals or turning to insolvency proceedings to renegotiate their debts, including owed rent. Mark Burlton, the founder of Cross Border Retail, said landlords may have to get used to the fact their properties are worth less The traditional business model of how retail property is leased is now well and truly broken. ""It's a mess, but it's not a mess that we can't tidy up"" said Mark Burlton, the founder of Cross Border Retail, a real estate business which advises landlords and retailers. ""I do feel sorry for them (landlords) . Absolutely. They are entitled to receive income, but I don't believe they're entitled to receive the same income as they were. I think they have to understand the value of their asset. And the value of their asset is what someone is prepared to pay for it. There isn't a queue of retailers coming up behind them,"" he said. He believes upward only rent reviews should be abolished along with the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1954, the law which still underpins the leasehold system in the UK. ""It's inflexible. We need something which is much cheaper and quicker to negotiate. We should have a system of rents based on turnover, allowing retailers to pay a rent they can afford. But in order to do that, tenants have to play their part. They have to declare what they are turning over,"" said Mr Burlton. Bill Hughes thinks the Government's new code of practice on rental agreements should ease the tensions. ""We're having an active conversation with tenants about can they pay, and if they can't pay, we're working hard to restructure things. ""Because it's in our interest to find a way of helping cash flow to companies that would survive beyond this very difficult, unusual crisis that Covid presents."" Legal & General's Bill Hughes thinks the Government should take a careful look at providing some financial support to help bridge the likely shortfall in income otherwise the ""dynamic between landlords and tenants is likely to be challenging and deteriorate"". The future prosperity of our high streets and town centres could ultimately be at stake if this crisis doesn't end well. Regeneration requires private sector investment as well as Government funding. Mr Hughes says unless there's an appeal for long term investors like pension funds to invest in UK real estate, infrastructure won't get funded. ""They need a sensible and stable environment within which they can get some sort of return,"" he explains. Mr Burlton says he's receiving phone calls from US private equity and venture capitalists sniffing around for opportunities to snap up some retail assets on the cheap. ""Ultimately if landlords and tenants can't agree what the actual rent should be, then a number of landlords face the very real prospect of going bust. And then we have to be careful what we wish for because the purchasers of these assets in my opinion will likely have much shorter goals than the landlords they currently have. "" The fate of heavily indebted shopping centre owner, Intu, will be decided by Friday. It owns some of the UK's biggest and most popular malls, including the Trafford Centre and the Metrocentre in Gateshead. If it can't secure a last minute agreement with its lenders, it will go into administration which could mean the temporary closure of its sites.

New advice for businesses on how to reopen safelyPubs and hairdressers are among the venues which will be allowed to reopen in England from 4 July.UK,"Screens between customers are among the safety measures suggested for hairdressers Music should be kept quiet and customers encouraged to order through apps, under updated guidance for businesses reopening from 4 July. Pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers are among the venues which will be allowed to reopen in England. There is also advice to reconfigure seating, minimise self-service, cancel live acts and stagger arrivals. It comes after Boris Johnson announced sweeping changes to England's lockdown, including a relaxing of the 2m rule. Meanwhile, the latest figures show a further 154 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, across all settings, taking the total to 43,081. Lifting lockdown: A round-up Who are we allowed to meet up with? Is it safe to relax the 2m rule? The updated government guidance,externalincludes some general advice for all businesses as well as guidance for specific sectors. It says businesses should carry out a Covid-19 risk assessment to ensure the safety of their workplace, which should be shared on their website, and also develop cleaning and hygiene procedures. Guidance for close contact services such as hairdressers says employees should wear a visor where it is not possible to maintain distance and customers could also be separated from each other by screens. Places like pubs, restaurants, hotels and hairdressers are asked to keep a temporary record of customers and visitors for 21 days, to support thetest and trace system. Pubs and restaurants should keep music at a low volume to avoid people needing to shout, which increases the risk of transmission from tiny droplets in the air, known as aerosols. Customers will be encouraged to book in advance and order food and drink direct to their tables through a smartphone app. Pubs are among the venues which will be allowed to open in England from 4 July Business Secretary Alok Sharma said he expected people to continue to use ""common sense"" and follow government guidelines. But he said there was a ""legal duty"" for businesses to keep their employees safe and the Health and Safety Executive could take action if not. Frances O'Grady, general secretary of trade union body the TUC, said the more the government relaxes lockdown ""the tougher it needs to get on health and safety at work"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it should be a legal requirement for employers to publish risk assessments on their website, adding too many companies were ""not doing the right thing"". Adam Regan, who runs the Hare and Hounds pub in Birmingham, said the guidelines were ""very, very difficult to navigate safely"". He told BBC Radio 5 Live extra staff would be needed to monitor entrances and serve tables, while some customers might not be comfortable giving their contact details on arrival. Mr Regan said another concern was that people would become more relaxed and less conscious of social distancing after drinking alcohol. What will a reopened pub actually be like? Mike Cherry, chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said while there was ""a lot to welcome"" in the guidance, ""ideally, small firms would have been given weeks rather than days to prepare for their reopenings"". He said the new measures would also bring extra costs for companies and called for government support to help businesses which could not afford to reconfigure their premises. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said that while he supported the easing of the lockdown,a more effective test and trace system was needed for the plan to work safely. This video can not be played Boris Johnson is cheered as he announces English pubs can reopen from 4 July In the biggest easing of lockdown yet, Mr Johnson also said the 2m social-distancing rule would be replaced with a ""one-metre plus"" rule in England. This means people should stay at least 2m (6ft) apart where possible, but otherwise should remain at least 1m apart while taking steps to reduce the risk of transmission, such as wearing face coverings. The 2m rule will remain in Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland,ministers have said social distancing of 1m is ""safe and appropriate"" for children at school. Announcing the changes on Tuesday, Mr Johnson said the following venues would be able to reopen from 4 July: Pubs, bars and restaurantsbut only with a table service indoors, and owners will be asked to keep contact details of customers to help with contact tracing Hotels, holiday apartments, campsites and caravan parksbut shared facilities must be cleaned properly Theatres and music hallsbut they will not be allowed to hold live performances In other changesweddingswill be allowed to have 30 attendees, andplaces of worshipwill be allowed to hold services but singing will be banned Hair salonsandbarberswill be able to reopen but must have protective measures, such as visors, in place Libraries, community centresandbingo halls Cinemas,museumsandgalleries Funfairs, theme parks, adventure parks, amusement arcades, outdoor skating rinksandmodel villages Indoor attractions where animals are exhibited, such as atzoos,aquariums,farms,safari parksandwildlife centres Some other venues will remain closed by law, including nightclubs, casinos, indoor play areas, nail bars and beauty salons, swimming pools and indoor gyms. It comes asstruggling retailers must pay their quarterly rentto landlords on Wednesday. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowdensaid in a tweet,externalthat the government's ""aspiration"" was to reopen gyms and leisure facilities in England in mid-July. However, Mark Sesnan, chief executive of Greenwich Leisure, which runs leisure centres for councils across the country, said he was ""shocked and disappointed"" that such sites would not be allowed to reopen on 4 July. ""We had been led to believe that we would be,"" he told the BBC, adding that the company had ""incurred quite a lot of expense"" getting facilities ready. He said most swimming pools and sports halls were ""very large spaces"", making social distancing easier. Scientists also say chlorinated water should kill the virus. What might swimming pools be like after lockdown? Anger as indoor sports facilities remain closed Why are gyms still closed? And other questions The shops that won't be reopening The Betting and Gaming Council said it was ""inconsistent and frankly nonsensical"" that casinos were not able to reopen along with other parts of the hospitality industry. ""Casinos have done everything that they were asked to do by the government and they have pulled out all the stops to ensure they are able to open their doors safely for both staff and customers from 4 July,"" chief executive Michael Dugher said. Mr Sharma said he understood the ""frustration"" of businesses that were not yet allowed to reopen but ""the proximity that you have to someone in some of these closer settings"" posed ""a greater risk"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SOCIAL LIFE:When will pubs, bars and restaurants reopen?

Further dates for lockdown easing to be announcedScotland's first minister is to give an update on the timescale for easing the country's lockdown restrictions.Scotland,"Scottish pub and restaurant businesses have been shut down by the coronavirus lockdown People in Scotland will be allowed to meet up with two other households indoors from 10 July and pubs and restaurants can re-open from 15 July. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also said the five-mile travel limit will be lifted from 3 July, while beer gardens can re-open from 6 July. Hairdressers and barbers can open from 15 July, as can holiday accommodation. Ms Sturgeon said the move was possible thanks to the ""real sustained progress"" made in suppressing coronavirus. But she said the changes depended on keeping the virus under control, and could be reversed if there was a fresh outbreak. And they will not apply to people who are shielding, who will be given further advice ""before the end of July"". Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland Which Scottish lockdown rules will change next - and when? Lifting lockdown across the UK: All you need to know The first minister was speaking as new data showed that the coronavirus death rate has continued to fall for the eighth week in a row, with Ms Sturgeon saying these ""clear trends"" meant ""firmer milestones"" for the journey out of lockdown could be set. Advisors are still reviewing whether the 2m (6ft 6in) physical distancing rule should be eased, but a range of different shops and services can now begin planning for re-opening in mid-July. The government'srevised routemap,externalsaid shopping centres and dental practices could fully re-open from 13 July, while optometrists can begin to scale up work. From 15 July, all holiday accommodation can open up, along with indoor areas of pubs and restaurants and hairdressers and barbers. These moves depend on safety measures being put in place, and hospitality businesses will have to retain contact details for customers for four weeks. Museums, galleries, cinemas and libraries will be allowed to resume business from the same date, as long as physical distancing and other safety measures are enforced. However live entertainment venues like theatres, nightclubs and bingo halls ""will not reopen until a later date"", while ""further consideration"" is being given to the opening of indoor gyms and restrictions on weddings and funerals. 29 June - Most non-essential shops, many indoor workplaces, visitor attractions including zoos, outdoor sports courts and playgrounds 3 July - Five mile travel distance relaxed, most self-catering holiday homes and second homes can be used 6 July - Outdoor hospitality such as beer gardens can reopen 10 July - People can meet in extended groups outdoors and with two other households indoors 13 July - Shopping centres can reopen, organised outdoor contact sports for children can resume, dentists can reopen for most routine care 15 July - Pubs, restaurants and all holiday accommodation can reopen, as can hairdressers, barbers, museums, cinemas, libraries and childcare Read more about the lockdown easing timeline here Ministers have already announced that they are planning forschools to return full-time from 11 Augustwith no physical distancing between pupils. Ms Sturgeon said that on 1 May, it was estimated that about 25,000 people in Scotland had the virus - but that she expected that figure to be ""around 2,000"" when new figures are published on Thursday. She said this was ""down to people doing the right thing and following the rules"", saying: ""The sacrifices that have been made have suppressed the virus, protected the NHS and undoubtedly saved a significant number of lives."" Scotland will not decide whether to follow England in relaxing the 2m rules until at least next week The first minister said Scots ""must not be complacent"" about the dangers of Covid-19, but said if progress continued to be made then ""the prize is getting greater normality back in our lives, maybe more quickly than we would have envisaged a few weeks ago"". Many of the changes mirrorthose announced for Englandby Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday, but with dates around two weeks later. Most Scottish council areas record zero Covid deaths Ms Sturgeon accepted that Scotland's pace in exiting lockdown ""is slightly slower than England's"", saying this was ""in my view right for our circumstances and I hope more likely to be sustainable than if we went faster"". The Scottish Conservatives said the delay ""will cost millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line"", saying that ""Scotland has to look on while the rest of the UK and Europe resumes normal life"". Ms Sturgeon said she was not prepared to take part in ""some kind of reckless race"" with other parts of the country, saying opposition attacks were ""grubby political opportunism at a time of national crisis"". None of the changes Nicola Sturgeon announced today take immediate effect. Instead she has offered a series of dates to pencil into our diaries - the promise of further freedoms to come. The first minister acknowledged that the pace of easing lockdown in Scotland is ""slightly slower"" than in England, but said she wanted to continue to move carefully to reduce the chance of a coronavirus resurgence. When (non-essential) high street retailers reopen on Monday in Scotland, similar shops in England will have been trading for a fortnight. But not everything is happening later here. If new plans for the full return of schooling go ahead in August - when Scottish schools normally go back from their summer break - Scotland could be the first part of the UK to achieve that. Everything is of course conditional on the continued suppression of the virus. The signs in Scotland are good, with a further reduction in the weekly number of virus-related deaths being reported by the National Records of Scotland today. Ms Sturgeon accused her opponents of ""grubby political opportunism"" Ms Sturgeon said each step towards easing lockdown ""depends on us continuing to beat the virus back"" and could potentially be reversed. She said: ""Our challenge, not an easy one, is to manage all of this change while keeping the virus firmly under control. If at any stage there appears to be a risk of its resurgence, our path out of lockdown will be halted and we may even have to go backwards. ""To avoid that, we must get as close as possible to elimination of the virus now, and build confidence in our ability to control it in future through surveillance, testing, contact tracing and, where necessary, targeted suppression measures."" Information leaflets about the government's contact tracing system are being delivered to every household in Scotland, while ministers are considering whether to make face coverings mandatory in shops.

"UK's internet use surges to new highs in lockdownCoronavirus will leave a digital legacy as UK finds solace online, says Ofcom.Technology","Video-conferencing has proved one of the biggest hits of lockdown UK adults spent a quarter of their waking day online during lockdown - a record high, according to Ofcom. During April, adults spent an average of four hours a day online, up from three-and-a-half in September 2019, the communications watchdog said. And seven in 10 people made video calls at least once a week during lockdown, with millions turning to Zoom for the first time. The pandemic has radically changed online behaviour, said Ofcom. The regulator's Online Nation report,externalfound that people are seeking new ways to keep connected, informed, entertained and fit during lockdown. Twitch, the livestreaming platform for gamers, saw visitors increase from 2.3 million in January to 4.2 million in April. TikTok, which allows users to create and share short videos, reached 12.9 million UK visitors in April, up from 5.4 million in January. Much of Ofcom's report focused on people's online habits in September 2019, before the coronavirus struck. At that point, nine in 10 adults and almost all children spent time on platforms such as TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat and Instagram, according to the study. And nearly half of adults watch videos on such platforms several times a day, rising to 73% for children aged eight to 15. People are no longer just passive consumers, with two in five adults uploading videos to TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat or Instagram. Video conferencing app Zoom has proved the big hit of lockdown - up from 659,000 users in January to 13 million in April as the nation turned to it to chat to family and friends, and take part in quizzes and games. The app has not been without controversy, with questions about how secure it was, with some people falling victim to zoom-bombing, where an uninvited guest joins a call to cause mischief or share unpleasant or hateful material. People have turned online to entertain themselves and even to exercise Even before the pandemic, people were moving away from landline calls and text messages in favour of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, the report indicates. Lockdown seems to have accelerated the adoption of such services. Nearly half of UK adults used WhatsApp to make video calls at least weekly, with Facebook Messenger not far behind on 41% and Apple's FaceTime being used by 30%. Ofcom's director of strategy and research Yih-Choung Teh said: ""Lockdown may leave a lasting digital legacy. Coronavirus has radically changed the way we live, work and communicate online, with millions of people using online video services for the first time."" People remain wary about online safety though, with 87% of adults saying that they had concerns over children using video-sharing websites and other apps.

The movement has said it is a ""response to Facebook's long history of allowing racist, violent and verifiably false content to run rampant on its platform"". Stop Hate for Profit has called on advertisers to pressure the company to adopt stricter measures against racist and hateful content on its platforms by stopping all spending on advertising with it throughout July. Last year the social network attracted advertising revenue of almost $70bn (Â£56bn). Facebook, and its chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, have often been criticised for the handling of controversial subjects. This month the company's staff spoke outagainst the tech giant's decision not to remove or flag a post by US President Donald Trump. The same message was shared on Twitter, where it washidden behind a warning labelon the grounds that it ""glorified violence"".

Take this quizto test your knowledge of the government's advice on coronavirus during the summer in the UK . Gym bosses say theyare ""extremely disappointed"" at the government's decision to allow pubs to reopenon 4 July but not indoor sports facilities. Humphrey Cobbold, head of the Pure Gym chain, told the BBC indoor gyms were not high risk for coronavirus and his sites were ready to reopen safely. And the boss of the David Lloyd group called the decision bizarre and illogical. The government hopes gyms can reopen in mid-July, subject to health guidance. The Theatre Royal in Newcastlehas followed its namesake in Plymouthin making a redundancy announcement. Theatres have been allowed to open from 4 July, but no live performances are allowed because of coronavirus restrictions. The venues are 400 miles apart and are not linked, apart from sharing a name. On Tuesday,the Devon theatre warnedthat 110 of its 350 jobs were at risk. A day later, the Newcastle venue said it had taken the ""the very difficult and heartbreaking decision"" to make 44 of its 89 staff redundant.

Eighteen patients who tested positive for coronaviruswere sent from North Tees hospitals into care homes as the pandemic worsened,it has emerged. Figures from North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust also revealed 311 people were discharged into homes without a Covid-19 test between 1 March and 15 April. After this date it was routine to test such patients for Covid-19 . Stockton North MP Alex Cunningham said the past stance on discharge was cause for ""grave concern"". A memorial for transport workers could be erected at London Victoria station in honour of Belly Mujinga,who died after being allegedly spat at by a man who claimed to have Covid-19. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps revealed he has been in discussions with trade unions over commemorating the 54 transport workers who have died from coronavirus. He told the Commons Transport Select Committee: ""I've spoken to the unions and others about doing something in slightly longer-term to commemorate transport workers' extraordinary input and effort to assist the country in this time of crisis, perhaps with some sort of commemoration or memorial. ""Perhaps even at Victoria station, where, sadly, Belly Mujinga worked but sadly died. ""I think that might be an appropriate location to remember all transport workers during this crisis."" The death of Mrs Mujinga sparked outrage and questions about why she was not protected at the time of the incident, which was not reported to British Transport Police (BTP) until seven weeks later. Eurostar staff furloughed during the lockdown are helping London schools with online French lessons. Rail staff not currently working, including train drivers, have volunteered to help pupils learning at home online.

While pubs and hairdressers in England have been given the all clear by government to reopen on 4 July,many businesses have been told to remain doors closed for now. Beautician Tara Williamson is frustrated by what she sees as a double standard from government, with hairdressers allowed to reopen but beauty salons staying closed. She runs The Beauty, Skin and Eyelash Lounge in Epping and had planned to open on 4 July. ""I don't really get it. I don't see a reason why we couldn't open and it will obviously be a big blow,"" she says. ""We've put screens in place, we've done a one-way system in the salon, we've prepared everything for the two metre distancing, we've staggered appointments, we've got sanitising stations,"" she says. ""It just seems crazy that we have no guidelines of when we can open and what is going to be happening."" Martin LewesReporter A school in Cumbria says it has managed to accommodate all the children whose parents want them back in school for the final four weeks of term, with help from the Westmorland County Show The need to space out children and teachers to reduce the risk of infection has caused problems for many schools, but Grasmere Primary School's staff turned to the show organisers and asked if it was possible to hire marquees. Two marquees are now being used as extra classrooms for four year groups, and staff there say they've added extra enjoyment as well. One of the most unforgettable moments of lockdown wasthe fundraising achievement of World War Two veteran Captain Tom Moore. The 100-year-old walked the same number of laps of his garden to raise Â£32m for the NHS, in time for his landmark birthday in April. As part of the 100 days of Make A Difference project, Three Counties Radio started an idea which spread nationwide, to create a mosaic of photos submitted by the public. And, on this 100th day of the BBC campaign, Capt Tom was presented with the mosaic, along with his grandson Benjie. Pubs and restaurants reopening from 4 July should keep music at a low volume to avoid people needing to shout, which increases the risk of transmission from tiny droplets in the air, known as aerosols. Customers will be also encouraged to book in advance and order food and drink direct to their tables through a smartphone app. Pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hairdressers are among the venues which will be allowed to reopen in England Visitor attractions such as the Yorkshire Wildlife Park have only just reopened following the easing of coronavirus restrictions. Not only are the animals getting used to receiving 'guests' once again, but there is also the small matter of the day's heatwave. Â© 2025 BBC.

Now a further factory in Cambridgeshire, England, has closed for deep cleaning after 14 positive test results among staff. Health ministers have said coronaviruses thrive in cold, damp environments and survive for longer indoors and particularly on smooth surfaces - but not food itself.

In response to this dip in demand,airline Jet2 and rail firm Eurostar have said they will scale back their flights and trains this summer. Eurostar said its train timetable would focus on routes between major cities such as London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, where demand was highest. Eurostar's direct summer services to Lyon, Avignon and Marseilles, which were meant to start in May, will no longer run at all in 2020 or 2021. Jet2 said it would be reducing its flying programme for 2020 and 2021, citing ""complicated"" challenges relating to the coronavirus crisis and ""changes on an almost daily basis"". ""Sadly, the overall effect of these reductions has been the need to propose a number of colleague redundancies across our business,â the airline said. The airline is proposing to cut 102 pilot jobs, the pilots' union Balpa said on Wednesday.

A beach in Brighton on England's south coast Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The outbreak in the Americas has not yet peaked, with an increase in cases of between 25% and 50% in the last week, the head of health emergencies for the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Mike Ryan, has said. Dr Ryan said the virus exploited ""weak health systems"" and ""poor government"", and said that for governments to understand how to tackle the outbreak, they needed to look at the actions of countries which had succeeded in suppressing transmission. Dr Mike Ryan, the head of emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO), has praised the UK for the way it is easing restrictions. He said there had been a ""steady, slow and step-wise exit from lockdown conditions"" in the country. Dr Ryan said the government had communicated the changes to the population at large and to the WHO â with a consistent dialogue between the four nations of the UK over regional differences. He said testing in the UK had now increased and the ""surveillance system is capable of understand where the disease is"". His comments came after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the next level of lockdown easing would take place on 4 July, when businesses such as pubs and restaurants can reopen under government guidelines. The US states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will require visitors from Covid-19 hotspots elsewhere in the country to quarantine for 14 days, officials have said. The governors of the three north-eastern states - once coronavirus hotspots themselves - announced the joint travel advisory today. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he did not want visitors from other states bringing Covid-19 in with them, because ""we worked very hard to get the viral transmission down"". The quarantine rule will apply to visitors from states where 10% of the population is infected with Covid-19 on a seven-day rolling average, Mr Cuomo said. Nine states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Texas, currently meet that high infection rate threshold. The quarantine will come into effect on Thursday. With more than 31,000 deaths and 412,000 cases to date, New York was the epicentre of the pandemic at one stage, but now other southern and western states are seeing a rise in infections. This video can not be played Covid-19: A brief look back at the government briefings The daily Downing Street news conferences became a fixture of the UK's coronavirus coverage - and on previous days, we would have just finished one at about this time. But now that they havebeen scrapped, here's a look back at the last three months' briefings. Around 45,000 runners usually take part in the marathon every year Another major event has been cancelled because of the pandemic: this year's Berlin Marathon in Germany. Organisers say the event - originally scheduled to take place on 26-27 September - will not go ahead citing Covid-19 restrictions and health concerns. They say holding the marathon was not possible given the German government's social-distancing rules. And, following a review, they decided the event could not be held at a later date this year either. ""As hard as we have tried, it is currently not possible to organise the BMW Berlin-Marathon with its usual Berlin charm,"" the organisers said. ""Your health, as well as all of our health, is our first priority."" Around 45,000 runners usually take part in the marathon every year in the German capital. Earlier, we reported that this year's marathon in New York had been scrapped also because of the pandemic. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine trials in Africa: What you need to know Scientists are scrambling to develop an effective vaccine against Covid-19, with trials taking place worldwide. One of those trials is being carried out in South Africa, where a vaccine made by Oxford University is being tested. Scientists say that it is vital for Africans to take part in these trials, arguing that not doing so could jeopardise efforts to find a vaccine that works across the globe. But critics cite a history of Western exploitation of Africa and unethical drug trials in the past as a reason not to participate. Why are vaccine trials such a sensitive issue in Africa? BBC Africa's Joice Etutu explains in the video above. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was ""confident"" that an arrangement could be reached US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said he is ""confident"" the US and the EU will be able to agree arrangements for the resumption of international travel. There have been reports that the European Union could block Americans from resuming travel to EU countries because of the prevalence of coronavirus in the US. Pompeo told reporters: ""I'm confident that we'll find a set of conditions that create sufficient health and safety protection. ""We're working on finding the right way to do that, the right timing to do it, the right tactics to have in place. We certainly don't want to cause problems any place else."" We have more on the EU discussions here. Volunteers have begun being immunised with a new UK coronavirus vaccine. About 300 people will have the vaccine over the coming weeks, as part of a trial led by Prof Robin Shattock and his colleagues, at Imperial College London. Tests on animals suggest the vaccine is safe and triggers an effective immune response. Many traditional vaccines are based on a weakened or modified form of virus, but the Imperial vaccine is based on a new approach, using synthetic strands of genetic code, called RNA, which mimic the virus. There are more than 120 coronavirus vaccines in early development across the world. A further 13 are now in clinical trials: five in China, three in the United States, two in the UK, one in Australia, Germany and Russia. Vaccine teams are keen to stress that they are not in a race against each other, but against the virus. If there are to be enough doses to protect the world, several vaccine approaches will need to be successful,writes the BBC's medical correspondent Fergus Walsh. Dr Tedros said rising case numbers were a ""sober reminder"" of our responsibilities The World Health Organization (WHO) says it expects to see the number of cases of Covid-19 reach 10 million within the next week. ""More than 9.1 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to the WHO, and more than 470,000 deaths,"" the health body chief, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told reporters in Geneva. ""In the first month of this outbreak, less than 10,000 cases were reported. In the last month, almost four million cases have been reported.

Vivienne NunisBusiness reporter, BBC News Louise Parkinson runs a cleaning business in Chippenham, Wiltshire Cleaners across England are facing huge financial challenges as a result of the pandemic Since the lockdown, lots of people have stopped using cleaning services. Some simply can't afford the additional cost, while others find it too much of a disruption to have people cleaning the house while they're working and educating children from home. And some clients are shielding or worried about the risk of catching Covid-19 from workers entering their properties. Where the work has continued, many businesses have been left to come up with their own safety protocols. Husband-and-wife team Liam and Louise Parkinson, who are based in Chippenham, Wiltshire, say their customer base has been reduced ""from 30 customers down to one or two"" becuase of the pandemic. Cleaning staff are permitted to work in people's homes, but industry leaders say there hasn't been clear guidance from the government advising cleaners how to keep themselves and their clients safe.

West Bengal was going to ease its lockdown on 30 June The Indian state of West Bengal has extended its lockdown until 31 July to stem the spread of Covid-19 after a spike in infections nationwide. The lockdown in the eastern state was supposed to expire on 30 June. But as new infections continue to rise across the country, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, said it was necessary to keep restrictions in place to ""help the entire nation"". Schools, colleges and universities would remain shut as part of the continued curbs, but some relaxations would go ahead, the minister said. India's infections jumped by almost 16,000 to more than 456,000 on Wednesday, the highest daily rise in the country. The death toll stands at more than 14,000. There have been 14,728 confirmed cases and 580 deaths in West Bengal.

In case you missed them, these were some of the biggest developments of the day: We reported earlier on the Welsh food factory linked to almost 100 coronavirus cases. Now a further factory in Cambridgeshire, England, has closed for deep cleaning after 14 positive test results among staff. Health ministers have said coronaviruses thrive in cold, damp environments and survive for longer indoors and particularly on smooth surfaces - but not food itself. This is believed to pose a particular challenge to the food manufacturing industry. Outbreaks at food factories and wholesale food markets have also been reported in Germany and China. Read morehere. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent Fancy a pint in the pub? From 4 July, you can have one - or indeed a mojito or an orange juice - in England. But you probably won't be able to stroll up to the bar and order what you fancy. In many places, you may find you need an app for that. The government has published alengthy document, giving guidance to restaurants, pubs and takeaways,externalon all the measures they will need to take to operate safely. You can read analysis of those measures here. A food factory in Wales is linked to nearly 100 cases of coronavirus. The country's health minister has confirmed that 97 people have now tested positive after staff became ill at Rowan Foods. One trade union has accused the company of not dealing with health and safety concerns urgently. Two other food processing plants have had confirmed cases in Wales, with the largest number at 2 Sisters in Anglesey. Read morehere.

In response to this dip in demand,airline Jet2 and rail firm Eurostar have said they will scale back their flights and trains this summer. Eurostar said its train timetable would focus on routes between major cities such as London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, where demand was highest. Eurostar's direct summer services to Lyon, Avignon and Marseilles, which were meant to start in May, will no longer run at all in 2020 or 2021. Jet2 said it would be reducing its flying programme for 2020 and 2021, citing ""complicated"" challenges relating to the coronavirus crisis and ""changes on an almost daily basis"". ""Sadly, the overall effect of these reductions has been the need to propose a number of colleague redundancies across our business,â the airline said.

Rent day arrives for struggling retailersShops are due to pay their quarterly rent bill on Wednesday as landlords expect a shortfall.,"""We're almost 90% open with most of our retailers trading. It's a return to almost normality,"" says James Roberts the boss of Grosvenor Shopping centre in Northampton. But there's one big question.  How many of the 50 or so retailers and food outlets will be paying any rent this week. He laughs nervously when asked. ""Hopefully some, but we've only collected 56% in the last quarter,"" he says. UK landlords should be collecting at least Â£2.5bn on Wednesday for shop rents. Retail landlords traditionally get paid four times a year. On the last rent day in March, no more than half the total rent was handed over and landlords will be lucky to get a quarter of what they're owed today. Most high street shops, along with pubs and restaurants, have seen sales evaporate and have either been unable or refusing to pay rent. Bill Hughes says unless there's an appeal for long term investors like pension funds to invest in UK real estate, infrastructure won't get funded. Businesses are hoarding cash to survive. But the crisis is starving landlords of much needed income, too. The Grosvenor Shopping Centre is the kind of everyday mall you'd find in many of our towns and city centres. It's owned by Legal & General which invests in property to fund thousands of pensions. ""It's not well known, or particularly transparent to people, but most retail properties are effectively owned by the normal person on the street in the UK,"" said Bill Hughes, Legal and General's head of real assets. Recent research by Estates Gazette, a commercial property weekly, showed that as much as 60% of all UK retail space is owned either directly or indirectly by the public, including pension funds, the public sector and individual shareholders. It's been a secure form of income until now. ""The risk of loss of income is really important. The pension fund owners of the built environment of the UK, they rely upon the income being produced by what hitherto have been seen as being very stable assets. And that is at risk in a way that's never been there to the extent before."" said Mr Hughes. Landlords have enjoyed the good times over the decades with long leases and upward-only rent reviews. And rapidly expanding retailers were happy to sign up. But in recent years with sales shifting online, it's become far harder for shops to make a profit. The pandemic has accelerated this trend.  The Government extended its ban on evictions for non-payment of rent until the autumn. Occupiers are now frantically trying to secure better deals or turning to insolvency proceedings to renegotiate their debts, including owed rent. Mark Burlton, the founder of Cross Border Retail, said landlords may have to get used to the fact their properties are worth less The traditional business model of how retail property is leased is now well and truly broken. ""It's a mess, but it's not a mess that we can't tidy up"" said Mark Burlton, the founder of Cross Border Retail, a real estate business which advises landlords and retailers. ""I do feel sorry for them (landlords) . Absolutely. They are entitled to receive income, but I don't believe they're entitled to receive the same income as they were. I think they have to understand the value of their asset. And the value of their asset is what someone is prepared to pay for it. There isn't a queue of retailers coming up behind them,"" he said. He believes upward only rent reviews should be abolished along with the Landlord and Tenant Act of 1954, the law which still underpins the leasehold system in the UK. ""It's inflexible. We need something which is much cheaper and quicker to negotiate. We should have a system of rents based on turnover, allowing retailers to pay a rent they can afford. But in order to do that, tenants have to play their part. They have to declare what they are turning over,"" said Mr Burlton. Bill Hughes thinks the Government's new code of practice on rental agreements should ease the tensions. ""We're having an active conversation with tenants about can they pay, and if they can't pay, we're working hard to restructure things. ""Because it's in our interest to find a way of helping cash flow to companies that would survive beyond this very difficult, unusual crisis that Covid presents."" Legal & General's Bill Hughes thinks the Government should take a careful look at providing some financial support to help bridge the likely shortfall in income otherwise the ""dynamic between landlords and tenants is likely to be challenging and deteriorate"". The future prosperity of our high streets and town centres could ultimately be at stake if this crisis doesn't end well. Regeneration requires private sector investment as well as Government funding. Mr Hughes says unless there's an appeal for long term investors like pension funds to invest in UK real estate, infrastructure won't get funded. ""They need a sensible and stable environment within which they can get some sort of return,"" he explains. Mr Burlton says he's receiving phone calls from US private equity and venture capitalists sniffing around for opportunities to snap up some retail assets on the cheap. ""Ultimately if landlords and tenants can't agree what the actual rent should be, then a number of landlords face the very real prospect of going bust. And then we have to be careful what we wish for because the purchasers of these assets in my opinion will likely have much shorter goals than the landlords they currently have. "" The fate of heavily indebted shopping centre owner, Intu, will be decided by Friday. It owns some of the UK's biggest and most popular malls, including the Trafford Centre and the Metrocentre in Gateshead. If it can't secure a last minute agreement with its lenders, it will go into administration which could mean the temporary closure of its sites.

Further dates for lockdown easing to be announced,"Scottish pub and restaurant businesses have been shut down by the coronavirus lockdown People in Scotland will be allowed to meet up with two other households indoors from 10 July and pubs and restaurants can re-open from 15 July. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also said the five-mile travel limit will be lifted from 3 July, while beer gardens can re-open from 6 July. Hairdressers and barbers can open from 15 July, as can holiday accommodation. Ms Sturgeon said the move was possible thanks to the ""real sustained progress"" made in suppressing coronavirus. But she said the changes depended on keeping the virus under control, and could be reversed if there was a fresh outbreak. And they will not apply to people who are shielding, who will be given further advice ""before the end of July"". Live: Latest on coronavirus in Scotland Which Scottish lockdown rules will change next - and when? Lifting lockdown across the UK: All you need to know The first minister was speaking as new data showed that the coronavirus death rate has continued to fall for the eighth week in a row, with Ms Sturgeon saying these ""clear trends"" meant ""firmer milestones"" for the journey out of lockdown could be set. Advisors are still reviewing whether the 2m (6ft 6in) physical distancing rule should be eased, but a range of different shops and services can now begin planning for re-opening in mid-July. The government'srevised routemap,externalsaid shopping centres and dental practices could fully re-open from 13 July, while optometrists can begin to scale up work. From 15 July, all holiday accommodation can open up, along with indoor areas of pubs and restaurants and hairdressers and barbers. These moves depend on safety measures being put in place, and hospitality businesses will have to retain contact details for customers for four weeks. Museums, galleries, cinemas and libraries will be allowed to resume business from the same date, as long as physical distancing and other safety measures are enforced. However live entertainment venues like theatres, nightclubs and bingo halls ""will not reopen until a later date"", while ""further consideration"" is being given to the opening of indoor gyms and restrictions on weddings and funerals. 29 June - Most non-essential shops, many indoor workplaces, visitor attractions including zoos, outdoor sports courts and playgrounds 3 July - Five mile travel distance relaxed, most self-catering holiday homes and second homes can be used 6 July - Outdoor hospitality such as beer gardens can reopen 10 July - People can meet in extended groups outdoors and with two other households indoors 13 July - Shopping centres can reopen, organised outdoor contact sports for children can resume, dentists can reopen for most routine care 15 July - Pubs, restaurants and all holiday accommodation can reopen, as can hairdressers, barbers, museums, cinemas, libraries and childcare Read more about the lockdown easing timeline here Ministers have already announced that they are planning forschools to return full-time from 11 Augustwith no physical distancing between pupils. Ms Sturgeon said that on 1 May, it was estimated that about 25,000 people in Scotland had the virus - but that she expected that figure to be ""around 2,000"" when new figures are published on Thursday. She said this was ""down to people doing the right thing and following the rules"", saying: ""The sacrifices that have been made have suppressed the virus, protected the NHS and undoubtedly saved a significant number of lives."" Scotland will not decide whether to follow England in relaxing the 2m rules until at least next week The first minister said Scots ""must not be complacent"" about the dangers of Covid-19, but said if progress continued to be made then ""the prize is getting greater normality back in our lives, maybe more quickly than we would have envisaged a few weeks ago"". Many of the changes mirrorthose announced for Englandby Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday, but with dates around two weeks later. Most Scottish council areas record zero Covid deaths Ms Sturgeon accepted that Scotland's pace in exiting lockdown ""is slightly slower than England's"", saying this was ""in my view right for our circumstances and I hope more likely to be sustainable than if we went faster"". The Scottish Conservatives said the delay ""will cost millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line"", saying that ""Scotland has to look on while the rest of the UK and Europe resumes normal life"". Ms Sturgeon said she was not prepared to take part in ""some kind of reckless race"" with other parts of the country, saying opposition attacks were ""grubby political opportunism at a time of national crisis"". None of the changes Nicola Sturgeon announced today take immediate effect. Instead she has offered a series of dates to pencil into our diaries - the promise of further freedoms to come. The first minister acknowledged that the pace of easing lockdown in Scotland is ""slightly slower"" than in England, but said she wanted to continue to move carefully to reduce the chance of a coronavirus resurgence. When (non-essential) high street retailers reopen on Monday in Scotland, similar shops in England will have been trading for a fortnight. But not everything is happening later here. If new plans for the full return of schooling go ahead in August - when Scottish schools normally go back from their summer break - Scotland could be the first part of the UK to achieve that. Everything is of course conditional on the continued suppression of the virus. The signs in Scotland are good, with a further reduction in the weekly number of virus-related deaths being reported by the National Records of Scotland today. Ms Sturgeon accused her opponents of ""grubby political opportunism"" Ms Sturgeon said each step towards easing lockdown ""depends on us continuing to beat the virus back"" and could potentially be reversed. She said: ""Our challenge, not an easy one, is to manage all of this change while keeping the virus firmly under control. If at any stage there appears to be a risk of its resurgence, our path out of lockdown will be halted and we may even have to go backwards. ""To avoid that, we must get as close as possible to elimination of the virus now, and build confidence in our ability to control it in future through surveillance, testing, contact tracing and, where necessary, targeted suppression measures."" Information leaflets about the government's contact tracing system are being delivered to every household in Scotland, while ministers are considering whether to make face coverings mandatory in shops.

Virus has 'brought US to its knees' - CDC chief,"New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to quarantine people coming from hard-hit US states The move comes as half of US states are seeing a surge in new cases The IMF says economic activity in 2020 is likely to decline by almost 5% - almost double the April prediction The UK economy may contract by 10% - but Italy, France and Spain will be worse off Globally there are now 9.2 million cases and almost 477,000 deaths More than 100,000 people have now died in Latin America Health experts are saying infection rates still have not peaked in many countries Hamish Mackay Thatâs it for our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic for today. Thanks for joining us. Weâll be back on Thursday with more live updates from the UK and around the world. Today's coverage was brought to you by Hamish Mackay, Claudia Allen, Joshua Nevett, Mal Siret, George Bowden, Victoria Lindrea, Hugo Bachega, Joshua Cheetham, Vanessa Buschschluter, Toby Luckhurst, Krutika Pathi, Yvette Tan and Owen Amos. In case you missed them, these were some of the biggest developments of the day: We reported earlier on the Welsh food factory linked to almost 100 coronavirus cases. Now a further factory in Cambridgeshire, England, has closed for deep cleaning after 14 positive test results among staff. Health ministers have said coronaviruses thrive in cold, damp environments and survive for longer indoors and particularly on smooth surfaces - but not food itself. This is believed to pose a particular challenge to the food manufacturing industry. Outbreaks at food factories and wholesale food markets have also been reported in Germany and China. Read morehere. Rory Cellan-JonesTechnology correspondent Fancy a pint in the pub? From 4 July, you can have one - or indeed a mojito or an orange juice - in England. But you probably won't be able to stroll up to the bar and order what you fancy. In many places, you may find you need an app for that. The government has published alengthy document, giving guidance to restaurants, pubs and takeaways,externalon all the measures they will need to take to operate safely. You can read analysis of those measures here. A food factory in Wales is linked to nearly 100 cases of coronavirus. The country's health minister has confirmed that 97 people have now tested positive after staff became ill at Rowan Foods. One trade union has accused the company of not dealing with health and safety concerns urgently. Two other food processing plants have had confirmed cases in Wales, with the largest number at 2 Sisters in Anglesey. Read morehere. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Crowds gathered to watch a spectacular military display as Russia celebrated the 75th anniversary of its victory over the Nazis in World War Two. The parade had been postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic, but President Vladimir Putin recently declared it safe to go ahead - despite the fact that the virus is still present in Russia. Watch as thousands of soldiers marched across Red Square in Moscow. This video can not be played Russia WW2 parade goes ahead despite coronavirus fears The number of reported coronavirus deaths in France rose by 11 to 29,731 on
Wednesday, down sharply from Tuesday, when the weekly data for
nursing homes were included. It is the lowest increase in Covid-19 fatalities in five
days. France's death toll is the fifth-highest in the world.

Masood Khan spent weeks on a ventilator in Wakefield's Pinderfields Hospital in England, cared for by ICU nurse Jackie Wright among others, but is now beginning to recover. ""I had a tube in my throat and I couldn't speak for two months,"" Masood says. ""It was very difficult, it was very painful."" ""He was probably one of the sickest patients that we've ever had,"" Jackie reflects. Demand for transport of all kinds has dropped to historic lows during the coronavirus pandemic. In response to this dip in demand,airline Jet2 and rail firm Eurostar have said they will scale back their flights and trains this summer. Eurostar said its train timetable would focus on routes between major cities such as London, Paris, Brussels and Amsterdam, where demand was highest. Eurostar's direct summer services to Lyon, Avignon and Marseilles, which were meant to start in May, will no longer run at all in 2020 or 2021. Jet2 said it would be reducing its flying programme for 2020 and 2021, citing ""complicated"" challenges relating to the coronavirus crisis and ""changes on an almost daily basis"". ""Sadly, the overall effect of these reductions has been the need to propose a number of colleague redundancies across our business,â the airline said. The airline is proposing to cut 102 pilot jobs, the pilots' union Balpa said on Wednesday. Bournemouth beach was especially busy on Wednesday evening People in the UK are enjoying the country's warmest day of the year so far by flocking to beaches on the south coast of England. Pictures show busy beaches in Brighton and Bournemouth, where thousands of sun and sea enthusiasts are enjoying the exceptionally hot weather. Temperatures hit a high of 28C in Bournemouth - but it was hotter still in other parts of England People in England have been able to travel across the country to spend time outdoors since last month as part of a gradual easing of coronavirus restrictions. A beach in Brighton on England's south coast Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The outbreak in the Americas has not yet peaked, with an increase in cases of between 25% and 50% in the last week, the head of health emergencies for the World Health Organization (WHO), Dr Mike Ryan, has said. Dr Ryan said the virus exploited ""weak health systems"" and ""poor government"", and said that for governments to understand how to tackle the outbreak, they needed to look at the actions of countries which had succeeded in suppressing transmission. Dr Mike Ryan, the head of emergencies at the World Health Organization (WHO), has praised the UK for the way it is easing restrictions. He said there had been a ""steady, slow and step-wise exit from lockdown conditions"" in the country. Dr Ryan said the government had communicated the changes to the population at large and to the WHO â with a consistent dialogue between the four nations of the UK over regional differences. He said testing in the UK had now increased and the ""surveillance system is capable of understand where the disease is"". His comments came after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the next level of lockdown easing would take place on 4 July, when businesses such as pubs and restaurants can reopen under government guidelines. The US states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut will require visitors from Covid-19 hotspots elsewhere in the country to quarantine for 14 days, officials have said. The governors of the three north-eastern states - once coronavirus hotspots themselves - announced the joint travel advisory today. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he did not want visitors from other states bringing Covid-19 in with them, because ""we worked very hard to get the viral transmission down"". The quarantine rule will apply to visitors from states where 10% of the population is infected with Covid-19 on a seven-day rolling average, Mr Cuomo said. Nine states, including Alabama, Arkansas, Arizona, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Washington, Utah and Texas, currently meet that high infection rate threshold. The quarantine will come into effect on Thursday. With more than 31,000 deaths and 412,000 cases to date, New York was the epicentre of the pandemic at one stage, but now other southern and western states are seeing a rise in infections. This video can not be played Covid-19: A brief look back at the government briefings The daily Downing Street news conferences became a fixture of the UK's coronavirus coverage - and on previous days, we would have just finished one at about this time. But now that they havebeen scrapped, here's a look back at the last three months' briefings. Around 45,000 runners usually take part in the marathon every year Another major event has been cancelled because of the pandemic: this year's Berlin Marathon in Germany. Organisers say the event - originally scheduled to take place on 26-27 September - will not go ahead citing Covid-19 restrictions and health concerns. They say holding the marathon was not possible given the German government's social-distancing rules. And, following a review, they decided the event could not be held at a later date this year either. ""As hard as we have tried, it is currently not possible to organise the BMW Berlin-Marathon with its usual Berlin charm,"" the organisers said. ""Your health, as well as all of our health, is our first priority."" Around 45,000 runners usually take part in the marathon every year in the German capital. Earlier, we reported that this year's marathon in New York had been scrapped also because of the pandemic. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine trials in Africa: What you need to know Scientists are scrambling to develop an effective vaccine against Covid-19, with trials taking place worldwide. One of those trials is being carried out in South Africa, where a vaccine made by Oxford University is being tested. Scientists say that it is vital for Africans to take part in these trials, arguing that not doing so could jeopardise efforts to find a vaccine that works across the globe. But critics cite a history of Western exploitation of Africa and unethical drug trials in the past as a reason not to participate. Why are vaccine trials such a sensitive issue in Africa? BBC Africa's Joice Etutu explains in the video above. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was ""confident"" that an arrangement could be reached US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said he is ""confident"" the US and the EU will be able to agree arrangements for the resumption of international travel. There have been reports that the European Union could block Americans from resuming travel to EU countries because of the prevalence of coronavirus in the US. Pompeo told reporters: ""I'm confident that we'll find a set of conditions that create sufficient health and safety protection. ""We're working on finding the right way to do that, the right timing to do it, the right tactics to have in place. We certainly don't want to cause problems any place else."" We have more on the EU discussions here. Volunteers have begun being immunised with a new UK coronavirus vaccine. About 300 people will have the vaccine over the coming weeks, as part of a trial led by Prof Robin Shattock and his colleagues, at Imperial College London. Tests on animals suggest the vaccine is safe and triggers an effective immune response. Many traditional vaccines are based on a weakened or modified form of virus, but the Imperial vaccine is based on a new approach, using synthetic strands of genetic code, called RNA, which mimic the virus. There are more than 120 coronavirus vaccines in early development across the world. A further 13 are now in clinical trials: five in China, three in the United States, two in the UK, one in Australia, Germany and Russia. Vaccine teams are keen to stress that they are not in a race against each other, but against the virus. If there are to be enough doses to protect the world, several vaccine approaches will need to be successful,writes the BBC's medical correspondent Fergus Walsh. Dr Tedros said rising case numbers were a ""sober reminder"" of our responsibilities The World Health Organization (WHO) says it expects to see the number of cases of Covid-19 reach 10 million within the next week. ""More than 9.1 million cases of Covid-19 have now been reported to the WHO, and more than 470,000 deaths,"" the health body chief, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told reporters in Geneva. ""In the first month of this outbreak, less than 10,000 cases were reported. In the last month, almost four million cases have been reported. ""We expect to reach a total of 10 million cases within the next week."" He called it a ""sober reminder"" of our ""urgent responsibility to do everything we can... to suppress transmission and save lives"". The Americas have become the epicentre of the pandemic.Find out more about where cases are still rising. Vivienne NunisBusiness reporter, BBC News Louise Parkinson runs a cleaning business in Chippenham, Wiltshire Cleaners across England are facing huge financial challenges as a result of the pandemic Since the lockdown, lots of people have stopped using cleaning services. Some simply can't afford the additional cost, while others find it too much of a disruption to have people cleaning the house while they're working and educating children from home. And some clients are shielding or worried about the risk of catching Covid-19 from workers entering their properties. Where the work has continued, many businesses have been left to come up with their own safety protocols. Husband-and-wife team Liam and Louise Parkinson, who are based in Chippenham, Wiltshire, say their customer base has been reduced ""from 30 customers down to one or two"" becuase of the pandemic. Cleaning staff are permitted to work in people's homes, but industry leaders say there hasn't been clear guidance from the government advising cleaners how to keep themselves and their clients safe. ""There's nothing that we can adhere to, we've just got to decide for ourselves what's appropriate,"" says Stephen Munton, director of the trade body the Domestic Cleaning Alliance. ""It's a huge worry."" Read more. West Bengal was going to ease its lockdown on 30 June The Indian state of West Bengal has extended its lockdown until 31 July to stem the spread of Covid-19 after a spike in infections nationwide. The lockdown in the eastern state was supposed to expire on 30 June. But as new infections continue to rise across the country, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, said it was necessary to keep restrictions in place to ""help the entire nation"". Schools, colleges and universities would remain shut as part of the continued curbs, but some relaxations would go ahead, the minister said. India's infections jumped by almost 16,000 to more than 456,000 on Wednesday, the highest daily rise in the country. The death toll stands at more than 14,000. There have been 14,728 confirmed cases and 580 deaths in West Bengal.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The German Bundesliga returned in May - without fans in stadiums The return
of live events has been brought forward more than the Scottish government originally
planned for, Scotland's national clinical director confirms. It was not
thought these would be able to return until phase four but Proj Jason Leitch suggests sports events could begin behind closed down at the
beginning of August. The list of
indicative dates published today says it is unlikely this would happen before
23 July. Mr Leitch
says it is difficult give precise timescales at this stage  â but he would hope small crowds would be able to attend large venues in 2-3
monthsâ time. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Scotland's education secretary, John Swinney, has been accused of treating staff safety ""as an after thought"" and not engaging with trades unions as he plans an August return to school. Helen Meldrum, from the GMB, which represents cleaning, janitorial and catering staff, tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""We need more investment, more staff, PPE that's fit for purpose and sadly, as it stands at the moment, this is a Scottish government that is making the same mistakes as it made with social care."" She says a survey of staff last month found they were ""absolutely terrified about taking the virus into school and passing it to vulnerable children as well as taking it home"". ""The strategy so far for the educational recovery has been a compete shambles,"" she adds. ""There are just no safe plans or working practices in place yet and the prospect of 100% pupils back sounds even more unsafe for our members."" A Scottish government statement said that staff safety is paramount as it plans for the next academic year. Pubs are exploring apps that will let customers order drinks, and keep a record of their visit. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland One hotelier has had 220 bookings in four hours since opening the phone lines for business after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gave a provisional date for reopening. Stuart McPhee, of the Siberia Bar & Hotel in Aberdeen, tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""It is an Ikea moment. It is the next big thing that is opening up for people's lives. The struggle will be beyond that once the novelty dies off. ""I feel clear about the indicative dates and realise
they are not concrete, but it allows us to create some certainty for our
customers and ourselves."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland How do you
keep your business going when your key market is large events? Lynsey
Maxwell is the director of a catering company which normally serves parties.
But in the last few weeks the business has turned to delivering grazing boxes
for families to enjoy. âIt became
really popular. People send it as gifts, people order it for themselves. Itâs
great, itâs been very busy,â she tells Drivetime. What about
theatre? Actress Sarah Galbraith says her show Girls Night Oot has just
relaunched as Girls Night In â a ticketed Zoom event. âIt allows us
to bring our show to the masses without being in the theatre,â she explains. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Blair Drummond Safari Park, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary, is reopening Nearly 70% of Scotland's visitor attractions do not plan to take up the option of reopening on 15 July despite being given a provisional green light to do so by the Scottish government - and 15% have no plans to reopen by September. The figures have been revealed by Scottish Visitors Attractions chief executive Gordon Morrison, who tells BBC Radio Scotland that indoor sites, like museums and country houses, are the more reticent. ""There is a real concern about cost versus return when it comes to reopening,"" he says. The additional costs in adapting facilities to 2m social distancing, fears for the safety of older volunteers and a lack of international visitors were all factors among the 200 attractions that responded to a survey. ""The majority of outdoor sites, where you can experience grounds, gardens, zoos, wildlife parks, they are all raring to go,"" Mr Morrison adds. ""I would encourage people to visit these when they open because it is the only way they will be able to keep the doors open."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Many children's playgrounds have not been inspected during lockdown despite the Scottish government announcing that they can be reopened from Monday, an industry expert warns. Register of Playground Inspectors International board member Jon Dalton was asked on BBC Radio Scotland whether the facilities will be ready in time. ""It depends on what the playground owners have been doing in the meantime - some have just left them dormant, they have stopped inspecting,"" says. ""But playgrounds should be inspected on a regular basis. ""With playgrounds not being used, people have just not been inspecting them in our experience. ""Access will have been restricted in some way, so if the playground is open then it should be okay, but what we're saying as an organisation is that someone responsible for that playground gets in and checks it before they open it."" Hairdressing businesses in Scotland will be able to open next month - but it is unlikely to be business as usual. Norma Chesne from Uddingston in Lanarkshire, who has been cutting hair for over 30 years, has built a ""home studio salon"" in her garden which she says incorporates all the social distancing measures needed. Her protective equipment will include mask and visor, and she will see one client at a time. But, whatever the limitations, Norma can hardly wait to get started. ""I'm delighted,"" she said. ""I feel for my clients. ""They're all desperate to have their hair done. It's the feel-good factor. Plus I thoroughly enjoy doing it.""  Prof Pennington said the decision to reduce the distance is a political one The decision over the two-metre social distancing rule in Scotland is one of ""personality and politics"", a scientist has claimed. Prof Hugh Pennington said the decision to reduce the distance is a political one, given how new Covid-19 is and the fact advice being given to both administrations will be ""largely the same"". Writing in the Scottish Daily Mail,external, Prof Pennington said should there be a localised outbreak - in a place such as a bar - when the rule is relaxed then it could simply be shut down and the rest of the population will not be impacted. The first minister has said she has asked her scientific advisers to look into reducing the amount of social distancing in certain measures, with a report expected by 2 July. Prof Pennington said there is ""every reason"" Scotland should also reduce the social distancing rule. He wrote: ""But in my view there is absolutely no need for (Nicola Sturgeon's) caution. ""There is no reason we should not be following England and reducing the social distancing limit to one metre and every reason we should be in order to get the economy and education system going again. ""If we do see a localised outbreak of Covid, for example if there is an outbreak linked to a particularly busy pub, we can step in and close it down again. ""The whole country does not need to go back into lockdown."" He added: ""What we are seeing now is not about the science, it's about the personality and the politics."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Restrictions on travel for leisure and recreation will be relaxed on 3 July Scotlandâs
national clinical director urges people to continue following lockdown rules
for the next few weeks â or they will put easing at risk. The Scottish government has set out the dates when it plans torelax more of the lockdown restrictions. Prof Jason
Leitch admits healthcare professionals and advisors like him are ânervousâ about
the relaxation of rules, but following guidelines for now mean the public will
be reward in the future. The easing
of lockdown is being introduce gradually because a the potential for the need
to reverse it, he explains. If the rules are followed, it is less likely there
will be a second spike at a big scale requiring that backwards move, he adds. Local outbreaks requiring a local response are more likely â

Pointing to the fact that pubs and restaurants have been given a date, she asks: ""Is it because they contribute more to the economy and now it is all about wealth instead of health? ""If it is, it is a very sad day. If they can show me the science, I will hold up my hands and admit I was wrong, but I have not seen it."" Ms Elliot's partner owns a gym and adds: ""I have been in the fitness industry for along time and in my time the cleanliness of a gym is absolutely paramount. To suggest they are not clean enough, I can't understand it. ""People can turn up at a gym and leave wearing their gym kit, there is no reason they can't get showered at home and no suggestion the virus can be transmitted through sweat, for example."" Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch is on Drivetime shortly Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch will be interviewed shortly on Drivetime with John Beattie. The Scottish government has set out the dates when it plans torelax more of the lockdown restrictions.

leaders are calling for an urgent review to determine whether the UK is
properlyprepared for the
""real risk"" of a second wave of coronavirus. Professor
Jackie Taylor is one of the signatories of the letter as president of the Royal
College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. She tells
Drivetime it is important to review what has gone well and what hasnât so there
are better outcomes if a second wave occurs. It is very difficult to quantify what a second wave may look like, she explains, but she suggests it is likely there will be local outbreaks. These can be managed in a different way from full lockdown so long as management practices are in place, Prof Taylor adds. She says we will be living with the virus until a vaccine is rolled out â and until then we must ensure health and social care services work together and have the resources they require. Prof Taylor also insists on the importance of looking to lower the risk for vulnerable groups in particular, like those in the BME community, older people or the homeless. Allow Twitter content?

""The strategy so far for the educational recovery has been a compete shambles,"" she adds. ""There are just no safe plans or working practices in place yet and the prospect of 100% pupils back sounds even more unsafe for our members."" A Scottish government statement said that staff safety is paramount as it plans for the next academic year. Pubs are exploring apps that will let customers order drinks, and keep a record of their visit. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland One hotelier has had 220 bookings in four hours since opening the phone lines for business after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon gave a provisional date for reopening. Stuart McPhee, of the Siberia Bar & Hotel in Aberdeen, tells BBC Radio Scotland: ""It is an Ikea moment. It is the next big thing that is opening up for people's lives. The struggle will be beyond that once the novelty dies off. ""I feel clear about the indicative dates and realise
they are not concrete, but it allows us to create some certainty for our
customers and ourselves."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland How do you
keep your business going when your key market is large events? Lynsey
Maxwell is the director of a catering company which normally serves parties.
But in the last few weeks the business has turned to delivering grazing boxes
for families to enjoy. âIt became
really popular. People send it as gifts, people order it for themselves. Itâs
great, itâs been very busy,â she tells Drivetime. What about
theatre? Actress Sarah Galbraith says her show Girls Night Oot has just
relaunched as Girls Night In â a ticketed Zoom event. âIt allows us
to bring our show to the masses without being in the theatre,â she explains. Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Blair Drummond Safari Park, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary, is reopening Nearly 70% of Scotland's visitor attractions do not plan to take up the option of reopening on 15 July despite being given a provisional green light to do so by the Scottish government - and 15% have no plans to reopen by September. The figures have been revealed by Scottish Visitors Attractions chief executive Gordon Morrison, who tells BBC Radio Scotland that indoor sites, like museums and country houses, are the more reticent. ""There is a real concern about cost versus return when it comes to reopening,"" he says. The additional costs in adapting facilities to 2m social distancing, fears for the safety of older volunteers and a lack of international visitors were all factors among the 200 attractions that responded to a survey. ""The majority of outdoor sites, where you can experience grounds, gardens, zoos, wildlife parks, they are all raring to go,"" Mr Morrison adds. ""I would encourage people to visit these when they open because it is the only way they will be able to keep the doors open."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Many children's playgrounds have not been inspected during lockdown despite the Scottish government announcing that they can be reopened from Monday, an industry expert warns. Register of Playground Inspectors International board member Jon Dalton was asked on BBC Radio Scotland whether the facilities will be ready in time. ""It depends on what the playground owners have been doing in the meantime - some have just left them dormant, they have stopped inspecting,"" says. ""But playgrounds should be inspected on a regular basis. ""With playgrounds not being used, people have just not been inspecting them in our experience. ""Access will have been restricted in some way, so if the playground is open then it should be okay, but what we're saying as an organisation is that someone responsible for that playground gets in and checks it before they open it."" Hairdressing businesses in Scotland will be able to open next month - but it is unlikely to be business as usual. Norma Chesne from Uddingston in Lanarkshire, who has been cutting hair for over 30 years, has built a ""home studio salon"" in her garden which she says incorporates all the social distancing measures needed. Her protective equipment will include mask and visor, and she will see one client at a time. But, whatever the limitations, Norma can hardly wait to get started. ""I'm delighted,"" she said. ""I feel for my clients. ""They're all desperate to have their hair done. It's the feel-good factor. Plus I thoroughly enjoy doing it.""  Prof Pennington said the decision to reduce the distance is a political one The decision over the two-metre social distancing rule in Scotland is one of ""personality and politics"", a scientist has claimed. Prof Hugh Pennington said the decision to reduce the distance is a political one, given how new Covid-19 is and the fact advice being given to both administrations will be ""largely the same"". Writing in the Scottish Daily Mail,external, Prof Pennington said should there be a localised outbreak - in a place such as a bar - when the rule is relaxed then it could simply be shut down and the rest of the population will not be impacted. The first minister has said she has asked her scientific advisers to look into reducing the amount of social distancing in certain measures, with a report expected by 2 July. Prof Pennington said there is ""every reason"" Scotland should also reduce the social distancing rule. He wrote: ""But in my view there is absolutely no need for (Nicola Sturgeon's) caution. ""There is no reason we should not be following England and reducing the social distancing limit to one metre and every reason we should be in order to get the economy and education system going again. ""If we do see a localised outbreak of Covid, for example if there is an outbreak linked to a particularly busy pub, we can step in and close it down again. ""The whole country does not need to go back into lockdown."" He added: ""What we are seeing now is not about the science, it's about the personality and the politics."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Restrictions on travel for leisure and recreation will be relaxed on 3 July Scotlandâs
national clinical director urges people to continue following lockdown rules
for the next few weeks â or they will put easing at risk. The Scottish government has set out the dates when it plans torelax more of the lockdown restrictions. Prof Jason
Leitch admits healthcare professionals and advisors like him are ânervousâ about
the relaxation of rules, but following guidelines for now mean the public will
be reward in the future. The easing
of lockdown is being introduce gradually because a the potential for the need

will be a second spike at a big scale requiring that backwards move, he adds. Local outbreaks requiring a local response are more likely â

tells Drivetime he is hopeful people will respect the rules and communities
when they arrive. Weâve seen what happens when this virus gets into a small community. Itâs not something the communities are taking lightly.

Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland This Moscow gym is regularly cleaned with PPE The health and fitness industry has been ""completely overlooked"" by the Scottish government, personal trainer Elaine Elliot claims after being disappointed to hear they have not been given a date for re-opening. Pointing to the fact that pubs and restaurants have been given a date, she asks: ""Is it because they contribute more to the economy and now it is all about wealth instead of health? ""If it is, it is a very sad day. If they can show me the science, I will hold up my hands and admit I was wrong, but I have not seen it."" Ms Elliot's partner owns a gym and adds: ""I have been in the fitness industry for along time and in my time the cleanliness of a gym is absolutely paramount. To suggest they are not clean enough, I can't understand it. ""People can turn up at a gym and leave wearing their gym kit, there is no reason they can't get showered at home and no suggestion the virus can be transmitted through sweat, for example.""

leaders are calling for an urgent review to determine whether the UK is
properlyprepared for the
""real risk"" of a second wave of coronavirus. Professor
Jackie Taylor is one of the signatories of the letter as president of the Royal
College of Physicians and Surgeons of Glasgow. She tells
Drivetime it is important to review what has gone well and what hasnât so there
are better outcomes if a second wave occurs. It is very difficult to quantify what a second wave may look like, she explains, but she suggests it is likely there will be local outbreaks. These can be managed in a different way from full lockdown so long as management practices are in place, Prof Taylor adds. She says we will be living with the virus until a vaccine is rolled out â and until then we must ensure health and social care services work together and have the resources they require. Prof Taylor also insists on the importance of looking to lower the risk for vulnerable groups in particular, like those in the BME community, older people or the homeless. Allow Twitter content?
