Fast fashion 'still has serious plastic problem',"The report said 60% of Boohoo's women's clothing were made solely from new plastics Nearly half of of women's clothes for sale on some of the leading online websites are made entirely from new plastics, according to a study. The research by the charity the Royal Society for the Arts (RSA) looked at 10,000 items being sold by  Boohoo, Prettylittlething, Missguided and Asos. It found on average 49% were made of polyester, acrylic, nylon and elastane. The RSA said the numbers varied by outlet with Asos using comparatively less new plastic than the others. The study found that 60% of Boohoo's women's clothing and 57% of Boohoo-owned Prettylittlething's were made entirely from new plastics. Missguided had 42% of its items made entirely from new plastics and Asos 36%. âGoing outâ gear out and athleisure in for Boohoo Asos 'rips up the playbook' for pandemic boost The RSA also said that the study found that on average, just 3% of clothes which contained any plastics used recycled plastics - ""although this rises to 6% among items from Asos"". Missguided's head of sourcing and product technology Paul Smith said the company was ""proud of the progress it had made"" and that all its own brand products were packaged and despatched in 100% recycled plastic. However, it added: ""We agree there's more to do."" The company said it had ""committed to making sure 10% of our products will use recycled fibres by the end of 2021 and 25% by the end of 2022"". Asos said the figures reflected positively on it, but like the rest of the industry it recognised more needed to be done. The study for the report Fast Fashion's Plastic Problem, was carried out between 11 and 29 May. The researchers looked at more than 2,500 recently added items from each website, spread across different product categories. The RSA said the plastic used large amounts of energy and created environmental damage in their production and could take thousands of years to break down. It added that a ""throwaway culture"", meant that ""the bulk of these garments are ending up in landfill"". ""The sheer volume of clothing produced by these websites is shocking - we should see many of these items, which go for rock-bottom prices, as akin to other short-lived plastics. The nature of fast fashion trends means they are not designed to have long lives in our wardrobes,"" said the report's co-author Josie Warden. The RSA is calling for action to cut down on the use of plastic in fashion items. It wants to government to look at introducing a plastics tax on clothes imported into or produced in the UK. It says websites should come  up with ways of promoting second-hand clothing, ""along the lines of Depop and Asos' marketplace"" and to publish figures on how much plastic they use. And it is encouraging consumers to buy less and keep clothes for longer, rather than only wearing garments a ""handful of times"". Asos, said its prices were not at ""throwaway"" levels and disputed the report's description of it as a fast-fashion retailer. It pointed out it does publish information about fabrics and their care, including on a new page on its website about how to care for clothes in a more environmentally-friendly way. It said it is encouraging that the RSA figures reflected positively on it because shifting to more sustainable materials was a key element of its Fashion With Integrity programme. However, it said like the rest of the industry it recognised there was much more work to do and that it was continually reviewing and developing programmes to minimise its impact on people and the planet. Boohoo has published itsUp Front strategy,externalwhich sets an ""ambitious"" goal of all polyester and cotton being recycled or more sustainable for 2025. However, the RSA report said the company had a ""mountain to climb"" to meet this target. Boohoo said: ""Solutions to these complex challenges require collaboration which is why we are delighted with the response from our existing and new suppliers to help us identify innovative solutions to achieve this target,"" a spokesperson said. Boohoo is a member of the Sustainable Apparel Coalition and a signatory of Textiles 2030. ""We've engaged with our customers extensively through focus groups and a recent survey, that received over 14,500 responses, to understand their attitudes to textile waste,"" the spokesperson added. ""What they tell us is that the price they pay does not determine how long they keep an item of clothing and 88% said that they use either charity shops or resale sites as a responsible form of disposal, throwing an item away is an absolute last resort for them.""

Sir Elton John fears musicians face 'catastrophe',"Sir Elton John set up a charity to help people with HIV Sir Elton John has warned MPs that the UK music industry could lose ""a generation of talent"" because of post-Brexit restrictions on touring the EU. The musician accused ministers of being unwilling to fix a ""gaping hole"" in the current Brexit deal which means artists need costly visas to play in the bloc. The government says the EU rejected its attempts to negotiate visa-free travel, while the EU claims the opposite. Sir Elton called the situation a ""looming catastrophe"" for the UK. ""I want to be clear that the issues of visa-free and permit-free touring aren't about the impact on me, and artists who tour arenas and stadiums,"" he said. ""This gravest of situations is about the damage to the next generation of musicians and emerging artists, whose careers will stall before they've even started due to this infuriating blame game. ""If I had faced the financial and logistical obstacles facing young musicians now when I started out, I'd never have had the opportunity to build the foundations of my career and I very much doubt I would be where I am today."" The star's statement was read to MPs during a hearing by the Digital, Culture, Media (DCMS) and Sport Committee on EU visa arrangements for those in the creative industries. Sir Elton later posted the letter in full on Instagram. The DCMS committee was also due to hear from Brexit Minister Lord Frost - but he pulled out unexpectedly, drawing fierce criticism from committee chairman Julian Knight. ""Parliamentary scrutiny in front of select committees is of crucial importance in our democratic system and is particularly important when we have a government with a majority of over 80,"" he said in a statement, calling Lord Frost's failure to attend the hearing unacceptable. ""I, and this committee, look forward to Lord Frost joining us at the rearranged date and we will not truck any further cancellation."" However, the committee did hear from live music agent and promoter Craig Stanley, who warned that the UK's live music industry ""is facing annihilation"". He noted that the majority of European tours by pop and rock bands originate in the UK - meaning they employ stage crew, drivers, caterers, sound engineers, lighting technicians and backing musicians to work across the 27 EU member states. ""American acts when they come over, the vast majority of the time, take on British staff and use British equipment 85 to 90% of the time,"" he told MPs. ""They will start to move to Schiphol, to Frankfurt, to warehouses in the middle of Germany, and take on the gear there, and all of that will be lost."" He added that there was a ""real danger"" British orchestras may have to stop touring internationally. They not only face visa requirements, but new limits on road haulage - which mean trucks transporting instruments from the UK must return home after visiting two EU member states. ""They can't just put their very, very expensive and delicate instruments into any truck,"" Stanley explained. ""If they can't drive it [themselves], they can't tour. So you're going to stop the Royal Philharmonic from touring. It's as bold as that."" Will UK bands start touring in Liechtenstein? Musicians 'failed by government', stars say National Theatre shelves Europe tours after Brexit The government was previously accusedof treating live music as ""an afterthought"" in Brexit negotiations,externalcompared with the much smaller Â£1.2bn fishing industry. Culture Minister Caroline Dinenage rejected that characterisation, saying: ""No, I wouldn't accept that. This is something that's huge for our economy. It's an international calling card for us."" A UK government spokesperson told the BBC on Tuesday: ""We want musicians and others to be able to tour easily both inside and outside the EU. ""Short-term, temporary visits for paid performances by UK musicians are possible in at least 17 EU countries, including France, Germany and the Netherlands, without needing visas or work permits."" However, Noel McClean, leader of the entertainment union Bectu, told the DCMS committee there are still ""varying degrees of bureaucracy still associated with those 17 member states"". The government's statement does not ""quite match up to the expectation that you can do what you could before"", he added. Another rock star, Noel Gallagher, echoed those sentiments whentalking to BBC Radio 4's Front Rowon Thursday, saying his European touring plans will now have to be scaled down. ""You can't just get on a train and go to Paris and do a gig [anymore],"" the former Oasis singer-songwriter said. ""You've got to apply to do a gig and you've got to declare what equipment you're bringing. Noel Gallagher says touring Europe with his band, the High Flying Birds, will have to be scaled down due to Brexit ""And that's things that never cost us any money two or three years ago, which is going to cost a fortune."" He continued: ""So I just think, ultimately, like most things, the fans are going to lose out because instead of bands going to Europe for four weeks now and doing three gigs in Germany, there'll be one. And there will be one in France, and one in Spain, and one in Belgium, and then it'll be a whistlestop, scaled-down show."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Brewdog boss vows to learn from savage criticism,"This video can not be played James Watt said he would reflect on how to become a better leader A co-founder of Brewdog has promised to listen and learn from savage criticism of the beer company by 60 ex-staff. James Watt told the BBC claims of a ""culture of fear"" and ""toxic attitude"" were tough to hear, but said they would help make him a better chief executive. In an open letter,external, signatories said a ""significant number"" of former staff had ""suffered mental illness as a result of working at Brewdog"". And they aren't happy with the apology, saying: ""We aren't going away"". Mr Watt said it was clear some things had gone wrong at the company. ""We genuinely apologise,"" he said. But the signatories have focused on a separate comment appearing to come from Mr Watt on Thursday, which they say illustrates his ""true disregard"" for his staff. In the first letter, the ex-staff claimed that the firm was built around a ""cult of personality"" of founders Mr Watt and Martin Dickie. The fast-growing Scottish brewer and pub chain has enjoyed rapid success and now employs 2,000 staff. But it has also courted controversy with its marketing and commercial decisions. The letter, posted on Twitter, made a number of allegations, including that Brewdog fostered a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns. It said Mr Watt and Mr Dickie had exploited publicity, ""both good and bad"", to further their own business goals and chased ""growth, at all costs"". Allow Twitter content?

It added: ""You spent years claiming you wanted to be the best employer in the world, presumably to help you to recruit top talent, but ask former staff what they think of those claims, and you'll most likely be laughed at. ""Being treated like a human being was sadly not always a given for those working at Brewdog."" In his BBC interview, Mr Watt said: ""It's very clear, looking at the feedback, we haven't always got things right here. ""We have to see this feedback as an opportunity to get better. We have to learn, we have to act. We have to take it on the chin."" Brewdog reveals plans for 'beer hotel' in Edinburgh Beer firm BrewDog toasts US investment Mr Watt would not confirm if the allegations were true, but said: ""For me, it's not about disputing individual claims. But 60 people were unhappy and we have to get better. That's the only way we can get something good out of this situation."" One of the many criticisms was that Brewdog management operated a culture of fear, with staff afraid to speak out - even after they had left. That culture has not prevented dozens more former Brewdog staff speaking up in response to the publicity around the letter. The letter now has more than 250 signatories, its unnamed authors said. They have issued a follow-up letter, addressed to Mr Watt, in which they thank him for his apology but say that they have gathered many further examples of bad practice at the company. They also voiced strong objections to an earlier message that was circulated to current Brewdog staff as an immediate reaction to their first letter of complaint. That note, from James Watt, said: ""It is fair to say that this type of fast-paced and intense environment is definitely not for everyone, but many of our fantastic long-term team members have thrived in our culture. Our culture is built on rewarding and developing great people and focussing on growing our business."" The group of ex-staff said: ""We want you to know that we categorically refute everything suggested in this statement. ""Many of our signatories worked for Brewdog for years, and were extremely high-performing. To suggest that those who apparently couldn't hack it are somehow less worthy in your eyes is grotesque; we believe this shows your true feelings of disregard for your staff, both former and current."" The group said it would continue to monitor what action was taken to address these issues. In his BBC interview Mr Watt admitted that the company's rapid growth had been a steep learning curve. ""But the buck stops with me. I will use [the criticism] to be a better chief executive and leader."" He said the company will embark on a series of anonymous surveys of current staff ""and do some listening groups"". However, Brewdog's rapid expansion - the source of much of the problems, ex-staff claim - would continue, he said: ""It's not about slowing the growth, because that's in our DNA."" The challenge now would be how Brewdog can maintain the intensity of its expansion, ""yet be a better employer,"" he said. Brewdog started out in 2007, being passionate about craft beer and contemptuous of rival big brewers. It's become at least as passionate about growth, by unconventional ""punk"" means. So far, there is a big brewery in Aberdeenshire, plus others in Berlin, Brisbane and Columbus, Ohio. There are more than 100 Brewdog bars dotted across the world map. And a new project is beer-themed hotels, in Ohio, Manchester and Edinburgh. This has been funded through the sale of a big chunk of the business to private equity and several rounds of crowdfunding. The AGM in Aberdeen has become something of a party. But it seems the combined publicity-thirsty passion for beer and growth has been bruising. Every employer has disgruntled ex-employees. Usually, once dispersed, they moan into their beer. But in this case, these ex-staff signatories have taken their passion for beer and applied it to improving working conditions in their industry. Co-founder James Watt concedes he didn't always ""get things right"". He dispensed with the usual combative defiance. His response is chastened, recognising that the accusations could be damaging to the brand and to recruitment. He has become very successful by inviting drinkers to buy into products infused with the passion of beer people. So this runs counter to the values of clubby comradeship. Repairing the damage will take more nuance than Brewdog usually deploys.

Ex-Brewdog staff allege culture of fear at brewer,"Brewdog founder James Watt (right) said the brewery was 'sorry' Former staff at Brewdog have alleged a ""culture of fear"" at the beer firm with a ""toxic attitude"" to junior employees.

""Being treated like a human being was sadly not always a given for those working at Brewdog."" According to the letter, toxic attitudes towards junior staff had ""trickled down"" throughout the business ""until they were simply an intrinsic part of the company"". ""Put bluntly, the single biggest shared experience of former staff is a residual feeling of fear. Fear to speak out about the atmosphere we were immersed in, and fear of repercussions even after we have left,"" it added. One of the ex-staff members who signed the letter, Christopher Baria-Lewis, told the BBC he ""felt it was important, with former colleagues, to get a message out there"". ""Their [Brewdog's] external persona doesn't align with how they operate,"" he said, adding that the letter had been organised collectively. The letter also questioned Brewdog's commitment to sustainability after ""years of vanity projects"" and use of a private jet. Along with many breweries, pubs, and other parts of the hospitality industry, Brewdog has been hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Watt said: ""At Brewdog, we are focused on building the best business we can, which is why the open letter we saw on Twitter was so upsetting, but so important. ""Our focus now is not on contradicting or contesting the details of that letter, but to listen, learn and act. ""As a fast-growing business, we have always tried to do the best by our team - we do have thousands of employees with positive stories to tell as a result."" But he said the tweet by former staff proved that ""on many occasions we haven't got it right"". ""We are committed to doing better, not just as a reaction to this, but always; and we are going to reach out to our entire team past and present to learn more. ""But most of all, right now, we are sorry."" He said it had been ""hard to hear"" the comments, but added: ""It must have been harder to say them. ""We appreciate that and we will endeavour to honour that effort and courage with the real change it deserves. We aren't going to make excuses, we're going to take action.""

"Normality a long way off, says health minister","The document says NI is ""not yet at a point where we can set a date for an end to social distancing"" ""Normality, as we knew it in 2019, is still some way off,"" the health minister has said. The remarks by Robin Swann were in a briefing document from the Department of Health to the NI Executive. Mr Swann said Northern Ireland is ""not yet at a point where we can set a date for an end to social distancing"". The health paper also said testing for coronavirus over the past few days has indicated that up to 25% of new cases here may be the Delta variant. The document warns of another possible ""significant fresh surge"" of positive cases and hospitalisations by late summer or early autumn. It says the Delta variant, which originated in India, is more transmissible, and is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission. Vaccination is working, it states, and ""the more people we can get fully vaccinated the stronger our protection will be"". The Public Health Agency has said 111 probable and confirmed cases of the Delta variant have been detected throughout all 11 local council areas in Northern Ireland, 28 of them are in Kilkeel. Cases of the variantwere first confirmed in Northern Ireland in early May. The NI Executive met on Thursday to discuss further relaxations of Covid restrictions. Mr Swann said while the number of Delta cases remained small, there were ""grounds for concern"", and evidence from Great Britain showed its potential to spread quickly. The use of face coverings was also expected to continue, he said. Ministers have agreed live music can resume on 21 June subject to the decision being rubber-stamped Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there was cause for ""worry"". ""We're naturally worried whenever we look at predictions and modelling for what could potentially happen,"" she said. ""Some of the modelling suggests we will have a significant rise in positive cases."" Ms O'Neill said Chief Medical officer Dr Michael McBride said there should be clearer picture by mid July. First Minister Arlene Foster said the Delta variant is more transmissible and ""we need to make sure we continue to protect our citizens"". Stormont ministers have agreed an indicative date of 21 June for live music to resume across venues in NI. However, it will need to be rubber-stamped by the executive next week, in line with health advice. No live music is permitted in pubs, hotels and clubs under current Covid-19 regulations, with many venues closedto audiences since March 2020. It is understood the Executive also agreed proposals to raise limits on social contact at home from 21 June. This would allow 10 people from two households to meet indoors from that date. Currently only six people from two households can meet inside a home. The number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a private garden could rise to 15 from any number of households on that date. 21 June has also been agreed as an indicative date for lifting the cap of 500 people at outdoor gatherings, instead replacing it with numbers by risk assessment. Along with the other proposals on rules regarding live music in licensed and unlicensed venues, the changes could mean the return of some larger concerts, sporting events and festivals this summer. Arlene Foster says the Delta variant is more transmissible and ""we need to make sure we continue to protect our citizens"" Theatres may also be set to reopen on 21 June, if the executive gives the green light next week. Queen's University Belfast virologist Dr Connor Bamford has said delaying the easing of restrictions may ""put us in better stead going into the coming months"". He said some modelling ofthe new Delta variantsuggested its spread could result in a significant rise in hospital admissions and deaths, despite a large portion of the adult population being vaccinated. ""There are still a lot of people at risk, without vaccines, with one dose of vaccine, and this is, of course, more transmissible,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""I think that possibly delaying the relief of these restrictions might be the best thing to do in the next couple of weeks, until we have more information and more time for that public health acting to act and also to get more people with two-dose vaccinations."" Time between NI Covid vaccines to be shortened Singer Liam McFeely says the past year has been ""absolutely brutal"" for musicians and bands. Liam McFeely, singer with The Goodfellas, one of the north west's best-known wedding bands, said it was vital the return of live music got the go-ahead. ""People are on aeroplanes, they are in cinemas tonight, which is fantastic, but still no dancing, no signing, no music,"" he toldBBC Radio Foyle. ""For some reason, for music and entertainment there was no happy medium, it was just stop, no dancing,"" he said. Musicians, he added, have endured an ""absolutely brutal, horrendous"" time since March 2020. He estimated lockdown cost him ""thousands of pounds"" in lost earnings. ""We lost 60 weddings in three weeks, that's my livelihood, that was the beginning,"" he said. ""You keep things for a rainy day but when you have three kids at uni, the rainy days are every day"". Thursday's executive meeting was also Arlene Foster's last as Northern Ireland's first minister, as she prepares to step down. Education Minister Peter Weir, Economy Minister Diane Dodds and Junior Minister Gordon Lyons are also due to leave their posts, as DUP leader Edwin Poots prepares to move his new team into office. On Wednesday, the incoming Economy Minister Paul Frew said he wanted to see a ""stocktake"" of the coronavirus restrictions. He said: ""There are some restrictions that are still in place and have been in place over the past month that are not logical.""

The Biden-Johnson relationship,"The Cornwall beachfront resort where world leaders will gather Boris Johnson and Joe Biden will meet near the cliff tops overlooking the magnificent Carbis Bay in Cornwall, the waves from the Atlantic crashing below. It won't have the bodice-ripping tension and tempestuousness of an encounter between Ross Poldark and Demelza - until now the most famous pairing from these parts thanks to the BBC hit drama - but this is an important relationship to watch as it develops. The reasons why it might get off to a horrible start are all too easy to enumerate. Biden firmly supported Britain remaining in the EU; Johnson was the leading architect of Brexit. Biden is perhaps the most ""Irish"" (I put it in inverted commas because a lot of Americans in public life like to play up their Irish roots - though Biden's are very clear) of recent US presidents, and the Good Friday Agreement is sacrosanct for him - and so he will make clear to his British host there can be no tinkering with the Northern Ireland protocol if it puts that long-fought-over agreement in jeopardy. Boris Johnson clearly wants to get out of the binding agreement - freely signed by the British to get Brexit done - that in effect puts a trade barrier down the Irish Sea between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland. In a pre-visit interview, Joe Biden's national security adviser told me that Britain should not underestimate the strength of Biden's feelings on this subject. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Don't imperil NI peace, Biden to warn UK and EU And then there is the back story of the two men - Boris Johnson was seen by many in the US as Britain's Donald Trump (certainly by Donald Trump himself) - a bit chaotic, populist, unpredictable, a rabble rouser. And in return Boris Johnson was lavish in his praise of the former business tycoon occupying the White House - he was Making America Great Again said the British PM; he was worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in North Korea. A statue of Johnson, Biden and other world leaders has been erected on the iconic cliffs And no-one would say that Joe Biden is cut from the same privileged cloth as Boris Johnson. Somehow I can't quite imagine the young working class Joe from Scranton, Pennsylvania, in Bullingdon Club white tie. Indeed Biden went as far as describing Johnson as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Donald Trump. But equally, if you delve back into the manila folder of yellowing newspaper cuttings - or just used your search engine - you will find plenty of disobliging comments from BoJo from when he was mayor of London, talking about Trump's ""stupefying ignorance"". All of which leads to an obvious point. That was then. Now is now. Trump and Johnson share laughs at the 2019 summit in France If we're talking of presidents and PMs not being cut from the same cloth, you would have to say that David Cameron and Barack Obama were hardly obvious soulmates, yet they forged a close working relationship. To Cameron's credit - he didn't obsess and fret about the special relationship in the way that some others have done. Remember Gordon Brown chasing Barack Obama through a kitchen at the UN so desperate was he to have a face to face with the American president? If you're the British prime minister you make it your business to get on with whoever the elected US president of the day is. In the days after the 2020 presidential election when Donald Trump was insisting it was all a fraud and he would overturn the result (actually, come to think of it, seven months on he is still saying the same thing), the Johnson government was very speedy to note that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor and was duly congratulated by the British. Some countries havered on doing the same, fearful of incurring the wrath of Donald Trump. On some of the biggest ticket items facing the world, Biden and Johnson are completely aligned. Perhaps most notably, on climate change and the upcoming COP26 UN climate change conference being hosted in Glasgow in November - but also on national security issues, defence co-operation and intelligence sharing, Britain and the US are very closely aligned. Go back in history, and few would have imagined that after the apparent bromance between Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, with all their windy rhetoric about The Third Way (I really can't decide whether the idea deserves capital letters or not - I'll leave them there for now), that the British PM would have transitioned so effortlessly into forging such a close relationship with George W Bush - of course many then criticised Blair for becoming too close to Bill Clinton's successor. I think the only relationship where there was lasting damage came when Bill Clinton was elected president and John Major was prime minister.Major's efforts to help George HW Bush win re-electionby allowing the Home Office to look into whether there was any ""dirt"" on Bill Clinton from when he was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford was a big mistake, and probably had a lasting impact. It's hard to believe that Biden and Johnson will be a recreation of the Thatcher and Reagan relationship - or going back further, Churchill and FDR - Churchill during the terrifying blitz in 1940 would talk about courting and cultivating the US leader, endlessly finding ways to capture his attention - and critically support - to bring the US into the Second World War. FDR and Churchill meet in Washington The other week on our podcast Americast, I spoke to Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama's former deputy national security adviser, and joked about the special relationship. Remember this is something that the British political class talk much more about than the Americans. But Rhodes made the point that there is such a commonality of interest, so many shared values, that when you sit down with the British to discuss major issues, you invariably find yourself starting from the same point. How you get to the end point might differ, but being of like mind is a good start for the relationship between Joe Biden and Boris Johnson. On most things they are. St Ives, near to where the officials will meet And with Britain forging a post-Brexit future that is critically important. One thing the two men do have in common is that both men are Roman Catholics - though as one wag noted drily - one is a practising Roman Catholic; the other is in need of a lot more practice. Republicans defend - and some attack - Trump. Video, 00:02:34Republicans defend - and some attack - Trump Don't imperil NI peace, Biden to warn UK and EU What next for Trump - and Trumpism?

Ninety schools in Wales named on harassment site,"Ofsted was told pupils were put under pressure to share sexual images of themselves More than 90 schools in Wales have been named on a website where girls have shared allegations of sexual harassment or abuse. A review of sexual abuse in schools and colleges in Englandconcluded sexual harassment had become ""normalised"" among school-age children. The Welsh Conservatives called on the Welsh government to find out the scale of the problem in schools across Wales. Education Minister Jeremy Miles said the issue was a priority. UK ministers asked English schools inspectorate Ofsted to begin a review in England after the Everyone's Invited website began publishing anonymous testimony of sexual abuse allegations in schools. It also launched a helpline run by the NSPCC. Schools in Wales are the responsibility of the Welsh government. Girls asked for nudes by 11 boys a night - Ofsted Schools abuse helpline and review launched Met investigates 'Everyone's Invited' abuse claims Laura Anne Jones, education spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives, called on ministers in Wales to act after the ""troubling references to 91 schools in Wales"" by asking its own schools watchdog to investigate. She said: ""It's vital the Welsh government now instructs Estyn to look at the prevalence of the problem in Wales, assess safeguarding policies and experiences in schools and colleges, and publish its findings. ""Schools must be a safe place for our children."" Mr Miles toldBBC Radio Cymru's Dros Giniothe issue ""is a priority for us here in Wales too"". Asked if he would commit to an inquiry by Estyn, the minister replied: ""We are looking at the best way to respond to this. ""We want to make sure we take deliberate steps to ensure this doesn't happen."" Mr Miles said the Welsh government would say more ""in due course"". This video can not be played Soma Sara from Everyone's Invited: There's still a ""huge gap"" between incidents and reporting The Ofsted report, which questioned 900 staff and pupils in 30 schools and colleges in England, found more than two-thirds of girls said they endured unwanted touching ""a lot"" or ""sometimes"", while eight in 10 said they had been put under pressure to share sexual images of themselves. The report said data on children sexually harassing or abusing other children was scarce, saying: ""It is hard to get an accurate picture of the scale and nature of sexual harassment and violence between children and young people in schools and colleges. ""Although anyone can experience sexual harassment and violence, research indicates that girls are disproportionately affected,"" the report said. ""For example, 90% of recorded offences of rape in 2018-19 of 13 to 15-year-olds were committed against girls. In the past year, girls aged between 15 and 17 reported the highest annual rates of sexual abuse for young people and children aged 25 and younger."" NSPCC abuse helpline 'takes hundreds of calls' Sex abuse claims 'not limited to private schools' School abuse: 'Raped girl ignored by teachers' The report was prompted by the Everyone's Invited website, which has attracted more than 16,000 posts. It publishes anonymous allegations which mostly refer to sexual harassment carried out against young women by young men at their school or university. Wales' children's commissioner Professor Sally Holland said: ""Whilst I would welcome Estyn's expertise in gathering more information about this, we already know that this is an issue here in Wales. ""I've been hearing harrowing experiences from children and young people for years - which we've dealt with as individual cases - and I wouldn't want to delay taking action on this now by having to wait for a review."" She called for government to make a ""wider package of support and resources"" available, with ""high quality professional learning that gives all teachers the understanding and skills needed to prevent sexual harassment"".

UN aid chief says there is famine in Ethiopia,"A child sleeps on a sack of food aid in the Tigray region UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock has said there is famine in northern Ethiopia after the release of a UN-backed analysis of the situation. ""There is famine now,"" he said, adding: ""This is going to get a lot worse."" The study found that 350,000 people were living in ""severe crisis"" in the war-torn Tigray region. Tigray has been devastated by fighting between government forces and rebels, with 1.7 million people displaced since fighting began in November 2020. According to the assessment, the food situation in the region has reached the level of a ""catastrophe"",external, which it defines as starvation and death affecting small groups of people spread over large areas. The tragedy behind Ethiopiaâs man-made famine The dilemma of declaring a famine Why Ethiopia genocide debate may be a distraction The UN's World Food Programme (WFP), Food and Agriculture Organization and children's agency Unicef have all called for urgent action to address the crisis. The analysis - or Integrated Phase Classification (IPC) as it is known - was not endorsed by Ethiopia's government, which has denied that there is a famine in the country. It insists that humanitarian access is being expanded as it restores order across the region. People in Qafta Humera, an isolated district in the west of Tigray, told the BBC this week they were on the verge of starvation. The US Agency for International Development has sent food aid to Tigray ""We don't have anything to eat,"" one man said by phone, explaining their crops and livestock had been looted during seven months of war. They were being prevented from seeking aid by a militia fighting with government forces, he added. ""We were eating small remains of crops that we managed to hide, but now we don't have anything,"" said a farmer in his 40s. ""Nobody has given us any aid. Almost everyone is on the verge of death - our eyes are affected by the hunger, the situation is perilous. Death is knocking on our door. You can see the hunger on the face of each of us."" Residents of western Tigray say their crops were looted by militias and they are surviving on the little they hid Residents said they had seen vehicles carrying aid pass by, but no-one had bothered to inquire about their predicament. In 1984, Tigray and the next-door province of Wollo were the epicentre of a famine caused by a combination of drought and war that led to between 600,000 and one million deaths. âWe have no food, we face deathâ The Integrated Phase Classification is a measure of the severity of food shortages, drawn up by multiple organisations which include UN agencies and non-governmental aid organisations. ""An IPC analysis update conducted in Tigray and the neighbouring zones of Amhara and Afar concludes that over 350,000 people are in Catastrophe (IPC Phase 5) between May and June 2021,"" the report says. ""This severe crisis results from the cascading effects of conflict, including population displacements, movement restrictions, limited humanitarian access, loss of harvest and livelihood assets, and dysfunctional or non-existent markets,"" the analysis adds. It says that as of May, 5.5 million people were facing high levels of acute food insecurity in the region and the situation was likely to worsen through to September. But the report stops short of officially declaring a famine, which has a very specific definition. The IPC announcement falls short of declaring a famine in Tigray. That is because the ""f-word"" is such a powerful, compelling word that governments and international organisations have agreed it should only be used when certain strict criteria are met. For now, the IPC has settled on the use of the word ""catastrophe"" instead - with a warning that large parts of Tigray are at risk of famine in the coming months. Put simply, a ""Phase 5 catastrophe"" can refer to small groups of people, spread over large areas, whereas the word ""famine"" is only used when a big and distinct population group is experiencing conditions of starvation and death. And right now, in Tigray - in part because of insecurity and problems accessing those in most need - there is not yet the data to support a definition of famine. But many experts find this - often highly politicised - debate over definitions both petty and counter-productive, and individuals, like the UN's humanitarian chief, Mark Lowcock, have chosen to ignore the rules and insist that ""there is famine now in Tigray"". Last November Ethiopia's government launched an offensive to oust the region's then ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The party had had a massive fallout with Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed over political changes to the country's ethnically based federal system - though the TPLF's capture of federal military bases in Tigray was the catalyst for the invasion. This video can not be played Ethiopia's Tigray crisis: 'The marks of the conflict can easily be seen' Mr Abiy, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, declared that the conflict was over at the end of November, but fighting has continued. Thousands of people have been killed. Tens of thousands have sought refuge in neighbouring Sudan. All sides have been accused of numerous human rights abuses. Food shortages can lead to large numbers of people lacking nutrition, but only rarely do they amount to famine, according to UN humanitarian criteria. Long periods of drought and other problems reducing the supply of food do not necessarily result in a famine. A famine is declared only when certain measures of mortality, malnutrition and hunger are met. They are: at least 20% of households in an area face extreme food shortages with a limited ability to cope acute malnutrition rates exceed 30% the death rate exceeds two persons per day per 10,000 persons The declaration of a famine carries no binding obligations on the UN or member states, but serves to focus global attention on the problem.

What difference could half a billion vaccines make?,"A US vaccine donation via Covax arrives in East Timor The G7 group of leading industrial nations have pledged to donate one billion coronavirus vaccine doses to poorer countries. President Joe Biden, in the UK for a G7 summit, said the US contribution of 500 million doses would be ""the largest single...donation of Covid-19 vaccines by any single country ever"". The UK has pledgedmore than 100 million doses over the next year. Over 870 million additional doseswere pledged at the G7 summit,external, bringing total commitments made since February 2021, to one billion. The vaccines will mainly be delivered throughthe Covax vaccine scheme, which aims to reach the most vulnerable 20% of every nation around the world. ""We need more, and we need them faster,"" said the head of the World Health Organization Tedros Ghebreyesus in his response to the G7 pledge.  ""Many other countries are now facing a surge in cases - and they are facing it without vaccines."" South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said: ""Even a billion vaccines, when we talk about two dose vaccines, it basically means 500 million... we need much more than that,"" ""We want to manufacture vaccines on our own, and we don't have the capacity."" Both the US and the UK have pledged to give away vaccine doses to other countries The US has agreed to purchase 500 million doses from Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at a ""not for profit"" price. Mr Biden vowed the US would be ""the arsenal of vaccines in our fight against Covid"". It is understood that 200 million US doseswill be distributed by the end of this year, and a further 300 million by June 2022.,external The US had already pledgedto give 80 million doses to countries around the world.,external Five million UK vaccines will be donated by the end of September, and another 25 million by the end of 2021. Most of the UK doses (80%) will go via Covax. The scale of the task is huge, and vaccines are needed immediately. At a summit in early June, hosted by the Global Alliance for Vaccination and Immunisation (Gavi), it was announced that so far,more than 132 million doses had been shared by various countries.,external This included more than 54 million doses available for short-term supply donated by Belgium, Denmark and Japan, as well as additional supplies from Spain and Sweden. ""The challenge is given the variants, given the movement of the virus, to get these vaccines available across the world as soon as possible,"" Seth Berkley, the chief executive of Gavi told the BBC. He said Covax had already ordered more than 2.5 billion doses, but these wouldn't come until the latter part of the year. ""To vaccinate at least 10% of the population in every country by September, we need an additional 250 million... vaccine doses,"" says Tedros Ghebreyesus of the WHO, of which 100 millionare needed in June and July. The original Covax objective was to deliver two billion doses of vaccine worldwide by the end of this year, but the aim now is to get 1.8 billion doses to 92 lower income economies by early 2022. And all these commitments are a long way off the 11 billion doses the WHO estimates are needed to vaccinate the whole world to a level of 70%, the point at which transmission of the virus could be significantly reduced. The Covax scheme has mostly relied so far on the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine produced in India. However supplies were severely hit in March, April and May after India halted all major exports of the vaccine when it was hit by its own major second wave of the pandemic. AstraZeneca vaccines have been the mainstay of the Covax sharing scheme A total of 1.1bn doses of Covishield (AstraZeneca) were ordered from India's largest manufacturer - the Serum Institute of India (SII). So far, it has supplied just 30 million doses to Covax, with nearly 190 million doses held up as it struggled to ramp up its production. It says exports will only resume by the end of the year and thatthe company is focusing on meeting India's own needs. There has also been an issue in some countries about the slow uptake and distribution of vaccines already delivered,with some African nations unable to use doses before they expire. ""While more vaccines are vital, some African countries must ramp up actions to swiftly roll out the vaccines they have,"" the WHO said.

UK to donate more than 100m surplus vaccine doses,"Boris Johnson says the UK will start donating coronavirus vaccines to poorer countries in the next few weeks. More than 100 million surplus doses will be delivered in the next year, he announced ahead of the G7 summit. US President Joe Biden has promised 500 million doses of Pfizer vaccines to 92 low and middle-income countries and the African Union. Five million doses will be given by the UK by the end of September, with 25 million more by the end of the year. The prime minister said: ""As a result of the success of the UK's vaccine programme we are now in a position to share some of our surplus doses with those who need them. ""In doing so we will take a massive step towards beating this pandemic for good."" He said he hoped his fellow leaders at the summit in Carbis Bay, Cornwall, which starts on Friday, would ""make similar pledges so that, together, we can vaccinate the world by the end of next year"". What difference could half a billion doses make? What is the Covax scheme and how does it work? The group of leaders of wealthy nations is expected to collectively agree to provide a billion doses of coronavirus vaccines in a collective effort to end the pandemic. The leaders of Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Italy as well as the US and the UK, are also setting out a plan to expand vaccine manufacturing to help hit that goal. Speaking in Cornwall, Mr Biden said: ""The United States is providing these half billion doses with no strings attached. No strings attached. ""Our vaccine donations don't include pressure for favours, or potential concessions. We're doing this to save lives."" The announcement came after the US and UK leaders met for the first time in Cornwall ahead of the G7 summit It is not the first contribution to global vaccination by the UK government - it has already donated more than Â£500m to Covax, the scheme that distributes vaccines to the world's poorest countries. And it helped develop the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is available at cost price - with two-thirds of the 400m doses going to low and middle-income countries, including 170m to India. Why does the G7 summit matter? Boris Johnson and Joe Biden hold face-to-face meeting Mr Johnson wants the G7 leaders to encourage other pharmaceutical companies to also provide vaccines at cost price, while the pandemic continues. About a fifth of the doses being donated by the UK will be delivered through specific agreements with countries in need, with the rest being donated through Covax. Speaking to the BBC, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi agreed that even with the G7 donation pledges ""fundamentally, there's a shortage"" to vaccinate everyone and called on manufacturers to scale up production across the world. He also said no-one in the UK would have to wait longer for a vaccine because of the country's contribution to the global effort. He added that the UK was on track to offer all those aged over 50 - who had already had a first jab - a second dose by 21 June. The government has orderedmore than 500m dosesof seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use. It is hoped that the surplus doses of vaccine could help prevent the spread of the virus around the world and in doing so, restrict the emergence of more new variants. The donations announcement comes after the UK went back on a commitment to spend 0.7% of national income on overseas aid, insteadcutting that to 0.5%, citing the pandemic's effect on public finances. The donation of vaccines will count as extra aid spending on top of the Â£10bn promised under the reduced target. Zoe Abrams, executive director at the British Red Cross, said the promise on vaccines was ""heartening"" but added: ""While every commitment must be welcomed, more needs to be done, and fast."" And Lis Wallace, head of UK advocacy at anti-poverty campaigners One, said it was ""not happening anywhere near fast enough"", calling on Mr Johnson to start sharing doses straight away. What difference could a billion jabs make? Joe Biden is breath of fresh air, says Johnson Why does the G7 summit matter?

Girls asked for nudes by 11 boys a night - Ofsted,"Website Everyone's Invited has published thousands of testimonies (stock image) Some girls can be contacted by up to 11 boys a night asking for nude images, the schools watchdog for England says. In an Ofsted survey, girls explained that if they blocked boys on social media ""they just create multiple accounts to harass you"". The report,externalalso found nine in 10 girls believed that sexist name-calling and being sent unwanted explicit photos or videos happened ""a lot"" or ""sometimes"" between their peers. The watchdog is warning that sexual harassment has become ""normalised"" among school-age children. Students often do not see the point of reporting abuse and many teachers underestimate the scale of these problems, Ofsted says. NSPCC abuse helpline 'takes hundreds of calls' Schools abuse helpline and review launched Sex abuse claims 'not limited to private schools' School abuse: 'Raped girl ignored by teachers' In the survey, girls said boys ""just won't take no for an answer"" when asking for explicit images. At one school, the girls told inspectors they can be contacted by up to 10 or 11 different boys a night asking for nude or semi-nude images. Women's groups are calling for school staff to be trained to change the culture and for a government taskforce. Ministers say schools and colleges will be encouraged to dedicate training days to help staff deal with sexual abuse. A BBC investigation has revealed at least 13,000 sex offences a year between under-18s have been reported to police in England and Wales between 2018 and 2020. Thirty police forces responded to a Freedom of Information request which revealed in about 2,000 cases, both the alleged victim and perpetrator were aged 10 or under. About 1,000 of the reported offences were about events happening on school premises. This echoes Ofsted's finding that inappropriate sexual behaviour is filtering down into primary schools. Cerys said she received 50 or 60 nude photographs when she was at school Cerys, 21, said most girls she knows had received sexually explicit images from boys or men. She said: ""When I was younger at school I received 50 or 60 on Instagram, Facebook Snapchat, images of privates that I didn't want to see. I think the first port of call is to go to your mum...you feel like 'I don't want to see that, I don't know what to do with that and no one's asked for it'. It's not very nice to receive it."" Lucy, 18, said that receiving nude photographs had become ""so normalised"" that if they appear in girls' social media message requests they ""just delete it"". She said: ""Some girls do get it very often but it's something you brush away because it's not something you think of that's out of the ordinary... and there's nothing you can do about it."" Lucy said she did not think teachers knew what to do about the problem. Cerys said: ""We were told if you're going to be involved in this then the police are going to be involved. It was more of a scary assembly rather than let's get all the girls together and tell them how to emotionally deal with receiving these kinds of images."" Lucy said receiving nudes had become normalised Amy, not her real name, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that when she was in sixth form she was raped after a party. Now 25, she believes there was a wider culture of sexual harassment that played a role in what happened to her. She said: ""What was so challenging afterwards was when I tried to speak to friends I was fed back lines like 'Even if it was 80% him it was still 20% you' and 'Are you sure you didn't lead him on?' She said a number of other girls told her they had had similar experiences and she knew she had to tell the school. She said: ""It wasn't just one boy and me. It was a number of girls being affected by multiple boys doing these kinds of things."" Amy said she was able to speak to a teacher and the support was ""overall overwhelmingly positive"". But she believes the exchanging of nude images has ""got much worse"" in the years since she left school. ""Now I speak to younger people they just say [nude photographs] is what's expected. That's what being in a relationship is or that's what love is, or if you like someone you share a picture and if you don't then clearly you didn't like them,"" she said. This video can not be played Soma Sara from Everyone's Invited: There's still a ""huge gap"" between incidents and reporting Ofsted visited 30 state and independent schools and two further education colleges and spoke to more than 900 young people about sexual harassment. Some 64% of girls thought that unwanted touching was experienced ""a lot"" or ""sometimes"" amongst their peers, while eight in 10 said the same of being pressured into sharing sexual images of themselves. Children said sexual violence typically occurred in unsupervised spaces outside of school, like parties or parks. Pupils in several schools said harmful sexual behaviour happens at house parties, without adults present, and that alcohol and drugs are often involved. Most students felt that the relationships, sex and health education (RSHE) they received at school did not give them the information and advice they needed to navigate the reality of their situations. Girls in particular were frustrated that there was not clear teaching about what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Many teachers said they lacked knowledge on topics such as consent, healthy relationships and sharing of sexual images. Inspectors are urging school and college leaders to ""develop a culture"" where all types of sexual harassment are recognised and addressed. They also say time should be set aside within the RSHE curriculum for topics that youngsters find difficult, such as consent and the sharing of explicit images. Ofsted's review came after thousands of testimonies about abuse were posted on a website - Everyone's Invited - and the government asked inspectors to assess safeguarding policies and experiences in schools and colleges. In April, ministers also asked the NSPCC charity to run an abuse in education helpline, which will stay open until October. As of Monday, the helpline had received 426 calls and helpline staff have made 80 referrals to external agencies, including the police or social services. Ofsted says the issue is a societal one and not something schools and colleges can tackle alone Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said she was ""shocked"" that young people said it was a significant problem at every school the watchdog visited. ""It wasn't in some, it was in all of them,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a cultural issue - it's about attitudes and behaviours becoming normalised, and schools and colleges can't solve that by themselves."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said Ofsted's review had ""rightly highlighted where we can take specific and urgent action to address sexual abuse in education"". But he said schools and colleges could not be expected to tackle these issues alone. The Department for Education says teachers and school leaders will be better supported to recognise sexual harassment and abuse and teach confidently about issues of consent, online pornography and healthy relationships. They will be encouraged to dedicate staff training days on how to deal with sexual abuse and harassment among pupils and how to deliver the new compulsory RSHE curriculum. The End Violence Against Women Coalition called for a taskforce made up of the government, education leaders, and experts on violence against women and girls ""to advise on next steps and drive the rollout of a whole school approach"". Peter Wanless, head of the NSPCC, said young people had exposed what was happening and their voices must shape a whole-school approach to preventing harmful sexual behaviour. Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""It seems obvious that more must be done with greater urgency to tackle the misuse of social media and the availability of online pornography."" A spokeswoman for Everyone's Invited called for an anonymous reporting system available in all schools.

"Ex-Brewdog staff allege culture of fear at brewerFormer employees allege ""cult of personality"" in firm and claim ""toxic attitude"" to junior staff.Business","Brewdog founder James Watt (right) said the brewery was 'sorry' Former staff at Brewdog have alleged a ""culture of fear"" at the beer firm with a ""toxic attitude"" to junior employees. In an open letter,external, signatories said a ""significant number"" of former staff had ""suffered mental illness as a result of working at BrewDog"". They claimed that the firm was built around a ""cult of personality"" of founders James Watt and Martin Dickie. Mr Watt said Brewdog was ""sorry"",externaland that it would not contest the letter, but ""listen, learn and act"". The Scottish brewer and pub-chain rapidly rose into the mainstream after major supermarkets started stocking it in 2008. But it has also courted controversy with its marketing and commercial decisions. The open letter, which was posted on Twitter and signed by more than 60 former staff, made a number of allegations, including a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns. It said Mr Watt and Mr Dickie had exploited publicity, ""both good and bad"" to further their own business goals and chased ""growth, at all costs"". Allow Twitter content?

Brewdog reveals plans for 'beer hotel' in Edinburgh Beer firm BrewDog toasts US investment It added: ""You spent years claiming you wanted to be the best employer in the world, presumably to help you to recruit top talent, but ask former staff what they think of those claims, and you'll most likely be laughed at. ""Being treated like a human being was sadly not always a given for those working at Brewdog."" According to the letter, toxic attitudes towards junior staff had ""trickled down"" throughout the business ""until they were simply an intrinsic part of the company"". ""Put bluntly, the single biggest shared experience of former staff is a residual feeling of fear. Fear to speak out about the atmosphere we were immersed in, and fear of repercussions even after we have left,"" it added. One of the ex-staff members who signed the letter, Christopher Baria-Lewis, told the BBC he ""felt it was important, with former colleagues, to get a message out there"". ""Their [Brewdog's] external persona doesn't align with how they operate,"" he said, adding that the letter had been organised collectively. The letter also questioned Brewdog's commitment to sustainability after ""years of vanity projects"" and use of a private jet. Along with many breweries, pubs, and other parts of the hospitality industry, Brewdog has been hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Watt said: ""At Brewdog, we are focused on building the best business we can, which is why the open letter we saw on Twitter was so upsetting, but so important. ""Our focus now is not on contradicting or contesting the details of that letter, but to listen, learn and act. ""As a fast-growing business, we have always tried to do the best by our team - we do have thousands of employees with positive stories to tell as a result."" But he said the tweet by former staff proved that ""on many occasions we haven't got it right"". ""We are committed to doing better, not just as a reaction to this, but always; and we are going to reach out to our entire team past and present to learn more. ""But most of all, right now, we are sorry."" He said it had been ""hard to hear"" the comments, but added: ""It must have been harder to say them. ""We appreciate that and we will endeavour to honour that effort and courage with the real change it deserves. We aren't going to make excuses, we're going to take action."" Brewdog started out in 2007, being passionate about craft beer and contemptuous of rival big brewers. It's become at least as passionate about growth, by unconventional ""punk"" means. So far, there is a big brewery in Aberdeenshire, plus others in Berlin, Brisbane and Columbus, Ohio. There are more than 100 Brewdog bars, dotted across the world map. And a new project is beer-themed hotels, in Ohio, Manchester and Edinburgh. This has been funded through the sale of a big chunk of the business to private equity and several rounds of crowdfunding. The AGM in Aberdeen has become something of a party. But it seems the combined publicity-thirsty passion for beer and growth has been bruising. Every employer has disgruntled ex-employees. Usually, once dispersed, they moan into their beer. But in this case, these ex-staff signatories have taken their passion for beer and applied it to improving working conditions in their industry. Co-founder James Watt concedes he didn't always ""get things right"".  He dispensed with the usual combative defiance. His response is chastened, recognising that the accusations could be damaging to the brand and to recruitment. He has become very successful by inviting drinkers to buy into products infused with the passion of beer people. So this runs counter to the values of clubby comradeship. Repairing the damage will take more nuance than Brewdog usually deploys.

"Girls asked for nudes by 11 boys a night - OfstedSexual harassment is being ""normalised"" among school-age children, England's schools watchdog finds.Family & Education","Website Everyone's Invited has published thousands of testimonies (stock image) Some girls can be contacted by up to 11 boys a night asking for nude images, the schools watchdog for England says. In an Ofsted survey, girls explained that if they blocked boys on social media ""they just create multiple accounts to harass you"". The report,externalalso found nine in 10 girls believed that sexist name-calling and being sent unwanted explicit photos or videos happened ""a lot"" or ""sometimes"" between their peers. The watchdog is warning that sexual harassment has become ""normalised"" among school-age children. Students often do not see the point of reporting abuse and many teachers underestimate the scale of these problems, Ofsted says. NSPCC abuse helpline 'takes hundreds of calls' Schools abuse helpline and review launched Sex abuse claims 'not limited to private schools' School abuse: 'Raped girl ignored by teachers' In the survey, girls said boys ""just won't take no for an answer"" when asking for explicit images. At one school, the girls told inspectors they can be contacted by up to 10 or 11 different boys a night asking for nude or semi-nude images. Women's groups are calling for school staff to be trained to change the culture and for a government taskforce. Ministers say schools and colleges will be encouraged to dedicate training days to help staff deal with sexual abuse. A BBC investigation has revealed at least 13,000 sex offences a year between under-18s have been reported to police in England and Wales between 2018 and 2020. Thirty police forces responded to a Freedom of Information request which revealed in about 2,000 cases, both the alleged victim and perpetrator were aged 10 or under. About 1,000 of the reported offences were about events happening on school premises. This echoes Ofsted's finding that inappropriate sexual behaviour is filtering down into primary schools. Cerys said she received 50 or 60 nude photographs when she was at school Cerys, 21, said most girls she knows had received sexually explicit images from boys or men. She said: ""When I was younger at school I received 50 or 60 on Instagram, Facebook Snapchat, images of privates that I didn't want to see. I think the first port of call is to go to your mum...you feel like 'I don't want to see that, I don't know what to do with that and no one's asked for it'. It's not very nice to receive it."" Lucy, 18, said that receiving nude photographs had become ""so normalised"" that if they appear in girls' social media message requests they ""just delete it"". She said: ""Some girls do get it very often but it's something you brush away because it's not something you think of that's out of the ordinary... and there's nothing you can do about it."" Lucy said she did not think teachers knew what to do about the problem. Cerys said: ""We were told if you're going to be involved in this then the police are going to be involved. It was more of a scary assembly rather than let's get all the girls together and tell them how to emotionally deal with receiving these kinds of images."" Lucy said receiving nudes had become normalised Amy, not her real name, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that when she was in sixth form she was raped after a party. Now 25, she believes there was a wider culture of sexual harassment that played a role in what happened to her. She said: ""What was so challenging afterwards was when I tried to speak to friends I was fed back lines like 'Even if it was 80% him it was still 20% you' and 'Are you sure you didn't lead him on?'

They were edited by Katie Wright and Emma Owen. Thanks for tuning in, we'll be back tomorrow. We'll shortly be wrapping up for the day. Here's what you need to know: Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said earlier that data suggests there will be a further rise in cases ""in coming weeks"" Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter According to NHS England, a record number of young people have booked
appointments for vaccines after those over 25 were invited to have their
jabs. But anti-vaccine activists are still targeting younger people online. Videos and posts promoting conspiracy theories that vaccines will cause
miscarriages or affect fertility have circulated for months, aimed at younger
women in particular. Anecdotally, weâve seen an uptick in recent days, just as younger people
have been offered a jab. Emotive content is being shared on sites like Instagram and
TikTok, as well as in Facebook groups. Several women - as well as doctors
working at vaccine centres - have messaged me with worries that these
conspiracy theories may frighten some off the jab. Weâve looked into claims about vaccines affecting periods - and
unsubstantiated claims that they could cause miscarriages - read more on thathere. Nearly one in three older adult care home workers in England has not been fully vaccinated against coronavirus, new figures from NHS England show. The latest data shows that 68.7% of eligible staff at older adult care homes had been given both doses of vaccine by 6 June. Since the vaccine programme began, 83.7% of staff have been given a first jab. In total, 95.3% of older adult care home residents have had a first jab and 90.5% have had both. Residents and staff are eligible for the vaccine if they have not had Covid-19 in the previous 28 days. And they are both in the top priority group of the vaccination programme. Meanwhile, 82.7% of residents at younger adult care homes have received both doses now. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The US was worst hit by the pandemicin the G7 big Western democracies over the first year of Covid-19, according to an updated study of excess death figures. The analysis, done for the BBC by the Health Foundation, comes on the eve of the G7 summit in Cornwall and measures deaths above expected levels for a normal year. Last year,an earlier BBC studyshowed that at that point, the UK had been hardest hit. Overall, UK outcomes are now second worst in the G7. The analysis shows that in the second half of last year in particular, US levels of excess deaths failed to drop back as much as other comparable industrialised nations. The UK's worse outcomes in the first wave, and a significant peak of deaths in December and January, still mean that overall UK outcomes were second worst, on one measure just behind the US. Read the full story here. For people wanting to get married, the wait continues as cases of the Delta variant rise ahead of the planned 21 June unlocking. One couple has been telling the BBC how that has been for them. Tommy Router, 30, and his fiancÃ©e Caroline Dorman, 29, got engaged in 2019 and were supposed to get married last summer, with a reception at his parents' garden in Hingham, Norfolk. Since last summer, the couple have spent weeks making and then changing various contingency plans for a wedding this July, plans which have seen their guest list scaled back from 130 to 100 and then 60. They are now erring on the side of caution and have decided to cut their wedding list even further to 30 guests. ""We've mentally changed our wedding plans more times than I can ever count and physically changed it more than a handful of times,"" says Tommy. Caroline, an NHS intensive care nurse working at St Thomas' Hospital in London, says: ""It feels a bit like deja vu of last year, but we obviously hope this year it actually happens."" Read more here on the effect on those planning weddings. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has reported a spike in new Covid infections for the eighth day running. The country's Covid-19 HQ recorded 11,699 new cases on 10 June - the highest such figure since 24 February. Speaking to state news agency RIA Novosti on 9 June, one of the country's top epidemiologists Alexander Gintsburg suggested the recent rise in new cases was down to socialising in the summer. ""Summer has come, there is far more interaction, people's mobility is increasing compared with the winter period which is why naturally there is an increase in incidence among those who have not been vaccinated,"" he said. Gintsburg, whose Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology developed the Sputnik V vaccine - one of Russia's three vaccines against the virus - urged the public to get vaccinated. President Vladimir Putin and senior officials have made repeated appeals to Russians about receiving a jab, but public enthusiasm has been persistently low. In February only 30% of Russians said they were willing to receive the Sputnik V jab, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey in May by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a jab ""under any circumstances"". Former prime minister Theresa May has criticised Boris Johnson's international travel restrictions, saying ""global Britain is shut for business"". Speaking in the House of Commons, she says the government had failed to act on its June 2020 promise to get internationally-agreed standard health measures in place. ""One year on, we are no further forward - indeed, what we have is a devastated industry, jobs lost and global Britain shut for business."" she says. ""More than not being any further forward, we've gone backwards."" May says that last year she went to Switzerland in August and South Korea in September - questioning why travel was possible when there was no vaccine, yet now there is a vaccine it is not. She also says the traffic light system is ""chaotic"" and that business travel is ""practically impossible"". May says the UK is ""falling behind the rest of Europe"" when it comes to making decisions on travel, adding of the government: ""It needs to decide whether it wants an airline industry and aviation sector in the UK or not, because at the rate it's going it won't have one."" Harriet AgerholmData journalist The gap between Covid-19 case rates among the old and young is growing. In Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, where cases are surging and the Delta variant has been found in high concentrations, the most recent average case rate in the under 60s is now about six times that of those aged 60 and over. During earlier waves of the pandemic, case rates among older people in hotspot areas caught up with those of younger people, but this time it looks different. Local leaders have been calling on eligible people to have their second jab, and these high rates of infection among lower priority groups could demonstrate just why having two doses is so important. Covid cases in the UK are not heading in the right direction and data suggests there will be a further rise soon, says chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency Dr Jenny Harries. ""We are progressing, probably as a country, not quite in the right direction that we would all want to,"" she told a Royal Society of Medicine webinar. ""Cases are rising, I think that is becoming clearer and modelling does suggest that we would start to see a further rise, not necessarily immediately but in coming weeks."" The latest Public Health England data shows case rates in England have risen in almost every age group, with the highest rise among people in their 20s. Dr Harries said older people were not getting ill because they have had two jabs, while those in hospital have either only had one dose or are unvaccinated. She said the virus is ""not going to go away"", with factors including a possible drop in vaccine effectiveness against new variants and a ""large reservoir"" of people who can transmit it. And more from the UK's daily figures - 176,559 more people had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine yesterday, with 316,258 having a second dose. In total, 40,886,878 have now had their first jab and of them, 28,857,102 have had both doses - that's 54.8% of the UK's adult population. In the last seven days, there have been 44,008 new positive coronavirus tests in the UK. That's a rise of 17,036 - or 63.2% - from the previous week. And there have been 55 deaths in the past seven days, a rise of one - or 1.9% - from the week before.  There have been 7,393 new daily cases of coronavirus reported in the UK,according to the latest figures.,external That's the second day running cases have topped 7,000 - prior to this that number was last surpassed in late February. In addition, there have been seven more deaths reported of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. The gap between the first and second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine isto be cut in Northern Ireland. There is currently a gap of 10-12 weeks between the two doses of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines. It is now being reduced to a maximum of eight weeks, the Department of Health has said. It's intended to offer better protection against the Delta variant, first detected in India, which is more transmissible. The first dose is thought to be 30% effective against it, while this increases to about 80% following a second dose. Hancock, centre with his back to the camera, giving evidence earlier Labour's shadow social care minister Liz Kendall says evidence from Matt Hancock at the science and health committees was ""at best disingenuous"". She says: ""He selectively used briefings, evidence and clinical advice to defend his record instead of admitting his abject failure to protect care homes in the pandemic. ""Even Matt Hancock knows he now categorically failed to put a protective ring around care homes. ""He has now used multiple excuses for failing to test those discharged to care homes, and family members who have lost loved ones will be frustrated and deeply upset that they still do not have the truth from the Secretary of State today.""

Matt Hancock has a few. Such as not challenging the assumption within Whitehall early last year that the public wouldn't tolerate a lockdown to contain Covid. He ""bitterly regretted"" that he had not overruled scientific advice at the start of the pandemic that assumed coronavirus could not be transmitted asymptomatically. Mr Hancock said the death rate in care homes ""weighed heavily"" on him. But over four and half hours the health secretary defended the government's actions on several fronts - from PPE provision to care homes - making claims that will be scrutinised further. Dominic Cummings sat in the same chair two weeks ago and heaped scorn on blame on his former colleagues (most venomously on Mr Hancock). In contrast, the health secretary said ministers and officials largely did their best in unprecedented circumstances. Mr Hancock strenuously avoided mentioning Mr Cummings by name but swatted away his allegations when they were put to him by MPs. While assiduously praising those he worked with Matt Hancock also gave the impression that what the crisis really needed was more Matt Hancock. After having his name trashed by Mr Cummings a fortnight ago this was quite a bounce back. Matt Hancock ended his evidence saying the government was now better prepared to handle another pandemic. It had better be because Mr Hancock's testimony added to the picture of a government stunned, sometimes inert and often overwhelmed as the Covid crisis engulfed it at the start of last year. In a bid to boost vaccination numbers, officials in the US state of Washington are allowing marijuana retailers to host their own vaccine clinics and to offer a single, pre-rolled cannabis cigarette to anyone aged over 21 who gets their jab there. The scheme, announced on Monday, is the latest of many vaccine incentives being offered in the west coast state, including free pints of beer, sports tickets and prize money. Back in 2012, Washington and Colorado became the first states to legalise the adult use of cannabis, and regulated sales began two years later. It's been a major source of tax revenue for Washington state, bringing in over $395m (Â£280m) in 2019. Unlike purveyors of alcohol, cannabis retailers are being given tax breaks on the joints they give away. But the high-minded scheme is set to expire 12 July â meaning many customers will be unable to return for a second dose. Many businesses also face legal hurdles since their industry is still illegal at a federal level. Daniela Bernhard, the co-owner of Uncle Ikeâs cannabis store in Seattle, told AP news agency that their efforts to host a vaccine clinic had been rejected by two healthcare providers. A spokesperson for Spokane Regional Health District, a local public health agency, also told AP that they wouldn't be able to provide marijuana businesses with any vaccines because of concerns that it would jeopardise their own federal funding. Ms Bernhard said she was âdisappointed that our legal and heavily regulated sector continues to be treated differently than our peer sectorsâ. âIf we are trusting adults driving with their vaccination cards to get a pint of beer and then responsibly get to their next destination, we can also trust that adults will pick up a joint and enjoy it later in a legal setting,â she added. The National Covid Memorial Wall in London A campaign group for families bereaved by Covid-19 has said Matt Hancock's evidence to MPs shows ""he blames everyone but himself and the government for the handling of the pandemic"". In a statement posted to Twitter, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said: ""Scientists, the public and advisers are all seemingly at fault according to a minister who suggested he was continually unaware of important details. ""Even when directly challenged to agree that the first lockdown came too late he shirked the opportunity to show humility, instead choosing to speak on something else while not denying what we all know - the late lockdown cost lives. ""Hundreds of thousands of bereaved families will have felt a shudder as Matt Hancock stated 'sometimes you have to put yourself in jeopardy'. ""The truth is it was our loved ones who were placed in jeopardy and they paid for it with their lives."" They urged Hancock to meet with bereaved families so he could be ""better informed"" of the challenges they have faced. Ministers at Stormont have agreed an indicative date of 21 June for live music and theatre to resume across venues in NI. But this still has to be rubber-stamped by the executive next week, in line with health advice. Many venues have been closed to audiences since March 2020. The executive is also understood to have agreed to proposals to raise limits on social contact with others at home from that date. It would allow 10 people from two households to meet indoors from that date. Currently only six people from two households can meet inside a home. The number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a private garden could rise to 15 from any number of households on that date. 21 June has also been agreed as an indicative date for lifting the cap of 500 people at outdoor gatherings, instead replacing it with numbers by risk assessment. The changes could mean the return of some larger concerts, sporting events and festivals this summer. Ahead of the executive meeting, Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said he would ""encourage the executive to do the right thing"" and allow the return of live music. ""Northern Ireland is known for its rich fabric of talented musicians. These musicians, and the venues which host them, feel left behind,"" he said. Read more. Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveDelta variant comprises 91% of new UK cases - Hancock6 minutes ago,"Matt Hancock says the Delta variant first identified in India now comprises 91% of new Covid cases seen in the UK His comments came as he defended his handling of the pandemic during four hours of questioning from MPs He rejects criticism from Dominic Cummings, including that he had lied to the PM about care home testing Locking down earlier than 23 March last year would have gone against the scientific advice at the time, he says Hancock says he ""bitterly regrets"" not overruling scientific guidance the virus could not be spread asymptomatically And he says he followed clinical advice on patients being released from hospitals to care homes and was told they would be tested The UK has reported more than 7,000 daily Covid cases for a second day running The latest government figures also show there were another seven deaths within 28 days of a positive test The UK's recovery from the pandemic lagged behind other big economies in the first three months of 2021 Edited by Katie Wright Today's live page posts were written by Hazel Shearing, Lauren Turner, Jo Couzens and Richard Morris. They were edited by Katie Wright and Emma Owen. Thanks for tuning in, we'll be back tomorrow. We'll shortly be wrapping up for the day. Here's what you need to know: Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said earlier that data suggests there will be a further rise in cases ""in coming weeks"" Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter According to NHS England, a record number of young people have booked
appointments for vaccines after those over 25 were invited to have their
jabs. But anti-vaccine activists are still targeting younger people online. Videos and posts promoting conspiracy theories that vaccines will cause
miscarriages or affect fertility have circulated for months, aimed at younger
women in particular. Anecdotally, weâve seen an uptick in recent days, just as younger people
have been offered a jab. Emotive content is being shared on sites like Instagram and
TikTok, as well as in Facebook groups. Several women - as well as doctors
working at vaccine centres - have messaged me with worries that these
conspiracy theories may frighten some off the jab. Weâve looked into claims about vaccines affecting periods - and
unsubstantiated claims that they could cause miscarriages - read more on thathere. Nearly one in three older adult care home workers in England has not been fully vaccinated against coronavirus, new figures from NHS England show. The latest data shows that 68.7% of eligible staff at older adult care homes had been given both doses of vaccine by 6 June. Since the vaccine programme began, 83.7% of staff have been given a first jab. In total, 95.3% of older adult care home residents have had a first jab and 90.5% have had both. Residents and staff are eligible for the vaccine if they have not had Covid-19 in the previous 28 days. And they are both in the top priority group of the vaccination programme. Meanwhile, 82.7% of residents at younger adult care homes have received both doses now. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The US was worst hit by the pandemicin the G7 big Western democracies over the first year of Covid-19, according to an updated study of excess death figures. The analysis, done for the BBC by the Health Foundation, comes on the eve of the G7 summit in Cornwall and measures deaths above expected levels for a normal year. Last year,an earlier BBC studyshowed that at that point, the UK had been hardest hit. Overall, UK outcomes are now second worst in the G7. The analysis shows that in the second half of last year in particular, US levels of excess deaths failed to drop back as much as other comparable industrialised nations. The UK's worse outcomes in the first wave, and a significant peak of deaths in December and January, still mean that overall UK outcomes were second worst, on one measure just behind the US.

One couple has been telling the BBC how that has been for them. Tommy Router, 30, and his fiancÃ©e Caroline Dorman, 29, got engaged in 2019 and were supposed to get married last summer, with a reception at his parents' garden in Hingham, Norfolk. Since last summer, the couple have spent weeks making and then changing various contingency plans for a wedding this July, plans which have seen their guest list scaled back from 130 to 100 and then 60. They are now erring on the side of caution and have decided to cut their wedding list even further to 30 guests. ""We've mentally changed our wedding plans more times than I can ever count and physically changed it more than a handful of times,"" says Tommy. Caroline, an NHS intensive care nurse working at St Thomas' Hospital in London, says: ""It feels a bit like deja vu of last year, but we obviously hope this year it actually happens."" Read more here on the effect on those planning weddings. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has reported a spike in new Covid infections for the eighth day running. The country's Covid-19 HQ recorded 11,699 new cases on 10 June - the highest such figure since 24 February. Speaking to state news agency RIA Novosti on 9 June, one of the country's top epidemiologists Alexander Gintsburg suggested the recent rise in new cases was down to socialising in the summer. ""Summer has come, there is far more interaction, people's mobility is increasing compared with the winter period which is why naturally there is an increase in incidence among those who have not been vaccinated,"" he said. Gintsburg, whose Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology developed the Sputnik V vaccine - one of Russia's three vaccines against the virus - urged the public to get vaccinated. President Vladimir Putin and senior officials have made repeated appeals to Russians about receiving a jab, but public enthusiasm has been persistently low. In February only 30% of Russians said they were willing to receive the Sputnik V jab, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey in May by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a jab ""under any circumstances"". Former prime minister Theresa May has criticised Boris Johnson's international travel restrictions, saying ""global Britain is shut for business"". Speaking in the House of Commons, she says the government had failed to act on its June 2020 promise to get internationally-agreed standard health measures in place. ""One year on, we are no further forward - indeed, what we have is a devastated industry, jobs lost and global Britain shut for business."" she says. ""More than not being any further forward, we've gone backwards."" May says that last year she went to Switzerland in August and South Korea in September - questioning why travel was possible when there was no vaccine, yet now there is a vaccine it is not. She also says the traffic light system is ""chaotic"" and that business travel is ""practically impossible"". May says the UK is ""falling behind the rest of Europe"" when it comes to making decisions on travel, adding of the government: ""It needs to decide whether it wants an airline industry and aviation sector in the UK or not, because at the rate it's going it won't have one."" Harriet AgerholmData journalist The gap between Covid-19 case rates among the old and young is growing. In Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, where cases are surging and the Delta variant has been found in high concentrations, the most recent average case rate in the under 60s is now about six times that of those aged 60 and over. During earlier waves of the pandemic, case rates among older people in hotspot areas caught up with those of younger people, but this time it looks different. Local leaders have been calling on eligible people to have their second jab, and these high rates of infection among lower priority groups could demonstrate just why having two doses is so important. Covid cases in the UK are not heading in the right direction and data suggests there will be a further rise soon, says chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency Dr Jenny Harries. ""We are progressing, probably as a country, not quite in the right direction that we would all want to,"" she told a Royal Society of Medicine webinar. ""Cases are rising, I think that is becoming clearer and modelling does suggest that we would start to see a further rise, not necessarily immediately but in coming weeks."" The latest Public Health England data shows case rates in England have risen in almost every age group, with the highest rise among people in their 20s. Dr Harries said older people were not getting ill because they have had two jabs, while those in hospital have either only had one dose or are unvaccinated. She said the virus is ""not going to go away"", with factors including a possible drop in vaccine effectiveness against new variants and a ""large reservoir"" of people who can transmit it. And more from the UK's daily figures - 176,559 more people had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine yesterday, with 316,258 having a second dose. In total, 40,886,878 have now had their first jab and of them, 28,857,102 have had both doses - that's 54.8% of the UK's adult population. In the last seven days, there have been 44,008 new positive coronavirus tests in the UK. That's a rise of 17,036 - or 63.2% - from the previous week. And there have been 55 deaths in the past seven days, a rise of one - or 1.9% - from the week before.  There have been 7,393 new daily cases of coronavirus reported in the UK,according to the latest figures.,external That's the second day running cases have topped 7,000 - prior to this that number was last surpassed in late February. In addition, there have been seven more deaths reported of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. The gap between the first and second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine isto be cut in Northern Ireland. There is currently a gap of 10-12 weeks between the two doses of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines. It is now being reduced to a maximum of eight weeks, the Department of Health has said. It's intended to offer better protection against the Delta variant, first detected in India, which is more transmissible. The first dose is thought to be 30% effective against it, while this increases to about 80% following a second dose. Hancock, centre with his back to the camera, giving evidence earlier Labour's shadow social care minister Liz Kendall says evidence from Matt Hancock at the science and health committees was ""at best disingenuous"". She says: ""He selectively used briefings, evidence and clinical advice to defend his record instead of admitting his abject failure to protect care homes in the pandemic. ""Even Matt Hancock knows he now categorically failed to put a protective ring around care homes. ""He has now used multiple excuses for failing to test those discharged to care homes, and family members who have lost loved ones will be frustrated and deeply upset that they still do not have the truth from the Secretary of State today.""

Oatly sues UK oat milk maker over trademark,"Oatly, the plant milk maker backed by Oprah Winfrey, is in a court battle with a Cambridgeshire farm over alleged trademark infringement. Lawyers for Oatly sought a High Court injunction on Thursday to stop Glebe Farm Foods selling its PureOaty brand. Oatly said it contacted the PureOaty makers in early 2020 saying ""their branding infringed our trademark"". Farmer Phillip Rayner, who owns Glebe Farm, said the PureOaty name was ""a nod to the purity of the product"". Mr Rayner said that his company began producing the beverage using British-farmed oats about 18 months ago, but Oatly now wants Glebe Farm to stop using the PureOaty brand and change its packaging. The Cambridgeshire farmer said: ""Oatly says the name and packaging is too similar to theirs, but when we compare the two products side by side, we are surprised by this."" Oatly sought a High Court injunction on Thursday to stop Glebe Farm Foods selling its PureOaty brand A spokesperson for Oatly said that since the 2020 letter, ""we unfortunately received no constructive response from them. We are therefore now involved in an ongoing court case and we have no further comment as we await the results."" The case at the London High Court is expected to conclude on Thursday. Oatly, which was founded in the 1990s and produces a milk substitute made from oats, has grown rapidly in recent years. Its oat milk is now sold in 60,000 shops and more than 32,000 coffee shops across 20 countries and the company is now worth more than $15bn Other celebrity investors in the firm alongside Ms Winfrey include Jay-Z and Natalie Portman, It has also had investment from the state-owned China Resources and Verlinvest, a Belgium-based investment firm.

US overtakes UK as hardest hit by Covid deaths in G7,"The US was worst hit by the pandemic in the G7 big Western democracies over the first year of Covid-19, according to an updated study of excess death figures. The analysis, done for the BBC by the Health Foundation, comes on the eve of the G7 summit in Cornwall. It measures deaths above expected levels for a normal year. Last year,an earlier BBC studyshowed that at that point, the UK had been hardest hit. Overall, UK outcomes are now second worst in the G7. The analysis,externalshows that in the second half of last year in particular, US levels of excess deaths failed to drop back as much as other comparable industrialised nations. This video can not be played Faisal Islam dissects the latest G7 Covid death statistics. However, the UK's worse outcomes in the first wave, and a significant peak of deaths in December and January, still mean that overall UK outcomes were second worst, on one measure just behind the US. The other G7 countries - Italy, France, Canada, Germany and Japan - had fewer excess deaths, with the latter three significantly fewer. The principal measure of comparison is excess deaths. This is the percentage of above normal deaths over the year, which can help account for different measurement techniques in different countries. It is a measure of the overall impact of the pandemic, including directly from the disease and from the response to it. The raw numbers of reported Covid-19 deaths show the UK as the worst in the G7, but most analysts believe there has been structural under-reporting of Covid deaths in the US, which has seen far less testing, making the excess deaths comparison more appropriate. The analysis shows that between March 2020 and February 2021, there were a fifth more deaths than in a normal year for the US (+20.2%) and  a little bit under a fifth for the UK (+19.6%), Italy was lower, but still significantly hit (+17%), French excess deaths were one-10th higher (+10.2%), and then Canada (+5.1%) and Germany (+4.9%) saw deaths only one-20th up on normal. Japan's deaths (-1.4%) were actually lower over this first year than would have been expected. Another measure, adjusted for the size of population, showed that there were 227 excess deaths for every 100,000 people in the US. There were just under that both for the UK (181) and Italy (180). France was clearly lower at 125. Canada (92) and Germany (92) had an excess death rate below one in 1,000. And Japan's figure was lower still (47). Comparing the pandemic waves over the course of the year shows that the level of excess deaths in the US remained high between peaks and never fell back to zero. This reflects an absence of lockdowns and different policies across different US states. Charles Tallack from the Health Foundation said: ""Understanding how similar countries have fared over the pandemic is a vital part of learning lessons for the future. ""Excess deaths - how many more deaths there have been than in a usual year - is generally regarded as an objective and fair way of comparing countries. ""Over the first year of the pandemic, the US comes out as the worst affected country in the G7 with deaths of up to 25% more than usual. ""The UK is not far behind in second place. Japan has fared best followed by Germany. These rankings remain the same even when we use slightly different approaches, so we're confident that they provide a fair comparison of the first year."" Other metrics,externalshowed that the US has had the fastest economic bounce-back, already having made up the lost growth in the pandemic. The US economy is forecast to grow 6.9% this year, after a fall of 3.5% last year. The UK is expected to grow a similar amount at 7.2% this year, but that is after the largest fall in the G7 in 2020 of -9.8%. Canada is also bouncing back fast, with growth forecast this year of more than 6%, after a relatively modest hit last year of 5%. There have also been marked differences within the G7 onthe rollout of vaccinations,external. The share of the population that is fully vaccinated almost exactly follows the countries most hit by the pandemic. The US has vaccinated the most, alongside the UK, followed by Italy. Japan has vaccinated the least, then Canada, with France and Germany in the middle. US overtakes UK as hardest hit by Covid deaths.

"More than 90 schools named on harassment siteWales' Education Minister said the issue was ""a priority for us here in Wales too"".Wales politics","Ofsted was told pupils were put under pressure to share sexual images of themselves More than 90 schools in Wales have been named on a website where girls have shared allegations of sexual harassment or abuse. A review of sexual abuse in schools and colleges in Englandconcluded sexual harassment had become ""normalised"" among school-age children. The Welsh Conservatives called on the Welsh government to find out the scale of the problem in schools across Wales. Education Minister Jeremy Miles said the issue was a priority. UK ministers asked English schools inspectorate Ofsted to begin a review in England after the Everyone's Invited website began publishing anonymous testimony of sexual abuse allegations in schools. It also launched a helpline run by the NSPCC. Schools in Wales are the responsibility of the Welsh government. Girls asked for nudes by 11 boys a night - Ofsted Schools abuse helpline and review launched Met investigates 'Everyone's Invited' abuse claims Laura Anne Jones, education spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives, called on ministers in Wales to act after the ""troubling references to 91 schools in Wales"" by asking its own schools watchdog to investigate. She said: ""It's vital the Welsh government now instructs Estyn to look at the prevalence of the problem in Wales, assess safeguarding policies and experiences in schools and colleges, and publish its findings. ""Schools must be a safe place for our children."" Mr Miles toldBBC Radio Cymru's Dros Giniothe issue ""is a priority for us here in Wales too"". Asked if he would commit to an inquiry by Estyn, the minister replied: ""We are looking at the best way to respond to this. ""We want to make sure we take deliberate steps to ensure this doesn't happen."" Mr Miles said the Welsh government would say more ""in due course"". This video can not be played Soma Sara from Everyone's Invited: There's still a ""huge gap"" between incidents and reporting The Ofsted report, which questioned 900 staff and pupils in 30 schools and colleges in England, found more than two-thirds of girls said they endured unwanted touching ""a lot"" or ""sometimes"", while eight in 10 said they had been put under pressure to share sexual images of themselves. The report said data on children sexually harassing or abusing other children was scarce, saying: ""It is hard to get an accurate picture of the scale and nature of sexual harassment and violence between children and young people in schools and colleges. ""Although anyone can experience sexual harassment and violence, research indicates that girls are disproportionately affected,"" the report said. ""For example, 90% of recorded offences of rape in 2018-19 of 13 to 15-year-olds were committed against girls.

Head bans school skirts 'after complaints',"The head said pupils need to wear ""appropriate workplace attire"" A head teacher has banned skirts from his school citing ""frequent"" complaints that they are ""far too revealing"". In an email to parents at St Martin's School in Caerphilly, Lee Jarvis said from September both pupils and staff must wear tailored trousers or shorts. The change proved unpopular with some parents, with one describing it as unfair and another saying the secondary school should focus on other issues. Mr Jarvis said he did not want to comment further. About 980 pupils attend the school The email to parents at the comprehensive said: ""Over the last couple of years our school community has had concerns over the length of some learners' skirts. ""Staff and learners are included in this and members of the public have frequently contacted the school to complain about what they regard as highly inappropriate and far too revealing attire for the workplace. ""Despite us attempting to educate learners as to appropriate schoolwear and issuing school badged skirts of an appropriate length we have not been effective in ensuring that learners adhere to appropriate workplace attire. ""We have therefore concluded that this item of clothing needs to be removed from our uniform policy from September and replaced by tailored shorts for hot weather or alternatively trousers. ""I felt it was prudent to write to let you know this in plenty of time before we all begin to consider purchasing new uniform for September."" One mother said: ""My daughter is not happy and doesn't want to wear tailored school trousers. ""I think it's unfair. Don't they have other things to worry about after we've all come through Covid?"" Another said: ""I disagree with this. It should be addressed per child and not penalise the whole school."" About 980 pupils attend the comprehensive and sixth form school. Campaign group Let Clothes Be Clothes said on social media: ""The skirts are school branded only, so how can they complain they're not fit for purpose? ""This head is not showing good leadership but allowing unaccountable strangers to police girls and female staff bodies and dress."" It is not the first time a school has banned skirts - in 2019, bans at bothAppleton Academy in Wyke, West Yorkshire, andStowmarket High School in Suffolkprompted criticism.

Delta variant comprises 91% of new UK cases - Hancock,"Matt Hancock says the Delta variant first identified in India now comprises 91% of new Covid cases seen in the UK His comments came as he defended his handling of the pandemic during four hours of questioning from MPs He rejects criticism from Dominic Cummings, including that he had lied to the PM about care home testing Locking down earlier than 23 March last year would have gone against the scientific advice at the time, he says Hancock says he ""bitterly regrets"" not overruling scientific guidance the virus could not be spread asymptomatically And he says he followed clinical advice on patients being released from hospitals to care homes and was told they would be tested The UK has reported more than 7,000 daily Covid cases for a second day running The latest government figures also show there were another seven deaths within 28 days of a positive test The UK's recovery from the pandemic lagged behind other big economies in the first three months of 2021 Edited by Katie Wright Today's live page posts were written by Hazel Shearing, Lauren Turner, Jo Couzens and Richard Morris. They were edited by Katie Wright and Emma Owen. Thanks for tuning in, we'll be back tomorrow. We'll shortly be wrapping up for the day. Here's what you need to know: Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said earlier that data suggests there will be a further rise in cases ""in coming weeks"" Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter According to NHS England, a record number of young people have booked
appointments for vaccines after those over 25 were invited to have their
jabs. But anti-vaccine activists are still targeting younger people online. Videos and posts promoting conspiracy theories that vaccines will cause
miscarriages or affect fertility have circulated for months, aimed at younger
women in particular. Anecdotally, weâve seen an uptick in recent days, just as younger people
have been offered a jab. Emotive content is being shared on sites like Instagram and
TikTok, as well as in Facebook groups. Several women - as well as doctors
working at vaccine centres - have messaged me with worries that these
conspiracy theories may frighten some off the jab. Weâve looked into claims about vaccines affecting periods - and
unsubstantiated claims that they could cause miscarriages - read more on thathere. Nearly one in three older adult care home workers in England has not been fully vaccinated against coronavirus, new figures from NHS England show. The latest data shows that 68.7% of eligible staff at older adult care homes had been given both doses of vaccine by 6 June. Since the vaccine programme began, 83.7% of staff have been given a first jab. In total, 95.3% of older adult care home residents have had a first jab and 90.5% have had both. Residents and staff are eligible for the vaccine if they have not had Covid-19 in the previous 28 days. And they are both in the top priority group of the vaccination programme. Meanwhile, 82.7% of residents at younger adult care homes have received both doses now. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The US was worst hit by the pandemicin the G7 big Western democracies over the first year of Covid-19, according to an updated study of excess death figures. The analysis, done for the BBC by the Health Foundation, comes on the eve of the G7 summit in Cornwall and measures deaths above expected levels for a normal year. Last year,an earlier BBC studyshowed that at that point, the UK had been hardest hit. Overall, UK outcomes are now second worst in the G7. The analysis shows that in the second half of last year in particular, US levels of excess deaths failed to drop back as much as other comparable industrialised nations. The UK's worse outcomes in the first wave, and a significant peak of deaths in December and January, still mean that overall UK outcomes were second worst, on one measure just behind the US.

One couple has been telling the BBC how that has been for them. Tommy Router, 30, and his fiancÃ©e Caroline Dorman, 29, got engaged in 2019 and were supposed to get married last summer, with a reception at his parents' garden in Hingham, Norfolk. Since last summer, the couple have spent weeks making and then changing various contingency plans for a wedding this July, plans which have seen their guest list scaled back from 130 to 100 and then 60. They are now erring on the side of caution and have decided to cut their wedding list even further to 30 guests. ""We've mentally changed our wedding plans more times than I can ever count and physically changed it more than a handful of times,"" says Tommy. Caroline, an NHS intensive care nurse working at St Thomas' Hospital in London, says: ""It feels a bit like deja vu of last year, but we obviously hope this year it actually happens."" Read more here on the effect on those planning weddings. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has reported a spike in new Covid infections for the eighth day running. The country's Covid-19 HQ recorded 11,699 new cases on 10 June - the highest such figure since 24 February. Speaking to state news agency RIA Novosti on 9 June, one of the country's top epidemiologists Alexander Gintsburg suggested the recent rise in new cases was down to socialising in the summer. ""Summer has come, there is far more interaction, people's mobility is increasing compared with the winter period which is why naturally there is an increase in incidence among those who have not been vaccinated,"" he said. Gintsburg, whose Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology developed the Sputnik V vaccine - one of Russia's three vaccines against the virus - urged the public to get vaccinated. President Vladimir Putin and senior officials have made repeated appeals to Russians about receiving a jab, but public enthusiasm has been persistently low. In February only 30% of Russians said they were willing to receive the Sputnik V jab, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey in May by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a jab ""under any circumstances"". Former prime minister Theresa May has criticised Boris Johnson's international travel restrictions, saying ""global Britain is shut for business"". Speaking in the House of Commons, she says the government had failed to act on its June 2020 promise to get internationally-agreed standard health measures in place. ""One year on, we are no further forward - indeed, what we have is a devastated industry, jobs lost and global Britain shut for business."" she says. ""More than not being any further forward, we've gone backwards."" May says that last year she went to Switzerland in August and South Korea in September - questioning why travel was possible when there was no vaccine, yet now there is a vaccine it is not. She also says the traffic light system is ""chaotic"" and that business travel is ""practically impossible"". May says the UK is ""falling behind the rest of Europe"" when it comes to making decisions on travel, adding of the government: ""It needs to decide whether it wants an airline industry and aviation sector in the UK or not, because at the rate it's going it won't have one."" Harriet AgerholmData journalist The gap between Covid-19 case rates among the old and young is growing. In Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, where cases are surging and the Delta variant has been found in high concentrations, the most recent average case rate in the under 60s is now about six times that of those aged 60 and over. During earlier waves of the pandemic, case rates among older people in hotspot areas caught up with those of younger people, but this time it looks different. Local leaders have been calling on eligible people to have their second jab, and these high rates of infection among lower priority groups could demonstrate just why having two doses is so important. Covid cases in the UK are not heading in the right direction and data suggests there will be a further rise soon, says chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency Dr Jenny Harries. ""We are progressing, probably as a country, not quite in the right direction that we would all want to,"" she told a Royal Society of Medicine webinar. ""Cases are rising, I think that is becoming clearer and modelling does suggest that we would start to see a further rise, not necessarily immediately but in coming weeks."" The latest Public Health England data shows case rates in England have risen in almost every age group, with the highest rise among people in their 20s. Dr Harries said older people were not getting ill because they have had two jabs, while those in hospital have either only had one dose or are unvaccinated. She said the virus is ""not going to go away"", with factors including a possible drop in vaccine effectiveness against new variants and a ""large reservoir"" of people who can transmit it. And more from the UK's daily figures - 176,559 more people had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine yesterday, with 316,258 having a second dose. In total, 40,886,878 have now had their first jab and of them, 28,857,102 have had both doses - that's 54.8% of the UK's adult population. In the last seven days, there have been 44,008 new positive coronavirus tests in the UK. That's a rise of 17,036 - or 63.2% - from the previous week. And there have been 55 deaths in the past seven days, a rise of one - or 1.9% - from the week before.  There have been 7,393 new daily cases of coronavirus reported in the UK,according to the latest figures.,external That's the second day running cases have topped 7,000 - prior to this that number was last surpassed in late February. In addition, there have been seven more deaths reported of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. The gap between the first and second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine isto be cut in Northern Ireland. There is currently a gap of 10-12 weeks between the two doses of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines. It is now being reduced to a maximum of eight weeks, the Department of Health has said. It's intended to offer better protection against the Delta variant, first detected in India, which is more transmissible. The first dose is thought to be 30% effective against it, while this increases to about 80% following a second dose. Hancock, centre with his back to the camera, giving evidence earlier Labour's shadow social care minister Liz Kendall says evidence from Matt Hancock at the science and health committees was ""at best disingenuous"". She says: ""He selectively used briefings, evidence and clinical advice to defend his record instead of admitting his abject failure to protect care homes in the pandemic. ""Even Matt Hancock knows he now categorically failed to put a protective ring around care homes. ""He has now used multiple excuses for failing to test those discharged to care homes, and family members who have lost loved ones will be frustrated and deeply upset that they still do not have the truth from the Secretary of State today.""

Thousands were due to fly to the capital Baku this week for the start of the tournament, which has been delayed by a year because of the pandemic. Wales play Switzerland in Baku on Saturday, Turkey on Wednesday, and the Italians in Rome the following Sunday. Azerbaijan and Italy are on the UK andWelsh governments' amber lists,external, meaning you should not travel there. First Minister Mark Drakeford and the Football Association of Wales havecalled on fans not to go to the matches. Before returning to Wales, they will need to take a PCR test, and thenquarantine at home for 10 days,external. Read the full storyhere. Ben WrightBBC political correspondent Regrets? Matt Hancock has a few. Such as not challenging the assumption within Whitehall early last year that the public wouldn't tolerate a lockdown to contain Covid. He ""bitterly regretted"" that he had not overruled scientific advice at the start of the pandemic that assumed coronavirus could not be transmitted asymptomatically. Mr Hancock said the death rate in care homes ""weighed heavily"" on him. But over four and half hours the health secretary defended the government's actions on several fronts - from PPE provision to care homes - making claims that will be scrutinised further. Dominic Cummings sat in the same chair two weeks ago and heaped scorn on blame on his former colleagues (most venomously on Mr Hancock). In contrast, the health secretary said ministers and officials largely did their best in unprecedented circumstances. Mr Hancock strenuously avoided mentioning Mr Cummings by name but swatted away his allegations when they were put to him by MPs. While assiduously praising those he worked with Matt Hancock also gave the impression that what the crisis really needed was more Matt Hancock. After having his name trashed by Mr Cummings a fortnight ago this was quite a bounce back. Matt Hancock ended his evidence saying the government was now better prepared to handle another pandemic. It had better be because Mr Hancock's testimony added to the picture of a government stunned, sometimes inert and often overwhelmed as the Covid crisis engulfed it at the start of last year. In a bid to boost vaccination numbers, officials in the US state of Washington are allowing marijuana retailers to host their own vaccine clinics and to offer a single, pre-rolled cannabis cigarette to anyone aged over 21 who gets their jab there. The scheme, announced on Monday, is the latest of many vaccine incentives being offered in the west coast state, including free pints of beer, sports tickets and prize money. Back in 2012, Washington and Colorado became the first states to legalise the adult use of cannabis, and regulated sales began two years later. It's been a major source of tax revenue for Washington state, bringing in over $395m (Â£280m) in 2019. Unlike purveyors of alcohol, cannabis retailers are being given tax breaks on the joints they give away. But the high-minded scheme is set to expire 12 July â meaning many customers will be unable to return for a second dose. Many businesses also face legal hurdles since their industry is still illegal at a federal level. Daniela Bernhard, the co-owner of Uncle Ikeâs cannabis store in Seattle, told AP news agency that their efforts to host a vaccine clinic had been rejected by two healthcare providers. A spokesperson for Spokane Regional Health District, a local public health agency, also told AP that they wouldn't be able to provide marijuana businesses with any vaccines because of concerns that it would jeopardise their own federal funding. Ms Bernhard said she was âdisappointed that our legal and heavily regulated sector continues to be treated differently than our peer sectorsâ. âIf we are trusting adults driving with their vaccination cards to get a pint of beer and then responsibly get to their next destination, we can also trust that adults will pick up a joint and enjoy it later in a legal setting,â she added. The National Covid Memorial Wall in London A campaign group for families bereaved by Covid-19 has said Matt Hancock's evidence to MPs shows ""he blames everyone but himself and the government for the handling of the pandemic"". In a statement posted to Twitter, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said: ""Scientists, the public and advisers are all seemingly at fault according to a minister who suggested he was continually unaware of important details. ""Even when directly challenged to agree that the first lockdown came too late he shirked the opportunity to show humility, instead choosing to speak on something else while not denying what we all know - the late lockdown cost lives. ""Hundreds of thousands of bereaved families will have felt a shudder as Matt Hancock stated 'sometimes you have to put yourself in jeopardy'. ""The truth is it was our loved ones who were placed in jeopardy and they paid for it with their lives."" They urged Hancock to meet with bereaved families so he could be ""better informed"" of the challenges they have faced. Ministers at Stormont have agreed an indicative date of 21 June for live music and theatre to resume across venues in NI. But this still has to be rubber-stamped by the executive next week, in line with health advice. Many venues have been closed to audiences since March 2020. The executive is also understood to have agreed to proposals to raise limits on social contact with others at home from that date. It would allow 10 people from two households to meet indoors from that date. Currently only six people from two households can meet inside a home. The number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a private garden could rise to 15 from any number of households on that date. 21 June has also been agreed as an indicative date for lifting the cap of 500 people at outdoor gatherings, instead replacing it with numbers by risk assessment. The changes could mean the return of some larger concerts, sporting events and festivals this summer. Ahead of the executive meeting, Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said he would ""encourage the executive to do the right thing"" and allow the return of live music. ""Northern Ireland is known for its rich fabric of talented musicians. These musicians, and the venues which host them, feel left behind,"" he said. Read more. Â© 2025 BBC.

Biden and Johnson meet ahead of G7 Summit,"US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have held talks, on the eve of the G7 Summit in Cornwall It is the first time the two leaders have met face to face President Biden announced the US will donate half a billion coronavirus vaccine doses to over 90 of the world's poorest countries The leaders discussed transatlantic travel and a new ""Atlantic Charter"" aimed at refreshing the so-called ""special relationship"" It's understood the president also told Boris Johnson the EU-UK row over post-Brexit trading in Northern Ireland must not affect the peace process The G7 leader's summit will begin on Friday and will focus on global coronavirus vaccinations and climate change The UK is Mr Biden's first stop on an eight-day trip to Europe. He will meet the Queen at Windsor Castle on Sunday Edited by Johanna Howitt US President Jo Biden and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson greet each other in Cornwall We're going to pause our coverage of today's events in Cornwall. The team on board with you today were Lucy Webster, Jack Hunter, and Sinead Wilson. We'll be back tomorrow with full coverage of the main summit. Thanks for following along with us. Good night. Reality Check President Biden's announcement that the US will donate half a billion
vaccines to help the fight against coronavirus seems like a huge figure. It will involve giving away 200 million Pfizer-BioNTech jabs this year, and another 300 million by June 2022 to
be used by poorer countries. But is that enough to make a
difference? The scale of the task is
enormous, and the Covax vaccine-sharing programme for poorer countries
is facing severe shortages. It aims to distribute
1.8 billion doses globally by early next year, so the US donation will help. But experts believe that the
US vaccines, and smaller commitments made by other countries, still fall far short
of whatâs needed. Read more in our Reality Check piece here. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The summit - accompanied by the image of the two leaders' wives barefoot in the sand - is a shift, the start of something new after a terrible year. Johnson and Biden have talked with conviction about shared values. But that doesn't mask the areas where they might disagree. The Americans are very unhappy about the situation in Northern Ireland, where Brexit is creating problems for the peace process. A new respectful relationship is easy to promise, but it's up to these leaders to convincingly create. The US president has announced plans to donate half a billion Pfizer vaccine doses to over 90 of the world's poorest countries. President Joe Biden said the US ""knows first hand the tragedies of this pandemic - we've had more people die in the United States than anywhere in the world"". ""We know the tragedy, and we also know the recovery"" he said. ""This is about our responsibility, our humanitarian obligation to save as many lives as we can"", he added. Biden said he discussed with UK Prime Minster Boris Johnson how together the two nations can ""lead the global effort against Covid-19"" He said the pandemic had been a ""major focus"" for the UK's presidency of the G7 to ""focus and coordinate resources to help vaccinate the world"". Biden said US values ""call on us to do everything we can to vaccinate the world against Covid-19. ""It's also in America's self interest - as long as the virus rages elsewhere there is a risk of new mutations that could threaten our people"", he added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden will be joined in Cornwall tomorrow by the rest of the G7 leaders for the  start of the official summit. Along with President Biden, Italyâs Mario Draghi, and Japanâs Yoshihide Suga will attend the gathering for the first time. Canadaâs Justin Trudeau is flying in as will Emmanuel Macron, the French president, Germanyâs chancellor, Angela Merkel, and EU President Ursula von der Leyen. Guest invitations have also been extended to Australiaâs
Scott Morrison, Indiaâs Nehendra Modi, South Koreaâs Moon Jae-in and South
Africaâs Cyril Ramaphosa. This video can not be played G7: Boris Johnson on talks with Joe Biden Boris Johnson has said the UK-US relationship is a ""massive strategic importance"" for the security of the world. The UK prime minister has said there is âso muchâ the US presidential team want to do together with the UK, including security, Nato and climate change. Johnson says talks with US President Joe Biden were âgreat, they went on for a long timeâ. The prime minister has said that there is ""complete
harmony"" on the need to find solutions to the Northern Ireland protocol. Asked if President Biden ""urged"" him to solve the
problems that have been raised in Brexit talks with the EU, Boris Johnson said: ""No, he
didn't, but what I can say is that America - the US, Washington, the UK, plus
the EU have one thing we absolutely all want to do and that is to uphold the
Belfast Good Friday Agreement and make sure we keep the balance of the peace
process going."" Johnson said this was ""absolutely common ground"". The prime minister added: ""There is complete harmony on
the need to keep going, find solutions and make sure we uphold the Belfast Good
Friday Agreement."" James LandaleDeputy political editor The two leaders were all smiles and warm words, saying they
were thrilled to meet each other. The president said he and the prime minister
had something in common, namely that theyâd both married way above their
stations. Mr Johnson replied he was not going to disagree with Mr Biden on that
or indeed anything else. And that is indeed likely on some of the issues before
them including the pandemic, climate change and global security. They both also
signed a new updated version of the Atlantic Charter to encourage greater
cooperation between their countries. Where there is friction is on trade across
the Irish sea where the President has made it clear that he does not want the
UK-EU row over the Northern Ireland Protocol to imperil the stability provided
by the Good Friday Agreement. This video can not be played Boris Johnson 'won't disagree with Joe Biden on anything' The UK Prime Minister has said he is ""not going to disagree with his US counterpart on anything"" ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall. He was responding to the US President's joke that they both married ""way above their station"". Talks between the two leaders may be overshadowed by discussions between the UK and the EU about the Northern Ireland Protocol. It's understood the US President will warn Johnson not to let Brexit put the Good Friday Agreement at risk. Top EU official Maros Sefcovic has said the UK must start checking goods entering Northern Ireland, as agreed in the 2019 Brexit ""divorce"" settlement. But the UK says it is ready to ignore the rules to prevent further disruption - sparking threats of EU retaliation. Last yearâs G7 summit should have taken place in the US - but it was called off because
of the pandemic. The leaders met over video instead. This year, all the leaders and their delegations have been subject
to a strict testing regime. Cornwall Council's Director of Public Health, Rachel Wigglesworth has said: âCornwall Councilâs Public Health team is working very closely with the Cabinet Office, Devon & Cornwall Police, Public Health England (PHE) and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to make the summit as safe as possible.â All attendees had to have a negative Covid test before arriving for the summit. They are also taking daily lateral flow tests. Anyone who tests positive or develops Covid symptoms will have to self-isolate and take a more sensitive PCR tests to confirm the result. If the PCR test is positive, they must continue to self-isolate. If not, they can return to the summit. Last month,the entire Indian delegation had to self-isolatewhen ministers from the attending countries met for preparatory talks. The Queen will meet US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden at Windsor Castle on Sunday, at the end of Mr Biden's visit to Britain. Mr Biden will be the 12th serving US president the Queen has met as monarch. The Queen, 95, first met a serving US president, Harry S Truman, as Princess Elizabeth in 1951. She has since met all elected US leaders during her 69 years on the throne, except for Lyndon B Johnson. Read more here. The Queen met her first serving US president as monarch, Dwight D Eisenhower, at the White House in October 1957 Jill Biden and Carrie Johnson took a bare foot stroll on beach with  Wilfred As his daddy discusses climate change, Covid and Brexit with the US president, one year old Wilfred Johnson has been spotted on the beach with his mother and the First Lady. Boris and Carrie Johnson's son was born just days after the prime minister was discharged from hospital last year after his own brush with coronavirus. We'll be watching to see if Wilfred makes his own waves this weekend, and charms the G7 leaders at their beachside summit. Prince Charles cycling at his home Highgrove House, Tetbury, on Thursday While President Biden and Prime Minister Boris Johnson are meeting in Cornwall, Prince Charles is currently hosting executives from some of the world's biggest companies at St James's Palace to urge them to work with governments to tackle climate change. The prince is meeting the bosses of Bank of America,
AstraZeneca, HSBC, NatWest and Heathrow Airport among others at St James's Palace. Also joining the meeting are John Kerry, the US climate envoy, and Britain's COP26 President Alok Sharma. âWe have a potentially game changing opportunity to drive forward the partnerships between government, business and private-sector finance that are absolutely vital if we are to win the battle to combat climate change and biodiversity loss,"" the prince said. ""Unless we deploy private-sector resource, innovation and finance more effectively, we just donât stand a chance.â President and Biden and Boris Johnson have been looking at historical documents and artefacts relating to the Atlantic Charter - the 1941 joint statement made by Winston Churchill and  Franklin D. Roosevelt setting out their goals for the post-war world. Eighty years on, the two leaders are expected to agree a new one, pledging to work together to solve global challenges such as the coronavirus pandemic and climate change. The new charter will outline eight areas of co-operation  including defending democracy, reaffirming the importance of collective security, and building a fair and sustainable global trading system. James LandaleDeputy political editor While some of the discussions between President Biden and Boris  Johnson will be about the impact of Brexit in Northern Ireland, it certainly won't be the main topic. The agenda for the summit and their own bilateral discussions  is much, much bigger than that. The diplomats around the president have made clear he has not come here to lecture the prime minister, but he will make clear his very, very  deeply held view that nothing should threaten the peace process in Northern Ireland. That point will be made but I don't think the issue will be resolved. Neither side will let this issue dominate their talks because they have much bigger fish to fry when it comes to Covid and co-operation about vaccines, climate change, making western democracies more resilient against threats from autocracies.

The team on board with you today were Lucy Webster, Jack Hunter, and Sinead Wilson. We'll be back tomorrow with full coverage of the main summit. Thanks for following along with us. Good night. Reality Check President Biden's announcement that the US will donate half a billion
vaccines to help the fight against coronavirus seems like a huge figure. It will involve giving away 200 million Pfizer-BioNTech jabs this year, and another 300 million by June 2022 to
be used by poorer countries. But is that enough to make a
difference? The scale of the task is
enormous, and the Covax vaccine-sharing programme for poorer countries
is facing severe shortages. It aims to distribute
1.8 billion doses globally by early next year, so the US donation will help. But experts believe that the
US vaccines, and smaller commitments made by other countries, still fall far short
of whatâs needed. Read more in our Reality Check piece here. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The summit - accompanied by the image of the two leaders' wives barefoot in the sand - is a shift, the start of something new after a terrible year. Johnson and Biden have talked with conviction about shared values. But that doesn't mask the areas where they might disagree. The Americans are very unhappy about the situation in Northern Ireland, where Brexit is creating problems for the peace process. A new respectful relationship is easy to promise, but it's up to these leaders to convincingly create. The US president has announced plans to donate half a billion Pfizer vaccine doses to over 90 of the world's poorest countries. President Joe Biden said the US ""knows first hand the tragedies of this pandemic - we've had more people die in the United States than anywhere in the world"". ""We know the tragedy, and we also know the recovery"" he said. ""This is about our responsibility, our humanitarian obligation to save as many lives as we can"", he added. Biden said he discussed with UK Prime Minster Boris Johnson how together the two nations can ""lead the global effort against Covid-19"" He said the pandemic had been a ""major focus"" for the UK's presidency of the G7 to ""focus and coordinate resources to help vaccinate the world"". Biden said US values ""call on us to do everything we can to vaccinate the world against Covid-19. ""It's also in America's self interest - as long as the virus rages elsewhere there is a risk of new mutations that could threaten our people"", he added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden will be joined in Cornwall tomorrow by the rest of the G7 leaders for the  start of the official summit. Along with President Biden, Italyâs Mario Draghi, and Japanâs Yoshihide Suga will attend the gathering for the first time. Canadaâs Justin Trudeau is flying in as will Emmanuel Macron, the French president, Germanyâs chancellor, Angela Merkel, and EU President Ursula von der Leyen. Guest invitations have also been extended to Australiaâs
Scott Morrison, Indiaâs Nehendra Modi, South Koreaâs Moon Jae-in and South
Africaâs Cyril Ramaphosa. This video can not be played G7: Boris Johnson on talks with Joe Biden Boris Johnson has said the UK-US relationship is a ""massive strategic importance"" for the security of the world. The UK prime minister has said there is âso muchâ the US presidential team want to do together with the UK, including security, Nato and climate change. Johnson says talks with US President Joe Biden were âgreat, they went on for a long timeâ. The prime minister has said that there is ""complete
harmony"" on the need to find solutions to the Northern Ireland protocol. Asked if President Biden ""urged"" him to solve the
problems that have been raised in Brexit talks with the EU, Boris Johnson said: ""No, he
didn't, but what I can say is that America - the US, Washington, the UK, plus
the EU have one thing we absolutely all want to do and that is to uphold the
Belfast Good Friday Agreement and make sure we keep the balance of the peace
process going."" Johnson said this was ""absolutely common ground"". The prime minister added: ""There is complete harmony on
the need to keep going, find solutions and make sure we uphold the Belfast Good
Friday Agreement."" James LandaleDeputy political editor The two leaders were all smiles and warm words, saying they
were thrilled to meet each other. The president said he and the prime minister
had something in common, namely that theyâd both married way above their
stations. Mr Johnson replied he was not going to disagree with Mr Biden on that
or indeed anything else. And that is indeed likely on some of the issues before
them including the pandemic, climate change and global security. They both also
signed a new updated version of the Atlantic Charter to encourage greater
cooperation between their countries. Where there is friction is on trade across
the Irish sea where the President has made it clear that he does not want the
UK-EU row over the Northern Ireland Protocol to imperil the stability provided
by the Good Friday Agreement. This video can not be played Boris Johnson 'won't disagree with Joe Biden on anything' The UK Prime Minister has said he is ""not going to disagree with his US counterpart on anything"" ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall. He was responding to the US President's joke that they both married ""way above their station"". Talks between the two leaders may be overshadowed by discussions between the UK and the EU about the Northern Ireland Protocol. It's understood the US President will warn Johnson not to let Brexit put the Good Friday Agreement at risk. Top EU official Maros Sefcovic has said the UK must start checking goods entering Northern Ireland, as agreed in the 2019 Brexit ""divorce"" settlement. But the UK says it is ready to ignore the rules to prevent further disruption - sparking threats of EU retaliation. Last yearâs G7 summit should have taken place in the US - but it was called off because
of the pandemic. The leaders met over video instead. This year, all the leaders and their delegations have been subject
to a strict testing regime. Cornwall Council's Director of Public Health, Rachel Wigglesworth has said: âCornwall Councilâs Public Health team is working very closely with the Cabinet Office, Devon & Cornwall Police, Public Health England (PHE) and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to make the summit as safe as possible.â All attendees had to have a negative Covid test before arriving for the summit. They are also taking daily lateral flow tests. Anyone who tests positive or develops Covid symptoms will have to self-isolate and take a more sensitive PCR tests to confirm the result. If the PCR test is positive, they must continue to self-isolate. If not, they can return to the summit. Last month,the entire Indian delegation had to self-isolatewhen ministers from the attending countries met for preparatory talks. The Queen will meet US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden at Windsor Castle on Sunday, at the end of Mr Biden's visit to Britain. Mr Biden will be the 12th serving US president the Queen has met as monarch. The Queen, 95, first met a serving US president, Harry S Truman, as Princess Elizabeth in 1951. She has since met all elected US leaders during her 69 years on the throne, except for Lyndon B Johnson. Read more here. The Queen met her first serving US president as monarch, Dwight D Eisenhower, at the White House in October 1957 Jill Biden and Carrie Johnson took a bare foot stroll on beach with  Wilfred As his daddy discusses climate change, Covid and Brexit with the US president, one year old Wilfred Johnson has been spotted on the beach with his mother and the First Lady. Boris and Carrie Johnson's son was born just days after the prime minister was discharged from hospital last year after his own brush with coronavirus. We'll be watching to see if Wilfred makes his own waves this weekend, and charms the G7 leaders at their beachside summit. Prince Charles cycling at his home Highgrove House, Tetbury, on Thursday While President Biden and Prime Minister Boris Johnson are meeting in Cornwall, Prince Charles is currently hosting executives from some of the world's biggest companies at St James's Palace to urge them to work with governments to tackle climate change. The prince is meeting the bosses of Bank of America,
AstraZeneca, HSBC, NatWest and Heathrow Airport among others at St James's Palace. Also joining the meeting are John Kerry, the US climate envoy, and Britain's COP26 President Alok Sharma. âWe have a potentially game changing opportunity to drive forward the partnerships between government, business and private-sector finance that are absolutely vital if we are to win the battle to combat climate change and biodiversity loss,"" the prince said. ""Unless we deploy private-sector resource, innovation and finance more effectively, we just donât stand a chance.â President and Biden and Boris Johnson have been looking at historical documents and artefacts relating to the Atlantic Charter - the 1941 joint statement made by Winston Churchill and  Franklin D. Roosevelt setting out their goals for the post-war world. Eighty years on, the two leaders are expected to agree a new one, pledging to work together to solve global challenges such as the coronavirus pandemic and climate change. The new charter will outline eight areas of co-operation  including defending democracy, reaffirming the importance of collective security, and building a fair and sustainable global trading system. James LandaleDeputy political editor While some of the discussions between President Biden and Boris  Johnson will be about the impact of Brexit in Northern Ireland, it certainly won't be the main topic. The agenda for the summit and their own bilateral discussions  is much, much bigger than that. The diplomats around the president have made clear he has not come here to lecture the prime minister, but he will make clear his very, very  deeply held view that nothing should threaten the peace process in Northern Ireland. That point will be made but I don't think the issue will be resolved. Neither side will let this issue dominate their talks because they have much bigger fish to fry when it comes to Covid and co-operation about vaccines, climate change, making western democracies more resilient against threats from autocracies.

Ex-Brewdog staff allege 'culture of fear' at brewer,"Brewdog founder James Watt (right) said the brewery was 'sorry' Former staff at Brewdog have alleged a ""culture of fear"" at the beer firm with a ""toxic attitude"" to junior employees. In an open letter,external, signatories said a ""significant number"" of former staff had ""suffered mental illness as a result of working at BrewDog"". They claimed that the firm was built around a ""cult of personality"" of founders James Watt and Martin Dickie. Mr Watt said Brewdog was ""sorry"",externaland that it would not contest the letter, but ""listen, learn and act"". The Scottish brewer and pub-chain rapidly rose into the mainstream after major supermarkets started stocking it in 2008. But it has also courted controversy with its marketing and commercial decisions. The open letter, which was posted on Twitter and signed by more than 60 former staff, made a number of allegations, including a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns. It said Mr Watt and Mr Dickie had exploited publicity, ""both good and bad"" to further their own business goals and chased ""growth, at all costs"". Allow Twitter content?

Brewdog reveals plans for 'beer hotel' in Edinburgh Beer firm BrewDog toasts US investment It added: ""You spent years claiming you wanted to be the best employer in the world, presumably to help you to recruit top talent, but ask former staff what they think of those claims, and you'll most likely be laughed at. ""Being treated like a human being was sadly not always a given for those working at Brewdog."" According to the letter, toxic attitudes towards junior staff had ""trickled down"" throughout the business ""until they were simply an intrinsic part of the company"". ""Put bluntly, the single biggest shared experience of former staff is a residual feeling of fear. Fear to speak out about the atmosphere we were immersed in, and fear of repercussions even after we have left,"" it added. One of the ex-staff members who signed the letter, Christopher Baria-Lewis, told the BBC he ""felt it was important, with former colleagues, to get a message out there"". ""Their [Brewdog's] external persona doesn't align with how they operate,"" he said, adding that the letter had been organised collectively. The letter also questioned Brewdog's commitment to sustainability after ""years of vanity projects"" and use of a private jet. Along with many breweries, pubs, and other parts of the hospitality industry, Brewdog has been hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Watt said: ""At Brewdog, we are focused on building the best business we can, which is why the open letter we saw on Twitter was so upsetting, but so important. ""Our focus now is not on contradicting or contesting the details of that letter, but to listen, learn and act. ""As a fast-growing business, we have always tried to do the best by our team - we do have thousands of employees with positive stories to tell as a result."" But he said the tweet by former staff proved that ""on many occasions we haven't got it right"". ""We are committed to doing better, not just as a reaction to this, but always; and we are going to reach out to our entire team past and present to learn more. ""But most of all, right now, we are sorry."" He said it had been ""hard to hear"" the comments, but added: ""It must have been harder to say them. ""We appreciate that and we will endeavour to honour that effort and courage with the real change it deserves. We aren't going to make excuses, we're going to take action."" Brewdog started out in 2007, being passionate about craft beer and contemptuous of rival big brewers. It's become at least as passionate about growth, by unconventional ""punk"" means. So far, there is a big brewery in Aberdeenshire, plus others in Berlin, Brisbane and Columbus, Ohio. There are more than 100 Brewdog bars, dotted across the world map. And a new project is beer-themed hotels, in Ohio, Manchester and Edinburgh. This has been funded through the sale of a big chunk of the business to private equity and several rounds of crowdfunding. The AGM in Aberdeen has become something of a party. But it seems the combined publicity-thirsty passion for beer and growth has been bruising. Every employer has disgruntled ex-employees. Usually, once dispersed, they moan into their beer. But in this case, these ex-staff signatories have taken their passion for beer and applied it to improving working conditions in their industry. Co-founder James Watt concedes he didn't always ""get things right"".  He dispensed with the usual combative defiance. His response is chastened, recognising that the accusations could be damaging to the brand and to recruitment. He has become very successful by inviting drinkers to buy into products infused with the passion of beer people. So this runs counter to the values of clubby comradeship. Repairing the damage will take more nuance than Brewdog usually deploys.

LiveLiveBiden and Johnson to meet ahead of G7 Summit3 minutes ago,"US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Boris Johnson have held talks, on the eve of the G7 Summit in Cornwall It is the first time the two leaders have met face to face President Biden announced the US will donate half a billion coronavirus vaccine doses to over 90 of the world's poorest countries The leaders discussed transatlantic travel and a new ""Atlantic Charter"" aimed at refreshing the so-called ""special relationship"" It's understood the president also told Boris Johnson the EU-UK row over post-Brexit trading in Northern Ireland must not affect the peace process The G7 leader's summit will begin on Friday and will focus on global coronavirus vaccinations and climate change The UK is Mr Biden's first stop on an eight-day trip to Europe. He will meet the Queen at Windsor Castle on Sunday Edited by Johanna Howitt US President Jo Biden and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson greet each other in Cornwall We're going to pause our coverage of today's events in Cornwall. The team on board with you today were Lucy Webster, Jack Hunter, and Sinead Wilson. We'll be back tomorrow with full coverage of the main summit. Thanks for following along with us. Good night. Reality Check President Biden's announcement that the US will donate half a billion
vaccines to help the fight against coronavirus seems like a huge figure. It will involve giving away 200 million Pfizer-BioNTech jabs this year, and another 300 million by June 2022 to
be used by poorer countries. But is that enough to make a
difference? The scale of the task is
enormous, and the Covax vaccine-sharing programme for poorer countries
is facing severe shortages. It aims to distribute
1.8 billion doses globally by early next year, so the US donation will help. But experts believe that the
US vaccines, and smaller commitments made by other countries, still fall far short
of whatâs needed. Read more in our Reality Check piece here. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor The summit - accompanied by the image of the two leaders' wives barefoot in the sand - is a shift, the start of something new after a terrible year. Johnson and Biden have talked with conviction about shared values. But that doesn't mask the areas where they might disagree. The Americans are very unhappy about the situation in Northern Ireland, where Brexit is creating problems for the peace process. A new respectful relationship is easy to promise, but it's up to these leaders to convincingly create. The US president has announced plans to donate half a billion Pfizer vaccine doses to over 90 of the world's poorest countries. President Joe Biden said the US ""knows first hand the tragedies of this pandemic - we've had more people die in the United States than anywhere in the world"". ""We know the tragedy, and we also know the recovery"" he said. ""This is about our responsibility, our humanitarian obligation to save as many lives as we can"", he added. Biden said he discussed with UK Prime Minster Boris Johnson how together the two nations can ""lead the global effort against Covid-19"" He said the pandemic had been a ""major focus"" for the UK's presidency of the G7 to ""focus and coordinate resources to help vaccinate the world"". Biden said US values ""call on us to do everything we can to vaccinate the world against Covid-19. ""It's also in America's self interest - as long as the virus rages elsewhere there is a risk of new mutations that could threaten our people"", he added. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden will be joined in Cornwall tomorrow by the rest of the G7 leaders for the  start of the official summit. Along with President Biden, Italyâs Mario Draghi, and Japanâs Yoshihide Suga will attend the gathering for the first time. Canadaâs Justin Trudeau is flying in as will Emmanuel Macron, the French president, Germanyâs chancellor, Angela Merkel, and EU President Ursula von der Leyen. Guest invitations have also been extended to Australiaâs
Scott Morrison, Indiaâs Nehendra Modi, South Koreaâs Moon Jae-in and South
Africaâs Cyril Ramaphosa. This video can not be played G7: Boris Johnson on talks with Joe Biden Boris Johnson has said the UK-US relationship is a ""massive strategic importance"" for the security of the world. The UK prime minister has said there is âso muchâ the US presidential team want to do together with the UK, including security, Nato and climate change. Johnson says talks with US President Joe Biden were âgreat, they went on for a long timeâ. The prime minister has said that there is ""complete
harmony"" on the need to find solutions to the Northern Ireland protocol. Asked if President Biden ""urged"" him to solve the
problems that have been raised in Brexit talks with the EU, Boris Johnson said: ""No, he
didn't, but what I can say is that America - the US, Washington, the UK, plus
the EU have one thing we absolutely all want to do and that is to uphold the
Belfast Good Friday Agreement and make sure we keep the balance of the peace
process going."" Johnson said this was ""absolutely common ground"". The prime minister added: ""There is complete harmony on
the need to keep going, find solutions and make sure we uphold the Belfast Good
Friday Agreement."" James LandaleDeputy political editor The two leaders were all smiles and warm words, saying they
were thrilled to meet each other. The president said he and the prime minister
had something in common, namely that theyâd both married way above their
stations. Mr Johnson replied he was not going to disagree with Mr Biden on that
or indeed anything else. And that is indeed likely on some of the issues before
them including the pandemic, climate change and global security. They both also
signed a new updated version of the Atlantic Charter to encourage greater
cooperation between their countries. Where there is friction is on trade across
the Irish sea where the President has made it clear that he does not want the
UK-EU row over the Northern Ireland Protocol to imperil the stability provided
by the Good Friday Agreement. This video can not be played Boris Johnson 'won't disagree with Joe Biden on anything' The UK Prime Minister has said he is ""not going to disagree with his US counterpart on anything"" ahead of the G7 summit in Cornwall. He was responding to the US President's joke that they both married ""way above their station"". Talks between the two leaders may be overshadowed by discussions between the UK and the EU about the Northern Ireland Protocol. It's understood the US President will warn Johnson not to let Brexit put the Good Friday Agreement at risk. Top EU official Maros Sefcovic has said the UK must start checking goods entering Northern Ireland, as agreed in the 2019 Brexit ""divorce"" settlement. But the UK says it is ready to ignore the rules to prevent further disruption - sparking threats of EU retaliation. Last yearâs G7 summit should have taken place in the US - but it was called off because
of the pandemic. The leaders met over video instead. This year, all the leaders and their delegations have been subject
to a strict testing regime. Cornwall Council's Director of Public Health, Rachel Wigglesworth has said: âCornwall Councilâs Public Health team is working very closely with the Cabinet Office, Devon & Cornwall Police, Public Health England (PHE) and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) to make the summit as safe as possible.â All attendees had to have a negative Covid test before arriving for the summit. They are also taking daily lateral flow tests. Anyone who tests positive or develops Covid symptoms will have to self-isolate and take a more sensitive PCR tests to confirm the result. If the PCR test is positive, they must continue to self-isolate. If not, they can return to the summit. Last month,the entire Indian delegation had to self-isolatewhen ministers from the attending countries met for preparatory talks. The Queen will meet US President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden at Windsor Castle on Sunday, at the end of Mr Biden's visit to Britain. Mr Biden will be the 12th serving US president the Queen has met as monarch. The Queen, 95, first met a serving US president, Harry S Truman, as Princess Elizabeth in 1951. She has since met all elected US leaders during her 69 years on the throne, except for Lyndon B Johnson. Read more here. The Queen met her first serving US president as monarch, Dwight D Eisenhower, at the White House in October 1957 Jill Biden and Carrie Johnson took a bare foot stroll on beach with  Wilfred As his daddy discusses climate change, Covid and Brexit with the US president, one year old Wilfred Johnson has been spotted on the beach with his mother and the First Lady. Boris and Carrie Johnson's son was born just days after the prime minister was discharged from hospital last year after his own brush with coronavirus. We'll be watching to see if Wilfred makes his own waves this weekend, and charms the G7 leaders at their beachside summit. Prince Charles cycling at his home Highgrove House, Tetbury, on Thursday While President Biden and Prime Minister Boris Johnson are meeting in Cornwall, Prince Charles is currently hosting executives from some of the world's biggest companies at St James's Palace to urge them to work with governments to tackle climate change. The prince is meeting the bosses of Bank of America,
AstraZeneca, HSBC, NatWest and Heathrow Airport among others at St James's Palace. Also joining the meeting are John Kerry, the US climate envoy, and Britain's COP26 President Alok Sharma. âWe have a potentially game changing opportunity to drive forward the partnerships between government, business and private-sector finance that are absolutely vital if we are to win the battle to combat climate change and biodiversity loss,"" the prince said. ""Unless we deploy private-sector resource, innovation and finance more effectively, we just donât stand a chance.â President and Biden and Boris Johnson have been looking at historical documents and artefacts relating to the Atlantic Charter - the 1941 joint statement made by Winston Churchill and  Franklin D. Roosevelt setting out their goals for the post-war world. Eighty years on, the two leaders are expected to agree a new one, pledging to work together to solve global challenges such as the coronavirus pandemic and climate change. The new charter will outline eight areas of co-operation  including defending democracy, reaffirming the importance of collective security, and building a fair and sustainable global trading system. James LandaleDeputy political editor While some of the discussions between President Biden and Boris  Johnson will be about the impact of Brexit in Northern Ireland, it certainly won't be the main topic. The agenda for the summit and their own bilateral discussions  is much, much bigger than that. The diplomats around the president have made clear he has not come here to lecture the prime minister, but he will make clear his very, very  deeply held view that nothing should threaten the peace process in Northern Ireland. That point will be made but I don't think the issue will be resolved. Neither side will let this issue dominate their talks because they have much bigger fish to fry when it comes to Covid and co-operation about vaccines, climate change, making western democracies more resilient against threats from autocracies. As the Bidens and Johnsons stepped out for the photo call, they briefly turned their backs to the cameras to look out at the Cornish bay. Eagle eyes will have spotted First Lady Jill Biden was wearing a jacket with lettering that spelled out 'love'. A senior White House reporter for Bloomberg who is travelling with the US media delegation hastweeted,externalshe asked 'Flotus' what her ""love message meant"", and Mrs Biden replied: âI think that this is a global conference and we're trying to bring unity across the globe and I think that's important right now that you have a sense of unity.â As the PM and the president emerged from the hotel with their wives, President Biden was heard praising the stunning backdrop for the summit in Carbis Bay in Cornwall. ""It's gorgeous, I don't want to go home"", he says. And to shouts from the hordes of journalists and photographers he said he is ""very pleased to be here"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson and US President Joe Biden are meeting ahead of the G7 summit. They paused for a slightly chaotic call with the media before heading in to a private room for official talks. As the cameras clicked the president was heard to say: ""It was a pleasure to meet your wife. I told the prime minister we have something in common - we both married way above our station.""â Johnson replied: ""I am not going to dissent from that."" Biden added it was a ""great pleasure"" to be in the UK. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, his wife Carrie Johnson and US President Joe Biden with First Lady Jill Biden walk outside Carbis Bay Hotel in Cornwall. US President Joe Biden comes to Cornwall with an array of vehicles and aircraft to help him get around. Most iconic is the presidential plane - Air Force One - that touched down at RAF Mildenhall in Suffolk on Wednesday evening. The two specially adapted Boeing 747-200B series aircraft have many advanced technologies, including protection against electromagnetic pulses and flares to throw off heat-seeking missiles.  For short trips in the air, the president uses helicopters - recognisable by their predominantly green body and white top. Marine One usually refers to a VH-3D Sea King or a VH-60N White Hawk. Decoy versions of Marine One often fly alongside the president's helicopter.  Once on the ground, President Biden transfers from Air Force One or Marine One to Cadillac One - nicknamed The Beast. It weighs about nine tonnes (20,000lb), and has an armour-plated body and bulletproof windows. Read more: The Beast: How Biden's getting around on his first overseas trip,external Â© 2025 BBC.

Biden to warn PM not to risk NI peace over BrexitThe US President and Boris Johnson will have their first face-to-face meeting on the eve of the G7.,"Mr Biden said he was ""thrilled"" to be in Cornwall US President Joe Biden will tell PM Boris Johnson not to let the row over post-Brexit trading in Northern Ireland affect the peace process. The two leaders are having their first face-to-face talks in Cornwall on the eve of the G7 summit. Mr Biden will stress the need to ""stand behind"" the Northern Ireland protocol. They will also discuss transatlantic travel and a new ""Atlantic Charter"" aimed at refreshing the relationship between the UK and US. Follow live: Biden and Johnson meet ahead of G7 Don't imperil NI peace, Biden to warn UK and EU EU says patience wearing thin in UK trade war talks How does the Biden-Johnson relationship stack up? The US President is on his first overseas visit since being elected and the G7 summit is the first time world leaders have all gathered in person since the pandemic began. The rollout of the coronavirus vaccination programme and climate change are high on their agenda. But the ongoing dispute between the UK and the EU over regulatory checks on goods going into Northern Ireland from Great Britain is also likely to feature heavily in diplomatic discussions in the coming days. President Biden has a close interest in Ireland, given his ancestral roots, and had warned that theGood Friday Agreementmust not be jeopardised by rows over trade. The US was closely involved in drawing up the agreement - with American senator George Mitchell chairing the talks which led to the peace deal. Business and political leaders in Northern Ireland have warned that the trade dispute is causing political angst and instability in the run up to the marching season next month, a historical flashpoint between loyalist and nationalist communities. Northern Ireland was given special status as a result of the 2019 Brexit ""divorce"" settlement between the UK and the EU. While England, Scotland and Wales no longer follow EU rules, Northern Ireland still does, because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. In order to avoid a physical border between the two countries -  and thereby protect the peace process - it was agreed that customs checks would take place on goods entering Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK. But Unionists say this has effectively put a border down the Irish Sea instead - something they are ideologically opposed to - and business say supply chains have been complicated and disrupted. Talks on Wednesday between Brexit minister Lord Frost and the European Commission's Maros Sefcovic to try to resolve the standoff  ended without a breakthrough. Mr Sefcovic said the EU's patience was ""wearing very thin"" with the UK's attitude towards the protocol, after UK ministers said they were prepared to ignore parts of it to prevent disruption to goods like sausages and other chilled meats going to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. And in a press conference on Thursday morning, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the protocol was the ""only solution"" to prevent a hard border with the Republic and must be implemented ""completely"". From Air Force One to Beast - Biden's travel kit Why are world leaders coming to the English seaside? US overtakes UK as hardest hit by Covid deaths in G7 Mr Johnson said on Wednesday that resolving the dispute with Brussels was ""easily doable"" and ""what we want to do is make sure that we can have a solution that...protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the whole United Kingdom"". But speaking on a visit to Batley in West Yorkshire, the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said President Biden had delivered an ""an unprecedented rebuke"" to the prime minister over the unresolved situation in Northern Ireland. Sir Keir said he knew ""what it means for those communities and the way the government is going about this is undermining the peace process"", adding that the situation was also undermining the UK's relationship with the US. ""The government needs to make much more of an effort to settle this, to negotiate and get to a settlement for the people of Northern Ireland and for the world."" Leader of the DUP Edwin Poots said Mr Biden's comments were ""not well informed"" and argued that the protocol had been responsible for a rise in violence in Northern Ireland. However Irish PM Micheal Martin said the US president was urging the UK to do ""the sensible thing"" and resolve its trade issues with the EU. During their meeting in Carbis Bay,Mr Johnson and President Biden are expected to agree to set up a taskforceto make recommendations on safely resuming international travel. Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss described its creation as ""a first step towards reopening the skies"" but warned that the ""absence of a definitive timeframe"" means airlines, businesses and consumers are still in the dark. The prime minister is coming under fire for his own travel arrangements to Cornwall. Critics say taking a private jet rather than a train to the summit tarnishes his green credentials and Britain's claim to be a world leader on climate change. Mr Johnson defended his decision saying: ""If you attack my arrival by plane, I respectfully point out the UK is actually in the lead in developing sustainable aviation fuel, and one of the points in the 10 point plan of our green industrial revolution, is to get to 'jet zero' as well."" A trip to St Michael's Mount was cancelled due to the weather Organisers have been forced to change the location of the talks between the President and Mr Johnson after bad weather ruled out holding them at St Michael's Mount, a castle on a tidal island off the coast of Cornwall. Reports suggested their wives, Carrie Johnson and First Lady Jill Biden, were also due to tour the beauty spot but a No 10 source confirmed the visit was ""sadly off due to the weather"". Instead, the leaders are meeting in Carbis Bay, the location for Friday's summit.

Oxford lecturers begin boycott over Rhodes statue,"Calls to remove the memorial were reignited after the Black Lives Matter protests last year About 150 Oxford University academics are refusing to teach at one of its colleges after it decided to keep its controversial statue of Cecil Rhodes. For years campaigners have been calling for the statue at Oriel College to go, saying Rhodes stood for white supremacy and racism. But last month the college decided not to take it down for practical reasons. Now, some academics are boycotting Oriel and have signed a petition saying the statue ""glorifies colonialism"". They are refusing to give tutorials to undergraduates from Oriel or attend talks there,as first reported by the Daily Telegraph,external. The college expressed ""sadness"" at the decision, while the head of Oxford University said she was ""deeply disappointed"". A No 10 spokesman said the government would expect ""appropriate action"" to be taken if the teaching of students was disrupted by the dispute, such as providing compensation. Why is Cecil Rhodes such a controversial figure? How do you replace a fallen statue? Rhodes was a businessman and politician who played a big role in southern Africa in the 19th Century. He thought of the English as a master race, and his critics see him as the ultimate representation of colonialism and one of the people who helped pave the way for apartheid. He had been a student at Oriel, and his statue is now above a doorway of a building named after him. Oriel's governing body said last year that the majority of its members wished the statue to be removed. But after an inquiry, the college decided not to remove it due to the cost and complex planning processes. The Oxford lecturers say the college's decision not to remove the statue ""undermines us all"", and that the whole university can only work to eradicate racism if all its colleges do so. ""Faced with Oriel's stubborn attachment to a statue that glorifies colonialism and the wealth it produced for the college, we feel we have no choice but to withdraw all discretionary work and goodwill collaborations,"" a statement from the boycott organisers said. As well as refusing to tutor Oriel students, the dons will also not help the college when it interviews admissions candidates or attend talks sponsored by it. The boycott does not include work which is not discretionary, such as exams, delivering lecturers and supervising postgraduate students. The dons said the boycott was done ""with regret"" but would continue ""until Oriel makes a credible public commitment to remove the statue"". Danny Dorling, professor of geography at Oxford and one of the signatories, said: ""Having your university associated with a statue of a racist is deeply upsetting and puts a smear on the whole university."" Rhodes was controversial back in Britain even in his own lifetime But a No 10 spokesman said: ""Students rightly expect to get a good deal for their investment in higher education and we would expect universities to take appropriate action should any student be seriously affected by these actions - which could include compensation. ""We fully believe in protecting academic freedom but universities have a duty to maintain access to good-quality tuition as a priority, especially given the disruption the pandemic has caused students already."" Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was ""half tempted to say you should be lucky not to be taught by such a useless bunch"". He suggested the academics had not ""bothered to look up the history of Rhodes in any detail"", describing him as a ""figure of importance and of interest and of enormous generosity to Oxford"". ""We must not allow this wokeness to happen,"" he added. Lord Wharton, chair of the Office for Students, said: ""Oriel College took a decision to retain the Rhodes statue after carefully considering all of the evidence. ""It would be utterly unacceptable if any 'boycott' of Oriel led to students, or prospective students, at the college being disadvantaged in any way."" Universities minister Michelle Donelan said: ""We fully believe in protecting academic freedom, but universities have a duty to maintain access to good quality tuition as a priority - especially given the disruption the pandemic has caused students."" Regarding the Rhodes statue, she said universities ""make their own decisions as autonomous institutions but our position is that a retain-and-explain policy is always best"". A toppled bronze memorial to the 17th Century slave merchant Colston is on display at a museum in Bristol There have been some creative ideas of what to do with controversial statues, if they are removed. Some have suggested just leaving the space empty, whilesculptor Antony Gormley proposed,externalturning the Rhodes statue to face the wall. Robert Gildea, one of the academics to sign up to the boycott, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was a way of putting pressure on the college after alternative attempts had not worked. The professor emeritus of modern history at Oxford University said taking no action was ""not acceptable"". He added: ""If the college put up a notice explaining who Cecil Rhodes was that would be fine, if the college put a placard round his neck at lunchtime today saying 'sorry' that would also be fine."" A graffitied statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, that was toppled during a Black Lives Matter protest last year,is now on display at a museum. Any decision to remove the Rhodes statue would require listed building consent from Oxford City Council, Historic England and the secretary of state for local government. In a statement, the college said it had undertaken ""an extensive, academic and rigorous process advised by a 10-month long independent commission of inquiry"". It added: ""The commission did not make a recommendation on the removal of memorials. ""We note with sadness that some fellow academics from other colleges at Oxford University have chosen not to respect the decisions of our governing body, not least because of the commensurate impact on our students and the wider academic community at Oriel, to whom we all have a duty of care."" Prof Louise Richardson, vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford, said: ""Oxford's brilliant academics are rightly renowned for their dedication to teaching, so I am deeply disappointed that some of my colleagues would choose to punish students, and prospective students, for the actions of their college's governing body, especially after the prolonged disruption of teaching during the pandemic.""

""My landlord said: 'Look Jon, you're paying me Â£800 a month for this one bedroom apartment, and I've just found out that I can be charging people on holiday Â£1,200 a week.'"" He is one of many hospitality workers in British tourist hotspots who are finding accommodation scarce. This is as landlords want to cash in on the UK holiday boom.

Jon is the front of house manager for Red Hotels, which includes the Scarlet Hotel and the Bedruthan Hotel in Mawgan Porth, along the coast from Newquay. He moved to Cornwall to take up his job in October 2020, and, after staying in staff accommodation, in January began renting a one-bedroom flat in Newquay for Â£800 a month. But at the start of April he had a letter from the agents to tell him his landlord had decided to end the tenancy. Jon started looking for alternative places to live but says there was nowhere to rent in the Newquay area. ""If you do go for a property there are more than 30 people going for it. ""When you get to the point of being accepted they then turn round to you and say 'Well actually we've added another couple of hundred pounds to the monthly rent'. ""Or they may even ask you to pay six months rent in advance, otherwise they'll go to the next person,"" he said. The UK holiday boom is helping to force up rents in places like Newquay Jon told Radio 4'sYou and Yours:""The day that Boris Johnson announced that people could start going into self-catered accommodation, that's when everything changed.

""I'm rather lucky because I do own a boat, and I'm now living on my boat, so I can at least carry on working in Cornwall. But what does anyone else do? ""In the autumn things will calm down again and these landlords will be going cap-in-hand to people who live in the area, wanting them to rent their places over the winter again, and the test will be, how many people will turn around and say 'No'?"" With lockdown easing the hospitality sector is opening up, but there is a huge shortage of staff. UK Hospitality, the trade body that represents the industry, has estimated that there isa shortage of about 188,000 workers. Hospitality jobs are traditionally some of the lowest paid roles, and the increasing cost of finding a place to live in areas like Cornwall and the Lake District is making it harder for hotels, restaurants and bars to recruit staff. Emma Stratton says pressure on accommodation seems to be causing resentment among locals Emma Stratton owns Red Hotels. She currently has at least 20 vacancies being advertised, and she says she's struggling to find workers. ""We've had people who've accepted employment offers with us and then haven't been able to find accommodation and have had to turn the job down,"" she said. ""We're lucky in that we have quite a lot of team accommodation so we're able to offer rooms to key people, but many businesses just don't have that. ""The wider problem is, it's not making living in places like Cornwall very easy for local people, and that seems to be causing growing resentment in communities.""

Easing of Covid-19 measures on NI Executive agenda,"The document says NI is ""not yet at a point where we can set a date for an end to social distancing"" ""Normality, as we knew it in 2019, is still some way off,"" the health minister has said. The remarks by Robin Swann were in a briefing document from the Department of Health to the NI Executive. Mr Swann said Northern Ireland is ""not yet at a point where we can set a date for an end to social distancing"". The health paper also said testing for coronavirus over the past few days has indicated that up to 25% of new cases here may be the Delta variant. The document warns of another possible ""significant fresh surge"" of positive cases and hospitalisations by late summer or early autumn. It says the Delta variant, which originated in India, is more transmissible, and is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission. Vaccination is working, it states, and ""the more people we can get fully vaccinated the stronger our protection will be"". The Public Health Agency has said 111 probable and confirmed cases of the Delta variant have been detected throughout all 11 local council areas in Northern Ireland, 28 of them are in Kilkeel. Cases of the variantwere first confirmed in Northern Ireland in early May. The NI Executive met on Thursday to discuss further relaxations of Covid restrictions. Mr Swann said while the number of Delta cases remained small, there were ""grounds for concern"", and evidence from Great Britain showed its potential to spread quickly. The use of face coverings was also expected to continue, he said. Ministers have agreed live music can resume on 21 June subject to the decision being rubber-stamped Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there was cause for ""worry"". ""We're naturally worried whenever we look at predictions and modelling for what could potentially happen,"" she said. ""Some of the modelling suggests we will have a significant rise in positive cases."" Ms O'Neill said Chief Medical officer Dr Michael McBride said there should be clearer picture by mid July. First Minister Arlene Foster said the Delta variant is more transmissible and ""we need to make sure we continue to protect our citizens"". Stormont ministers have agreed an indicative date of 21 June for live music to resume across venues in NI. However, it will need to be rubber-stamped by the executive next week, in line with health advice. No live music is permitted in pubs, hotels and clubs under current Covid-19 regulations, with many venues closedto audiences since March 2020. It is understood the Executive also agreed proposals to raise limits on social contact at home from 21 June. This would allow 10 people from two households to meet indoors from that date. Currently only six people from two households can meet inside a home. The number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a private garden could rise to 15 from any number of households on that date. 21 June has also been agreed as an indicative date for lifting the cap of 500 people at outdoor gatherings, instead replacing it with numbers by risk assessment. Along with the other proposals on rules regarding live music in licensed and unlicensed venues, the changes could mean the return of some larger concerts, sporting events and festivals this summer. Arlene Foster says the Delta variant is more transmissible and ""we need to make sure we continue to protect our citizens"" Theatres may also be set to reopen on 21 June, if the executive gives the green light next week. Queen's University Belfast virologist Dr Connor Bamford has said delaying the easing of restrictions may ""put us in better stead going into the coming months"". He said some modelling ofthe new Delta variantsuggested its spread could result in a significant rise in hospital admissions and deaths, despite a large portion of the adult population being vaccinated. ""There are still a lot of people at risk, without vaccines, with one dose of vaccine, and this is, of course, more transmissible,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""I think that possibly delaying the relief of these restrictions might be the best thing to do in the next couple of weeks, until we have more information and more time for that public health acting to act and also to get more people with two-dose vaccinations."" Time between NI Covid vaccines to be shortened Singer Liam McFeely says the past year has been ""absolutely brutal"" for musicians and bands. Liam McFeely, singer with The Goodfellas, one of the north west's best-known wedding bands, said it was vital the return of live music got the go-ahead. ""People are on aeroplanes, they are in cinemas tonight, which is fantastic, but still no dancing, no signing, no music,"" he toldBBC Radio Foyle. ""For some reason, for music and entertainment there was no happy medium, it was just stop, no dancing,"" he said. Musicians, he added, have endured an ""absolutely brutal, horrendous"" time since March 2020. He estimated lockdown cost him ""thousands of pounds"" in lost earnings. ""We lost 60 weddings in three weeks, that's my livelihood, that was the beginning,"" he said. ""You keep things for a rainy day but when you have three kids at uni, the rainy days are every day"". Thursday's executive meeting was also Arlene Foster's last as Northern Ireland's first minister, as she prepares to step down. Education Minister Peter Weir, Economy Minister Diane Dodds and Junior Minister Gordon Lyons are also due to leave their posts, as DUP leader Edwin Poots prepares to move his new team into office. On Wednesday, the incoming Economy Minister Paul Frew said he wanted to see a ""stocktake"" of the coronavirus restrictions.

Biden to warn PM not to risk NI peace over Brexit,"Mr Biden said he was ""thrilled"" to be in Cornwall US President Joe Biden will tell PM Boris Johnson not to let the row over post-Brexit trading in Northern Ireland affect the peace process. The two leaders are having their first face-to-face talks in Cornwall on the eve of the G7 summit. Mr Biden will stress the need to ""stand behind"" the Northern Ireland protocol. They will also discuss transatlantic travel and a new ""Atlantic Charter"" aimed at refreshing the relationship between the UK and US. Follow live: Biden and Johnson meet ahead of G7 Don't imperil NI peace, Biden to warn UK and EU EU says patience wearing thin in UK trade war talks How does the Biden-Johnson relationship stack up? The US President is on his first overseas visit since being elected and the G7 summit is the first time world leaders have all gathered in person since the pandemic began. The rollout of the coronavirus vaccination programme and climate change are high on their agenda. But the ongoing dispute between the UK and the EU over regulatory checks on goods going into Northern Ireland from Great Britain is also likely to feature heavily in diplomatic discussions in the coming days. President Biden has a close interest in Ireland, given his ancestral roots, and had warned that theGood Friday Agreementmust not be jeopardised by rows over trade. The US was closely involved in drawing up the agreement - with American senator George Mitchell chairing the talks which led to the peace deal. Business and political leaders in Northern Ireland have warned that the trade dispute is causing political angst and instability in the run up to the marching season next month, a historical flashpoint between loyalist and nationalist communities. Northern Ireland was given special status as a result of the 2019 Brexit ""divorce"" settlement between the UK and the EU. While England, Scotland and Wales no longer follow EU rules, Northern Ireland still does, because it shares a land border with the Republic of Ireland, an EU member. In order to avoid a physical border between the two countries -  and thereby protect the peace process - it was agreed that customs checks would take place on goods entering Northern Ireland from elsewhere in the UK. But Unionists say this has effectively put a border down the Irish Sea instead - something they are ideologically opposed to - and business say supply chains have been complicated and disrupted. Talks on Wednesday between Brexit minister Lord Frost and the European Commission's Maros Sefcovic to try to resolve the standoff  ended without a breakthrough. Mr Sefcovic said the EU's patience was ""wearing very thin"" with the UK's attitude towards the protocol, after UK ministers said they were prepared to ignore parts of it to prevent disruption to goods like sausages and other chilled meats going to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. And in a press conference on Thursday morning, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the protocol was the ""only solution"" to prevent a hard border with the Republic and must be implemented ""completely"". From Air Force One to Beast - Biden's travel kit Why are world leaders coming to the English seaside? US overtakes UK as hardest hit by Covid deaths in G7 Mr Johnson said on Wednesday that resolving the dispute with Brussels was ""easily doable"" and ""what we want to do is make sure that we can have a solution that...protects the peace process, but also guarantees the economic and territorial integrity of the whole United Kingdom"". But speaking on a visit to Batley in West Yorkshire, the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, said President Biden had delivered an ""an unprecedented rebuke"" to the prime minister over the unresolved situation in Northern Ireland. Sir Keir said he knew ""what it means for those communities and the way the government is going about this is undermining the peace process"", adding that the situation was also undermining the UK's relationship with the US. ""The government needs to make much more of an effort to settle this, to negotiate and get to a settlement for the people of Northern Ireland and for the world."" Leader of the DUP Edwin Poots said Mr Biden's comments were ""not well informed"" and argued that the protocol had been responsible for a rise in violence in Northern Ireland. However Irish PM Micheal Martin said the US president was urging the UK to do ""the sensible thing"" and resolve its trade issues with the EU. During their meeting in Carbis Bay,Mr Johnson and President Biden are expected to agree to set up a taskforceto make recommendations on safely resuming international travel. Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss described its creation as ""a first step towards reopening the skies"" but warned that the ""absence of a definitive timeframe"" means airlines, businesses and consumers are still in the dark. The prime minister is coming under fire for his own travel arrangements to Cornwall. Critics say taking a private jet rather than a train to the summit tarnishes his green credentials and Britain's claim to be a world leader on climate change. Mr Johnson defended his decision saying: ""If you attack my arrival by plane, I respectfully point out the UK is actually in the lead in developing sustainable aviation fuel, and one of the points in the 10 point plan of our green industrial revolution, is to get to 'jet zero' as well."" A trip to St Michael's Mount was cancelled due to the weather Organisers have been forced to change the location of the talks between the President and Mr Johnson after bad weather ruled out holding them at St Michael's Mount, a castle on a tidal island off the coast of Cornwall. Reports suggested their wives, Carrie Johnson and First Lady Jill Biden, were also due to tour the beauty spot but a No 10 source confirmed the visit was ""sadly off due to the weather"". Instead, the leaders are meeting in Carbis Bay, the location for Friday's summit.

More swearing but parents want children protected,"Swearing is increasingly seen as part of adult life, but parents want to keep controls on language on screen People are increasingly likely to use strong swearing in their everyday life, says research from the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). The body, which gives age ratings to films, says about a third of people in the UK are more likely to use strong swear words than five years ago. But the research found parents did not want age restrictions weakened for swearing in movies and DVDs. Parents wanted to protect children ""for as long as possible"" from swearing. The BBFC also said it would treat acronyms such as ""WTF"" as though the full swear words had been spelt out, because the meaning was so widely recognised. The report on swearing habits, based on research with 1,000 people, found about six in 10 people saw strong swearing, such as the F-word, as part of everyday life. Netflix provides age ratings with BBFC How Life of Brian changed to a 12A rating Why swearing could have a place in the office A third were more likely to swear than five years ago, but there was a significant ""generational divide"", with 18 to 34 year olds most likely to swear and to be ""desensitised"" to its impact. Among older people, strong swear words still remained a taboo - with 75% of those over 65 saying they would not use strong swearing in public, according to research which included focus groups and in-depth interviews. ""My son is exposed to strong language among his peers. I don't want him using it though."" Mother of a 10-12 year old. ""My 15 year old son uses swearing among gaming friends casually. It's become a normal form of expression. Even my 13 year old thinks it's okay now, its become so normalised."" Mother, aged 31-50 ""There's a slippery slope with strong language creeping into films at younger ages. Where do you draw the line and say that's enough?"" Female, aged 31-50 ""I swear every day around friends. I don't use it in front of new people as I don't want them to get a bad impression of me."" Female, aged 31-50 ""My kids are 16 and 21 now. They hear strong language on a daily basis when out and about."" Father of children aged 16-18. Source: BBFC Parents were also keen to keep strong swearing away from their children - with about two thirds of parents saying while they might swear among their own friends they would avoid it if they thought their children, up to the age of 16, could hear. There was also anxiety among parents about how much swearing could be ""normalised"" in the online video content available to young people. Most parents who swore with friends avoided strong language around their children The context also made a difference, with parents more worried if swearing was used in an aggressive or violent way, with a particular concern if it was used in terms of sexual violence. The BBFC said the research suggested that while swearing might be increasingly used and tolerated, that parents did not want a dilution of the limits on how it appeared on-screen - such as not having very strong language in a 12A-rated film. The strongest swear words should be infrequent for a 15 rating and if accompanied with violence they might need an 18 rating, said the BBFC. ""Children are watching more content on multiple screens, and their parents want to protect them from strong and very strong language wherever they can and for as long as possible. Parents told us they are keen for media industries to share the responsibility,"" said David Austin, the BBFC's chief executive.

How does Biden-Johnson relationship stack up?,"The Cornwall beachfront resort where world leaders will gather Boris Johnson and Joe Biden will meet near the cliff tops overlooking the magnificent Carbis Bay in Cornwall, the waves from the Atlantic crashing below. It won't have the bodice-ripping tension and tempestuousness of an encounter between Ross Poldark and Demelza - until now the most famous pairing from these parts thanks to the BBC hit drama - but this is an important relationship to watch as it develops. The reasons why it might get off to a horrible start are all too easy to enumerate. Biden firmly supported Britain remaining in the EU; Johnson was the leading architect of Brexit. Biden is perhaps the most ""Irish"" (I put it in inverted commas because a lot of Americans in public life like to play up their Irish roots - though Biden's are very clear) of recent US presidents, and the Good Friday Agreement is sacrosanct for him - and so he will make clear to his British host there can be no tinkering with the Northern Ireland protocol if it puts that long-fought-over agreement in jeopardy. Boris Johnson clearly wants to get out of the binding agreement - freely signed by the British to get Brexit done - that in effect puts a trade barrier down the Irish Sea between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland. In a pre-visit interview, Joe Biden's national security adviser told me that Britain should not underestimate the strength of Biden's feelings on this subject. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Don't imperil NI peace, Biden to warn UK and EU And then there is the back story of the two men - Boris Johnson was seen by many in the US as Britain's Donald Trump (certainly by Donald Trump himself) - a bit chaotic, populist, unpredictable, a rabble rouser. And in return Boris Johnson was lavish in his praise of the former business tycoon occupying the White House - he was Making America Great Again said the British PM; he was worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in North Korea. A statue of Johnson, Biden and other world leaders has been erected on the iconic cliffs And no-one would say that Joe Biden is cut from the same privileged cloth as Boris Johnson. Somehow I can't quite imagine the young working class Joe from Scranton, Pennsylvania, in Bullingdon Club white tie. Indeed Biden went as far as describing Johnson as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Donald Trump. But equally, if you delve back into the manila folder of yellowing newspaper cuttings - or just used your search engine - you will find plenty of disobliging comments from BoJo from when he was mayor of London, talking about Trump's ""stupefying ignorance"". All of which leads to an obvious point. That was then. Now is now. Trump and Johnson share laughs at the 2019 summit in France If we're talking of presidents and PMs not being cut from the same cloth, you would have to say that David Cameron and Barack Obama were hardly obvious soulmates, yet they forged a close working relationship. To Cameron's credit - he didn't obsess and fret about the special relationship in the way that some others have done. Remember Gordon Brown chasing Barack Obama through a kitchen at the UN so desperate was he to have a face to face with the American president? If you're the British prime minister you make it your business to get on with whoever the elected US president of the day is. In the days after the 2020 presidential election when Donald Trump was insisting it was all a fraud and he would overturn the result (actually, come to think of it, seven months on he is still saying the same thing), the Johnson government was very speedy to note that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor and was duly congratulated by the British. Some countries havered on doing the same, fearful of incurring the wrath of Donald Trump. On some of the biggest ticket items facing the world, Biden and Johnson are completely aligned. Perhaps most notably, on climate change and the upcoming COP26 UN climate change conference being hosted in Glasgow in November - but also on national security issues, defence co-operation and intelligence sharing, Britain and the US are very closely aligned. Go back in history, and few would have imagined that after the apparent bromance between Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, with all their windy rhetoric about The Third Way (I really can't decide whether the idea deserves capital letters or not - I'll leave them there for now), that the British PM would have transitioned so effortlessly into forging such a close relationship with George W Bush - of course many then criticised Blair for becoming too close to Bill Clinton's successor. I think the only relationship where there was lasting damage came when Bill Clinton was elected president and John Major was prime minister.Major's efforts to help George HW Bush win re-electionby allowing the Home Office to look into whether there was any ""dirt"" on Bill Clinton from when he was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford was a big mistake, and probably had a lasting impact. It's hard to believe that Biden and Johnson will be a recreation of the Thatcher and Reagan relationship - or going back further, Churchill and FDR - Churchill during the terrifying blitz in 1940 would talk about courting and cultivating the US leader, endlessly finding ways to capture his attention - and critically support - to bring the US into the Second World War. FDR and Churchill meet in Washington The other week on our podcast Americast, I spoke to Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama's former deputy national security adviser, and joked about the special relationship. Remember this is something that the British political class talk much more about than the Americans. But Rhodes made the point that there is such a commonality of interest, so many shared values, that when you sit down with the British to discuss major issues, you invariably find yourself starting from the same point. How you get to the end point might differ, but being of like mind is a good start for the relationship between Joe Biden and Boris Johnson. On most things they are. St Ives, near to where the officials will meet And with Britain forging a post-Brexit future that is critically important.

Biden warns Putin as he opens foreign trip in UK,"This video can not be played US President Joe Biden arrives in the UK ahead of the G7 summit US President Joe Biden has launched his first official overseas trip with a warning to Russia that it faces ""robust and meaningful"" consequences if it engages in ""harmful activities"". Mr Biden made clear his intention to strengthen ties with US allies, following strained relations under the Trump administration. President Biden arrived in the UK on Wednesday. He will meet PM Boris Johnson to agree a new ""Atlantic Charter"". The pact will be a modern version of the one agreed between Winston Churchill and Franklin Roosevelt in 1941, with a focus on challenges including climate change and security. The BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, says the two are aiming to refresh a vital relationship, after the turbulence of the Trump years and the pressures of the pandemic. During a packed eight-day European visit Mr Biden will meet the Queen at Windsor Castle, attend a G7 leaders' meeting, and join his first Nato summit as president. At the end of his trip Mr Biden is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin in Geneva. From Air Force One to Beast - Biden's travel kit How does the Biden-Johnson relationship stack up? Industry dismisses US-UK moves to reopen travel Why are world leaders coming to the English seaside? The White House has indicated that he intends to cover a ""full range of pressing issues"" with his Russian counterpart, including arms control, climate change, Russian military involvement in Ukraine, Russia's cyber-hacking activities and the jailing of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny. Three organisations linked to Mr Navalny were outlawedby a Moscow court on Wednesday for being ""extremist"". Addressing US troops and their families at the RAF Mildenhall airbase in Suffolk on Wednesday, where he landed before travelling on to Cornwall, Mr Biden said he would deliver a clear message to Mr Putin. ""We're not seeking conflict with Russia,"" he said. ""We want a stable and predictable relationship ... but I've been clear: The United States will respond in a robust and meaningful way if the Russian government engages in harmful activities."" Ties between Washington and Moscow are at a low point over a variety of issues. In April,Mr Putin accused Western powers of trying to ""pick on"" Russiaand warned them not to cross a ""red line"". Mr Biden said that ""at every point"" during his first overseas trip as president he wanted to make it clear that ""the United States is back and democracies of the world are standing together to tackle the toughest challenges, and the issues that matter most to our future"". Other leaders of the G7 (Group of Seven) will arrive in Cornwall, south-west England, on Friday and meetings will take place over the weekend. The G7 is made up of the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - plus the EU. Vladimir Putin has downplayed expectations of his planned summit with President Biden The main topic of conversation will be Covid recovery, including ""a stronger global health system that can protect us all from future pandemics"". In an article for the Times, Boris Johnson said the G7 would ""begin the framing of a new global treaty on pandemic preparedness so the world is never caught out in the same way again"". The Biden administration has said it plans to provide 500 million doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to about 100 countries over the next two years. What's the plan for rich countries to share spare vaccines? Why does the G7 summit matter? The G7 agenda also includes climate change and trade. Mr Biden is expected to warn thatthe UK-EU trade rowcould endanger peace in Northern Ireland. He will call on fellow leaders to protect the gains of the Good Friday agreement. At the end of the summit, the UK - as the host nation - will publish a document outlining what has been agreed by the leaders. After the G7, Mr Biden and First Lady Jill Biden will meet the Queen at Windsor Castle before flying to Brussels for talks with Nato on Monday and the EU on Tuesday. US ties with Nato were strained under Donald Trump, but Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg - visiting the White House on Monday - hailed Mr Biden's ""powerful commitment"" to America's allies.

LiveLiveHancock faces MPs' questions over pandemic1 minute ago,"Matt Hancock says the Delta variant first identified in India now comprises 91% of new Covid cases seen in the UK His comments came as he defended his handling of the pandemic during four hours of questioning from MPs He rejects criticism from Dominic Cummings, including that he had lied to the PM about care home testing Locking down earlier than 23 March last year would have gone against the scientific advice at the time, he says Hancock says he ""bitterly regrets"" not overruling scientific guidance the virus could not be spread asymptomatically And he says he followed clinical advice on patients being released from hospitals to care homes and was told they would be tested The UK has reported more than 7,000 daily Covid cases for a second day running The latest government figures also show there were another seven deaths within 28 days of a positive test The UK's recovery from the pandemic lagged behind other big economies in the first three months of 2021 Edited by Katie Wright Today's live page posts were written by Hazel Shearing, Lauren Turner, Jo Couzens and Richard Morris. They were edited by Katie Wright and Emma Owen. Thanks for tuning in, we'll be back tomorrow. We'll shortly be wrapping up for the day. Here's what you need to know: Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said earlier that data suggests there will be a further rise in cases ""in coming weeks"" Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter According to NHS England, a record number of young people have booked
appointments for vaccines after those over 25 were invited to have their
jabs. But anti-vaccine activists are still targeting younger people online. Videos and posts promoting conspiracy theories that vaccines will cause
miscarriages or affect fertility have circulated for months, aimed at younger
women in particular. Anecdotally, weâve seen an uptick in recent days, just as younger people
have been offered a jab. Emotive content is being shared on sites like Instagram and
TikTok, as well as in Facebook groups. Several women - as well as doctors
working at vaccine centres - have messaged me with worries that these
conspiracy theories may frighten some off the jab. Weâve looked into claims about vaccines affecting periods - and
unsubstantiated claims that they could cause miscarriages - read more on thathere. Nearly one in three older adult care home workers in England has not been fully vaccinated against coronavirus, new figures from NHS England show. The latest data shows that 68.7% of eligible staff at older adult care homes had been given both doses of vaccine by 6 June. Since the vaccine programme began, 83.7% of staff have been given a first jab. In total, 95.3% of older adult care home residents have had a first jab and 90.5% have had both. Residents and staff are eligible for the vaccine if they have not had Covid-19 in the previous 28 days. And they are both in the top priority group of the vaccination programme. Meanwhile, 82.7% of residents at younger adult care homes have received both doses now. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The US was worst hit by the pandemicin the G7 big Western democracies over the first year of Covid-19, according to an updated study of excess death figures. The analysis, done for the BBC by the Health Foundation, comes on the eve of the G7 summit in Cornwall and measures deaths above expected levels for a normal year. Last year,an earlier BBC studyshowed that at that point, the UK had been hardest hit. Overall, UK outcomes are now second worst in the G7. The analysis shows that in the second half of last year in particular, US levels of excess deaths failed to drop back as much as other comparable industrialised nations. The UK's worse outcomes in the first wave, and a significant peak of deaths in December and January, still mean that overall UK outcomes were second worst, on one measure just behind the US. Read the full story here. For people wanting to get married, the wait continues as cases of the Delta variant rise ahead of the planned 21 June unlocking. One couple has been telling the BBC how that has been for them. Tommy Router, 30, and his fiancÃ©e Caroline Dorman, 29, got engaged in 2019 and were supposed to get married last summer, with a reception at his parents' garden in Hingham, Norfolk. Since last summer, the couple have spent weeks making and then changing various contingency plans for a wedding this July, plans which have seen their guest list scaled back from 130 to 100 and then 60. They are now erring on the side of caution and have decided to cut their wedding list even further to 30 guests. ""We've mentally changed our wedding plans more times than I can ever count and physically changed it more than a handful of times,"" says Tommy. Caroline, an NHS intensive care nurse working at St Thomas' Hospital in London, says: ""It feels a bit like deja vu of last year, but we obviously hope this year it actually happens."" Read more here on the effect on those planning weddings. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Russia has reported a spike in new Covid infections for the eighth day running. The country's Covid-19 HQ recorded 11,699 new cases on 10 June - the highest such figure since 24 February. Speaking to state news agency RIA Novosti on 9 June, one of the country's top epidemiologists Alexander Gintsburg suggested the recent rise in new cases was down to socialising in the summer. ""Summer has come, there is far more interaction, people's mobility is increasing compared with the winter period which is why naturally there is an increase in incidence among those who have not been vaccinated,"" he said. Gintsburg, whose Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology developed the Sputnik V vaccine - one of Russia's three vaccines against the virus - urged the public to get vaccinated. President Vladimir Putin and senior officials have made repeated appeals to Russians about receiving a jab, but public enthusiasm has been persistently low. In February only 30% of Russians said they were willing to receive the Sputnik V jab, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey in May by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a jab ""under any circumstances"". Former prime minister Theresa May has criticised Boris Johnson's international travel restrictions, saying ""global Britain is shut for business"". Speaking in the House of Commons, she says the government had failed to act on its June 2020 promise to get internationally-agreed standard health measures in place. ""One year on, we are no further forward - indeed, what we have is a devastated industry, jobs lost and global Britain shut for business."" she says. ""More than not being any further forward, we've gone backwards."" May says that last year she went to Switzerland in August and South Korea in September - questioning why travel was possible when there was no vaccine, yet now there is a vaccine it is not. She also says the traffic light system is ""chaotic"" and that business travel is ""practically impossible"". May says the UK is ""falling behind the rest of Europe"" when it comes to making decisions on travel, adding of the government: ""It needs to decide whether it wants an airline industry and aviation sector in the UK or not, because at the rate it's going it won't have one."" Harriet AgerholmData journalist The gap between Covid-19 case rates among the old and young is growing. In Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, where cases are surging and the Delta variant has been found in high concentrations, the most recent average case rate in the under 60s is now about six times that of those aged 60 and over. During earlier waves of the pandemic, case rates among older people in hotspot areas caught up with those of younger people, but this time it looks different. Local leaders have been calling on eligible people to have their second jab, and these high rates of infection among lower priority groups could demonstrate just why having two doses is so important. Covid cases in the UK are not heading in the right direction and data suggests there will be a further rise soon, says chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency Dr Jenny Harries. ""We are progressing, probably as a country, not quite in the right direction that we would all want to,"" she told a Royal Society of Medicine webinar. ""Cases are rising, I think that is becoming clearer and modelling does suggest that we would start to see a further rise, not necessarily immediately but in coming weeks."" The latest Public Health England data shows case rates in England have risen in almost every age group, with the highest rise among people in their 20s. Dr Harries said older people were not getting ill because they have had two jabs, while those in hospital have either only had one dose or are unvaccinated. She said the virus is ""not going to go away"", with factors including a possible drop in vaccine effectiveness against new variants and a ""large reservoir"" of people who can transmit it. And more from the UK's daily figures - 176,559 more people had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine yesterday, with 316,258 having a second dose. In total, 40,886,878 have now had their first jab and of them, 28,857,102 have had both doses - that's 54.8% of the UK's adult population. In the last seven days, there have been 44,008 new positive coronavirus tests in the UK. That's a rise of 17,036 - or 63.2% - from the previous week. And there have been 55 deaths in the past seven days, a rise of one - or 1.9% - from the week before.  There have been 7,393 new daily cases of coronavirus reported in the UK,according to the latest figures.,external That's the second day running cases have topped 7,000 - prior to this that number was last surpassed in late February. In addition, there have been seven more deaths reported of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. The gap between the first and second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine isto be cut in Northern Ireland. There is currently a gap of 10-12 weeks between the two doses of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines. It is now being reduced to a maximum of eight weeks, the Department of Health has said. It's intended to offer better protection against the Delta variant, first detected in India, which is more transmissible. The first dose is thought to be 30% effective against it, while this increases to about 80% following a second dose. Hancock, centre with his back to the camera, giving evidence earlier Labour's shadow social care minister Liz Kendall says evidence from Matt Hancock at the science and health committees was ""at best disingenuous"". She says: ""He selectively used briefings, evidence and clinical advice to defend his record instead of admitting his abject failure to protect care homes in the pandemic. ""Even Matt Hancock knows he now categorically failed to put a protective ring around care homes. ""He has now used multiple excuses for failing to test those discharged to care homes, and family members who have lost loved ones will be frustrated and deeply upset that they still do not have the truth from the Secretary of State today.""

Thousands were due to fly to the capital Baku this week for the start of the tournament, which has been delayed by a year because of the pandemic. Wales play Switzerland in Baku on Saturday, Turkey on Wednesday, and the Italians in Rome the following Sunday. Azerbaijan and Italy are on the UK andWelsh governments' amber lists,external, meaning you should not travel there. First Minister Mark Drakeford and the Football Association of Wales havecalled on fans not to go to the matches. Before returning to Wales, they will need to take a PCR test, and thenquarantine at home for 10 days,external. Read the full storyhere. Ben WrightBBC political correspondent Regrets? Matt Hancock has a few. Such as not challenging the assumption within Whitehall early last year that the public wouldn't tolerate a lockdown to contain Covid. He ""bitterly regretted"" that he had not overruled scientific advice at the start of the pandemic that assumed coronavirus could not be transmitted asymptomatically. Mr Hancock said the death rate in care homes ""weighed heavily"" on him. But over four and half hours the health secretary defended the government's actions on several fronts - from PPE provision to care homes - making claims that will be scrutinised further. Dominic Cummings sat in the same chair two weeks ago and heaped scorn on blame on his former colleagues (most venomously on Mr Hancock). In contrast, the health secretary said ministers and officials largely did their best in unprecedented circumstances. Mr Hancock strenuously avoided mentioning Mr Cummings by name but swatted away his allegations when they were put to him by MPs. While assiduously praising those he worked with Matt Hancock also gave the impression that what the crisis really needed was more Matt Hancock. After having his name trashed by Mr Cummings a fortnight ago this was quite a bounce back. Matt Hancock ended his evidence saying the government was now better prepared to handle another pandemic. It had better be because Mr Hancock's testimony added to the picture of a government stunned, sometimes inert and often overwhelmed as the Covid crisis engulfed it at the start of last year. In a bid to boost vaccination numbers, officials in the US state of Washington are allowing marijuana retailers to host their own vaccine clinics and to offer a single, pre-rolled cannabis cigarette to anyone aged over 21 who gets their jab there. The scheme, announced on Monday, is the latest of many vaccine incentives being offered in the west coast state, including free pints of beer, sports tickets and prize money. Back in 2012, Washington and Colorado became the first states to legalise the adult use of cannabis, and regulated sales began two years later. It's been a major source of tax revenue for Washington state, bringing in over $395m (Â£280m) in 2019. Unlike purveyors of alcohol, cannabis retailers are being given tax breaks on the joints they give away. But the high-minded scheme is set to expire 12 July â meaning many customers will be unable to return for a second dose. Many businesses also face legal hurdles since their industry is still illegal at a federal level. Daniela Bernhard, the co-owner of Uncle Ikeâs cannabis store in Seattle, told AP news agency that their efforts to host a vaccine clinic had been rejected by two healthcare providers. A spokesperson for Spokane Regional Health District, a local public health agency, also told AP that they wouldn't be able to provide marijuana businesses with any vaccines because of concerns that it would jeopardise their own federal funding. Ms Bernhard said she was âdisappointed that our legal and heavily regulated sector continues to be treated differently than our peer sectorsâ. âIf we are trusting adults driving with their vaccination cards to get a pint of beer and then responsibly get to their next destination, we can also trust that adults will pick up a joint and enjoy it later in a legal setting,â she added. The National Covid Memorial Wall in London A campaign group for families bereaved by Covid-19 has said Matt Hancock's evidence to MPs shows ""he blames everyone but himself and the government for the handling of the pandemic"". In a statement posted to Twitter, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said: ""Scientists, the public and advisers are all seemingly at fault according to a minister who suggested he was continually unaware of important details. ""Even when directly challenged to agree that the first lockdown came too late he shirked the opportunity to show humility, instead choosing to speak on something else while not denying what we all know - the late lockdown cost lives. ""Hundreds of thousands of bereaved families will have felt a shudder as Matt Hancock stated 'sometimes you have to put yourself in jeopardy'. ""The truth is it was our loved ones who were placed in jeopardy and they paid for it with their lives."" They urged Hancock to meet with bereaved families so he could be ""better informed"" of the challenges they have faced. Ministers at Stormont have agreed an indicative date of 21 June for live music and theatre to resume across venues in NI. But this still has to be rubber-stamped by the executive next week, in line with health advice. Many venues have been closed to audiences since March 2020. The executive is also understood to have agreed to proposals to raise limits on social contact with others at home from that date. It would allow 10 people from two households to meet indoors from that date. Currently only six people from two households can meet inside a home. The number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a private garden could rise to 15 from any number of households on that date. 21 June has also been agreed as an indicative date for lifting the cap of 500 people at outdoor gatherings, instead replacing it with numbers by risk assessment. The changes could mean the return of some larger concerts, sporting events and festivals this summer. Ahead of the executive meeting, Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said he would ""encourage the executive to do the right thing"" and allow the return of live music. ""Northern Ireland is known for its rich fabric of talented musicians. These musicians, and the venues which host them, feel left behind,"" he said. Read more. Â© 2025 BBC.

How does the Biden-Johnson relationship stack up?The leaders of the US and UK will bring their very different backgrounds to their first official meeting.,"The Cornwall beachfront resort where world leaders will gather Boris Johnson and Joe Biden will meet near the cliff tops overlooking the magnificent Carbis Bay in Cornwall, the waves from the Atlantic crashing below. It won't have the bodice-ripping tension and tempestuousness of an encounter between Ross Poldark and Demelza - until now the most famous pairing from these parts thanks to the BBC hit drama - but this is an important relationship to watch as it develops. The reasons why it might get off to a horrible start are all too easy to enumerate. Biden firmly supported Britain remaining in the EU; Johnson was the leading architect of Brexit. Biden is perhaps the most ""Irish"" (I put it in inverted commas because a lot of Americans in public life like to play up their Irish roots - though Biden's are very clear) of recent US presidents, and the Good Friday Agreement is sacrosanct for him - and so he will make clear to his British host there can be no tinkering with the Northern Ireland protocol if it puts that long-fought-over agreement in jeopardy. Boris Johnson clearly wants to get out of the binding agreement - freely signed by the British to get Brexit done - that in effect puts a trade barrier down the Irish Sea between mainland Britain and Northern Ireland. In a pre-visit interview, Joe Biden's national security adviser told me that Britain should not underestimate the strength of Biden's feelings on this subject. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Don't imperil NI peace, Biden to warn UK and EU And then there is the back story of the two men - Boris Johnson was seen by many in the US as Britain's Donald Trump (certainly by Donald Trump himself) - a bit chaotic, populist, unpredictable, a rabble rouser. And in return Boris Johnson was lavish in his praise of the former business tycoon occupying the White House - he was Making America Great Again said the British PM; he was worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in North Korea. A statue of Johnson, Biden and other world leaders has been erected on the iconic cliffs And no-one would say that Joe Biden is cut from the same privileged cloth as Boris Johnson. Somehow I can't quite imagine the young working class Joe from Scranton, Pennsylvania, in Bullingdon Club white tie. Indeed Biden went as far as describing Johnson as a ""physical and emotional clone"" of Donald Trump. But equally, if you delve back into the manila folder of yellowing newspaper cuttings - or just used your search engine - you will find plenty of disobliging comments from BoJo from when he was mayor of London, talking about Trump's ""stupefying ignorance"". All of which leads to an obvious point. That was then. Now is now. Trump and Johnson share laughs at the 2019 summit in France If we're talking of presidents and PMs not being cut from the same cloth, you would have to say that David Cameron and Barack Obama were hardly obvious soulmates, yet they forged a close working relationship. To Cameron's credit - he didn't obsess and fret about the special relationship in the way that some others have done. Remember Gordon Brown chasing Barack Obama through a kitchen at the UN so desperate was he to have a face to face with the American president? If you're the British prime minister you make it your business to get on with whoever the elected US president of the day is. In the days after the 2020 presidential election when Donald Trump was insisting it was all a fraud and he would overturn the result (actually, come to think of it, seven months on he is still saying the same thing), the Johnson government was very speedy to note that Joe Biden was the legitimate victor and was duly congratulated by the British. Some countries havered on doing the same, fearful of incurring the wrath of Donald Trump. On some of the biggest ticket items facing the world, Biden and Johnson are completely aligned. Perhaps most notably, on climate change and the upcoming COP26 UN climate change conference being hosted in Glasgow in November - but also on national security issues, defence co-operation and intelligence sharing, Britain and the US are very closely aligned. Go back in history, and few would have imagined that after the apparent bromance between Tony Blair and Bill Clinton, with all their windy rhetoric about The Third Way (I really can't decide whether the idea deserves capital letters or not - I'll leave them there for now), that the British PM would have transitioned so effortlessly into forging such a close relationship with George W Bush - of course many then criticised Blair for becoming too close to Bill Clinton's successor. I think the only relationship where there was lasting damage came when Bill Clinton was elected president and John Major was prime minister.Major's efforts to help George HW Bush win re-electionby allowing the Home Office to look into whether there was any ""dirt"" on Bill Clinton from when he was a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford was a big mistake, and probably had a lasting impact. It's hard to believe that Biden and Johnson will be a recreation of the Thatcher and Reagan relationship - or going back further, Churchill and FDR - Churchill during the terrifying blitz in 1940 would talk about courting and cultivating the US leader, endlessly finding ways to capture his attention - and critically support - to bring the US into the Second World War. FDR and Churchill meet in Washington The other week on our podcast Americast, I spoke to Ben Rhodes, Barack Obama's former deputy national security adviser, and joked about the special relationship. Remember this is something that the British political class talk much more about than the Americans. But Rhodes made the point that there is such a commonality of interest, so many shared values, that when you sit down with the British to discuss major issues, you invariably find yourself starting from the same point. How you get to the end point might differ, but being of like mind is a good start for the relationship between Joe Biden and Boris Johnson. On most things they are. St Ives, near to where the officials will meet And with Britain forging a post-Brexit future that is critically important. One thing the two men do have in common is that both men are Roman Catholics - though as one wag noted drily - one is a practising Roman Catholic; the other is in need of a lot more practice.

"Sexual harassment normalised, warns Ofsted","Website Everyone's Invited has published thousands of testimonies (stock image) Some girls can be contacted by up to 11 boys a night asking for nude images, the schools watchdog for England says. In an Ofsted survey, girls explained that if they blocked boys on social media ""they just create multiple accounts to harass you"". The report,externalalso found nine in 10 girls believed that sexist name-calling and being sent unwanted explicit photos or videos happened ""a lot"" or ""sometimes"" between their peers. The watchdog is warning that sexual harassment has become ""normalised"" among school-age children. Students often do not see the point of reporting abuse and many teachers underestimate the scale of these problems, Ofsted says. NSPCC abuse helpline 'takes hundreds of calls' Schools abuse helpline and review launched Sex abuse claims 'not limited to private schools' School abuse: 'Raped girl ignored by teachers' In the survey, girls said boys ""just won't take no for an answer"" when asking for explicit images. At one school, the girls told inspectors they can be contacted by up to 10 or 11 different boys a night asking for nude or semi-nude images. Women's groups are calling for school staff to be trained to change the culture and for a government taskforce. Ministers say schools and colleges will be encouraged to dedicate training days to help staff deal with sexual abuse. A BBC investigation has revealed at least 13,000 sex offences a year between under-18s have been reported to police in England and Wales between 2018 and 2020. Thirty police forces responded to a Freedom of Information request which revealed in about 2,000 cases, both the alleged victim and perpetrator were aged 10 or under. About 1,000 of the reported offences were about events happening on school premises. This echoes Ofsted's finding that inappropriate sexual behaviour is filtering down into primary schools. Cerys said she received 50 or 60 nude photographs when she was at school Cerys, 21, said most girls she knows had received sexually explicit images from boys or men. She said: ""When I was younger at school I received 50 or 60 on Instagram, Facebook Snapchat, images of privates that I didn't want to see. I think the first port of call is to go to your mum...you feel like 'I don't want to see that, I don't know what to do with that and no one's asked for it'. It's not very nice to receive it."" Lucy, 18, said that receiving nude photographs had become ""so normalised"" that if they appear in girls' social media message requests they ""just delete it"". She said: ""Some girls do get it very often but it's something you brush away because it's not something you think of that's out of the ordinary... and there's nothing you can do about it."" Lucy said she did not think teachers knew what to do about the problem. Cerys said: ""We were told if you're going to be involved in this then the police are going to be involved. It was more of a scary assembly rather than let's get all the girls together and tell them how to emotionally deal with receiving these kinds of images."" Lucy said receiving nudes had become normalised Amy, not her real name, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that when she was in sixth form she was raped after a party. Now 25, she believes there was a wider culture of sexual harassment that played a role in what happened to her. She said: ""What was so challenging afterwards was when I tried to speak to friends I was fed back lines like 'Even if it was 80% him it was still 20% you' and 'Are you sure you didn't lead him on?' She said a number of other girls told her they had had similar experiences and she knew she had to tell the school. She said: ""It wasn't just one boy and me. It was a number of girls being affected by multiple boys doing these kinds of things."" Amy said she was able to speak to a teacher and the support was ""overall overwhelmingly positive"". But she believes the exchanging of nude images has ""got much worse"" in the years since she left school. ""Now I speak to younger people they just say [nude photographs] is what's expected. That's what being in a relationship is or that's what love is, or if you like someone you share a picture and if you don't then clearly you didn't like them,"" she said. This video can not be played Soma Sara from Everyone's Invited: There's still a ""huge gap"" between incidents and reporting Ofsted visited 30 state and independent schools and two further education colleges and spoke to more than 900 young people about sexual harassment. Some 64% of girls thought that unwanted touching was experienced ""a lot"" or ""sometimes"" amongst their peers, while eight in 10 said the same of being pressured into sharing sexual images of themselves. Children said sexual violence typically occurred in unsupervised spaces outside of school, like parties or parks. Pupils in several schools said harmful sexual behaviour happens at house parties, without adults present, and that alcohol and drugs are often involved. Most students felt that the relationships, sex and health education (RSHE) they received at school did not give them the information and advice they needed to navigate the reality of their situations. Girls in particular were frustrated that there was not clear teaching about what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Many teachers said they lacked knowledge on topics such as consent, healthy relationships and sharing of sexual images. Inspectors are urging school and college leaders to ""develop a culture"" where all types of sexual harassment are recognised and addressed. They also say time should be set aside within the RSHE curriculum for topics that youngsters find difficult, such as consent and the sharing of explicit images. Ofsted's review came after thousands of testimonies about abuse were posted on a website - Everyone's Invited - and the government asked inspectors to assess safeguarding policies and experiences in schools and colleges. In April, ministers also asked the NSPCC charity to run an abuse in education helpline, which will stay open until October. As of Monday, the helpline had received 426 calls and helpline staff have made 80 referrals to external agencies, including the police or social services. Ofsted says the issue is a societal one and not something schools and colleges can tackle alone Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said she was ""shocked"" that young people said it was a significant problem at every school the watchdog visited. ""It wasn't in some, it was in all of them,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a cultural issue - it's about attitudes and behaviours becoming normalised, and schools and colleges can't solve that by themselves."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said Ofsted's review had ""rightly highlighted where we can take specific and urgent action to address sexual abuse in education"". But he said schools and colleges could not be expected to tackle these issues alone. The Department for Education says teachers and school leaders will be better supported to recognise sexual harassment and abuse and teach confidently about issues of consent, online pornography and healthy relationships. They will be encouraged to dedicate staff training days on how to deal with sexual abuse and harassment among pupils and how to deliver the new compulsory RSHE curriculum. The End Violence Against Women Coalition called for a taskforce made up of the government, education leaders, and experts on violence against women and girls ""to advise on next steps and drive the rollout of a whole school approach"". Peter Wanless, head of the NSPCC, said young people had exposed what was happening and their voices must shape a whole-school approach to preventing harmful sexual behaviour. Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""It seems obvious that more must be done with greater urgency to tackle the misuse of social media and the availability of online pornography."" A spokeswoman for Everyone's Invited called for an anonymous reporting system available in all schools. ""This would help reduce the massive gap between incidents and reporting emphasised in the Ofsted report,"" she said. The Report Abuse in Education helpline can be reached on 0800 136 663, on Monday to Friday 0800-2200, or 0900-1800 at weekends. It can also be contacted by email athelp@nspcc.org.uk Clarification 1 July 2021: Descriptions of the statistics have been edited to clarify that respondents referred to behaviours experienced by others their own age.

They were edited by Katie Wright and Emma Owen. Thanks for tuning in, we'll be back tomorrow. We'll shortly be wrapping up for the day. Here's what you need to know: Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said earlier that data suggests there will be a further rise in cases ""in coming weeks"" Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter According to NHS England, a record number of young people have booked
appointments for vaccines after those over 25 were invited to have their
jabs. But anti-vaccine activists are still targeting younger people online. Videos and posts promoting conspiracy theories that vaccines will cause
miscarriages or affect fertility have circulated for months, aimed at younger
women in particular. Anecdotally, weâve seen an uptick in recent days, just as younger people
have been offered a jab. Emotive content is being shared on sites like Instagram and
TikTok, as well as in Facebook groups. Several women - as well as doctors
working at vaccine centres - have messaged me with worries that these
conspiracy theories may frighten some off the jab. Weâve looked into claims about vaccines affecting periods - and
unsubstantiated claims that they could cause miscarriages - read more on thathere. Nearly one in three older adult care home workers in England has not been fully vaccinated against coronavirus, new figures from NHS England show. The latest data shows that 68.7% of eligible staff at older adult care homes had been given both doses of vaccine by 6 June. Since the vaccine programme began, 83.7% of staff have been given a first jab. In total, 95.3% of older adult care home residents have had a first jab and 90.5% have had both. Residents and staff are eligible for the vaccine if they have not had Covid-19 in the previous 28 days. And they are both in the top priority group of the vaccination programme. Meanwhile, 82.7% of residents at younger adult care homes have received both doses now. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The US was worst hit by the pandemicin the G7 big Western democracies over the first year of Covid-19, according to an updated study of excess death figures. The analysis, done for the BBC by the Health Foundation, comes on the eve of the G7 summit in Cornwall and measures deaths above expected levels for a normal year. Last year,an earlier BBC studyshowed that at that point, the UK had been hardest hit. Overall, UK outcomes are now second worst in the G7. The analysis shows that in the second half of last year in particular, US levels of excess deaths failed to drop back as much as other comparable industrialised nations. The UK's worse outcomes in the first wave, and a significant peak of deaths in December and January, still mean that overall UK outcomes were second worst, on one measure just behind the US.

One couple has been telling the BBC how that has been for them. Tommy Router, 30, and his fiancÃ©e Caroline Dorman, 29, got engaged in 2019 and were supposed to get married last summer, with a reception at his parents' garden in Hingham, Norfolk. Since last summer, the couple have spent weeks making and then changing various contingency plans for a wedding this July, plans which have seen their guest list scaled back from 130 to 100 and then 60. They are now erring on the side of caution and have decided to cut their wedding list even further to 30 guests. ""We've mentally changed our wedding plans more times than I can ever count and physically changed it more than a handful of times,"" says Tommy. Caroline, an NHS intensive care nurse working at St Thomas' Hospital in London, says: ""It feels a bit like deja vu of last year, but we obviously hope this year it actually happens.""

The country's Covid-19 HQ recorded 11,699 new cases on 10 June - the highest such figure since 24 February. Speaking to state news agency RIA Novosti on 9 June, one of the country's top epidemiologists Alexander Gintsburg suggested the recent rise in new cases was down to socialising in the summer. ""Summer has come, there is far more interaction, people's mobility is increasing compared with the winter period which is why naturally there is an increase in incidence among those who have not been vaccinated,"" he said. Gintsburg, whose Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology developed the Sputnik V vaccine - one of Russia's three vaccines against the virus - urged the public to get vaccinated. President Vladimir Putin and senior officials have made repeated appeals to Russians about receiving a jab, but public enthusiasm has been persistently low. In February only 30% of Russians said they were willing to receive the Sputnik V jab, according to independent pollster Levada Centre, while a survey in May by the SuperJob website found 42% of those still unvaccinated did not want a jab ""under any circumstances"". Former prime minister Theresa May has criticised Boris Johnson's international travel restrictions, saying ""global Britain is shut for business"". Speaking in the House of Commons, she says the government had failed to act on its June 2020 promise to get internationally-agreed standard health measures in place. ""One year on, we are no further forward - indeed, what we have is a devastated industry, jobs lost and global Britain shut for business."" she says. ""More than not being any further forward, we've gone backwards."" May says that last year she went to Switzerland in August and South Korea in September - questioning why travel was possible when there was no vaccine, yet now there is a vaccine it is not. She also says the traffic light system is ""chaotic"" and that business travel is ""practically impossible"". May says the UK is ""falling behind the rest of Europe"" when it comes to making decisions on travel, adding of the government: ""It needs to decide whether it wants an airline industry and aviation sector in the UK or not, because at the rate it's going it won't have one."" Harriet AgerholmData journalist The gap between Covid-19 case rates among the old and young is growing. In Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, where cases are surging and the Delta variant has been found in high concentrations, the most recent average case rate in the under 60s is now about six times that of those aged 60 and over. During earlier waves of the pandemic, case rates among older people in hotspot areas caught up with those of younger people, but this time it looks different. Local leaders have been calling on eligible people to have their second jab, and these high rates of infection among lower priority groups could demonstrate just why having two doses is so important. Covid cases in the UK are not heading in the right direction and data suggests there will be a further rise soon, says chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency Dr Jenny Harries. ""We are progressing, probably as a country, not quite in the right direction that we would all want to,"" she told a Royal Society of Medicine webinar. ""Cases are rising, I think that is becoming clearer and modelling does suggest that we would start to see a further rise, not necessarily immediately but in coming weeks."" The latest Public Health England data shows case rates in England have risen in almost every age group, with the highest rise among people in their 20s. Dr Harries said older people were not getting ill because they have had two jabs, while those in hospital have either only had one dose or are unvaccinated. She said the virus is ""not going to go away"", with factors including a possible drop in vaccine effectiveness against new variants and a ""large reservoir"" of people who can transmit it. And more from the UK's daily figures - 176,559 more people had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine yesterday, with 316,258 having a second dose. In total, 40,886,878 have now had their first jab and of them, 28,857,102 have had both doses - that's 54.8% of the UK's adult population. In the last seven days, there have been 44,008 new positive coronavirus tests in the UK. That's a rise of 17,036 - or 63.2% - from the previous week. And there have been 55 deaths in the past seven days, a rise of one - or 1.9% - from the week before.  There have been 7,393 new daily cases of coronavirus reported in the UK,according to the latest figures.,external That's the second day running cases have topped 7,000 - prior to this that number was last surpassed in late February. In addition, there have been seven more deaths reported of people who had tested positive within the previous 28 days. The gap between the first and second doses of the Covid-19 vaccine isto be cut in Northern Ireland. There is currently a gap of 10-12 weeks between the two doses of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines. It is now being reduced to a maximum of eight weeks, the Department of Health has said. It's intended to offer better protection against the Delta variant, first detected in India, which is more transmissible. The first dose is thought to be 30% effective against it, while this increases to about 80% following a second dose. Hancock, centre with his back to the camera, giving evidence earlier Labour's shadow social care minister Liz Kendall says evidence from Matt Hancock at the science and health committees was ""at best disingenuous"".

Matt Hancock has a few. Such as not challenging the assumption within Whitehall early last year that the public wouldn't tolerate a lockdown to contain Covid. He ""bitterly regretted"" that he had not overruled scientific advice at the start of the pandemic that assumed coronavirus could not be transmitted asymptomatically. Mr Hancock said the death rate in care homes ""weighed heavily"" on him. But over four and half hours the health secretary defended the government's actions on several fronts - from PPE provision to care homes - making claims that will be scrutinised further. Dominic Cummings sat in the same chair two weeks ago and heaped scorn on blame on his former colleagues (most venomously on Mr Hancock). In contrast, the health secretary said ministers and officials largely did their best in unprecedented circumstances. Mr Hancock strenuously avoided mentioning Mr Cummings by name but swatted away his allegations when they were put to him by MPs. While assiduously praising those he worked with Matt Hancock also gave the impression that what the crisis really needed was more Matt Hancock. After having his name trashed by Mr Cummings a fortnight ago this was quite a bounce back. Matt Hancock ended his evidence saying the government was now better prepared to handle another pandemic. It had better be because Mr Hancock's testimony added to the picture of a government stunned, sometimes inert and often overwhelmed as the Covid crisis engulfed it at the start of last year. In a bid to boost vaccination numbers, officials in the US state of Washington are allowing marijuana retailers to host their own vaccine clinics and to offer a single, pre-rolled cannabis cigarette to anyone aged over 21 who gets their jab there. The scheme, announced on Monday, is the latest of many vaccine incentives being offered in the west coast state, including free pints of beer, sports tickets and prize money. Back in 2012, Washington and Colorado became the first states to legalise the adult use of cannabis, and regulated sales began two years later. It's been a major source of tax revenue for Washington state, bringing in over $395m (Â£280m) in 2019. Unlike purveyors of alcohol, cannabis retailers are being given tax breaks on the joints they give away. But the high-minded scheme is set to expire 12 July â meaning many customers will be unable to return for a second dose. Many businesses also face legal hurdles since their industry is still illegal at a federal level. Daniela Bernhard, the co-owner of Uncle Ikeâs cannabis store in Seattle, told AP news agency that their efforts to host a vaccine clinic had been rejected by two healthcare providers. A spokesperson for Spokane Regional Health District, a local public health agency, also told AP that they wouldn't be able to provide marijuana businesses with any vaccines because of concerns that it would jeopardise their own federal funding. Ms Bernhard said she was âdisappointed that our legal and heavily regulated sector continues to be treated differently than our peer sectorsâ. âIf we are trusting adults driving with their vaccination cards to get a pint of beer and then responsibly get to their next destination, we can also trust that adults will pick up a joint and enjoy it later in a legal setting,â she added. The National Covid Memorial Wall in London A campaign group for families bereaved by Covid-19 has said Matt Hancock's evidence to MPs shows ""he blames everyone but himself and the government for the handling of the pandemic"". In a statement posted to Twitter, Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK said: ""Scientists, the public and advisers are all seemingly at fault according to a minister who suggested he was continually unaware of important details. ""Even when directly challenged to agree that the first lockdown came too late he shirked the opportunity to show humility, instead choosing to speak on something else while not denying what we all know - the late lockdown cost lives. ""Hundreds of thousands of bereaved families will have felt a shudder as Matt Hancock stated 'sometimes you have to put yourself in jeopardy'. ""The truth is it was our loved ones who were placed in jeopardy and they paid for it with their lives."" They urged Hancock to meet with bereaved families so he could be ""better informed"" of the challenges they have faced. Ministers at Stormont have agreed an indicative date of 21 June for live music and theatre to resume across venues in NI. But this still has to be rubber-stamped by the executive next week, in line with health advice. Many venues have been closed to audiences since March 2020. The executive is also understood to have agreed to proposals to raise limits on social contact with others at home from that date. It would allow 10 people from two households to meet indoors from that date. Currently only six people from two households can meet inside a home. The number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a private garden could rise to 15 from any number of households on that date. 21 June has also been agreed as an indicative date for lifting the cap of 500 people at outdoor gatherings, instead replacing it with numbers by risk assessment. The changes could mean the return of some larger concerts, sporting events and festivals this summer. Ahead of the executive meeting, Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said he would ""encourage the executive to do the right thing"" and allow the return of live music. ""Northern Ireland is known for its rich fabric of talented musicians. These musicians, and the venues which host them, feel left behind,"" he said. Read more. Â© 2025 BBC.

They were edited by Katie Wright and Emma Owen. Thanks for tuning in, we'll be back tomorrow. We'll shortly be wrapping up for the day. Here's what you need to know: Dr Jenny Harries, chief executive of the UK Health Security Agency, said earlier that data suggests there will be a further rise in cases ""in coming weeks"" Marianna SpringSpecialist disinformation and social media reporter According to NHS England, a record number of young people have booked
appointments for vaccines after those over 25 were invited to have their
jabs. But anti-vaccine activists are still targeting younger people online. Videos and posts promoting conspiracy theories that vaccines will cause
miscarriages or affect fertility have circulated for months, aimed at younger
women in particular. Anecdotally, weâve seen an uptick in recent days, just as younger people
have been offered a jab. Emotive content is being shared on sites like Instagram and
TikTok, as well as in Facebook groups. Several women - as well as doctors
working at vaccine centres - have messaged me with worries that these
conspiracy theories may frighten some off the jab. Weâve looked into claims about vaccines affecting periods - and
unsubstantiated claims that they could cause miscarriages - read more on thathere. Nearly one in three older adult care home workers in England has not been fully vaccinated against coronavirus, new figures from NHS England show. The latest data shows that 68.7% of eligible staff at older adult care homes had been given both doses of vaccine by 6 June. Since the vaccine programme began, 83.7% of staff have been given a first jab. In total, 95.3% of older adult care home residents have had a first jab and 90.5% have had both. Residents and staff are eligible for the vaccine if they have not had Covid-19 in the previous 28 days. And they are both in the top priority group of the vaccination programme. Meanwhile, 82.7% of residents at younger adult care homes have received both doses now. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The US was worst hit by the pandemicin the G7 big Western democracies over the first year of Covid-19, according to an updated study of excess death figures. The analysis, done for the BBC by the Health Foundation, comes on the eve of the G7 summit in Cornwall and measures deaths above expected levels for a normal year. Last year,an earlier BBC studyshowed that at that point, the UK had been hardest hit. Overall, UK outcomes are now second worst in the G7. The analysis shows that in the second half of last year in particular, US levels of excess deaths failed to drop back as much as other comparable industrialised nations.

"Oxford lecturers begin boycott over Rhodes statueAcademics refuse to tutor students of Oriel College, which chose to keep the controversial statue.UK","Calls to remove the memorial were reignited after the Black Lives Matter protests last year About 150 Oxford University academics are refusing to teach at one of its colleges after it decided to keep its controversial statue of Cecil Rhodes. For years campaigners have been calling for the statue at Oriel College to go, saying Rhodes stood for white supremacy and racism. But last month the college decided not to take it down for practical reasons. Now, some academics are boycotting Oriel and have signed a petition saying the statue ""glorifies colonialism"". They are refusing to give tutorials to undergraduates from Oriel or attend talks there,as first reported by the Daily Telegraph,external. The college expressed ""sadness"" at the decision, while the head of Oxford University said she was ""deeply disappointed"". A No 10 spokesman said the government would expect ""appropriate action"" to be taken if the teaching of students was disrupted by the dispute, such as providing compensation. Why is Cecil Rhodes such a controversial figure? How do you replace a fallen statue? Rhodes was a businessman and politician who played a big role in southern Africa in the 19th Century. He thought of the English as a master race, and his critics see him as the ultimate representation of colonialism and one of the people who helped pave the way for apartheid. He had been a student at Oriel, and his statue is now above a doorway of a building named after him. Oriel's governing body said last year that the majority of its members wished the statue to be removed. But after an inquiry, the college decided not to remove it due to the cost and complex planning processes. The Oxford lecturers say the college's decision not to remove the statue ""undermines us all"", and that the whole university can only work to eradicate racism if all its colleges do so. ""Faced with Oriel's stubborn attachment to a statue that glorifies colonialism and the wealth it produced for the college, we feel we have no choice but to withdraw all discretionary work and goodwill collaborations,"" a statement from the boycott organisers said. As well as refusing to tutor Oriel students, the dons will also not help the college when it interviews admissions candidates or attend talks sponsored by it. The boycott does not include work which is not discretionary, such as exams, delivering lecturers and supervising postgraduate students. The dons said the boycott was done ""with regret"" but would continue ""until Oriel makes a credible public commitment to remove the statue"". Danny Dorling, professor of geography at Oxford and one of the signatories, said: ""Having your university associated with a statue of a racist is deeply upsetting and puts a smear on the whole university."" Rhodes was controversial back in Britain even in his own lifetime But a No 10 spokesman said: ""Students rightly expect to get a good deal for their investment in higher education and we would expect universities to take appropriate action should any student be seriously affected by these actions - which could include compensation. ""We fully believe in protecting academic freedom but universities have a duty to maintain access to good-quality tuition as a priority, especially given the disruption the pandemic has caused students already."" Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg said he was ""half tempted to say you should be lucky not to be taught by such a useless bunch"". He suggested the academics had not ""bothered to look up the history of Rhodes in any detail"", describing him as a ""figure of importance and of interest and of enormous generosity to Oxford"". ""We must not allow this wokeness to happen,"" he added. Lord Wharton, chair of the Office for Students, said: ""Oriel College took a decision to retain the Rhodes statue after carefully considering all of the evidence. ""It would be utterly unacceptable if any 'boycott' of Oriel led to students, or prospective students, at the college being disadvantaged in any way."" Universities minister Michelle Donelan said: ""We fully believe in protecting academic freedom, but universities have a duty to maintain access to good quality tuition as a priority - especially given the disruption the pandemic has caused students."" Regarding the Rhodes statue, she said universities ""make their own decisions as autonomous institutions but our position is that a retain-and-explain policy is always best"". A toppled bronze memorial to the 17th Century slave merchant Colston is on display at a museum in Bristol There have been some creative ideas of what to do with controversial statues, if they are removed. Some have suggested just leaving the space empty, whilesculptor Antony Gormley proposed,externalturning the Rhodes statue to face the wall. Robert Gildea, one of the academics to sign up to the boycott, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was a way of putting pressure on the college after alternative attempts had not worked. The professor emeritus of modern history at Oxford University said taking no action was ""not acceptable"". He added: ""If the college put up a notice explaining who Cecil Rhodes was that would be fine, if the college put a placard round his neck at lunchtime today saying 'sorry' that would also be fine."" A graffitied statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, that was toppled during a Black Lives Matter protest last year,is now on display at a museum. Any decision to remove the Rhodes statue would require listed building consent from Oxford City Council, Historic England and the secretary of state for local government. In a statement, the college said it had undertaken ""an extensive, academic and rigorous process advised by a 10-month long independent commission of inquiry"". It added: ""The commission did not make a recommendation on the removal of memorials. ""We note with sadness that some fellow academics from other colleges at Oxford University have chosen not to respect the decisions of our governing body, not least because of the commensurate impact on our students and the wider academic community at Oriel, to whom we all have a duty of care."" Prof Louise Richardson, vice-chancellor of the University of Oxford, said: ""Oxford's brilliant academics are rightly renowned for their dedication to teaching, so I am deeply disappointed that some of my colleagues would choose to punish students, and prospective students, for the actions of their college's governing body, especially after the prolonged disruption of teaching during the pandemic.""

Easing of Covid-19 measures on NI Executive agendaThere are proposals to allow live music and an increase in the number of people who can meet indoors.Northern Ireland,"The document says NI is ""not yet at a point where we can set a date for an end to social distancing"" ""Normality, as we knew it in 2019, is still some way off,"" the health minister has said. The remarks by Robin Swann were in a briefing document from the Department of Health to the NI Executive. Mr Swann said Northern Ireland is ""not yet at a point where we can set a date for an end to social distancing"". The health paper also said testing for coronavirus over the past few days has indicated that up to 25% of new cases here may be the Delta variant. The document warns of another possible ""significant fresh surge"" of positive cases and hospitalisations by late summer or early autumn. It says the Delta variant, which originated in India, is more transmissible, and is associated with a higher risk of hospital admission. Vaccination is working, it states, and ""the more people we can get fully vaccinated the stronger our protection will be"". The Public Health Agency has said 111 probable and confirmed cases of the Delta variant have been detected throughout all 11 local council areas in Northern Ireland, 28 of them are in Kilkeel. Cases of the variantwere first confirmed in Northern Ireland in early May. The NI Executive met on Thursday to discuss further relaxations of Covid restrictions. Mr Swann said while the number of Delta cases remained small, there were ""grounds for concern"", and evidence from Great Britain showed its potential to spread quickly. The use of face coverings was also expected to continue, he said. Ministers have agreed live music can resume on 21 June subject to the decision being rubber-stamped Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there was cause for ""worry"". ""We're naturally worried whenever we look at predictions and modelling for what could potentially happen,"" she said. ""Some of the modelling suggests we will have a significant rise in positive cases."" Ms O'Neill said Chief Medical officer Dr Michael McBride said there should be clearer picture by mid July. First Minister Arlene Foster said the Delta variant is more transmissible and ""we need to make sure we continue to protect our citizens"". Stormont ministers have agreed an indicative date of 21 June for live music to resume across venues in NI. However, it will need to be rubber-stamped by the executive next week, in line with health advice. No live music is permitted in pubs, hotels and clubs under current Covid-19 regulations, with many venues closedto audiences since March 2020. It is understood the Executive also agreed proposals to raise limits on social contact at home from 21 June. This would allow 10 people from two households to meet indoors from that date. Currently only six people from two households can meet inside a home. The number of people allowed to meet outdoors in a private garden could rise to 15 from any number of households on that date. 21 June has also been agreed as an indicative date for lifting the cap of 500 people at outdoor gatherings, instead replacing it with numbers by risk assessment. Along with the other proposals on rules regarding live music in licensed and unlicensed venues, the changes could mean the return of some larger concerts, sporting events and festivals this summer. Arlene Foster says the Delta variant is more transmissible and ""we need to make sure we continue to protect our citizens"" Theatres may also be set to reopen on 21 June, if the executive gives the green light next week. Queen's University Belfast virologist Dr Connor Bamford has said delaying the easing of restrictions may ""put us in better stead going into the coming months"". He said some modelling ofthe new Delta variantsuggested its spread could result in a significant rise in hospital admissions and deaths, despite a large portion of the adult population being vaccinated. ""There are still a lot of people at risk, without vaccines, with one dose of vaccine, and this is, of course, more transmissible,"" he told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""I think that possibly delaying the relief of these restrictions might be the best thing to do in the next couple of weeks, until we have more information and more time for that public health acting to act and also to get more people with two-dose vaccinations."" Time between NI Covid vaccines to be shortened Singer Liam McFeely says the past year has been ""absolutely brutal"" for musicians and bands. Liam McFeely, singer with The Goodfellas, one of the north west's best-known wedding bands, said it was vital the return of live music got the go-ahead. ""People are on aeroplanes, they are in cinemas tonight, which is fantastic, but still no dancing, no signing, no music,"" he toldBBC Radio Foyle. ""For some reason, for music and entertainment there was no happy medium, it was just stop, no dancing,"" he said. Musicians, he added, have endured an ""absolutely brutal, horrendous"" time since March 2020. He estimated lockdown cost him ""thousands of pounds"" in lost earnings. ""We lost 60 weddings in three weeks, that's my livelihood, that was the beginning,"" he said. ""You keep things for a rainy day but when you have three kids at uni, the rainy days are every day"". Thursday's executive meeting was also Arlene Foster's last as Northern Ireland's first minister, as she prepares to step down. Education Minister Peter Weir, Economy Minister Diane Dodds and Junior Minister Gordon Lyons are also due to leave their posts, as DUP leader Edwin Poots prepares to move his new team into office. On Wednesday, the incoming Economy Minister Paul Frew said he wanted to see a ""stocktake"" of the coronavirus restrictions. He said: ""There are some restrictions that are still in place and have been in place over the past month that are not logical.""

"Sexual harassment 'normalised', warns Ofsted","Website Everyone's Invited has published thousands of testimonies (stock image) Some girls can be contacted by up to 11 boys a night asking for nude images, the schools watchdog for England says. In an Ofsted survey, girls explained that if they blocked boys on social media ""they just create multiple accounts to harass you"". The report,externalalso found nine in 10 girls believed that sexist name-calling and being sent unwanted explicit photos or videos happened ""a lot"" or ""sometimes"" between their peers. The watchdog is warning that sexual harassment has become ""normalised"" among school-age children. Students often do not see the point of reporting abuse and many teachers underestimate the scale of these problems, Ofsted says. NSPCC abuse helpline 'takes hundreds of calls' Schools abuse helpline and review launched Sex abuse claims 'not limited to private schools' School abuse: 'Raped girl ignored by teachers' In the survey, girls said boys ""just won't take no for an answer"" when asking for explicit images. At one school, the girls told inspectors they can be contacted by up to 10 or 11 different boys a night asking for nude or semi-nude images. Women's groups are calling for school staff to be trained to change the culture and for a government taskforce. Ministers say schools and colleges will be encouraged to dedicate training days to help staff deal with sexual abuse. A BBC investigation has revealed at least 13,000 sex offences a year between under-18s have been reported to police in England and Wales between 2018 and 2020. Thirty police forces responded to a Freedom of Information request which revealed in about 2,000 cases, both the alleged victim and perpetrator were aged 10 or under. About 1,000 of the reported offences were about events happening on school premises. This echoes Ofsted's finding that inappropriate sexual behaviour is filtering down into primary schools. Cerys said she received 50 or 60 nude photographs when she was at school Cerys, 21, said most girls she knows had received sexually explicit images from boys or men. She said: ""When I was younger at school I received 50 or 60 on Instagram, Facebook Snapchat, images of privates that I didn't want to see. I think the first port of call is to go to your mum...you feel like 'I don't want to see that, I don't know what to do with that and no one's asked for it'. It's not very nice to receive it."" Lucy, 18, said that receiving nude photographs had become ""so normalised"" that if they appear in girls' social media message requests they ""just delete it"". She said: ""Some girls do get it very often but it's something you brush away because it's not something you think of that's out of the ordinary... and there's nothing you can do about it."" Lucy said she did not think teachers knew what to do about the problem. Cerys said: ""We were told if you're going to be involved in this then the police are going to be involved. It was more of a scary assembly rather than let's get all the girls together and tell them how to emotionally deal with receiving these kinds of images."" Lucy said receiving nudes had become normalised Amy, not her real name, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that when she was in sixth form she was raped after a party. Now 25, she believes there was a wider culture of sexual harassment that played a role in what happened to her. She said: ""What was so challenging afterwards was when I tried to speak to friends I was fed back lines like 'Even if it was 80% him it was still 20% you' and 'Are you sure you didn't lead him on?' She said a number of other girls told her they had had similar experiences and she knew she had to tell the school. She said: ""It wasn't just one boy and me. It was a number of girls being affected by multiple boys doing these kinds of things."" Amy said she was able to speak to a teacher and the support was ""overall overwhelmingly positive"". But she believes the exchanging of nude images has ""got much worse"" in the years since she left school. ""Now I speak to younger people they just say [nude photographs] is what's expected. That's what being in a relationship is or that's what love is, or if you like someone you share a picture and if you don't then clearly you didn't like them,"" she said. This video can not be played Soma Sara from Everyone's Invited: There's still a ""huge gap"" between incidents and reporting Ofsted visited 30 state and independent schools and two further education colleges and spoke to more than 900 young people about sexual harassment. Some 64% of girls thought that unwanted touching was experienced ""a lot"" or ""sometimes"" amongst their peers, while eight in 10 said the same of being pressured into sharing sexual images of themselves. Children said sexual violence typically occurred in unsupervised spaces outside of school, like parties or parks. Pupils in several schools said harmful sexual behaviour happens at house parties, without adults present, and that alcohol and drugs are often involved. Most students felt that the relationships, sex and health education (RSHE) they received at school did not give them the information and advice they needed to navigate the reality of their situations. Girls in particular were frustrated that there was not clear teaching about what constitutes acceptable and unacceptable behaviour. Many teachers said they lacked knowledge on topics such as consent, healthy relationships and sharing of sexual images. Inspectors are urging school and college leaders to ""develop a culture"" where all types of sexual harassment are recognised and addressed. They also say time should be set aside within the RSHE curriculum for topics that youngsters find difficult, such as consent and the sharing of explicit images. Ofsted's review came after thousands of testimonies about abuse were posted on a website - Everyone's Invited - and the government asked inspectors to assess safeguarding policies and experiences in schools and colleges. In April, ministers also asked the NSPCC charity to run an abuse in education helpline, which will stay open until October. As of Monday, the helpline had received 426 calls and helpline staff have made 80 referrals to external agencies, including the police or social services. Ofsted says the issue is a societal one and not something schools and colleges can tackle alone Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman said she was ""shocked"" that young people said it was a significant problem at every school the watchdog visited. ""It wasn't in some, it was in all of them,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is a cultural issue - it's about attitudes and behaviours becoming normalised, and schools and colleges can't solve that by themselves."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said Ofsted's review had ""rightly highlighted where we can take specific and urgent action to address sexual abuse in education"". But he said schools and colleges could not be expected to tackle these issues alone. The Department for Education says teachers and school leaders will be better supported to recognise sexual harassment and abuse and teach confidently about issues of consent, online pornography and healthy relationships. They will be encouraged to dedicate staff training days on how to deal with sexual abuse and harassment among pupils and how to deliver the new compulsory RSHE curriculum. The End Violence Against Women Coalition called for a taskforce made up of the government, education leaders, and experts on violence against women and girls ""to advise on next steps and drive the rollout of a whole school approach"". Peter Wanless, head of the NSPCC, said young people had exposed what was happening and their voices must shape a whole-school approach to preventing harmful sexual behaviour. Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""It seems obvious that more must be done with greater urgency to tackle the misuse of social media and the availability of online pornography."" A spokeswoman for Everyone's Invited called for an anonymous reporting system available in all schools. ""This would help reduce the massive gap between incidents and reporting emphasised in the Ofsted report,"" she said. The Report Abuse in Education helpline can be reached on 0800 136 663, on Monday to Friday 0800-2200, or 0900-1800 at weekends. It can also be contacted by email athelp@nspcc.org.uk Clarification 1 July 2021: Descriptions of the statistics have been edited to clarify that respondents referred to behaviours experienced by others their own age.

"Covid cases in children reach highest levelThe number of weekly cases among 0-14 year olds is now higher than in early January, figures show.ScotlandComments","The number of infections among younger children has passed the peak in early January Recorded Covid infections among children are now the highest they have been during the outbreak in Scotland. Weekly infections in 0-14 year olds reached 1,064 on 7 June - higher than the peak in early January, according to Public Health Scotland. While there is no evidence children are becoming seriously ill, growing numbers of pupils are off school. Nicola Sturgeon has said Scotland would move quickly to vaccinate 12-15 year olds if recommended by the regulator. The number of cases among the youngest age group is rising rapidly, having seen a near four-fold increase since early May. Despite the rise,medics have said children's wards are not seeing any significant rise in admissionsdue to Covid and said there is no reason for parents to worry. However, a number of schools have had to shut temporarily because of pupils testing positive, with St Peter's Primary in Galashiels among the latest to announce a short closure to allow contact tracing. Scotland would move quickly to vaccinate children Global vaccination should be 'focus' over teenagers UK approves Pfizer jab for 12 to 15-year-olds While most schools are open, growing numbers of pupils have been asked to stay home because they are possible contacts of pupils who have tested positive. Provisional figures indicate 15,687 pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons at the end of last week, with overall attendance dropping to 87.8%, the lowest percentage since pupils returned after Easter. Children under the age of 15 represent about quarter of the daily case numbers in recent weeks in terms of total numbers. However, when the size of the population in each age group is factored in, it is clear that infection rates are considerably higher among young adults and older teenagers. On 7 June, the weekly case rate among people in their early 20s was 277.2 per 100,000. Older teenagers had the second highest rate, at 228.4, while for younger children it was 122.9. What is clear from the data is that infections among older age groups are relatively low during the latest outbreaks, possibly a reflection of the rollout of the vaccination programme. More than half of Scotland's adult population has now had both doses of a Covid vaccine. The UK regulator hasapproved the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in childrenaged 12-15. The Scottish government is now awaiting advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI)  on whether it should begin vaccinating children. On Tuesday the first minister said the focus remained on getting all adults vaccinated but if the JCVI recommends vaccination of children, she saidScotland would ""move as quickly as possible to implement the advice"". Should all children get a vaccine? Scottish government adviser Prof Devi Sridhar has backed the rollout of the vaccine to those over the age of 12. Speaking to ITV's Good Morning Britain earlier this week, she said: ""If we want schools to continue without disruption in the autumn and lift restrictions so children can have a normal experience, we need to vaccinate them â if we wait and watch for the evidence it will be too late in the next few weeks. ""We have the supply. It's not a large amount, it's a couple of million doses to cover that population of 12-plus. ""Given that we know children can transmit, where we are going to see problems is not going to be in care homes, it's not going to be in hospitals, it's going to be in schools."" High school pupils in Scotland retuned to face-to-face lessons after the Easter holidays Another leading health expert, Prof Linda Bauld, has said she ""really welcomed"" plans to vaccinate teenagers but said completing the adult age groups must come first. She told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programme:""They will be next in line after we have issued vaccinations to all the 18-29 year olds, as Wales has already done. I really welcome the vaccine programme for teenagers... it will make a difference but they will not be able to receive it until older groups have. ""Over two million teenagers in the US have already received the vaccine, the trials suggest it's safe, so let's hope this all goes well."" With world leaders facing calls to do more to share vaccines internationally, some have argued a greater priority should be driving down infections globally, which could be the source of new variants. Christine Tait-Burkhard, an infection expert from University of Edinburgh, said it was a complex issue because while vaccination might help school attendance, there is little evidence of children becoming seriously ill. She told Drivetime with John Beattie: ""The last question is an ethical one. If we are starting to vaccinate children in this country yet other countries haven't got any vaccines or very little vaccines to vaccinate their most vulnerable. ""It is not only an ethical question, it's also a message that it sends to the world that says we don't care."" Prof Adam Finn, a member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, has said that if enough immunity was built up through the adult vaccination programme then vaccinating children may not be justified. He said: ""The issue is not that there's a problem doing it, it's just a question of whether we need to do it, given the very low incidence of serious illness in children and the fact that we're achieving so much with the adult programme at the moment with very high coverage. ""If indeed it turns out that children can be indirectly protected by the immunity that we induce in adults then there's clearly no justification for immunising - or at least immunising all of them.""

US 'to buy 500m Covid vaccine doses for world',"This video can not be played US President Joe Biden arrives in the UK ahead of the G7 summit US President Joe Biden's administration will provide 500 million doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to about 100 countries over the next two years, US media report. About 200 million doses will be distributed this year, with the remainder delivered in 2022. The US has been under pressure to raise vaccination rates in poor countries. The move comes as Mr Biden landed in the UK at the start of his first foreign trip as US president. The White House is yet to officially comment on the plan to roll out 500 million doses worldwide. But when asked if the US government had a vaccination strategy for the world, Mr Biden said: ""I have one, and I'll be announcing it,"" before boarding Air Force One. Awkward conversation looms for Biden and Putin Why are world leaders coming to the English seaside? An eager crowd awaited his arrival on Wednesdayat the RAF Mildenhall airbase in Suffolk, keen to catch a glimpse of Air Force One when Mr Biden touched down on Wednesday evening.

What's the plan for rich countries to share spare vaccines? The US had previously said it would donate 60m vaccine doses through Covax.

The first US-Russia summit of the Biden presidency will take place in Geneva, Switzerland, on 16 June. It comes at the tail end of Mr Biden's trip, giving the president plenty of time to hear from US allies beforehand. The White House has indicated that he intends to cover a ""full range of pressing issues"" with his Russian counterpart, including arms control, climate change, Russian military involvement in Ukraine, Russia's cyber-hacking activities and the jailing of Russian dissident Alexei Navalny. Three organisations linked to Mr Navalny were outlawed by a Moscow court on Wednesday as ""extremist"".

The transatlantic alliance (Nato) would remain a vital source of strength for the UK, Europe and the US, the president said. The White House said Mr Biden's meeting with Mr Johnson ahead of the summit would ""affirm the enduring strength"" of the countries' ""special relationship"". Both leaders took part in a virtual climate action summit hosted by the US in April but have not yet met in person.

It will be the 95-year-old monarch's first meeting with a foreign leader since the death of her husband Prince Philip. The next leg of Mr Biden's trip takes him to Brussels, where he will meet leaders of other Nato countries.
