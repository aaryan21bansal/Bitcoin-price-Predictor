President Trump's 'message to the world',"The papers are dominated by coverage of the US presidential inauguration - with every front page featuring a picture of Donald Trump. Mr Trump, says the Times, unveiled a new era,external- but it notes that the imagery was unusually dark for an inaugural address, with the president describing crime-ridden inner cities, catastrophic levels of drug addiction, and rusted-out factories. TheDaily Mirror describes it as a ""chilling inaugural speech"",externalin which Mr Trump vowed to put the United States first - ""and to hell with every other country"". TheDaily Mail says it was an incendiary speech,external, that both electrified and divided his nation. It points out the the new president had been expected to finally go easy on the vitriol and enjoy the pomp and ceremony of the event. But it says he used the speech to fire both barrels at the political establishment. Inthe view of the Financial Times, the new president made a defiant and uncompromising address,external, in which he promised to revive the country with an aggressive rejection of globalisation. The paper says his inauguration marked the end of an incredible journey that was propelled by a groundswell of populism. TheSun says more than a billion people watched the swearing in of the new president on TV,,externalwith 900,000 spectators on the National Mall in Washington to witness Mr Trump give a thumbs up and fist pump. However the paper notes that the crowd in Washington was only half of that which saw Barack Obama become the first black president in 2009. Writing in the Guardian, Gary Younge says there was no higher calling,external, no sense of a greater purpose, and no impassioned idealism. He describes the first words of Mr Trump's presidency as a ""crude and unapologetic appeal to nationalism"". In the i, Michael Day describes the address as ""lousy"",externaland says ""it hardly made the heart soar"". The editorials have mixed messages for President Trump. TheSun says that now he is in the Oval Office, he may be stunned by the complexity,externalof many of the problems he faces. It notes that plenty of people will write him off - but says that President Reagan was written off too - before he changed the world. TheDaily Mail claims his speech was ""truly astonishing"",external- as he tore up the rule book and delivered an inauguration address unlike any heard before. TheDaily Express asserts that the progressive left-leaning programme,external, which seemed woven into Western democracy, is now being unravelled. It says this is a profound change, which will affect us all. According to the Daily Telegraph, the inaugural address,externalwas what Mr Trump's supporters had gathered in their thousands to hear. But it says that for outsiders, it was an unsettling speech that seemed to presage the emergence of an inward-looking, isolationist America. TheDaily Mirror says the US and the rest of the world should be ""very afraid"",externalfollowing what it describes as the new president's ""rambling, pugnacious and protectionist speech"". TheGuardian is equally horrified,,externalsaying his America First nationalism was both ""crude and shameless"". It concludes the reality of a Trump presidency is a ""terrifying prospect"". A number of papers also leave space to comment on the person whose day it could have been: Hillary Clinton. TheDaily Mail says protocol demanded she attended the inauguration,externalwith her husband - and her solemn face showed the strain as she arrived at the US Capitol. TheDaily Express observes the former first lady looked more like she was attending a funeral.,external For theGuardian, Mrs Clinton stood stoically as chants of ""lock her up"",externalemanated from the crowd. However, on a more positive note, it adds that she left the ceremony waving to supporters and smiling broadly. Finally - despite their disagreements about President Trump - the papers all seem united on one point. TheDaily Mirror,,externalDaily Express,externaland theSun,externalall declare that the stand-out person at Friday's events was the new First Lady, Melania Trump. Many commentators,including the fashion director of the Daily Telegraph,external, compare her to Jackie Kennedy. TheGuardian says she wore a sleek ice blue dress and jacket,external, which was custom-made by US designer Ralph Lauren. For theDaily Mail, she did not put a foot wrong,external, describing her as the ""dazzling new First Lady"".

Unpredictable as he is, no-one is suggesting Donald Trump is about to describe âmoneyâ as a hoax.

Trump's angry call to arms,"This video can not be played Donald Trump said his inauguration day would be known as the day ""the people became the rulers of this nation again"" If Donald Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention was billed as ""midnight in America"" - a pessimistic view of the current conditions in the US - then his message on inauguration day was that it's always darkest before the dawn. The nation was in peril, but America was about to be great again. In an address that was tonally consistent with Candidate Trump's campaign rhetoric, the president railed against a Washington elite that flourished while the American people suffered. ""While they celebrated in the nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land,"" he said He described a nation blighted with rusted-out factories, families ""trapped in poverty"", a public education system that deprived ""young and beautiful"" children of all knowledge and cities wracked by violent crime. ""This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,"" he said. Early reports were that Mr Trump would offer a non-ideological appeal for national unity - and there were motions in that direction at times toward the end of his speech. This address, however, was very much aimed at his supporters - uniting the people with pitchforks against an out-of-touch establishment. It was a call to arms for the disaffected Americans who fuelled the improbable rise of the New York real-estate mogul and reality television star to the White House. He told them they would never again be forgotten or ignored. ""Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny,"" he said. This was not a message to the American people as a whole - many of whom likely feel the past resident of the White House, Barack Obama, reflected their beliefs and their diversity. This was a speech for the angry, the frustrated, the American voters who turned out in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Ohio to shake their fist at the status quo and take a chance on a man who was unlike any presidential politician who came before him. It should also serve as a wake-up call to American allies, as Mr Trump insisted that the US will put its own interests first both economically and militarily. ""We will follow two simple rules,"" he said. ""Buy American and hire American."" This video can not be played Donald Trump: 'America first, America first' For Mr Trump, giving this speech - and it clearly was a speech from his heart, if not directly from his pen - was the easy part. Making the promises to put America first, give power back to the people, bring jobs back, eradicate ""radical Islamic terrorism"" and rebuild US infrastructure isn't hard. The challenge now will be to live up to his rhetoric as a different kind of president - and bring the rest of the nation along with him on the journey. Congressional Republicans will advance their own priorities and follow their own path - one worn from years of tradition and ideology. What will Mr Trump do when their views diverge? Will an angry tweet or two suffice? Democrats will dig into the trenches and plot how to undermine Mr Trump at every turn, counting the days until 2020. American voters - at least ones in enough states to form an electoral college majority - have put their faith in Mr Trump. His presidency will be a remarkable experiment for American democracy, as it's clear after this speech that Mr Trump intends to govern as he campaigned. The new president has set the stage. Now, as he said on the steps of the Capitol, it is the hour of action. He has four years to make his supporters proud and prove all the doubters wrong. As Donald Trump prepares to take the oath of office, he faces public approval ratings for a newly elected president without precedent in modern US political history. The fivemost recent polls,externalfrom major news networks have his positive ratings at 32%, 37%, 40%, 40% and 44%. These early, heady early days of a president's administration are supposed to be his ""honeymoon"" with voters and political foes alike. It's the time when he's at the zenith of his power and most likely to be able to marshal bipartisan support for advancing his agenda with an eye toward making lasting changes. Instead, the partisan divisions in the US seem sharper than ever - and the publictends to agree,external. Part of this can be attributed to Mr Trump's narrow victory in the Electoral College and his nearly three million vote deficit to Hillary Clinton in the popular vote. Although the system worked the way it was designed, many Democrats feel cheated. Then there are the continued allegations of Russian meddling in the presidential election andrecent reports,externalthat there is an ongoing federal investigation into ties between former Trump advisors and Russian officials. Exacerbating all this has been Mr Trump's behaviour in the days since his election. He continues to act like a candidate on the campaign trail, lambasting his opponents - including members of the intelligence community - roasting the media and answering every perceived slight and criticism with a broadside of his own. If he refuses to tone down his attacks, his adversaries will remain in their political trenches. According toearly reports,external, Mr Trump's inaugural address will chart a different course - decrying ""ideological thinking"" and emphasising unity. If this turns out to be the case, the question becomes whether this marks the beginning of a new direction or a temporary blip. Columnist Mark Shieldhas observed,externalthat when choosing a new president, American voters often appear drawn toward candidates who have attributes their predecessor in the Oval Office seemingly lacked. Machiavellian Richard Nixon was replaced by do-gooder Jimmy Carter. Bill Clinton's unchecked appetites gave way to teetotaller George W Bush, whose perceived lack of eloquence stood in sharp contrast to next-in-line Barack Obama's erudition. Now Mr Obama, criticised even by some supporters as being overly professorial and detached, is handing over the reins of power to a man known for blunt bombast and raw emotion. It's a dramatic swing of presidential temperament that will be matched by the seismic political changes that loom over the coming days. For the past two years, Mr Obama and the Democrats in the executive branch have served as a check on Republicans in Congress. With threat of a presidential veto and the broad powers federal agencies possess, they've managed to keep the Obamacare health insurance system intact, adjust immigration law enforcement, impose new environmental regulations to address climate change and maintain the closer oversight of the financial sector set out in banking reform laws passed in 2009. Those days are over. For the first time in 10 years, the Republicans will have unified control over the federal government. They have the opportunity to advance their agenda - and roll back Mr Obama's legacy - on a wide variety of fronts. The biggest challenge facing Mr Trump and his party on this rainy January Inauguration Day is where exactly to start.

Peter Taylor: Martin McGuinness - end of a long journey,"The political retirement of Martin McGuinness on Thursday due to ill health marks the end of a remarkable journey. Perceived by some as a terrorist, others as a freedom fighter, he ended up a statesman, a journey similar to those previously made by other historical figures from Menachem Begin to Jomo Kenyatta and Nelson Mandela. It also marks the closing of a chapter in Northern Ireland's turbulent history in which Mr McGuinness played a crucial role both as perhaps the most important IRA leader on the island of Ireland and one of its most skilled and charismatic politicians. Without his endeavours, in umbilical political partnership with his former comrade-in- arms, Gerry Adams, I doubt if Northern Ireland, despite the continuing fragility of its institutions, would be where it is today. I first met Martin McGuinness 45 years ago this month, shortly after the day that became notorious as Bloody Sunday when British paratroops shot dead 13 civil rights marchers in the Bogside enclave of Londonderry/Derry. I remember watching a candle-lit procession on its way to the church where the coffins of the dead were lying and being told by the nationalist politician, John Hume, to keep an eye on one of the mourners. He pointed to Martin McGuinness. I followed his advice and soon met him on the steps of the gasworks that served as the IRA's headquarters in the Bogside. At the time he was second in command of the IRA's Derry Brigade. He was soon to become its commander. Martin McGuinness with Gerry Adams, 1987 He did not fit the stereotypical role of an IRA commander at the time. He was personable, highly articulate and utterly committed to his cause of getting the ""Brits"" out of the North. A few months later, following an IRA ceasefire, he was sitting down in a posh house in Chelsea, along with Gerry Adams, as part of the IRA delegation that met the Northern Ireland Secretary, Willie Whitelaw. The IRA said it wanted a British withdrawal by 1975. Not surprisingly, the talks got nowhere and it was back to the ""war"". If anyone had looked into a crystal ball at that time and told me that the young IRA commander would go on to become Northern Ireland's deputy prime minister, sharing power and joking, as ""the chuckle brothers"" with his former arch enemy, Ian Paisley, and then would don white tie and tails to dine with the Queen at Windsor Castle, I would have said that pigs might fly. But pigs did. ""The chuckle brothers"" - Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness at the Northern Ireland Assembly, 2007 Mr McGuinness's role was critical in persuading the IRA's rank-and-file that ""armed struggle"" had run its course and the future road to Sinn Fein's holy grail of a united Ireland lay in sharing power at Stormont with its unionist opponents. This was tantamount to accepting partition (the division of Ireland in 1922 into two states) and the role of the British state - albeit, as far as Sinn Fein is concerned, a temporary accommodation as a means to an end. Remarkably Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness finally persuaded the majority of the IRA to swallow the political heresy and agree to the ceasefire of 1994 that was to lead on to the Good Friday Agreement four years later. A measure of the faith and trust that rank-and-file IRA men and women had in Martin McGuinness is reflected in the sentiment I heard from many of them that ""if it's good enough for Martin, it's good enough for us"". Such sentiments speak volumes of Mr McGuinness and the esteem in which he was held as IRA leader. These landmark steps were only made possible as a result of a protracted and fraught secret back-channel dialogue, via an intermediary, between MI6 and MI5 in which Mr McGuinness was the key conduit to the IRA's ruling Army Council. Martin McGuinness leaves Stormont after resigning earlier this month But Mr McGuinness, because of his IRA past, remains a controversial figure. There are still some Unionists who would take issue withthe tribute paid by Ian Paisley's sonwho said that by working with his father, Martin McGuinness had ""saved lives"" and ""made countless lives better"". His critics can only see him as the former leader of a terrorist organisation responsible for a grievous toll of death and destruction. They will never forget - or forgive the IRA - for the lives of the hundreds of policemen, soldiers and civilians murdered in the IRA's campaign and the number of families who have been left bereft. But for me, the true recognition of the journey Mr McGuinness has made came in an interview I did with the mother of Marie Wilson, the young woman who died in the IRA's bomb attack on the Remembrance Day parade in Enniskillen in 1987. The intelligence services believe that Martin McGuinness, although he denies it, was at that time the acting head of the IRA's Northern Command that prosecuted the ""war"" in the North. In words of moving candour, Mrs Wilson said she respected Mr McGuinness's role in helping to bring the conflict to end and making such attacks, she hoped, a thing of the past.

"NHS: Fewer beds, higher patient demand","With many hospitals close to full in these difficult winter weeks, there has been much debate about the resources available in the health service. Patient demand is rising faster than the budget increases allocated to the NHS in England. Yet the number of hospital bed numbers has fallen steadily in recent years. So what is going on? The total number of overnight hospital beds in England fell from 144,455 at the start of the 2010/11 financial year to 129,458 in the middle of 2016 (the last recorded figures). The number of day beds over that period increased from 11,783 to 12,480. Looking further back into history reveals a sharper rate of decline. That current figure of overnight beds compares with almost 300,000 in 1987-88 according to figures from the Nuffield Trust. There was a steep fall in the late 1980s and early 1990s, then a more static position between 2000 and 2005 and then a resumption of the downward curve. The fall in bed numbers coincided with big changes in patterns of care. Institutionalised mental health treatment gave way to more care in a patient's local community so fewer beds were needed. Elderly care medicine changed too, with more older patients cared for closer to home. Medical advances meant that more patients could be treated as day cases. Average stays in hospitals for those needing overnight beds have fallen. There was a similar trend in other healthcare systems. As bed numbers fell in England, occupancy rates did not shoot up. This suggests that the health service has been more efficient with its care and dealing with more cases outside hospitals. Over the first three months of 2016 in England, 89% of beds were occupied on average compared to 86.6% over the same period in 2011. But has the system reached a tipping point? Hospital bed occupancy rates have crept up to 95% in the first weeks of 2017. Trust chiefs have reported days when they have been literally full with a new patient admitted only when one has been discharged. Back in October 2014, aNuffield Trust report,externalnoted that pressures were immense with demographic change and an ageing population the most significant drivers. ""Our analysis shows that if admission rates continue to rise, the NHS will need an additional 6.2m 'bed days' by 2022 - which equates to 22 hospitals with 800 beds each,"" it said. Nuffield went on to say that building new hospitals was not the answer and that curbing demand had to be part of the solution along with more joined up health and social care to keep people out of hospital where possible. Demand from older patients has risen That was their prognosis in 2014. Two-and-a-half years on there have been no obvious signs of progress. The drive for efficiency savings will continue but the calls for more investment in the NHS have become louder. The Chief Inspector of Hospitals in England, Sir Mike Richards,told the BBC this weekthat he was ""very concerned"" about the degree of strain experienced by hospitals. He continued by saying ""I believe the government will need to put more money into the NHS"" - though he added it was important the money was spent ""wisely"". The budget watchdog the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) argued this week that it was inevitable that health spending would rise because of demographic factors and the advance of medical technology. The OBR saidhealth spending could rise,externalfrom 6.9% of economic activity (GDP) in 2021 to 12.6% in 2066. The watchdog noted this could put great strain on public finances unless governments raised taxes or cut spending elsewhere. Ministers argue they have given the NHS in England above inflation increases in funding through till 2020. They also say that progress is being made at local level in joining up health and social care. But the demands for more money will continue, including from some on the Conservative benches in the Commons. And questions will be asked about the wisdom of reducing bed numbers and whether that can be reversed. Have you used NHS services in 2017? What was your experience?

Jonathan Head: Is Malaysia dragging its heels over MH370 search?20 January 2017 (00:10:39),"Many distraught relatives have called for the search to continue The announcement on 17 January that the search for MH370 was being suspended should have surprised no-one. At the tripartite meeting last July of the three countries involved in the search, Malaysia, Australia and China, they agreed that it would not be continued beyond the current 120,000sq km area (46,332 sq miles) of the southern Indian Ocean, unless there was credible new information showing a specific location for the crashed airliner. Nonetheless the families of the victims have condemned this requirement for a ""precise location"", calling it ""at best an erroneous expectation, and at worst a clever formulation to bury the search"". MH370: What we know Is it likely MH370 will ever be found? The passengers on board MH370 MH370: The key pieces of debris One man's search for answers They have pointed to a statement in December by the Australian Transport Safety Board, which is leading the search operation, that in view of the drift modelling carried out by the Australian scientific organisation CSIRO for debris from MH370 found along the East African coast, there was ""strong evidence that the aircraft is most likely to be located to the north of the current indicative underwater search area"". And with no trace of the airliner found after an exhaustive two-and-a-half-year search, all the experts agree they have been looking in the wrong area. There were 14 nationalities among the 227 passengers and 12 crew on board the plane The CSIRO drift models suggest the search should be shifted to a 25,000sq km area immediately north of the existing zone, along the arc that satellite data shows the plane must have travelled. It might require an additional $40-50m to extend the search operation into the new area, on top of the $160m already spent. But the three governments appear unmoved, sticking rigidly to the formula they agreed last July, although the Australian and Malaysian governments insist cost is not a factor in their decision to stop searching. However in an interview with ABC News on Tuesday, Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester made the point that any decision to resume the search was ""primarily Malaysia's call"". That underlines a problem which has troubled the search operation from the start: who is really responsible? Back in February 2015 Australia submitted a request to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which regulates international air travel, for clearer guidelines on which country should be responsible for both organising and funding an extended search operation. Under existing guidelines Australia is responsible for initial search-and-rescue efforts in the vast areas of ocean off its western coast. But once it was clear there would be no survivors, it became a search-and-recovery operation, for which responsibility is not clear. This video can not be played Flight MH370: Audio recording reveals final cockpit communications The ICAO designates to Malaysia, the flag state of the missing plane, the task of leading the accident investigation, but it is not clear whether that includes running the extended search. This was important because by 2015 Australia had shouldered most of the financial burden, and people were beginning to complain. After all, the specialised ships and detection equipment used in the search had to be rented from a Dutch salvage company; any of the three countries could have covered this cost. Only six of the MH370 passengers were Australians, whereas 153 came from China, which has so far contributed relatively little, around $16m, although the ICAO imposes no requirement on it do so. The Malaysian government now says it has contributed a total of $112m, but the official Australian figures suggest it has actually spent less than that. So why does Malaysia not take the initiative to fund an extended search? The Malaysian Transport Ministry responded to this question with the formula from last July, that all three countries had agreed they first needed indications of a specific location for the crash site, despite that fact that such detailed information in a huge expanse of sea is extremely unlikely to be found. Pieces probably from the plane have been found as far away as Madagascar Relatives of the passengers have also criticised the Malaysian authorities for being so slow to request recovered pieces of debris, eight of which are now believed to be almost certainly from the missing airliner. That debris is important: it has not only helped ascertain a probable alternative location for the plane; it has also helped confirm how the aircraft ended its flight, with Australian investigators concluding that it plunged into the sea, and was not under the control of the pilot. Malaysia has at times given the impression of being a reluctant lead investigator, happy for Australia to do most of the legwork. This video can not be played Grace Subathirai Nathan: ""I want to know what happened to my mother"" Aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas describes Malaysia's approach as ""inexcusable and irresponsible. It is their plane, and their responsibility to find out what happened to it. They are walking away from their commitment to international aviation and the flying public"". The Malaysian Ministry of Transport says only that ""all decisions with regards to the MH370 search have and will always be in the spirit of tripartite co-operation."" If it is primarily Malaysia's call to restart the search operation, it looks unlikely to make it.

Kerb appeal,"Police say it is a matter of respect for drivers and cyclists Police in one London borough have said they will not prosecute cyclists who ride on the pavement, but is the decision a good move for safety and will it be adopted in other parts of the country? Officers who work in Camden say they will not enforce the law ""without good reason"" and instead want to look at why riders are taking to paths instead of using the road. Inspiredby a similar operation launched by West Midlands Police, officers will talk to cyclists they see using pavements in the Primrose Hill area of the city, as well as stopping and warning drivers who overtake cyclists with a gap of less than 1.5m. They hope to identify the most dangerous spots where riders ""feel forced"" onto the path. Anyone encroaching inside the safe passing distance, widely considered to be at least 1.5m (4.9ft), will be stopped But the decision to stop fining cyclists has polarised opinion. Thomas Newton, who lives and works in London, said: ""It's a vehicle, it belongs on the road, end of story. ""I've had several near misses with riders jumping red lights and not stopping at zebra crossings. I appreciate that there are many conscientious cyclists, but it's not those guys who are the problem."" Jonathan Morris, from Hatfield, said he feels more at risk from cyclists than cars and would not like to see the police dropping fines. ""Cyclists are everywhere, can ride very fast and cause injuries because they dart all over the place and seem to show a disregard to pedestrians,"" he said. ""Cars and other motorised vehicles stay in the road and are mostly predicable - even when it comes to rushing through amber traffic lights."" But Dan Jestico, who cycles with his two young children, disagrees. ""It is entirely possible to ride sensibly on the pavement,"" he said. ""No one is suggesting that cyclists should ride like idiots anywhere, be it pavement or road. ""I cycle my two small kids to nursery on the pavement. It would be ludicrous for us to ride on the road."" Emma Richardson, from Nottingham, says it is all a matter of context. ""I don't think it would be appropriate for a cyclist to try and weave through a busy street as they risk injuring pedestrians,"" she said. ""But if the pavement is very empty, then no problem really. Just use common sense."" This video can not be played Broadcaster Janet Street-Porter says she believes pedestrians' rights are being eroded The relevant law in England and Wales is the 1835 Highways Act, which created the offence of wilfully riding on a footpath by the side of the road Enforcement of the law lies with chief police officers of each force The offence was modified by the Labour government in 1999 to include a fixed penalty notice of Â£50 The Home Office issued guidance calling for careful use of police discretion, particularly in respect of children The law is reflected in the Highway Code which prohibits cycling on the pavement - Rule 64: ""You MUST not cycle on a pavement"" There are similar rules in both Scotland and Northern Ireland Source: Stuart Kightley, partner at Cycle Injuries Solicitors A spokeswoman for the National Police Chiefs' Council said enforcing the fines is ""a local issue"" and the decision would depend on each force area and ""challenges they face locally"". But Sustrans, an organisation promoting sustainable transport, urged police forces to follow the lead of officers in Camden. ""We don't advocate cycling on pavements, but often fining people that do is a harsh line to take,"" Tim Burns, senior policy and partnerships advisor at Sustrans says. ""Many people in the UK do not feel confident or safe riding a bicycle on our roads. If we are to encourage cycling as an efficient and healthier way to get around our towns and cities whilst reducing cycling on pavements we need to better understand the concerns and needs of people and provide adequate cycle provision for them."" Living Streets, a campaign group for pedestrians, wants better enforcement of the law, not less. Dr Rachel Lee, policy and research coordinator for Living Streets, says: ""We know most cyclists prefer to use the road, but a small minority continue to ride their bicycles on the pavement for reasons of convenience or safety. ""This can make pedestrians feel vulnerable - especially those who are visually impaired, suffer hearing loss or have mobility issues. ""Although Camden's emphasis on education is welcome, cycling on pavements is illegal. We want better enforcement of the law."" In other parts of the world, cycling alongside pedestrians is seen as the norm. Countries including Germany, Switzerland and Spain have invested in large networks of cycle paths or pavements that are split between cyclists and pedestrians. Some cities in the US, such as Minneapolis and Portland, have also rolled out the extra space for those on two wheels. And in places like Fukuoka, Japan, bicycles are banned from the road entirely and wide pavements ensure safety for both walkers and riders. Local councils across the country say they are spending more money on creating safer cycling routes for their residents. When he was mayor of London, Boris Johnson invested Â£50m intocreating cycle ""superhighways""across the capital. Nottingham City Council is alsoinvesting Â£6m to build cycle ""superhighways"" across the cityand it wants riders to stick to the roads. A spokesman said: ""We are investing substantially in infrastructure which allows cyclists to be segregated from other road traffic and from pedestrians, which clearly is the best possible solution for everyone. ""This isn't possible in every location and so we look to cyclists to use roads where no alternative exists. We will often warn cyclists using pavements that it is an offence that could result in a fine.""

A divisive Trump may call for unity,"This video can not be played Donald Trump said his inauguration day would be known as the day ""the people became the rulers of this nation again"" If Donald Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention was billed as ""midnight in America"" - a pessimistic view of the current conditions in the US - then his message on inauguration day was that it's always darkest before the dawn. The nation was in peril, but America was about to be great again. In an address that was tonally consistent with Candidate Trump's campaign rhetoric, the president railed against a Washington elite that flourished while the American people suffered. ""While they celebrated in the nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land,"" he said He described a nation blighted with rusted-out factories, families ""trapped in poverty"", a public education system that deprived ""young and beautiful"" children of all knowledge and cities wracked by violent crime. ""This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,"" he said. Early reports were that Mr Trump would offer a non-ideological appeal for national unity - and there were motions in that direction at times toward the end of his speech. This address, however, was very much aimed at his supporters - uniting the people with pitchforks against an out-of-touch establishment. It was a call to arms for the disaffected Americans who fuelled the improbable rise of the New York real-estate mogul and reality television star to the White House. He told them they would never again be forgotten or ignored. ""Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny,"" he said. This was not a message to the American people as a whole - many of whom likely feel the past resident of the White House, Barack Obama, reflected their beliefs and their diversity. This was a speech for the angry, the frustrated, the American voters who turned out in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Ohio to shake their fist at the status quo and take a chance on a man who was unlike any presidential politician who came before him. It should also serve as a wake-up call to American allies, as Mr Trump insisted that the US will put its own interests first both economically and militarily. ""We will follow two simple rules,"" he said. ""Buy American and hire American."" This video can not be played Donald Trump: 'America first, America first' For Mr Trump, giving this speech - and it clearly was a speech from his heart, if not directly from his pen - was the easy part. Making the promises to put America first, give power back to the people, bring jobs back, eradicate ""radical Islamic terrorism"" and rebuild US infrastructure isn't hard. The challenge now will be to live up to his rhetoric as a different kind of president - and bring the rest of the nation along with him on the journey. Congressional Republicans will advance their own priorities and follow their own path - one worn from years of tradition and ideology. What will Mr Trump do when their views diverge? Will an angry tweet or two suffice? Democrats will dig into the trenches and plot how to undermine Mr Trump at every turn, counting the days until 2020. American voters - at least ones in enough states to form an electoral college majority - have put their faith in Mr Trump. His presidency will be a remarkable experiment for American democracy, as it's clear after this speech that Mr Trump intends to govern as he campaigned. The new president has set the stage. Now, as he said on the steps of the Capitol, it is the hour of action. He has four years to make his supporters proud and prove all the doubters wrong. As Donald Trump prepares to take the oath of office, he faces public approval ratings for a newly elected president without precedent in modern US political history. The fivemost recent polls,externalfrom major news networks have his positive ratings at 32%, 37%, 40%, 40% and 44%. These early, heady early days of a president's administration are supposed to be his ""honeymoon"" with voters and political foes alike. It's the time when he's at the zenith of his power and most likely to be able to marshal bipartisan support for advancing his agenda with an eye toward making lasting changes. Instead, the partisan divisions in the US seem sharper than ever - and the publictends to agree,external. Part of this can be attributed to Mr Trump's narrow victory in the Electoral College and his nearly three million vote deficit to Hillary Clinton in the popular vote. Although the system worked the way it was designed, many Democrats feel cheated. Then there are the continued allegations of Russian meddling in the presidential election andrecent reports,externalthat there is an ongoing federal investigation into ties between former Trump advisors and Russian officials. Exacerbating all this has been Mr Trump's behaviour in the days since his election. He continues to act like a candidate on the campaign trail, lambasting his opponents - including members of the intelligence community - roasting the media and answering every perceived slight and criticism with a broadside of his own. If he refuses to tone down his attacks, his adversaries will remain in their political trenches. According toearly reports,external, Mr Trump's inaugural address will chart a different course - decrying ""ideological thinking"" and emphasising unity. If this turns out to be the case, the question becomes whether this marks the beginning of a new direction or a temporary blip. Columnist Mark Shieldhas observed,externalthat when choosing a new president, American voters often appear drawn toward candidates who have attributes their predecessor in the Oval Office seemingly lacked. Machiavellian Richard Nixon was replaced by do-gooder Jimmy Carter. Bill Clinton's unchecked appetites gave way to teetotaller George W Bush, whose perceived lack of eloquence stood in sharp contrast to next-in-line Barack Obama's erudition. Now Mr Obama, criticised even by some supporters as being overly professorial and detached, is handing over the reins of power to a man known for blunt bombast and raw emotion. It's a dramatic swing of presidential temperament that will be matched by the seismic political changes that loom over the coming days. For the past two years, Mr Obama and the Democrats in the executive branch have served as a check on Republicans in Congress. With threat of a presidential veto and the broad powers federal agencies possess, they've managed to keep the Obamacare health insurance system intact, adjust immigration law enforcement, impose new environmental regulations to address climate change and maintain the closer oversight of the financial sector set out in banking reform laws passed in 2009. Those days are over. For the first time in 10 years, the Republicans will have unified control over the federal government. They have the opportunity to advance their agenda - and roll back Mr Obama's legacy - on a wide variety of fronts. The biggest challenge facing Mr Trump and his party on this rainy January Inauguration Day is where exactly to start.

Who will succeed Martin McGuinness?,"Sinn FÃ©in's successor as Northern Ireland leader of the party will be announced next week Former deputy first minister Martin McGuinness has confirmedhe will not stand in the Northern Ireland Assembly election. His successor as Sinn FÃ©in's leader in Northern Ireland will be announced next week. So who will replace him? Three names are tipped as the most likely contenders - Finance Minister MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir, Health Minister Michelle O'Neill and MLA and former MP Conor Murphy. Conor Murphy is a key member of the Sinn FÃ©in negotiating team who has represented the party at the Hillsborough, Leeds Castle and St Andrew's negotiations as well as playing a key role in the Fresh Start agreement negotiated at Stormont House. Conor Murphy has represented the party at the Hillsborough, Leeds Castle and St Andrew's negotiations After his election to the assembly in 1998, he was the party's chief whip. In 2005, he became the first Sinn FÃ©in member to be elected as MP for Newry and Armagh. Following Mr Murphy's re-election to the assembly in 2007, he was appointed minister for regional development, a position that he held until 2011. He wascriticised for the NI Water crisisas minister during the winter of 2010/11. In 2012, ahead of a ban on double-jobbing, he left the assembly to concentrate on his role as an MP. He returned to the Assembly in 2015 when Mickey Brady was elected MP for the constituency.  Since re-entering the assembly he has been a member of both the Enterprise, Trade and Investment Committee and the Public Accounts Committee. Health Minister Michelle O'Neill has held various senior positions within Sinn FÃ©in. She has worked in the Assembly since 1998, initially as political adviser to MP and former MLA Francie Molloy, before being elected to Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council in 2005. As health minister since May 2016, tackling mounting hospital waiting lists has been a huge task for Mrs O'Neill Mrs O'Neill was elected to the assembly for the Mid Ulster constituency in 2007, sitting on the education committee and serving as Sinn FÃ©in's health spokesperson. In 2011, she was appointed as minister for agriculture and rural development. The following year, she announced that the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) wouldmove to a former British army barracks in Ballykelly, County Londonderry. Following the announcement, it came to light that Strabane had been chosen as a more suitable location by an internal DARD assessment, a decision that Mrs O'Neill then overruled. In February 2013, it was also revealed that the decision had beenquestioned by the Finance Minister Sammy Wilson. As health minister since 2016, tackling mounting hospital waiting lists have been a huge task for Mrs O'Neill. In October, she launched a10-year plan to transform health service, saying it would improve a system that was at ""breaking point"". Opposition politicians questioned the lack of details in the plan, which was not costed. But it set out a range of priorities, including a new model of care involving a team of professionals based around GP surgeries. MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir has previously been a writer, journalist and publisher of the Belfast Media Group newspapers and the Irish Echo in New York. MÃ¡irtÃ­n Ã Muilleoir became finance minister in May 2016 The former west Belfast councillor served as Lord Mayor of Belfast from June 2013-June 2014 and was broadly praised for reaching out to unionists, despiteattacks by loyalist protestors. Mr Ã Muilleoir subsequently stood unsuccessfully as Sinn FÃ©in's candidate for South Belfast in the 2015 Westminster election, but was returned in the Stormont Assembly election of May 2016. As finance minister, he was the first Sinn FÃ©in minister to hold amajor economic briefin the Northern Ireland Assembly. His role has included leading the implementation of the devolution of corporation tax, due to happen in 2018. However, he became embroiled in controversy in 2016 when news emerged about a back channel of communication between aStormont committee chairman and a witnesswho was giving evidence on the Nama property loan sale. Mr Ã Muilleoir denied knowledge of allegedcoaching of loyalist blogger Jamie Brysonby finance committee chair DaithÃ­ McKay before his appearance.

What are stretch marks and can you prevent them?,"Model Chrissy Teigen has been praised by fans after posting a photo on Twitter showing off her stretch marks. The mum-of-one took to social media toshow an image of her inner thigh,externalwith the caption ""Whatevs"",  which has been retweeted 19,000 times and received 148,000 likes. Her photo was welcomed by other Twitter users who shared posts of their own stretch marks or replied with positive messages. Singer SuChwrote,external: ""Stretch marks develop when tremendous growth happen in a short period of time. They're a source of pride, embrace them."" Marisa V praised the model for posting the photo,adding,external: ""Thank you for being real, we need more public figures who aren't afraid to show their perfect imperfections."" Model Chrissy Teigen posted an image of her stretch marks to her 3.4m Twitter followers Keesha Turnerwrote,external: ""Thx, need to show this to my 14 y/o who's had them for a few yrs. She's beautiful, you all too!"" Ms Teigen, who has a daughter with singer John Legend, went on to say she did not post the photo for ""praise"" and told her followers she liked the pattern and ""they're so soft"". She has previously spoken openly about her stretch marks - sometimes referred to by women as their 'tiger stripes'. In 2015 she pledged to never use photoshop imaging apps again because ""we've forgot what normal people look like now"". Stretch marks are marks on the skin which occur when it has been stretched Dr Sweta Rai, from the British Association of Dermatologists, explains: Stretch marks are visible lines or marks on the skin that occur when it is stretched, such as during rapid weight gain, which causes the elastic fibres to break. They are effectively a rupture of collagen that is visible on the skin's surface. Why do people get them? Skin has a natural level of elasticity, however, once it is stretched past this the elastic fibres break. Stretch marks can occur to teenagers experiencing a growth spurt, during rapid weight gain, pregnancy or when the skin is stretched a great deal in a short period of time. Do they affect only women? They mainly affect women but can also occur in teenagers and men. Do you always get them in pregnancy? The British Association of Dermatologists says moisturising creams do not prevent stretch marks A woman's likelihood of getting stretch marks during pregnancy is partly determined by genetic factors but also by how big she grows. Mothers expecting more than one baby are more likely to develop stretch marks than in a single pregnancy. They are not an inevitable consequence of pregnancy, however, it is very common, affecting around 90% of women. What is the emotional impact? It is very important not to trivialise conditions like stretch marks. Like many disfiguring skin conditions or scars, stretch marks can have a lasting psychological, or emotional impact. They may cause people to feel self-conscious, socially anxious, and can lower self-confidence, increase social isolation, and lead to body image issues. This can be particularly the case when in social situations where stretch marks might be on display, such as at the swimming pool or at the start of a new intimate relationship. What can prevent you getting them? Unfortunately studies have shown that it is very hard to prevent stretch marks. Despite a large number of products claiming they can helping prevent them, there is very little evidence of their effectiveness. Stetch marks can affect men and teenagers as well as women Can they disappear? Gradually, stretch marks tend to fade from red or purple to thinner white or silver lines that are less noticeable. Some will disappear altogether. It can however take a year or longer for the marks to fade. Do moisturising creams help? Moisturising creams will not prevent the rupturing of the collagen so will not prevent stretch marks, but may make the skin look and feel smoother. It is probably not worth investing large sums of money into lotions with the belief that these will rid you of stretch marks - it is best to wait and see if they disappear of their own accord. What treatment is available? If your stretch marks are a problem, you can consult a dermatologist to discuss possible treatments. However, this is likely to be a service you will pay for as this is a cosmetic concern not funded within the NHS. There are some effective treatments for stretch marks if treated within a few months of development, for example certain laser treatments.

New secondary school league tables,"As new-style secondary school league tables for England are published, the BBC News website takes you through the changes that are taking place this year. Until this year, secondary school performance has been judged mainly by what proportion of pupils get five GCSEs at grade A*-C, including English and maths. Instead two new measures, known asAttainment 8,externalandProgress 8,external, have been adopted. These will now be used by the government to judge whether schools are performing adequately. For many years, teachers and heads had complained that to judge a school by its results in five GCSEs alone was unfair, because it did not offer broader information about the ability of the pupils being taught. Obviously if a high-achieving child comes to a school, it will not take as much effort to get them to a good GCSE grade as it would a lower-achieving child. So schools which were working with more challenging pupils with low prior attainment were effectively marked down in the league tables, because this extra challenge was not considered. There was also concern that the benchmark only assessed pupils who got results at grade C and above. The new measure takes into account achievement from grades A*-G. Taphereto search for the results for your area. In basic terms, it aims to measure how well a school is serving its pupils by looking at where they started and where they end up. It does this by looking at attainment in eight GCSE, or equivalent, subjects from grade A*-G for each pupil. These results are then compared against the results of other pupils who came into secondary schools nationally with the same attainment levels. A figure for those results across the school year group is then calculated. This result is then set within confidence levels, which set out how accurate the government believes the Progress 8 score is. Progress 8 scores generally fall somewhere between -1 and 1. The number (which is pretty abstract to all but the statisticians, as Progress 8 scores generally fall somewhere between -1 and 1) is then placed into one of five bands: well above average above average average below average well below average. It is these bandings which will be of most use to parents. Attainment 8 is about the raw results across individual pupils' best eight subjects. But they are not just any old subjects. English and maths are compulsory - and worth double points. Then there is the choice of three subjects from theEnglish Baccalaureate,external(core academic subjects), and any other three from the DfE's approved list of qualifications - including vocational qualifications. The results are only recorded at the school level and an average score per pupil is calculated and published. The maximum number of points per school is 80 points per pupil. The national average across all state secondary school is 49.9 this year. The short answer is that it is thought to be fairer to see a pupil's best achievement across a broader spectrum of subjects. Teachers and head teachers had complained that the five good GCSEs measure was too narrow. They also argued that the more recently introduced English Baccalaureate was too prescriptive and only relevant for the more academic students. If attainment across a broader range of subjects are be counted, then arts subjects and vocational qualifications count for something in school accountability as well. This has been a key concern, because the new measures are more complicated to read than the old tables based on five GCSE scores. Progress 8 scores are far more abstract in that they generally fall somewhere between -1 and 1. However, there are some figures in brackets below each score on the tables which measure how confident statisticians are that the figure above is accurate. When the DfE trialled the new measures on panels of parents, many were confused by these scores and so the banded descriptions were introduced to aid understanding. Secondary head teachers say that while is important for parents to look at a school's Progress 8 score, they should focus broadly on the descriptions such as ""above average"". Parents may also wish to look at schools' Attainment 8 scores to have an overall idea of how they  perform on GCSE results. School performance measures are used just as much by officials to monitor standards and ultimately Progress 8 is an accountability measure. A school is considered potentially failing if its Progress 8 score falls in the well below average band. No, these new measures apply to England only. However, there have been changes in terms of school accountability recently in Wales and Scotland. Data on how well Scottish pupils doin reading, writing and numeracy was published for the first time, as part of a new Curriculum for Excellence. The Welsh Assembly hasrecently reintroduced the publication of performance information,after abolishing it in 2001, in an attempt to raise standards. Schools are now given a colour code - green, yellow, amber or red - according to how well they are performing. School league tables are not published in Northern Ireland.

Trump and Obama: A story of two Americas,"So the pendulum swings again. They are polar opposites, inversions, thesis and antithesis, from the skinny kid with the funny name to the old guy with the funny hair, chalk to his cheese. It says a lot about the Disunited States of America that two such different brands are its best-selling political products. In his final week, President Barack Obama's many admirers are determined to behave with the brittle exaggerated optimism of mourners at a wake, determined to celebrate the achievements of a dear friend, rather than wail over his absence. They may even convince you it is hope that makes their eyes glisten so brightly. Their love - not too strong a word - for this man they mourn begs the question: ""What achievements, what legacy?"" And in what way did he fail? For Democrats can blame turnout, blame Twitter, blame Hillary Clinton, blame fake news, but surely the failure of his party to get a third term in the White House was in some sense Mr Obama's responsibility? As he said, his name wasn't on the ballot, but his achievements were. This goes to the heart of a question about character: his, Donald Trump's, most importantly their country's sense of self. President Obama often appeared to be deep in thought From the moment of his first victory in 2008, President Obama was pinned in place by America's horrible history. Even extraordinary actions would struggle to escape the orbit of the mundane, buried under the weight of that primary achievement. The first line in the encyclopaedias would always be: ""The USA's first black president."" So it has come to pass. But few, eight years ago, expected him to be followed into the White House by someone who is in every respect his opposite. You could argue President Obama has no legacy, the achievements of eight years already lie shredded by the election of Donald Trump. Mr Trump has indeed promised to undo Obamacare, the Iran deal, the Paris climate change deal, new environmental rules and regulations and much else that he has derided as ""horrible"". But we can't really judge Mr Obama's legacy until we know how profoundly it will be undone. This will be important. How history sees Barack Obama depends on Mr Trump, in more ways than one. More BBC News stories about Barack Obama Can Obamacare be repealed? More BBC News stories about Donald Trump Donald Trump's life story Because this is about character, charisma and storytelling. For a masterful writer, for a man who quite literally wrote his own tale long before others could define him, it is sobering the way Mr Obama lost control of the narrative in the White House. What were seen as positive qualities, a relief and a reaction after George W Bush, looked less favourable to some as time went on. Thoughtfulness seemed like dithering, eloquence became loquaciousness, ""no drama Obama"" wasn't the soap opera some in the American public craved. Mind you, there was no massive switch thrown where most of America changed its mind. The votes involved were comparatively few: this is still the old story of two Americas, as different as Donald Trump and Barack Obama. Mr Obama is cool, Mr Trump is hot. Indeed, Mr Obama is cool when Mr Trump is not. He's deliberative, Mr Trump is instinctive. Mr Trump is angry where Mr Obama is preternaturally calm. Donald Trump's inauguration takes place against the backdrop of a divided US One suspects Mr Obama walking alone in the Rose Garden conducts several inner monologues at once, we know Mr Trump blasts out his first thoughts in 140 characters on Twitter. Mr Trump wouldeat crocodiles and drink vinegar,externalwhile Obama soliloquises on maybes and might-have-beens. If US politics was a Western, Mr Obama would be the magical preacher, mystically advocating collective action, Mr Trump would be charismatic snake oil salesman, shouting from the side of the wagon, captivating, infuriating and embodying a certain sort of frustration. We don't know whether, when the black hats ride into town, he'll surprise us all with heroic feats, or be discovered cowering under the saloon counter. But Mr Trump is already much closer than Mr Obama to an American archetype - the boaster -bumptious, self-confident, quick to anger, but with a confidence and optimism in his own abilities, which respect no horizons. What is attention-grabbing is when the horizons have to buckle and broaden and widen in the face of that force of will. Mr Trump is the embodiment of the sort of America who shocks Europeans: brash and vulgar and unsophisticated. Many in the US, particularly on the coasts and in the cities, share that horror. But the truth is this is a deeply divided country. Mr Trump speaks for those other Americans who felt Mr Obama never did. When Mr Obama says:,external""The great American hero - Lincoln - could see the fundamental contradictions of the American experiment clearly,"" they can't. They didn't want nuance. They didn't want empathy towards other cultures and religions. They didn't want, in the end, cool. They want righteous fury and clear promises to do something dramatic to make it stop hurting - whatever ""it"" is. Two Americas face each other, watching their new president. Most are nervous, expecting a rollercoaster ride. Many are hopeful. These are an optimistic people, and he is, after all, not a passing politician but their head of state, the person who embodies their country. Even those who want him to fail, want their country to succeed. In mining country, in West Virginia, I was struck by those who had hope for a new future under a new president. Not faith, not trust, but hope, some what shop-soiled and held together with gaffer tape, but hope nonetheless. That, at least, is similar to 2008. But what the first line of Mr Trump's biography says is not defined from the first day.

Seismic change but what first for Trump?,"This video can not be played Donald Trump said his inauguration day would be known as the day ""the people became the rulers of this nation again"" If Donald Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention was billed as ""midnight in America"" - a pessimistic view of the current conditions in the US - then his message on inauguration day was that it's always darkest before the dawn. The nation was in peril, but America was about to be great again. In an address that was tonally consistent with Candidate Trump's campaign rhetoric, the president railed against a Washington elite that flourished while the American people suffered. ""While they celebrated in the nation's capital, there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our land,"" he said He described a nation blighted with rusted-out factories, families ""trapped in poverty"", a public education system that deprived ""young and beautiful"" children of all knowledge and cities wracked by violent crime. ""This American carnage stops right here and stops right now,"" he said. Early reports were that Mr Trump would offer a non-ideological appeal for national unity - and there were motions in that direction at times toward the end of his speech. This address, however, was very much aimed at his supporters - uniting the people with pitchforks against an out-of-touch establishment. It was a call to arms for the disaffected Americans who fuelled the improbable rise of the New York real-estate mogul and reality television star to the White House. He told them they would never again be forgotten or ignored. ""Your voice, your hopes and your dreams will define our American destiny,"" he said. This was not a message to the American people as a whole - many of whom likely feel the past resident of the White House, Barack Obama, reflected their beliefs and their diversity. This was a speech for the angry, the frustrated, the American voters who turned out in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida and Ohio to shake their fist at the status quo and take a chance on a man who was unlike any presidential politician who came before him. It should also serve as a wake-up call to American allies, as Mr Trump insisted that the US will put its own interests first both economically and militarily. ""We will follow two simple rules,"" he said. ""Buy American and hire American."" This video can not be played Donald Trump: 'America first, America first' For Mr Trump, giving this speech - and it clearly was a speech from his heart, if not directly from his pen - was the easy part. Making the promises to put America first, give power back to the people, bring jobs back, eradicate ""radical Islamic terrorism"" and rebuild US infrastructure isn't hard. The challenge now will be to live up to his rhetoric as a different kind of president - and bring the rest of the nation along with him on the journey. Congressional Republicans will advance their own priorities and follow their own path - one worn from years of tradition and ideology. What will Mr Trump do when their views diverge? Will an angry tweet or two suffice? Democrats will dig into the trenches and plot how to undermine Mr Trump at every turn, counting the days until 2020. American voters - at least ones in enough states to form an electoral college majority - have put their faith in Mr Trump. His presidency will be a remarkable experiment for American democracy, as it's clear after this speech that Mr Trump intends to govern as he campaigned. The new president has set the stage. Now, as he said on the steps of the Capitol, it is the hour of action. He has four years to make his supporters proud and prove all the doubters wrong. As Donald Trump prepares to take the oath of office, he faces public approval ratings for a newly elected president without precedent in modern US political history. The fivemost recent polls,externalfrom major news networks have his positive ratings at 32%, 37%, 40%, 40% and 44%. These early, heady early days of a president's administration are supposed to be his ""honeymoon"" with voters and political foes alike. It's the time when he's at the zenith of his power and most likely to be able to marshal bipartisan support for advancing his agenda with an eye toward making lasting changes. Instead, the partisan divisions in the US seem sharper than ever - and the publictends to agree,external. Part of this can be attributed to Mr Trump's narrow victory in the Electoral College and his nearly three million vote deficit to Hillary Clinton in the popular vote. Although the system worked the way it was designed, many Democrats feel cheated. Then there are the continued allegations of Russian meddling in the presidential election andrecent reports,externalthat there is an ongoing federal investigation into ties between former Trump advisors and Russian officials. Exacerbating all this has been Mr Trump's behaviour in the days since his election. He continues to act like a candidate on the campaign trail, lambasting his opponents - including members of the intelligence community - roasting the media and answering every perceived slight and criticism with a broadside of his own. If he refuses to tone down his attacks, his adversaries will remain in their political trenches. According toearly reports,external, Mr Trump's inaugural address will chart a different course - decrying ""ideological thinking"" and emphasising unity. If this turns out to be the case, the question becomes whether this marks the beginning of a new direction or a temporary blip. Columnist Mark Shieldhas observed,externalthat when choosing a new president, American voters often appear drawn toward candidates who have attributes their predecessor in the Oval Office seemingly lacked. Machiavellian Richard Nixon was replaced by do-gooder Jimmy Carter. Bill Clinton's unchecked appetites gave way to teetotaller George W Bush, whose perceived lack of eloquence stood in sharp contrast to next-in-line Barack Obama's erudition. Now Mr Obama, criticised even by some supporters as being overly professorial and detached, is handing over the reins of power to a man known for blunt bombast and raw emotion. It's a dramatic swing of presidential temperament that will be matched by the seismic political changes that loom over the coming days. For the past two years, Mr Obama and the Democrats in the executive branch have served as a check on Republicans in Congress. With threat of a presidential veto and the broad powers federal agencies possess, they've managed to keep the Obamacare health insurance system intact, adjust immigration law enforcement, impose new environmental regulations to address climate change and maintain the closer oversight of the financial sector set out in banking reform laws passed in 2009. Those days are over. For the first time in 10 years, the Republicans will have unified control over the federal government. They have the opportunity to advance their agenda - and roll back Mr Obama's legacy - on a wide variety of fronts. The biggest challenge facing Mr Trump and his party on this rainy January Inauguration Day is where exactly to start.

'The day the world changes',"It is show time for the showman,the Times declares,external, as the papers look ahead to the inauguration of America's 45th president. For the Mail, Mirror and the Sun, it is the Day of the Donald. But theSun says the inauguration is set to be the most divisive and volatile ever,external, with more than 25,000 police and secret service agents in place to quieten the thousands of protestors. When Mr Trump takes the oath of office,the Guardian says,external, it will be a scene that not so long ago was unthinkable to the political establishment. Even now,says the i,external, the world is having to pinch itself. In the Mail's words,external, it is an astonishing contrast with eight years ago when Barack Obama came to office on a wave of hope and expectation. Mr Trump is pictured on many of the front pages giving a salute as he arrives at Andrews Air Force base near Washington DC for the inauguration, accompanied by his wife Melania. The Guardian says he faces immediate pressure to deliver an inaugural address that can start to heal a divided nation and reassure an anxious world. According to the Telegraph,external, he will pledge to rebuild the US middle class in a speech that will focus on boosting blue collar jobs and rolling back big government. The paper says his team has laid out plans to slash the infrastructure of the state with $10.5tn in spending cuts over the next decade. For its lead, theTelegraph reports that the Prince of Wales has described climate change,externalas the ""wolf at the door"" - and urged world leaders to take immediate steps to combat what he sees as the biggest threat to the planet's future. In his bleakest comments on the subject to date, the paper adds, Prince Charles says action on climate change ""must be urgently scaled up, and scaled up now"". It says his warning is contained in the foreword to anew book he has co-authored, which is being published next week. The jailing of a woman who plied her four-year-old daughter with drugs before she diedis the lead for the Mail,external. It says social workers knew Poppy Widdison was at risk before her mother gave birth, and their ""shocking failures have been laid bare"". It asks why they are still in jobs and describes Michala Pyke as the mother from hell. The paper's headline - ""betrayed before she was even born"". The Guardian leads on an attack by Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron,externalon Labour over its stance on Brexit. In an interview for the paper, Mr Farron accuses Jeremy Corbyn of ""lamely giving up"" while Britain ""drives off a cliff"" as it leaves the EU. In what the paper calls an overt attempt to grab votes in pro-Remain constituencies, Mr Farron describes Labour as the most ineffective opposition in living memory over its perceived failure to hold the government to account on the issue. Finally, a company processing household waste found a highly unusual item in the piles of rubbish - an OBE. The Sun says the medal,externalwas in its gold-embossed leather case.

Getting it right,"When the Chinese city of Shanghai took part in the three-yearly Pisa test of 15-year-olds' academic ability in 2009 and 2012 it topped the table in maths, leaving countries such as Germany the UK and the US - and even Singapore and Japan - trailing in its wake.  What is its secret? The life of a teacher in a Shanghai primary school differs quite a bit from that of teachers in most other countries. For one thing each teacher specialises in a particular subject - if you teach maths, you teach only maths. These specialist teachers are given at least five years of training targeted at specific age groups, during which they gain a deep understanding both of their subject and of how children learn. After qualifying, primary school teachers will typically take just two lessons per day, spending the rest of their time assisting students who require extra help and discussing teaching techniques with colleagues. ""If you compare that to an English practitioner in a primary school now, they might have five days of training in their initial teacher training year, if they're doing the School Direct route, for example,"" says Ben McMullen, head teacher of Ashburnham Community School, London. ""They might have some follow-up training during the first or second year of training - inset, staff meetings etcetera - but there's no comparison between the expertise of someone who's had five years of training in a specific subject to someone who's had only a handful of days."" It's a similar story in secondary school, where teachers spend less time in the classroom with pupils than they do on planning and refining lessons. There are other differences too. School days are longer - from 07:00 until 16:00 or 17:00. Class sizes are larger. And lessons are shorter - each is 35 minutes long, followed by 15 minutes of unstructured play. There is no streaming according to ability and every student must understand before the teacher moves on. In the early years of school basic arithmetic is covered more slowly than in the UK, says McMullen, who has travelled to Shanghai in one of the groups of British teachers sent every year by the Department of Education to watch and learn. ""They looked at our curriculum and were horrified by how much we were trying to teach,"" he says. ""They wouldn't teach fractions until year four or five. By that time, they assume that the children were very fluent in multiplication and division. ""This is essentially a 'teaching for mastery' approach: covering less and making smaller incremental movements forward, ensuring the class move together as one and that you go over stuff again and again until it's truly understood."" In a world where a lot is going wrong there is also a lot going right. So what if you could build a country with policies that actually worked, by homing in on ideas around the world that have been truly successful? Listen toMy Perfect Countryon the BBC World Service Ordownload the podcast Email the programme,external It seems that other cities in mainland China may not be on quite the same level as Shanghai. In the 2015 Pisa test Shanghai was bundled together with Beijing, Jiangsu and Guangdong, and they jointlycame fifth in maths,external, behind Singapore, Japan, Taiwan and Hong Kong. It's also been suggested that Shanghai's results in previous years could have been skewed by the failure to includeabout a quarter of pupils in the city,external. However Pisa insists its results demonstrate that the children of menial workers in Shanghai outperform the children of professionals in the West. This is one of the key attractions of the system - it helps poor children realise their potential, increasing social mobility. But there are also drawbacks, according to Henrietta Moore of the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College London. ""The idea there is that effort brings rewards and so you will get this totally driven sort of idea but what you don't get - and what Chinese maths teachers are currently grappling with - is this creative problem-solving that requires space and mulling and dwelling,"" she says. ""We're actually much better at this in the UK and they're trying to develop that and learn from us."" Another criticism of the system is that parents work children too hard. An estimated 80% of students receive private lessons outside school. ""One of the downsides of parental interest in education is they get competitive - they're more competitive than the children - so they want to have all these extra classes,"" says Moore. So is this a system other countries would do well to adopt? ""I would adopt the idea that anyone who teaches maths needs a deep understanding of the conceptual building of maths and a deep understanding of how children learn that,"" says Anne Watson, emeritus professor of maths teaching at Oxford University. ""I would also want to take on board the idea of high expectations for everyone."" Online entrepreneur Martha Lane-Fox is also a fan. ""Two things really appeal to me about this,"" she says. ""The idea that everyone can be more of a maths master than I think we believe here in the UK. I also really like the incredible attention to the micro-detail. I'm really interested in this notion of incrementalism and moving things on in small chunks. ""The fundamentals of this policy are right and it's incredibly inspiring to think everybody can become more freed up by maths."" Ben McMullen's primary school has already been borrowing some of Shanghai's ideas, he says. There is no streaming, pupils are interacting more and there is a ""different atmosphere"" in class. ""The younger learners moving up the school have an incredibly robust sense of maths, calculation and of concept,"" McMullen says. And for teachers there is another great upside, he says - less marking. Join the conversation - find the BBC World Service onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external.

""When we first found out we were having quadruplets, it was pure terror and pure joy at the same time,"" Ashley explained. ""The doctors said we only had a 40% chance of having one baby, so to have all four to come at once was a huge blessing and a huge miracle. ""The odds of both eggs splitting are literally one in a million. ""But I didn't know anyone who'd had quadruplets. I didn't know if it was physically possible for a woman, I knew nothing about it. ""I had vertigo and morning sickness for the first 16 weeks. I couldn't eat anything and I lost 20 pounds in my first trimester. ""My body hurt, my bones hurt and my hips would dislocate every time I rolled over."" In order to support the family, the couple run four businesses from home. ""We work when the girls are asleep - during their naptime and then after they go to bed, until one or two in the morning, every single night. ""It's really helpful we both work from home, because every other morning one of us takes the girls and the other gets to sleep in. ""Having quads was expensive in the first months. ""They were on a high-calorie formula that cost $25 (Â£20) a can and needed lots of nappies."" The couple's social media fans helped to ease the expense. ""My heart was truly touched by the amount of nappies and baby outfits that turned up by our door when they were born,"" she said. ""There really are amazing, kind, good people out there and I'm so grateful to those who follow our story and love these babies."" Ashley and Tyson regularly blog and vlog about their children's progress. ""When my pregnancy announcement went viral, so many people prayed for me and my babies. Now I feel it's my duty to show these people what they prayed for,"" she explained. Ashley insists that she goes about her daily life ""like anybody else, it just takes a bit longer"". ""We do everything times four. We take them shopping with us and load them into the car several times a day. ""Just because there are four of them, we can't let that stop us living our lives. We don't just stay at home."" Ashley described the ""special relationship"" that the toddlers share. ""There are four of them and they work together to conspire against you, which is really funny. They're definitely tearing the house down. ""Each set of twins has their 'own language' and talk to each other. ""If one girl steals a toy from another one, her twin will steal it back for her. They protect one another."" At times, the quads can be overwhelming for Ashley and Tyson. ""We're first time parents and we're learning as we go like anyone else. There are definitely anxieties. ""Not many people have raised four toddlers at the same time so you're kind of on your own. ""I feel like we're doing a good job. Just the fact that there's four of them and they're all healthy and happy and growing and thriving is an amazing miracle to science and to God.""

âAsk Me Anythingâ,"This video can not be played ""Now that my body matches how it was supposed to look in my brain, I'm happy."" A transgender woman who offered people the chance to ask ""invasive questions"" on an internet forum has been overwhelmed by the response. Gwen, 24, from Pennsylvania, hosted an ""ask me anything"" (AMA) session on the online community site Reddit. She received almost 2,000 questions and comments, mostly from ""supportive and respectful people"". ""I figure very few of you know trans people in your everyday lives and might be afraid to ask questions at the risk of offending someone, so I thought I'd give you all the opportunity to learn from someone who will answer your invasive questions,"" she said. One Redditor wrote: ""I think you just won over half of Reddit right there."" Another said: ""You're very beautiful, and I'm glad you found the happiness that you were searching for. Thanks for sharing with us."" These are some of the questions she was asked. Gwen, who medically transitioned using hormone replacement therapy, started dreaming about becoming a woman when she was five years old. ""I would wake up from those dreams and feel so happy. It was weird because I looked like a boy and everyone told me I was a boy,"" she said. ""I noticed things were different when I was five or six,"" Gwen told the BBC ""When I was 10, someone at school asked what people look like in heaven, and our teacher said, 'You can look however you like.' ""I was so excited. I couldn't wait to die because then I could look like a girl. I wasn't suicidal, but I thought someone had just unlocked the secret for me."" At the age of 22, Gwen began her medical transition. Two years later, most people she meets can't tell she was born male. After two years of HRT, most people can't tell Gwen is transgender ""As a guy, it was lonely because people were nice but didn't really engage with me. ""If I was walking home late at night, I could tell if when a woman was uncomfortable with my presence. ""Now, I get catcalled a lot walking through the city, and I fully understand the mindset. ""You get way more attention as a woman, and you assume that anybody could be a threat."" Gwen also notices sexist remarks. ""You don't really understand it until you experience it for yourself. ""I get lots of comments like, 'You wouldn't know because you're a girl.' ""I grew up as a guy, so I do know, I know a lot of these things."" But she said one of the positives about living as a woman was how other women treat her. ""They're much more comfortable around me and compliment me on my hair, make-up or clothes."" ""Men go out of their way to hold doors for me or ask me if I need help."" HRT reduces hair growth on the face and body Gwen explained that, as well as reducing hair growth and redistributing fat to her hips and chest, the structure of her muscles had changed. ""I went down three shoe sizes because the muscles in my foot changed, and I shrunk in height because of the curvature of my spine,"" she said. ""I lost all my strength. Before, I'd always win in a hand wrestle with my sister or girlfriend. Now, they'd probably beat me."" The transition process was an ""awkward phase"" for Gwen, and she felt people were uncomfortable with her appearance. ""You don't look like a man, but you don't look like a woman either, and people don't know how to talk to you. ""I suffered a lot in that period because I felt I was a fake because I didn't look like other women did. ""I had to tell myself that there's no one way for a woman to look."" Gwen finally felt that she ""passed"" as a woman after a man made sexual advances on a train. ""My heart froze. For a split second, I was happy that a stranger had seen me as a woman for the first time. ""Then I immediately felt disgusted, uncomfortable and guilty for the attention."" Although one of her uncles refuses to speak to her since the transition, Gwen feels that most of her family has accepted her. ""My mum had to relearn a lot about me and there are things she had to get used to, like the fact that we'll never have a mother-son dance. ""We're much closer now though, because I feel more authentic."" Gwen wants to have children with her girlfriend before considering surgery Gwen also discussed her personal life, although she said most trans people preferred not to be asked intimate questions. ""My girlfriend has always made me feel OK with my body, and I enjoy sex a lot more because now I actually get to be myself,"" she said. ""It's more pleasurable, and I feel it all over my body. ""I can still use my penis but I prefer not to."" Surgery is a consideration for the future. ""If my girlfriend and I stay together and we want children, I need things to stay as they are right now. ""After we have kids, I'd like to have surgery. ""That's the only thing holding me back because I hate having it."" ""I'm a person like any other. Being trans is just a part of my medical history,"" Gwen told Reddit. ""People feel they need to walk on eggshells around trans people, and it keeps them from wanting to learn anything about us. ""But being friends with a trans person isn't all that different from being friends with anyone else, and it can be rewarding to have a different perspective on life. ""For 98% of my life, my status as a trans person doesn't matter, and anyone who spends a few minutes talking to me would realise that,"" Gwen said ""I love everything about me that makes me 'me', it was just my body I was unhappy with. ""Now that my body matches how it was supposed to look in my brain, I'm happy.""

'Martyrs of marriage',"Deepika Bhardwaj knows she's fighting a lone battle In India, where crimes against women are rampant, a female activist and documentary filmmaker stands out for being a rare voice for abused men. The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi profiles Deepika Narayan Bhardwaj as part of a series on the Asian women likely to make the news in 2017. India regularly gets hauled over the coals for its shabby treatment of women. And rightly so. Every 15 minutes a rape is recorded, every five minutes an incident of domestic violence is reported, a bride is killed for dowry every 69 minutes and every year hundreds of thousands of female foetuses are aborted and infant girls are killed, leading to an appallingly skewed gender ratio. Girls and women also have to battle lifelong discrimination, prejudice, violence and neglect. In a climate like that, 31-year-old Deepika Narayan Bhardwaj knows she sticks out like a sore thumb, but she has some questions that are reasonable enough: ""Are men not vulnerable? Do they not face discrimination? Can they not be victims?"" And she goes on to add: ""Just as you don't have to be a woman to fight for women, similarly, you don't have to be a man to fight for men. I don't talk about atrocities against women because there are millions who are talking about it."" Protests against the tough anti-dowry law have been growing Her fight at the moment is against the misuse of Section 498A of the Indian penal code which is a tough anti-dowry law. Ms Bhardwaj is travelling across India, screening Martyrs of Marriage, her first feature-length documentary, in an attempt to persuade the authorities to re-write the law. Asian women to watch in 2017 Regina Ip: The 'Iron Lady' who wants to lead Hong Kong Leila de Lima: The woman who dares to defy Duterte Hong Kong's rebellious lawmaker Yau Wai-ching Yip Pin Xiu: Singapore's all-conquering Paralympian India introduced Section 498A in 1983 after a spate of dowry deaths in Delhi and elsewhere in the country. There were daily reports of new brides being burnt to death by their husbands and in-laws and the murders were often passed off as ""kitchen accidents"". Angry protests by female MPs and activists forced parliament to bring in the law. India court says women 'misusing' dowry law Why are India's housewives killing themselves? Just who are men's rights activists? ""It was a law made with very noble intentions,"" agrees Ms Bhardwaj. ""But a law that was made to save lives, has taken many lives."" Ms Bhardwaj is not alone in her criticism. Over the years, Section 498A has acquired the reputation of being the ""most abused law in the history of Indian jurisprudence"". With cases of divorce in India steadily rising, campaigners say that disgruntled women, aided by unscrupulous lawyers, routinely misuse the law to harass their husbands and their relatives. It has also been questioned by the Supreme Court with one judge describing its misuse as ""legal terrorism"", warning that it was ""intended to be used as a shield and not as an assassin's weapon"", and the National Commission for Women expressing concerns over its misuse. Martyrs of Marriage focuses on the abuse of the anti-dowry law As the law prescribes the immediate arrest of those named in a complaint, 2.7 million people, including 650,000 women and 7,700 children, were arrested between 1998 and 2015. The accused in some of the cases were as young as two years old and, in a particularly bizarre case, a two-month-old baby was hauled into a police station. Perturbed by such reports, in July 2014, the Supreme Court ordered the police tofollow a nine-point checklistbefore arresting anyone on a dowry complaint. Ms Bhardwaj, a former journalist, says she began researching the subject in 2012 after ""a very personal experience"". ""In 2011, a cousin's marriage fell apart within three months and his wife accused him and our entire family of beating her and demanding dowry from her. She filed a false case against us. I was also named as an accused, as someone who beat her and tortured her regularly,"" she says. Ms Bhardwaj says her family paid ""a large sum of money"" to buy peace, but ""even though the case got over, I was not at peace"". ""The law has become a tool for extreme blackmail and extortion,"" she says. Banker Avadhesh Yadav left a suicide note, questioning the ""one-sided law"" Avadhesh Yadav's parents are unable to come to terms with the loss of their son Her research took her to police stations and courts, and put her in touch with theSave Indian Family,external, an NGO fighting for the rights of wronged men. The documentary, which took four years to complete, has powerful first-person accounts from men who have been falsely accused under the anti-dowry law - from husbands who spent years in jail only to be acquitted later by courts; from the parents of young men who killed themselves unable to bear the harassment and ignominy of being labelled wife-abusers; a tearful video message from a husband recorded minutes before he hanged himself; and a suicide note from a young banker questioning the ""one-sided law"". We also hear from a retired Delhi high court judge who says the law is often ""used as a leverage to settle scores""; a former Indian law minister who admits to the failure of governments to deal with the ""abuse of this law""; one women's rights activist who believes the law must be amended; while a second insists that ""cases of misuse are few"" and the law must remain unchanged to protect women from dowry abuse. Ms Bhardwaj, however, insists that laws must be gender neutral. ""You cannot deny it saying the number of such cases is small. In the past few years, thousands of people have reached out to me for help and I've referred them to the Save Indian Family. In Delhi, I'm told that 24% of calls to women's helplines are from men in distress. Lives are being destroyed. People are killing themselves."" She now wants to organise a screening of Martyrs of Marriage for Indian MPs. ""I have shown the documentary to judges, police officials and magistrates, activists and general public, men and women impacted by the law. I have received a tremendous response from the viewers. Now I want to take it to the parliament, to lobby for a change in the law to stop its misuse."" Retired Delhi judge SN Dhingra says the anti-dowry law is often used to settle scores In recent months, Ms Bhardwaj has also been speaking out against false rape cases. After the December 2012 gang rape of a young woman on a bus in the Indian capital, Delhi, and her subsequent death, India introduced Section 376, a tough new anti-rape law. Since then, there has been a surge in the registration of rape cases, amid reports from courts that many are filed by women after a consensual relationship has gone sour or to settle other disputes. Judges across India havewarned against its misuse,externaland the Delhi Commission for Women has said that 53.2% of the rape cases filed between April 2013 and July 2014were found to be false,external. India's Supreme Court has also questioned the abuse of the anti-dowry law by some women Ms Bhardwaj, too, has often taken to social media to speak up for men accused in false cases, attracting a severe backlash - she regularly gets trolled on social media, feminists and women's rights activists accuse her of bias, she's been called a ""pimp for rapists"" and is berated for her ""love for rapists"". Even her two-year-old niece has been dragged into the sordid debate by internet trolls who claim to feel sorry for the toddler ""for having an aunt like her"". But Ms Bhardwaj remains unfazed. ""Some feminists say it's politically incorrect for me to fight for men, but I want justice for everyone, regardless of their gender. My work is not against women. My work is against injustice.""

Positive reviews for T2 Trainspotting,"This video can not be played T2 Trainspotting: What would you choose? T2 Trainspotting has received broadly positive reviews from critics, although many noted it will not have the same impact as the original. The sequel to 1996's Trainspotting sees most of the original cast reunited with director Danny Boyle. Kate Muir ofThe Times,externalsaid the film was ""like riding a tragi-comic wave"". ""The original actors have matured well, and while the lunatic enthusiasm of their youth has disappeared, they give their nuanced all here,"" she added. Based on the Irvine Welsh novel Porno, T2 Trainspotting is set in the present day with the main characters now in middle age. Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, Robert Carlyle and Ewen Bremner have all reprised their roles for the new film. Writing inThe Guardian,external, Peter Bradshaw said: ""Reuniting the cast of Trainspotting for a new adventure 21 years on could have gone badly. ""But Boyle and his four musketeers give it just the right frantic, jaded energy and manic anxiety."" He added that while ""T2 isn't as good as T1"", it ""has the same punchy energy, the same defiant pessimism, and there's nothing around like this"". Analysis by Neil Smith, BBC entertainment reporter Danny Boyle (far right) directed both the original Trainspotting and the sequel Boyle's masterstroke is to tackle the passing of time head-on. Where the characters in the original film were blissfully insouciant about their self-destructive hedonism, they are here all too aware of the cul-de-sacs and dead ends at which they've now arrived. They are, to quote T2's most striking line, ""tourists in their own youth"" - a description that applies just as much to the audience member who goes to the film hoping to have the same giddy high they experienced two decades ago. Overall, is it as good as the original? The answer is no - but it comes pretty darn close. Read the full review. However,The Scotsman,external's Alistair Harkness was less positive about the film, awarding it three stars. ""The best that can be said about the new film is that it hasn't completely tarnished the original,"" he wrote. ""Boyle's frenetic, collage-like directing style gives the film a trying-too-hard feel and even though some of it does jolt T2 to life, the cast doesn't always have the emotional range to make it cohere."" The original cast have reunited for T2 Trainspotting The Telegraph,external's Robbie Collin also gave the movie three stars. ""There's no chance of its successor matching that legacy, but it won't tarnish it either. Though the film feeds on its forerunner, it's worthwhile on its own terms,"" he said. The Hollywood Reporter,external's Neil Young wrote: ""T2 never threatens to find its own distinctive voice."" He also pointed out the female characters ""are very much on the sidelines, even more so than in Trainspotting"". ""Kelly MacDonald pops up for a one-scene, two-minute cameo (which nevertheless somehow nabs her fifth billing),"" he said. But the ScottishDaily Record,external's Chris Hunneysett was more positive, calling the film ""an addictive hit of pure cinema"". He said that while it ""won't capture the youthful zeitgeist the way Trainspotting did"", Boyle ""has created an unapologetically abrasive tale of longevity, loyalty and friendship"".

'WW2 bomb' fails to derail Harrelson film,"The film is loosely based on a chaotic night out Woody Harrelson had in London in 2002 Woody Harrelson said directing his ground-breaking live film project was like ""walking on a high wire"". Lost in London was filmed in multiple locations in the capital in the early hours of Friday. In a cinematic first, the film was shot in a 100-minute single take and broadcast live to 550 US cinemas - and one in the UK. But the project was almost derailed by thediscovery of a suspected World War Two bombjust hours before the shoot. Waterloo Bridge - where the closing scene of the film takes place - was closed for a few hours but reopened just in time for the live shoot to go ahead as planned. Eleanor Matsuura plays Harrelson's wife Laura Speaking after the filming ended around 03:40 GMT, Harrelson was incredulous at the timing of the ""bomb"" discovery. ""That thing has been there for 70 years and they discover it tonight? That's impossible!"" Lost In London was shot on a single camera, involved a crew of 325 and more than 300 extras who had been rehearsing for four weeks. ""I would never do this again. No way. It felt like walking on a high wire,"" said Harrelson afterwards. There were no major gaffes - although one actor walked out of a scene, forcing Harrelson to ad lib during a phone call until the character returned. Woody Harrelson during rehearsals ""It felt like five minutes,"" Harrelson said. ""It was only a matter of seconds. But, boy, those were some painful seconds."" The film was screened in just one cinema in the UK, London's Picturehouse Central, where it received an enthusiastic reception. The comedy plot was loosely based on a real-life night out that Harrelson had in the capital in 2002 in which he ended up getting arrested and spending time in a police cell. The film opens with the words: ""Too much of this is true."" Harrelson, playing a version of himself, is seen coming off stage in the West End to discover he's the subject of a tabloid sex scandal just before he goes to meet his wife in a restaurant. The film includes a fight in a nightclub and chase sequences on foot and by car. Woody Harrelson with co-star Owen Wilson Much of the comedy comes from the scenes with co-star Owen Wilson - and the script is sprinkled with references to Harrelson's past projects, including Natural Born Killers and Cheers. ""It was pretty thrilling,"" Wilson said after the filming. ""I had a lot of anxiety about doing it a couple of weeks ago but we practised... and I was really happy to be a part of it. Maybe I should start doing theatre."" Musician Willie Nelson turned up in a cameo role as did U2's Bono, as a voice on the end of a phone. ""I felt like we took some risks. It was scary - the whole process,"" Harrelson said. Harrelson's next project will see him join the Star Wars franchise with a role in thespin-off movie about the young Han Solo. Did he think Hollywood would ever adopt the as-it-happens style of Lost in London? Harrelson laughed: ""If someone was thinking of doing it all they'd need to do is talk to me and I would talk them out of it.""

Born to move,"Chip Bergh usually does between 12 and 14 hours of sport a week Ask Levi boss Chip Bergh how he's finding his first trip to the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, and his immediate response is to say how frustrated he is by the lack of time to exercise. The sports-obsessed chief executive - who competes in triathlons and is a vegan - normally exercises daily from 5.30am to 7am doing a mixture of swimming, running and weights. In total, he does between 12 and 14 hours of sport a week. ""No-one is as intense as me,"" he quips. The vegan trying to make the perfect burger Does living to 100 mean we'll work forever? The successful women embracing âgirl powerâ Davos coverage in full Yet, in the testosterone-fuelled world of alpha males (and it is normally males) who make up the top ranks of the corporate world, exercise is often pretty high on the agenda. And it makes sense - the kind of drive, discipline and determination needed to push yourself to work out and compete - are exactly the same skills needed to get to the top. This video can not be played Levi boss shares his jeans story Mr Bergh, who was headhunted to lead the 163-year-old jeans firm after almost three decades at consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble, credits his exercise regime with helping him succeed in the new role. When he took the helm, Levi was losing out to cheaper and more fashionable rivals, with sales half of their annual $7bn peak. He changed all but one of the 11-strong executive team, and two thirds of its next tier of management alongside making significant cuts, including outsourcing its IT, finance and customer services. Sales and profit have now grown for the past four years. Exercise, he says, gave him the strength to make such dramatic changes. ""I really do firmly believe it plays a part in performance. For me personally when I'm healthy and exercising, eating right and getting enough rest, I'm much more productive at work,"" he says. His conviction of the benefits of exercise meant that when he joined he set up a ""Live wellth"" programme at the firm, including a cheap gym membership deal for staff and a nutritional onsite cafe at its San Francisco headquarters. For any company, encouraging staff to take care of their health makes sense, he says, due to the risk of high healthcare costs if they don't. ""It's not just the performance side of this, but the potential avoidance of costs,"" he says. Nerio Alessandri, chief executive of Technogym, thinks companies should offer their staff fitness facilities It's an issue companies are increasingly cottoning on to, says Nerio Alessandri, the founder and chief executive of Italian fitness equipment manufacturer Technogym. In fact, he says providing machines, fitness programmes and apps to companies is now its fastest growing market. Increasingly, he thinks the so-called millennial generation - those born between 1980 and 1999, and a group that accountancy firm Deloitte predicts will make up 75% of the global workforce by 2022 - will expect their workplaces to offer fitness facilities. ""It's a key way to attract talent. They don't want the car, or the other perks,"" he says. We're talking - whilst sitting on big bouncy balls - in the firm's pop-up store in Davos, while impossibly honed and fit-looking company representatives run and cycle furiously on stationary machines beside us. The World Economic Forum is littered with posters encouraging people to walk Mr Alessandri himself works out every morning for an hour at 6.30am, and cycles and runs at the weekend, but crucially, he says, whilst wobbling frenetically on the ball, he never stops moving. ""Exercise is one of the rules of the champion chief executive. If you're not healthy, you don't have a healthy mind, you don't have creativity, you don't have energy and productivity goes down,"" he says. At Technogym's head office in Cesena in northern Italy, taking the lift is banned unless someone has a physical issue. There are no chairs, just balls for seats and all meetings take place at high tables to force them to stand up. But what if a staff member isn't into fitness? ""It's an opportunity. We make them,"" he jokes. Armani was not impressed by Nerio Alessandri's attempt at fashion design In fact, he says his personal mission is to try to address the sedentary lifestyle that has been linked to health problems. ""People were born to move for 30km a day. Today, it's less than 1km a day. We're committed to covering the gap,"" he says. Mr Alessandri, who originally wanted to be a fashion designer but turned to fitness equipment after a rejection from Armani, believes the secret is to make the workout equipment look good. ""If it's like a piece of art, not a machine, then you put it on display and you're more likely to use it. If it's ugly, you stick it in the garage and never use it,"" he says. So far, the regime appears to be working. The firm has supplied the equipment for the past six Olympics and sales hit $581m in 2015, the most recent full-year figures available. ""Let's move for a better world is my mantra,"" he says. It's a mantra shared by the WEF. In Davos, posters are everywhere telling attendees of the benefits to the planet of walking instead of driving. And temporary signs in the village display the number of steps and time taken to reach a particular destination. Signs are placed across Davos helping delegates to calculate their daily step count Given the almost constant traffic gridlock on the streets in the morning and evening, I'm not sure delegates are heeding the message. But Tupperware chief executive Rick Goings says the WEF's emphasis on health and fitness persuaded him to make changes at his own firm. Its base in Orlando, Florida now boasts a fitness centre as well as biking and walking paths. And Mr Goings himself fits the mould of a typical high achiever - he too is an exercise freak. Mr Goings meditates every day ""I can still bench press my weight. I never miss a workout and do at least an hour every other day no matter what. Fitness gives me energy,"" he says. He also meditates every day. ""How old do you think I am?"" he asks, thrusting his face forward. I guess late 50s. ""Seventy-one,"" he says triumphantly. ""And no plastic surgery.""

What time is Trump president?Black marching band braves vitriolMexicoâs half-built Ford factory1:39Boycotters on why they arenât going,"This video can not be played Trump's inauguration: An insider's tour Hundreds of thousands of people poured into Washington to watch Donald Trump being sworn in as the 45th US president. All eyes were on the US Capitol as Mr Trump formally replaced President Barack Obama in the White House. Here is a guide to the historic transition. The newly elected US president is sworn into office by the Chief Justice of the United States every four years by noon (17:00 GMT) on 20 January, as prescribed by the US Constitution. Historically, the incoming president was inaugurated on 4 March, but the period of delay was shortened when the 20th Amendment was ratified in 1933. Was Obama second-longest serving US president? The tweets that say so much and reveal so little Will Trump's election lead to more women in politics? The oath is part of a ceremony marking the peaceful transition of power on the steps in front of the US Capitol. The ceremony is then followed by a parade down Pennsylvania Avenue and later celebrated through a series of inaugural balls. An estimated 800,000 to 900,000 people are expected to travel to Washington for the inauguration 1.Trump leaves from Blair House on Friday morning2.St John's Episcopal Church for morning service3.White House coffee with Obama4.US Capitol for Oath of office and address5.National Mall, where spectators watch parade6.Trump walks past his hotel as he leads the parade to his new home FRIDAY, 20 JANUARY Mr Trump attended a morning service at St John's Episcopal Church near the White House Mr Trump and his wife, Melania, had coffee with President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama. 10:30 (15:30 GMT)The couples took a motorcade to the Capitol.

He then delivered his inaugural address 13:00-15:45 (18:00-20:45 GMT)President Trump signed a series of documents in a room at the US Capitol before dining with lawmakers at the inaugural luncheon 15:45-17:00 (20:45-22:00 GMT)Mr Trump and Mr Pence embarked on a 1.5 mile (2.4km) parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House 19:00-23:00 (00:00-04:00 GMT)Mr Trump, Mr Pence and their wives will attend three official inaugural balls SAT, 21 JANUARY 10:00 (15:00 GMT)Mr Trump and Mr Pence attend the interfaith National Prayer Service at the Washington National Cathedral 10:00 (15:00 GMT)The Women's March on Washington begins President Obama and the first lady accompanied Mr Trump in a motorcade to the US Capitol for the official ceremony, where they were joined by members of Congress, politicians as well as supporters. Former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, who lost to Mr Trump in November's election, are attending. George W Bush and his wife, Laura, as well as Jimmy Carter, are also there. George HW Bush, who was inhospital for respiratory problems, wrote a letter to Mr Trump wishing him well and apologising for missing the event due to health concerns. An estimated 800,000 to 900,000 people were expected to flood the nation's capital on Friday for the inauguration, but it is unclear whether they will be there in celebration or protest, officials said. President Barack Obama drew an estimated 1.8 million people to Washington when he took office eight years ago. More than 1.8 million people attended President Obama's 2009 inauguration The ""level of enthusiasm"" and demand for hotel rooms has not reached that of previous inaugurations, according to Elliott Ferguson, president of Destination DC, the city's convention and tourism bureau. In fact, some hotels have reduced the minimum-night stay from four nights to two. Other hotels are only 50% full, but higher-end hotels appeared to have more bookings, he added. More than 50 House Democrats are publicly refusing to attend the ceremony amid a feud between the newly elected president and the civil rights activist and congressman, John Lewis. Mr Lewis is among the congressmen who will not be in attendance. Some lawmakers have said they will instead attend the Women's March on Washington, a protest set to take place a day after the inauguration. Trump inauguration boycott escalates Several demonstrations both protesting and supporting Mr Trump will take place around the city over the weekend. Most notably, the Women's March on Washington is estimated to draw crowds of 200,000 people on 21 January. It sets out to demonstrate for racial and gender equality, affordable healthcare, abortion rights and voting rights - issues perceived to be under threat from a Trump presidency. The motorcycle group Bikers for Trump will also host a rally for the incoming president after the ceremony and before the inauguration parade. Other protests include: Anti-war and anti-nuclear weapons rally attended by former Green Party presidential candidate Jill Stein #DisruptJ20 Festival of Resistance, organised by the DC Counter-Inaugural Welcoming Committee #Trump420 march, hosted by marijuana advocates who plan to hand out 4,200 free joints (which is legal in Washington) Mr Trump has enlisted the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, Radio City Rockettes, country stars Toby Keith and Lee Greenwood, 3 Doors Down as well as America's Got Talent contestant and singer Jackie Evancho to perform over the course of two days. Academy Award-winning actor Jon Voight also spoke at the welcome concert, telling the crowd: ""God answered all our prayers"" by electing Mr Trump. This video can not be played Trump's 'soft sensuality' inauguration Evancho, 16, who took second place on the talent show, sang the national anthem. The Trump transition team had reportedly struggled to secure high-profile entertainers. A number of artists turned down the opportunity to play, including Elton John, Welsh singer Charlotte Church and American DJ Moby. Dreamgirls star Jennifer Holliday announced she had dropped an inauguration performance to stand in solidarity with the LGBT community while a Bruce Springsteen tribute band also decided to skip the event out of respect for the Boss, who is vocally critical of Mr Trump. The newly sworn-in president and vice-president will also stop by three official inaugural balls, which are typically attended by the incoming administration's supporters. The soon-to-be 45th president has vowed to roll back many of Mr Obama's policies on ""day one"" in office, but it is unclear whether that begins on Friday or Monday. The new White House press secretary, Sean Spicer,tweeted,externalthat the president was signing three things in a ceremony at an ornate room within the US Capitol: a waiver bill enabling Gen James Mattis to serve as Defence Secretary, the formal nominations to go to the Senate, and a proclamation for a national ""day of patriotism"". But Mr Trump hadtold the Times,externalearlier this week that ""day one"" would not begin until Monday. ""I mean my day one is going to be Monday because I don't want to be signing and get it mixed up with lots of celebration,"" he told the newspaper.

Black marching band braves vitriolMexicoâs half-built Ford factory1:39Boycotters on why they arenât going,"This video can not be played The Marching Tornado Band has travelled all the way from Alabama. The only marching band from a historically black college to perform at the Trump presidential inauguration has experienced intense backlash. Regardless, on Thursday morning, the Talladega Marching Tornadoes blew into Washington. When students awoke after the 19-hour bus trip from Talladega, Alabama, one of the first scenes that greeted their bleary eyes in the nation's capital was Senator Bernie Sanders, waiting to cross the street. It was a sight few of the Talladega College marching band members thought they'd ever see - a former presidential candidate strolling to work - as the vast majority had never even been outside the state of Alabama. ""They're so talented, these young people. We're really excited to give them this opportunity,"" said Dr Sharon Whittaker-Davis, the school's vice-president of student affairs, as she watched the students pour out of the buses and into the African American Civil War Museum in Washington. ""We're here."" After 19 hours on the bus from Talladega, Alabama, the Marching Tornadoes arrive in Washington The night before, the mayor of tiny Talladega and a crowd of about 100 well-wishers cheered as the buses pulled out of town. It was a loving send-off that contrasted sharply with the treatment the band had faced in previous weeks. Several other high schools and colleges, including historically black institutions like Howard University, declined the invitation or didn't even apply to play at Donald Trump's inauguration. As soon as it was announced that the Marching Tornadoes was the sole black college to accept, they were called sell-outs, race traitors and worse. The college president received demands for his resignation, and then death threats. Alumni begged their alma mater not to go. ""Please do not march in this. Stand with people of colour against racism,"" one comment read on the band's Facebook page. However, after college president Barry Hawkins appeared on Fox News to explain his decision to let the band perform, donations to a GoFundMe page raising money for the trip shot through the roof, soaring toalmost $650,000,external(Â£527,000). The extra money will go towards scholarships, new band uniforms, new instruments and a new practice space - the college has only 700 students, almost all of whom receive some type of financial aid. Omarosa Manigault, Donald Trump's director of communications, take selfies with the Talladega Tornadoes Many of the band members come from low-income backgrounds and are the first in their families to attend college. The students were eager about the invitation and took the ensuing backlash personally. ""I just couldn't understand why they would do that to us,"" said 21-year-old alto saxophone player Eriel House. ""We're students. We're not involved in a political party. We just wanted to go show our talents."" ""[He's president] regardless,"" said Shylexis Robinson. ""I just want to march on Pennsylvania Avenue, period."" Once in Washington, the trip organisers had hoped to take the students straight to the Martin Luther King Memorial on the National Mall. But because streets were already blocked off for the inauguration, they instead headed to the African American Civil War Museum - a tribute to the black soldiers who fought for the Union. Talladega College itself was founded in 1867 by the descendants of slaves. Students took selfies in front of a monument to black soldiers who fought for the Union in the Civil War Inside the darkened museum, the students swished around in their matching blue-and-crimson tracksuits, peering into display cases of rusty slaves' shackles, a yellowed 1862 copy of the New York Times announcing the ""preliminary emancipation"" of slaves, and a sign that reads: ""We Serve Colored Carry Out Only"". When Mr Hawkins announced to the group that a special guest awaited the students across the street, a student said: ""Obama?"" Instead, Omarosa Manigault - former Apprentice star, director of Mr Trump's African-American outreach during the campaign, and now his director of communications - waited beside a statue of four black Union soldiers. Students clamoured for selfies. ""You have shown and exhibited such great courage... we can't move forward unless we are together,"" Ms Manigault called out. ""On behalf of the president, Donald J Trump, I want to just thank you, welcome you here and I cannot wait to see y'all show up and show out tomorrow at the inauguration parade!"" Milling around the memorial, Melissa Harris traced her hand along the names inscribed on the monument. ""I think I found one of my ancestors on one of these walls,"" she said. ""I hope we get to meet President Obama,"" another girl sighed. ""I don't think it's hitting us yet that he's going,"" said Marissa Melchor quietly. ""He's not dying,"" her friend said rolling her eyes. ""It feels unreal,"" Ms Melchor replied. ""But reality is going to hit us."" Elkena Washington on the E-flat alto saxophone and Melissa Harris on piccolo The students piled back onto the buses and took a long, slow ride through packed traffic to the University of the District of Columbia campus. There the students got their first meal since the previous day, and listened to remarks from local business people who donated to their GoFundMe campaign. None of the students who spoke to BBC News expressed a strong support for incoming President Trump, but they seemed cautiously optimistic. ""I don't like everything about him. I think it's going to be a pretty interesting couple of years,"" said Bernard Norris, an 18-year-old trombone player. ""I just wish him the best of luck and I hope he does the country right... I hope something good comes out of this."" In the hallway outside the dining hall, 21-year-old first chair trumpeteer Marco Vera said that even though he is excited to perform, it was hard to hear some of the remarks Mr Trump made during the campaign. ""Coming from a Hispanic background, having to see my parents struggle through everything to get where we're at... it hurts,"" he said. ""Yeah, he said some stuff about us, but I'm performing for my college. I'm performing for my parents. My parents told me to go out there and showcase my talent... so I'm just going to go out there and make my family proud.""

Mexicoâs half-built Ford factory1:39Boycotters on why they arenât going,"Jesus Oliva lost his job when Ford pulled out of Mexico in favour of the US The arid desert landscape of Villa de Reyes is a world away from the glitz of the presidential inauguration on Capitol Hill. Yet since Donald Trump was elected, the sparsely populated communities and dry valleys of Central Mexico have been inexorably linked to events in Washington DC. Like so much with President-elect Trump, it began with a tweet. ""Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!"" he tweeted at General Motors earlier this month. The warning may have been aimed at GM but within hours, Ford, which had also been singled out for criticism during his campaignannounced that it was withdrawing from a $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) car assembly plant in Villa de Reyes. Some of that money would be reinvested in Michigan in what the CEO of Ford described to the BBC as ""a vote of confidence"" in Mr Trump's business policies. Donald Trump has promised to punish companies who put their factories in other countries Today, that half-finished factory sits idle, gathering dust in the desert. The car plant has gone from a shining example of cross-border free trade to an eerie monument to Mr Trump's aggressive brand of economic protectionism. Trump supporters heralded the move as evidence that his harder stance towards Mexico will boost US jobs. For Jesus Oliva, though, it was just evidence that the next four years will be tougher than he'd hoped. He had worked on the site for six months when the entire workforce was told they were fired one morning. ""It was a decent job,"" he says of his time as a night-watchman. ""It was nearby so we could walk to work."" Jesus lives in the shadow of the abandoned Ford construction, in a community of around 500 families called La Presita. Plus, of course, it was regular pay. The factory now sits half-built and abandoned Jesus now harvests cactus to make a living from selling a fermented alcoholic beverage called aguamiel and a typical Mexican food, nopales. At 58, he has few other options, but he fears for the younger generation. ""Many will immigrate north or go to other places to try to build their lives. We need jobs here too so people can live honestly. I think that's where the delinquency and crime comes from - having no work."" Trump v the car industry Mexicans' Donald Trump fears The state authorities in San Luis Potosi admit that Ford's decision was ""not good news"". ""It was very good news nine months ago when we signed the agreement and announced that Ford was coming to San Luis Potosi,"" said Gustavo Puente Orozco, the state's secretary for economic development. Still he refrains from criticising the company - at least in public. Gustavo Puente Orozco, the state's secretary for economic development, has not criticised Ford for its decision ""Beyond being disappointed, I have to be very professional and I have to respect what the companies do and the decisions they make. As a former businessman I understand that markets and strategies can change."" ""We have to work with them to find the best solution for both parties,"" he adds, before underlining that Ford have not pulled out of Mexico altogether. Far from it, in fact. Their assembly plant in Hermosillo could even end up benefitting from these international movements of investment and capital that have accompanied Mr Trump's arrival in the White House. The local authorities insist that San Luis Potosi is still in good shape, with or without Ford, ranking fifth out of 32 states in terms of GDP growth per capita. ""We grew 5.4% in 2015 compared to the Mexican average of 2.5,"" said Mr Puente, which he attributes to a range of industries from mining to food production. Nevertheless there are likely to be complications ahead. This video can not be played Ford's chief executive says the move was a ""vote of confidence"" in Trump One of Mr Trump's key election promises was to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta. Added to that is the thorny question of more walls - both ""real and through taxes"" as Secretary Puente puts it. As the Trump administration prepares to take office, the idea that Mexico will pay for an extended border wall is roundly dismissed by ordinary Mexicans and politicians alike. ""Mexico isn't going to pay for that wall. Not today, not ever, not even on credit,"" Senator Luis Humberto Fernandez said in a statement in the final days before Mr Trump's inauguration. Still, in San Luis Potosi, many fear the worst from the incoming administration. Among them is the community leader at La Presita - an aged rancher called Gregorio Flores, known locally as Don Goyo. People here are fearful of a Trump presidency He can see the empty structure from his patch of land as he feeds his pigs every morning. ""We'd hoped to build a school and we urgently need a road as we're so cut off,"" he says, lamenting the loss for the village. His neighbour, Jesus Oliva, perhaps one of the first casualties in a US trade conflict with Mexico, says he'd urge the president-elect to ""play fair"". ""They accuse Mexicans of taking their jobs. But now they're coming in and taking away ours.""

Beckham to be Desert Island castaway,"Beckham told Kirsty Young music was a big part of his life Former England captain David Beckham is being cast away for the 75th birthday celebrations of BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs next weekend. More than 3,000 guests have been onthe showsince it was first broadcast on 29 January 1942. Presenter Kirsty Young said having Beckham choosing his favourite tracks for the anniversary show was ""the perfect gift"". Beckham, 41, said music has been a ""huge"" part of his family's life.

Black marching band braves vitriol,"This video can not be played The Marching Tornado Band has travelled all the way from Alabama. The only marching band from a historically black college to perform at the Trump presidential inauguration has experienced intense backlash. Regardless, on Thursday morning, the Talladega Marching Tornadoes blew into Washington. When students awoke after the 19-hour bus trip from Talladega, Alabama, one of the first scenes that greeted their bleary eyes in the nation's capital was Senator Bernie Sanders, waiting to cross the street. It was a sight few of the Talladega College marching band members thought they'd ever see - a former presidential candidate strolling to work - as the vast majority had never even been outside the state of Alabama. ""They're so talented, these young people. We're really excited to give them this opportunity,"" said Dr Sharon Whittaker-Davis, the school's vice-president of student affairs, as she watched the students pour out of the buses and into the African American Civil War Museum in Washington. ""We're here."" After 19 hours on the bus from Talladega, Alabama, the Marching Tornadoes arrive in Washington The night before, the mayor of tiny Talladega and a crowd of about 100 well-wishers cheered as the buses pulled out of town. It was a loving send-off that contrasted sharply with the treatment the band had faced in previous weeks. Several other high schools and colleges, including historically black institutions like Howard University, declined the invitation or didn't even apply to play at Donald Trump's inauguration. As soon as it was announced that the Marching Tornadoes was the sole black college to accept, they were called sell-outs, race traitors and worse. The college president received demands for his resignation, and then death threats. Alumni begged their alma mater not to go. ""Please do not march in this. Stand with people of colour against racism,"" one comment read on the band's Facebook page. However, after college president Barry Hawkins appeared on Fox News to explain his decision to let the band perform, donations to a GoFundMe page raising money for the trip shot through the roof, soaring toalmost $650,000,external(Â£527,000). The extra money will go towards scholarships, new band uniforms, new instruments and a new practice space - the college has only 700 students, almost all of whom receive some type of financial aid. Omarosa Manigault, Donald Trump's director of communications, take selfies with the Talladega Tornadoes Many of the band members come from low-income backgrounds and are the first in their families to attend college. The students were eager about the invitation and took the ensuing backlash personally. ""I just couldn't understand why they would do that to us,"" said 21-year-old alto saxophone player Eriel House. ""We're students. We're not involved in a political party. We just wanted to go show our talents."" ""[He's president] regardless,"" said Shylexis Robinson. ""I just want to march on Pennsylvania Avenue, period."" Once in Washington, the trip organisers had hoped to take the students straight to the Martin Luther King Memorial on the National Mall. But because streets were already blocked off for the inauguration, they instead headed to the African American Civil War Museum - a tribute to the black soldiers who fought for the Union. Talladega College itself was founded in 1867 by the descendants of slaves. Students took selfies in front of a monument to black soldiers who fought for the Union in the Civil War Inside the darkened museum, the students swished around in their matching blue-and-crimson tracksuits, peering into display cases of rusty slaves' shackles, a yellowed 1862 copy of the New York Times announcing the ""preliminary emancipation"" of slaves, and a sign that reads: ""We Serve Colored Carry Out Only"". When Mr Hawkins announced to the group that a special guest awaited the students across the street, a student said: ""Obama?"" Instead, Omarosa Manigault - former Apprentice star, director of Mr Trump's African-American outreach during the campaign, and now his director of communications - waited beside a statue of four black Union soldiers. Students clamoured for selfies. ""You have shown and exhibited such great courage... we can't move forward unless we are together,"" Ms Manigault called out. ""On behalf of the president, Donald J Trump, I want to just thank you, welcome you here and I cannot wait to see y'all show up and show out tomorrow at the inauguration parade!"" Milling around the memorial, Melissa Harris traced her hand along the names inscribed on the monument. ""I think I found one of my ancestors on one of these walls,"" she said. ""I hope we get to meet President Obama,"" another girl sighed. ""I don't think it's hitting us yet that he's going,"" said Marissa Melchor quietly. ""He's not dying,"" her friend said rolling her eyes. ""It feels unreal,"" Ms Melchor replied. ""But reality is going to hit us."" Elkena Washington on the E-flat alto saxophone and Melissa Harris on piccolo The students piled back onto the buses and took a long, slow ride through packed traffic to the University of the District of Columbia campus. There the students got their first meal since the previous day, and listened to remarks from local business people who donated to their GoFundMe campaign. None of the students who spoke to BBC News expressed a strong support for incoming President Trump, but they seemed cautiously optimistic. ""I don't like everything about him. I think it's going to be a pretty interesting couple of years,"" said Bernard Norris, an 18-year-old trombone player. ""I just wish him the best of luck and I hope he does the country right... I hope something good comes out of this."" In the hallway outside the dining hall, 21-year-old first chair trumpeteer Marco Vera said that even though he is excited to perform, it was hard to hear some of the remarks Mr Trump made during the campaign. ""Coming from a Hispanic background, having to see my parents struggle through everything to get where we're at... it hurts,"" he said. ""Yeah, he said some stuff about us, but I'm performing for my college. I'm performing for my parents. My parents told me to go out there and showcase my talent... so I'm just going to go out there and make my family proud.""

Mexicoâs half-built Ford factory,"Jesus Oliva lost his job when Ford pulled out of Mexico in favour of the US The arid desert landscape of Villa de Reyes is a world away from the glitz of the presidential inauguration on Capitol Hill. Yet since Donald Trump was elected, the sparsely populated communities and dry valleys of Central Mexico have been inexorably linked to events in Washington DC. Like so much with President-elect Trump, it began with a tweet. ""Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!"" he tweeted at General Motors earlier this month. The warning may have been aimed at GM but within hours, Ford, which had also been singled out for criticism during his campaignannounced that it was withdrawing from a $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) car assembly plant in Villa de Reyes. Some of that money would be reinvested in Michigan in what the CEO of Ford described to the BBC as ""a vote of confidence"" in Mr Trump's business policies. Donald Trump has promised to punish companies who put their factories in other countries Today, that half-finished factory sits idle, gathering dust in the desert. The car plant has gone from a shining example of cross-border free trade to an eerie monument to Mr Trump's aggressive brand of economic protectionism. Trump supporters heralded the move as evidence that his harder stance towards Mexico will boost US jobs. For Jesus Oliva, though, it was just evidence that the next four years will be tougher than he'd hoped. He had worked on the site for six months when the entire workforce was told they were fired one morning. ""It was a decent job,"" he says of his time as a night-watchman. ""It was nearby so we could walk to work."" Jesus lives in the shadow of the abandoned Ford construction, in a community of around 500 families called La Presita. Plus, of course, it was regular pay. The factory now sits half-built and abandoned Jesus now harvests cactus to make a living from selling a fermented alcoholic beverage called aguamiel and a typical Mexican food, nopales. At 58, he has few other options, but he fears for the younger generation. ""Many will immigrate north or go to other places to try to build their lives. We need jobs here too so people can live honestly. I think that's where the delinquency and crime comes from - having no work."" Trump v the car industry Mexicans' Donald Trump fears The state authorities in San Luis Potosi admit that Ford's decision was ""not good news"". ""It was very good news nine months ago when we signed the agreement and announced that Ford was coming to San Luis Potosi,"" said Gustavo Puente Orozco, the state's secretary for economic development. Still he refrains from criticising the company - at least in public. Gustavo Puente Orozco, the state's secretary for economic development, has not criticised Ford for its decision ""Beyond being disappointed, I have to be very professional and I have to respect what the companies do and the decisions they make. As a former businessman I understand that markets and strategies can change."" ""We have to work with them to find the best solution for both parties,"" he adds, before underlining that Ford have not pulled out of Mexico altogether. Far from it, in fact. Their assembly plant in Hermosillo could even end up benefitting from these international movements of investment and capital that have accompanied Mr Trump's arrival in the White House. The local authorities insist that San Luis Potosi is still in good shape, with or without Ford, ranking fifth out of 32 states in terms of GDP growth per capita. ""We grew 5.4% in 2015 compared to the Mexican average of 2.5,"" said Mr Puente, which he attributes to a range of industries from mining to food production. Nevertheless there are likely to be complications ahead. This video can not be played Ford's chief executive says the move was a ""vote of confidence"" in Trump One of Mr Trump's key election promises was to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta. Added to that is the thorny question of more walls - both ""real and through taxes"" as Secretary Puente puts it. As the Trump administration prepares to take office, the idea that Mexico will pay for an extended border wall is roundly dismissed by ordinary Mexicans and politicians alike. ""Mexico isn't going to pay for that wall. Not today, not ever, not even on credit,"" Senator Luis Humberto Fernandez said in a statement in the final days before Mr Trump's inauguration. Still, in San Luis Potosi, many fear the worst from the incoming administration. Among them is the community leader at La Presita - an aged rancher called Gregorio Flores, known locally as Don Goyo. People here are fearful of a Trump presidency He can see the empty structure from his patch of land as he feeds his pigs every morning. ""We'd hoped to build a school and we urgently need a road as we're so cut off,"" he says, lamenting the loss for the village. His neighbour, Jesus Oliva, perhaps one of the first casualties in a US trade conflict with Mexico, says he'd urge the president-elect to ""play fair"". ""They accuse Mexicans of taking their jobs. But now they're coming in and taking away ours.""

Trump and me: What his fans want,"This video can not be played Mr Trump's supporters who will be going to the inauguration What do the millions of Trump supporters want from their new president? The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan catches up with some of the voters she met while travelling across America during the election campaign. Sarah Jo Reynolds, 25,Arkansas Sarah Jo works for the Republican Party of Arkansas and I met her at her office in Little Rock a few days before the second presidential debate in October. While other Republican women in the state had voiced concerns over Donald Trump's threat to bring up Bill Clinton's past as an election issue, Sarah Jo was steadfastly behind her candidate. She remains so today, and has travelled to Washington DC for the inauguration. During the primaries she was the ""odd one out"" with her friends, who all supported Marco Rubio. ""I wasn't a bandwagon type of person. I wanted to support who I thought was best, and I guess I picked the right horse."" She wasn't upset about the comments Trump made on the Access Hollywood tape saying he would grab a woman ""by the pussy"". ""Everybody makes mistakes and I'd be mortified if something like that was caught on camera,"" she says. For Sarah Jo, the appeal lies in his promise of change, and his background as a businessman. Her two priorities are tax reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare. She's hopeful her candidate can heal divisions in the country. ""I am prayerful that he takes into account every single American citizen, not just those who voted for him. Change can't occur overnight but I think we are going to see great things with his first 100 days in office."" Will Estrada, 33, Virginia Will Estrada is the definition of a Washington insider. He's a lawyer, a lobbyist and the chair of the Loudon County Republican Party. When we met in August, some local congressional candidates in the Virginia district were refusing to endorse the party's nominee. But Will's loyalty was never in doubt. Now, as an invited guest to the inauguration, he'll get to witness Trump being sworn in up close. ""I think Trump has a huge opportunity to restore America's respect on the world stage,"" he says. ""Trump is a phenomenon who defies expectations. He's rewritten the rule book.  It's exciting to watch."" He has two ""non-negotiables"": the repeal of President Obama's healthcare reforms, and a conservative pick for the vacant Supreme Court seat. ""We'd seen the growth of government way larger than our founders had intended,"" Will says of Obamacare, adding that he's ""fine"" with Mr Trump's undefined plan to replace it. Back in the summer Will was an ardent critic of Hillary Clinton and agreed with the calls of many Trump supporters to ""lock her up"". But he understands why the new president has backed away from his promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs Clinton. ""It would have created more divisiveness if a president went after Hillary Clinton. I'd like to move forward - the Clintons are a relic of the past."" Marco Gutierrez, 43,California I met Marco Gutierrez at the Republican National Convention in Ohio last July, where he was holding a ""Latinos for Trump"" sign. A real estate investor in California's Discovery Bay, he became one of the faces of Donald Trump's minority outreach. Many Hispanic voters were incensed by Mr Trump's plan to build a wall, but not Marco. He believes the barrier will stop the flow of drugs and illegal immigration across the border. ""My only reservation is the way the immigration force will work as far as protecting innocent families,"" he cautions. His public support for Mr Trump has cost him some friends and clients, but his wife, a fourth-generation Mexican-American, supports him. Marco was just 17 when he came to the United States from Mexico in 1991. His parents, who'd been working in the US fields for many summers, had been granted amnesty after Ronald Reagan's change in immigration policy. ""When I came here I had 75 cents in my pocket and a pair of jeans and a white T-shirt,"" Marco says. ""That was the beginning of my new life in the United States"" Even though he benefitted from an amnesty, Marco now believes in tougher immigration laws. ""Trump's a firm believer in results and so far I see results. That he's willing to sit down and talk about the problems. I think by March we're going to be able to judge whether he's making a difference. We have to give him a chance."" Bill Hartmann, 59, Michigan I met Bill Hartmann, a self-employed building repair man, as he delivered Trump yard signs in Detroit ahead of the Michigan primary back in March. ""He was the only candidate who said he wanted to make America great again. And that's what turned me on."" When he watched Clinton supporters in tears on election night, Bill says he had a flashback to the sadness he felt when Barack Obama won in 2008. ""I could totally relate to that"". Bill won't be among the inauguration crowds in Washington DC, but will be watching on a big screen at a local hall, with other supporters. This video can not be played Detroit voters are playing Trump's tune ""I think people have lost respect for America,"" Bill says, ""especially with Barack Obama going and bowing to other leaders in the world. Donald Trump doesn't want to be part of the new world order, he wants America to be independent."" Bill believes Trump's business past, can help deliver a fresh approach to foreign policy. ""He's someone who would be a good negotiator in contracts and agreements with foreign nations, he always seems to be open to discussion regardless of who the individual is."" June Savage, 49, Florida It was hard to miss June Savage when we met at a Trump rally in Miami, Florida. Dressed in a top hat, red boots and draped in an American flag, she was holding a Women for Trump placard. The former Miss Miami finalist, a lifelong Republican who works as a real estate agent, backed Mr Trump because he's a political outsider. ""You can't ask an attorney to be POTUS anymore. You need people who have built things, who have hired and fired people and who can stand up to these billionaire heads of state."" She's met the new president and sees his direct approach as a strength. ""He has a big mouth - we all know that. He says a lot of things that maybe people like or do not like."" Her one concern is Mr Trump's addiction to social media, but she says everyone has the same tendency these days. And to June, one of the biggest assets of a Trump presidency, is his VP pick, Mike Pence, the former governor of Indiana. ""They always say behind a good man is a very good woman,"" she says. ""Not to call Mike Pence a woman, but he's definitely the woman in this marriage.  So you have a very strong man, which is Pence, behind Trump."" Martha Lehner, 75, Texas Martha Lehner I met Martha, a retired teacher and volunteer for the Trump campaign in Texas, at a watch party for a Republican primary debate in Houston in February. Originally from Argentina, Martha came to the US nearly 30 years ago, and believes his wall on the US-Mexico border is a good idea. She hopes Trump keeps the promises he talked about during the campaign, including ""draining the swamp"", reducing illegal immigration and beefing up national security. She does have some advice for her new president though: get a thicker skin. ""Right now I think he's jumping on every negative comment that people in the media make of him, and he should just ignore it."" Cathy De Grazia, 56, Massachusetts Cathy jokes she may be the only Trump supporter in her town of 11,000 in Massachusetts. We met as she campaigned for Trump in the neighbouring state of New Hampshire in the weeks before the election. Cathy says she's become more conservative with age, but remains socially liberal. She was fed up with politicians from both parties. She hopes Mr Trump can unite the country, and blames President Obama for making things worse. ""I just don't remember having racial divides as badly in my lifetime as we have in the past administration,"" she says. But it was Mr Trump's economic policies that sealed her vote. Her father was a manufacturer who owned a textile mill in upstate New York in the 1980s. ""I know what's happened with trade agreements with other countries who don't have the same human rights standards and can lower costs, and unfairly compete with American workers."" On the campaign trail she said she heard similar stories from disenfranchised voters. ""A lot of people felt all of these jobs are disappearing and the government wasn't listening to us, things are decidedly worse for a lot of people."" Security, healthcare and the military also rank as Cathy's key concerns for a Trump administration. And even though she's concerned about climate change, she doesn't think ""pie in the sky agreements"" are the way forward. Cathy believes more needs to be done in making US cars more fuel efficient. ""We need to get our house in order before we start dictating to the rest of the world.""

Finding home,"Sunny Pawar as five-year-old Saroo in the new film Lion He was the tiny boy from a poor family in India who fell asleep on a train and woke up 1,000 miles from home. After fending for himself on the streets, five-year-old Saroo made it to an orphanage, where he was adopted by Australian couple Sue and John Brierley to begin a new life in Tasmania. Years later, as a young man, he yearned to discover more about his origins. So he began an ambitious Google Earth search that would prove to be fateful. Now his story has been told in Lion, a Hollywood film starringDev Pateland Nicole Kidman. The image of Saroo's birth mother burned in his mind. He set out to find her with a laptop and unwavering determination. It became an obsession. For years he pored over satellite photos night after night. ""I used mathematics and everything I could remember about the landmarks and the architecture of my home town,"" Saroo tells the BBC. Saroo Brierley first chronicled his story in his book, A Long Way Home Then one day he found it. A dusty village in central India filled with childhood memories - the forest, the temple, a little bridge, a brick wall, the waterfall where he used to play. Memories of his mother swirled. He wanted to tell her: ""I know you looked for me, but I spent my whole life looking for you."" Saroo wrote down his experience - including what happened next - in a memoir that spawned Lion, which opens in the UK and Australia this week. It has already screened in the US, and is hoping togenerate awards buzz. ""I never thought that something like this would come to someone like me. I'm a pretty laid-back kind of person,"" Saroo says. ""People are just so enthralled and enchanted by the movie."" When his book achieved success, Saroo took time out from his job selling industrial equipment in his father's business in Hobart. Now he has a packed schedule of film promotional tours. His life has changed again. Saroo's adoptive mother, Sue, hopes the film could help transform other lives too. ""Sadly we've got a lot more war happening [now] and I believe there are just as many children wishing they could join a family,"" she says. ""They're orphans of war, and just abandoned in camps."" Adoption should happen ""a lot more"", she says. Lion is the fifth film British actor Dev Patel has shot in India The film's cast has also supported fundraising to help the millions of children living on India's streets. Nicole Kidman has said she wasmoved to tearsby the film's ""beautiful"" depiction of an adoptive mother's love. ""I really admire her as an actress,"" says Sue. ""She's Australian, she's an adoptive mother - we're really on the same page."" Slumdog Millionaire star Patel spent eight months honing his Australian accent, bulking up and growing his hair out for Lion. ""His devotion in this film has just been amazing,"" Saroo says. As for himself, Saroo says he has returned to India more than a dozen times, but Tasmania remains home. ""That's where my heart is, that's where my family is, that's where my friends are,"" he says.

The granny solution,"Here's a solution that could tackle two of the West's most urgent problems: a young generation priced out of affordable housing, and the loneliness and isolation of a rapidly ageing population. For so-called millennials, like Mikyoung Ahn, a large home is a seemingly unattainable dream.  She could not imagine living in a spacious detached house on the leafy outskirts of Paris, just half an hour from the Arc de Triomphe. She definitely couldn't imagine paying just 120 Euros (Â£100) a month to live there. Yet, with the help of an innovative housing scheme, that idea is no longer a fantasy for the 25-year-old student from Seoul, South Korea. An aspiring architect, she wanted to live and study in one of the world's cultural capitals. To realise her dream, she turned away from traditional student accommodation. Instead of moving in with other young people, Mikyoung chose as a landlady and housemate a 78-year-old widow with a passion for patchwork. ""I knew I was going away from home for university, and that I wouldn't have any family or any friends,"" she says. ""But after the first meeting her, I knew it was going to be perfect."" Mikyoung and her landlady, Monique, have been living together since October, after they were matched by an organisation called Ensemble2Generations. This organisation and others like it pair elderly people with students, in an arrangement called homeshare. The concept is simple, yet it attempts to bridge an intergenerational divide that exists in many parts of the world. On one side are older people, who own properties that were purchased when house prices were comparatively cheap, but who may now need some help with daily activities like shopping and cleaning. On the other side are young people, who cannot afford to rent a decent flat, but who may have some time to spare. Monique has got Mikyoung into her hobby, quilting Mikyoung helps Monique with a range of everyday tasks. She carries Monique's shopping in the supermarket, washes up, and has even created an instruction sheet to help Monique understand all the buttons on her TV remote. ""It's not a big deal,"" she says. ""It's just life, you know. If I lived here, I would have to clean the dishes or take the trash out. I feel really this is my home - this is our home. ""Every night when I come back, I prepare the dinner and I put on the music that I have learned today. For example, Champs-ÃlysÃ©es or something like that, and we sing together."" Monique, who is a retired schoolteacher, is now an avid fan of Downton Abbey, after being introduced to the programme by Mikyoung. ""We have very good moments together, because we share a lot,"" says Monique. ""We often sit together and watch TV programmes. Everything is simple between us."" Turning to Monique, she adds: ""You are like a granddaughter to me."" Homeshare is not a new idea - it was first trialled in the USA and Spain during the 1980s. However, experts have recently started to view it as a scalable solution to two problems that continue to cause social problems. While young people are migrating to cities, pushing up the price of rent, many populations in the developed world are ageing. Meet the people fixing the world in the new World Service programme, World Hacks Listen to our feature on homesharing in Franceon World Hacksradio Get the World Hacks podcast Check out our Facebook page,external Homeshare schemes are now active in 16 countries across the world. Since 1999, an organisation called Homeshare International has acted as a network for homeshare schemes. ""The benefits to the householder are they feel much safer at home because of having someone else in the house,"" says Elizabeth Mills, the organisation's director. ""They're happier, incidents of accidents and falls go down, and the reassurance for the householder's family is absolutely enormous."" Most programmes offer two homeshare arrangements for prospective participants. The first allows the student to live in an elderly person's home rent-free in exchange for help around the house. The second requires the student to contribute money to household bills, but places fewer burdens on their time. It costs roughly 900 Euros a month for a student to live in the centre of Paris So will schemes like this help solve the housing crises of millenials - and the problems of the elderly? Research into homeshare projects in Spain and the USA indicates that participants are overwhelmingly satisfied by the arrangement. The Spanish study, for example, reported that 93.2% of elderly people had benefitted in some way from the programme, while 98.7% of students had benefitted. The organisation that paired Monique and Mikyoung, Ensemble2Generations, conducts face-to-face interviews before placing people together. Students even have to put pen to paper to explain why they want a placement, so that their application can be examined by a handwriting expert. Despite this, some partnerships simply do not work out. A major issue is that people of different generations may not always get on. Monique's previous housemate was a young gardener who spent a lot of time out of the house. When they did occasionally eat together, the gardener did not want to have a conversation. Instead, according to Monique, he just stared vacantly at his phone. But that did not shake Monique's confidence in homeshare. ""I never doubted whether I wanted to homeshare. I knew there were other people out thereâ¦ It is a good solution for me."" And although the gardener did not provide much companionship for Monique, experts widely acknowledge that homeshare is an effective antidote to loneliness - a problem that affects over one million elderly people in Britain, according to Age UK. Helen Bown, a policy expert who specialises in social isolation, says that the emotional support provided by a homeshare relationship often exceeds its financial advantages. ""People talk about not feeling so lonely anymore, particularly people who are single, "" she says. ""People have talked about having a safety net, particularly at night. ""I think one of the most compelling things that people have talked about, consistently, is the impact emotionally for people - the positive relationship. The feeling that people are contributing; that they are part of a mutually beneficial relationship, not just a transaction of care and support."" This is certainly the case for Armelle, a 64 year-old woman living in Cergy, northwest of Paris. Eighteen months ago, Armelle's husband died of cancer. Devastated, and fearing loneliness, she got in touch with Ensemble2Generations. Since then, she has housed a 19-year-old student called Blandine, from Versailles, who is studying engineering at a local university. ""If my husband had been here, I would never have thought of accommodating a student,"" says Armelle. ""But she's like a companion. It's so good to have a presence in the house. I enjoy Blandine's company a lot."" Armelle and Blandine have an easygoing friendship Armelle and Blandine's relationship is like a casual friendship. They relax together in the evenings and chat about their lives. While she was away from the house for a few days, Armelle even allowed Blandine to have a house party. ""Though her contract says that she's not allowed to have friends over, I know that I can trust her,"" says Armelle, laughing. ""I even helped her organise it."" The house has a large fireplace and a spectacular view over the lakes of Cergy. Unsurprisingly, Blandine is fond of these home comforts, and is not keen on moving into a cramped student flat for the next academic year. ""In student accommodation everything is in the same room, except for the bathroom,"" she says, wrinkling up her nose. ""I have a few friends who are offering to flat-share next year. I tell them, ""Why not?"" but I'm actually very comfortable here - I'm not sure I'm going to leave.""

Happy hookah,"Hookah pipe smoking is an integral part of Lebanese culture One of the most familiar sights in the Middle East is of local citizens gathering in cafes smoking hookah pipes as they drink coffee strong enough to knock out an Arabian horse. But in Beirut,Lebanon'scapital, such traditional pastimes are being given a hi-tech twist. Not only is the city as hip and cool as any city in the West, Lebanese technology is even changing the nature of the hookah pipe. Finding the ideal tobacco flavour in the bowl at the right temperature is the Holy Grail of hookahs, but a start-up called Nara - Arabic for flame - is solving this with the first ""internet of things"" hookah pipe. Compact fast-lighting spheres of charcoal are supplemented by a dense battery and internet-connected sensors that measure air flow, moisture and temperature - all vital elements for a perfect smoke. Beirut, as seen from Zaitunay Bay, looks a lot more prosperous and peaceful these days Nara does its best to keep everything in the bowl perfectly balanced. And the collected data can be used by cafe owners to prepare a personal mix for returning customers. With more than 500 million people across the region enjoying a daily hookah pipe, this is one of several innovations that the Beirut start-up ecosystem is beginning to create. Nara is the brainchild of Lebanese-born Fady Isshak, Joe Zoghzoghy, and Mark Haidar - the latter now a highly successful US-based entrepreneur. But Mr Haidar's start in life was far less auspicious. Raised in a ""mixed"" South Lebanese refugee area of Bedouins, Palestinians and other displaced peoples, Mr Haidar created his first product, a smart chair, when he was 17 and without the use of electricity. Mark Haidar made his money in the US but is now investing in his home country, Lebanon Smart and ambitious, he left Beirut when he was 23. Four days later he had received his US visa, after charming the interviewer by saying he'd learned English by watching the ""two best documentaries on America"": The Simpsons and Seinfeld. The reason for his swift departure was the beginning of the 2006 war. His father ordered him to get out of Beirut and gave his son the family's life savings of $2,200 (Â£1,785), asking only for him to leave ""$300 for food"". Mr Haidar took his chance, managed to get to the border, and like many refugees after him, travelled through Syria, Turkey and Germany before finally flying to the US and getting a job in a Detroit petrol station. The rest was another example of the American Dream come true. His companies include Silvr, a payments company, and Dialexa, a technology and product development firm. While Mr Haidar has invested in a Beirut start-up as part of Lebanon's diaspora, several other companies are starting life in the city itself. And smoking seems to be a key theme. Samer El Gharib founded Slighter, a smart cigarette lighter that helps smokers quit gradually. The lighter records the user's smoking habits in the first week that they use the device and then sends them notification of times they are allowed to smoke - one of several steps on the way to giving up completely. The Slighter smart lighter and app aims to help people quit smoking Another (non-smoking) Lebanese start-up is Play My Way, an educational way to stop children spending too much time on their smartphones and tablets. At parent-specified intervals, Play My Way interrupts any running app with an educational question and will only return to the app once the question is answered. Of clearly global appeal, last month the app was the third most downloaded app, not in Lebanon, but in the UK. Other global players in the tech scene are taking an interest in Beirut. Two months ago, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak made his first visit to the city. He was the keynote speaker at the BDL [Banque du Liban] Accelerate conference in November, one of the 10 biggest tech conferences in the world. Tony Fadell, creator of the iPod and iPhone, also addressed the 25,000-strong audience. Event organiser Samer Karam was originally a photojournalist in Lebanon, covering all the traumatic events of the region in the early 21st Century. Now, he is probably the most influential tech person across the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region. Beirut, renowned for its nightlife and cuisine, is also becoming a tech hub In 2010, he raised $700,000 and founded Seeqnce, one of MENA's first start-up accelerator programmes and whose first two batches of start-ups raised more than $10m. He regularly advises the Central Bank of Lebanon on best practices in venture capital and was a member of the founding steering committee of Lebanon's $600m start-up fund, BDL Circular 331. The Lebanese tech sector witnessed significant growth between 2009 and 2014 - the so-called ""youth bulge"". Young talented individuals have been able to start companies in their own country, rather than having to move abroad like so many others. There are 15 million Lebanese living in other countries, from Brazil to Melbourne. The establishment of new incubators and accelerators such as the UK Lebanon Tech Hub - an initiative between the Central Bank of Lebanon and the UK government - is creating jobs, revenues and investment for start-ups. ""We have already seen the ICT sector here take huge strides forward as a result of incentives, such as the introduction of Circular 331,"" says Colm Reilly, chief executive of UK Lebanon Tech Hub. ""There is huge R&D capability from academia here and if we get this right, Lebanon can become the tech gateway to the Middle East."" While nothing in Beirut is ever certain, at least it is now much easier to find that perfect hookah pipe smoke, thanks to technology.

CIA's Labour fear,"Denis Healey was accused in the papers of attacking US policies The Labour Party is ""in the hands of urban leftists given to ideological extremes with only fringe appeal"". That isn't an assertion about today's politics. It was the verdict of the US Central Intelligence Agency on Labour back in 1985, ina memo,externalfor the agency's director on the early phase of Neil Kinnock's leadership. This memo is one of millions of the CIA's historical recordswhich have just been made available online,external. Previously researchers had to actually visit the US National Archives in Maryland in order to access this database of declassified documents. The records reveal the deep level of concern inside the CIA about the strength of the Left within Labour in the early 1980s, a political force which the agency regarded as anti-American. A report written,externalin the run-up to the 1983 general election states that ""a Labor majority government would represent the greatest threat to US interests"". The agency was particularly worried by Labour's then policy of opposition to nuclear weapons, which included cancelling plans for the Trident submarine programme. This report was especially scathing about leading figures on the traditionally pro-nuclear Labour right who had compromised with this stance. It said that ""most disheartening from the viewpoint of US interests"" was the position of the party's deputy leader, Denis Healey. The CIA documents released contain two references to Jeremy Corbyn - then a backbench Labour MP It reported that he still had ambitions to lead the party and as a result ""he apparently has decided to appease the left by attacking US arms control policy, denouncing Trident, and denying he ever supported the NATO INF [Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces] program"". The report added that the growing power of the Left meant that ""even moderates like Healey have been forced to ape anti-American rhetoric"". Entitled ""The British Labor Party: Caught between Ideology and Reality"", the document is a detailed account of the balance of power between left and right in the party and trade unions, as seen by the CIA. It also records that leading Labour politicians had told US officials they did not take all of the party's policy programme seriously. The CIA was also concerned by what it saw as Europe's large centre-left and socialist parties (including Labour) being too sympathetic to the Soviet Union. One 1982 report,externalconcluded ""We have long contended that Moscow's most effective allies in Western Europe are not the Communist Parties, but self-styled Social Democrats who have betrayed the original tenets of social democracy."" Anothernewly accessible document,externalis a record of a 1981 meeting between delegations led by the US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Margaret Thatcher, who was on a prime ministerial visit to Washington. The meeting discussed the controversial American plans for an Enhanced Radiation Weapon (ERW), more commonly known as the ""neutron bomb"", a weapon which was said to be able to kill very large numbers of people while leaving buildings standing. Margaret Thatcher's foreign secretary Lord Carrington questioned the ""neutron bomb"" Also present at the meeting was Mrs Thatcher's Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, who told the Americans that ""it is considered unsporting in Europe for a weapon to kill people only"". The database contains just two references to the current Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. One noted his support in 1986 for an El Salvadoran trade union federation, Fenastras, which was linked to Marxist guerrillas during the country's civil war, while the Americans backed the military government. This is just a small immediate selection from millions of pages covering a wide range of American and international issues which reveal the CIA's analyses and preoccupations in the past. Records relating to more recent events have not yet been declassified. The CIA's decision to make all these documents searchable and accessible followed a legal case brought byMuckRock,external, a US organisation that promotes access to public records.

New Spurs stadium images revealed,"This video can not be played Five facts about Spurs' new stadium Tottenham Hotspur have revealed images of the club's new stadium which is being built in north London. The 61,000-seat stadium will be the largest-capacity football club ground in the capital when it opens in 2018. It will include what is believed to be the longest general admission bar in a UK stadium as well as heated seats, a micro-brewery and an in-house bakery. Chairman Daniel Levy said the ground would ""redefine sports and entertainment experiences"". The 61,000-seat stadium will be the largest-capacity football club ground in London The stadium will have a retractable grass field and an artificial surface underneath it allowing the ground to host football games, NFL matches, concerts and other events. Other features in the stadium include: A glass-walled players' tunnel allowing people a view of what is happening behind the scenes before a game A 285ft (86.8m) long general admission bar A new beer delivery system which will enable staff to deliver 10,000 pints per minute Premium seats which will be heated and have USB points A 17,000 single tier stand, which will be the largest in the UK The new stadium is expected to cost Â£750m but will create about 3,500 jobs in the area when it is finished, according to the club. A glass-walled tunnel will give people behind-the-scenes views of the action The ninth-floor Sky Lounge will provide panoramic views of the area Mauricio Pochettino's side will temporarily relocate for the 2017-18 season as the stadium is being built. The Football Association (FA) has given Tottenham the option to hire Wembley but Conservative MP Bob Blackman warned in the Commons this could lead to the ""potential abuse"" of the ""national treasure"".

Baby boy delivered by mother in car,"Shelley and Alexander Jack with their new son Lucas and his brother Jensen A mother delivered her own baby in a car as her husband tried to get her to hospital for the birth. Shelley Jack, 26, was being driven by husband Alexander, 30, from their Inverallochy home to Aberdeen after contractions started. However, before they could make it, their baby son was born in their Mitsubishi Outlander - near Donald Trump's Aberdeenshire golf resort. They then continued the journey. Baby Lucas is now home and doing fine. The unusual birth happened in the early hours of 10 January. Mrs Jack told BBC Scotland: ""I went to my bed as normal. But I woke up with stomach cramps, woke my husband to tell him I thought something was happening, and started to pace round the room. ""I started to panic as I am a bit of a worrier with stuff like that and told my husband to phone Aberdeen maternity. ""The midwife on the phone told us to come straight through."" She continued: ""We got in the car. About 15 minutes from our house I had no space between my contractions at all. ""I said, I'm sure they aren't supposed to go this quick. ""I was trying to move about the seat to relieve the pain but nothing shifted it. My husband saw the pain I was in and started to drive faster but kept trying to assure me that I'd only just started and I would get there in time to get pain relief if I wanted."" Mrs Jack went on: ""My waters popped round about Ellon and from there I knew this wasn't normal and the baby was trying to come out. ""I screamed to my husband to phone an ambulance as I felt my body starting to push something out and the pain was horrendous at this point. ""He phoned the midwife back. She also told me that if I felt my body pushing that I wouldn't be able to control it and that I would have to take off my trousers and just let the baby come. ""I thought this was absolutely crazy - who has a baby in their car on their own? ""I wouldn't give in - probably in denial that this would actually happen - but somewhere between the Trump golf course and the Cock and Bull restaurant I realised this baby really was coming out and I did what the midwife told me to do and the baby came out with a few pushes. ""I caught him in my hands and cradled him into my chest. My whole body was shaking uncontrollably. ""My husband by this point was hysterical as I think he didn't realise I was actually being serious when I said the baby was coming out.""

SportYuvraj and Dhoni seal series for India19 January 2017 (17:08:56),"MS Dhoni struck six sixes in his 134 Second one-day international, Cuttack India 381-6 (50 overs):Yuvraj 150 (127), Dhoni 134 (122) England 366-8 (50 overs):Morgan 102 (81), Ashwin 3-65 India won by 15 runs Scorecard Brilliant centuries from Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni gave India a series-clinching 15-run win over England in a thrilling second one-day international. India were reduced to 25-3 in Cuttack before Yuvraj, who struck 150, and Dhoni (134) shared a stand of 256. They helped India to 381-6, the third-highest total made against England. Eoin Morgan blasted an 80-ball hundred, Jason Roy, Joe Root and Moeen Ali all made half-centuries, but England ended 366-8 to go 2-0 down with one to play. That in itself was England's fifth-highest total andtheir second of 350 or more in as many games,but they still have not won a series in this country since 1984-85 and have lost 21 of their past 25 ODIs against India in India. The tourists looked well set to alter that record when Chris Woakes took three wickets in his first three overs, including the prolific Virat Kohli, but Yuvraj and Dhoni destroyed an England attack that had no control of length. An unlikely chase was not out of the question on an ideal batting surface, only for India's spinners to run through the England top order, with the late hitting of Morgan not enough in the face of the home attack's greater nous. Yuvraj (left) and Dhoni shared the second-highest partnership ever made against England in an ODI Before returning for the first match, Yuvraj was out of the India ODI side for more than three years, dropped at the end of a 2013 when he averaged only 19.71 with the bat. Recalled after some excellent domestic form, he made his first ODI century for six years and his highest score, dismantling the England bowling with stylish drives and brutal pulls. England were right to initially probe the left-hander's historical weakness against the short ball, but too slow to change a plan that did not work. Time and again short deliveries were dismissed to the leg-side fence, even after Yuvraj had registered his 14th ODI ton with Jake Ball the most persistent offender. Yuvraj successfully overturned a caught-behind decision on 145 and a double century seemed possible until he edged the excellent Woakes, comfortably the pick of England's bowlers, to wicketkeeper Jos Buttler. Dhoni relinquished the white-ball captaincy to Kohli before this series but once again proved his worth alongside the equally experienced Yuvraj - both 35 and with 580 caps between them. Usually at his best at the end of the innings, Dhoni dealt with the inconvenience of having to arrive in the fifth over by batting until the 48th, initially as a foil for Yuvraj. He was dropped on 43, a tough chance to a retreating Ball off a leading edge, and only really accelerated as he neared a century, announcing his intention with a huge six over long-on off Woakes. From there it was carnage, as Dhoni took 41 runs off the last 20 balls he faced. Overall, India hit 214 from their final 20 overs and 120 off the last 10. Liam Plunkett, ineffective on his return for figures of 2-91, was hammered for three sixes in an over, eventually getting a crumb of comfort when Dhoni hit a full toss to David Willey at deep mid-wicket. England were not fazed by what would have been their highest successful run chase in ODIs, with Root and Roy sharing a stand of 100 that kept the tourists ahead of the curve. However, off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin,England's tormentor during their 4-0 Test series defeat,had Root sky a sweep, bowled Ben Stokes and had Buttler stumped down the leg side, while spin partner Ravindra Jadeja found turn to bowl Roy. Still England pressed on, captain Morgan returning to form with sixes over long-on and long-off, and Moeen's leg-side scoring bringing him a 40-ball half-century. When Moeen dragged on to his stumps off Bhuvneshwar Kumar, it looked to be a fatal blow to England's chances, but Morgan kept them alive in a fifty partnership with Plunkett that came in only 24 balls. The Irishman reached his ninth ODI ton only to be run out by bowler Jasprit Bumrah when backing up too far, taking England's hopes with him as he departed. Falling short by 15 in a game of 747 runs, England will reflect on a bowling effort that was too expensive and top-order batting that failed to capitalise on a strong position. Simon Hughes on Test Match Special India got just too many runs. England's bowling wasn't focused enough on Yuvraj Singh and then they lost wickets at the wrong time. It's unfair to blame England's death bowlers, but they still haven't got that right. Woakes is good but they haven't got another person that they can really rely on. India's 381-6 is the third-highest score ever made against England in a one-day international. The partnership of 256 by Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni is the second-highest for any wicket by any opponent against England in ODIs, bettered only by the 286 shared by Sanath Jayasuriya and Upul Tharanga for Sri Lanka in 2006. Yuvraj is only the sixth man to make a score of 150 or more against England in an ODI. England made their fifth-highest ODI total and their largest batting second. It was also the largest score they have ever made to lose an ODI. 747 runs is the second-most made in an ODI in India, behind the 825 made by the hosts and Sri Lanka in 2009-10. Joe Root has made a half-century in each of the five Tests and two ODIs against India this winter. England captain Eoin Morgan:""We probably weren't at our best with ball or the bat but we still competed and it's tremendously disappointing not to get over the line. ""Bowling to MS Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh is very difficult at times. The margin for error is quite small and the challenge is to break the partnership a little earlier. ""We showed a lot of fight, we have a huge amount of talent. It's been a magnificent day's cricket."" India captain Virat Kohli:""I said to the team that if we had had a good start then where could we have ended up today? MS Dhoni and Yuvraj Singh brought stability and wonders to the team, their batting rate was outstanding. ""A 380 target, we thought, was a bit too far-fetched, but we bowled at the most difficult phase because of the dew and the ball was very hard to execute - and the guys showed great character. ""If we had not picked out the wickets in the middle then I'm not sure where the game would have gone."" Man-of-the-match Yuvraj Singh:""In the domestic season I've been hitting the ball really well and I've been working hard on my fitness. The results showed today. ""Me and MS Dhoni understand the situations really well, we started by hitting the ball down the ground really well and not taking any risks. Then we attacked when the time was right."" ""Diet has been the key, as you pass 30 you've got to work hard on your fitness - I learned that from Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble, all the greats.""

Two presidents for The Gambia - what next?19 January 2017 (19:35:51),"Mr Barrow took the oath of office in his country's embassy in Senegal A political crisis in The Gambia appears to be coming to a head, with Senegalese and Nigerian troops in the country to ensure long-time leader Yahya Jammeh gives up power after losing elections last month. Mr Jammeh has asked for a deadline for him to leave office to be extended from noon until 16:00 GMT on Friday or be forced out by West African forces. They deployed on Thursday after the internationally-recognised new president, Adama Barrow, was sworn in at his country's embassy in the Senegalese capital, Dakar, in front of ambassadors from countries in the UN Security Council and key African states. This video can not be played Why The Gambia is in turmoil - in 60 seconds. Shortly afterwards the UN Security Council unanimously backed action against Mr Jammeh. Troops have been told to halt their advance for a last attempt at negotiation by the presidents of Guinea and Mauritania, who have arrived in the Gambian capital, Banjul. The chairman of West African regional bloc Ecowas, Marcel Alain de Souza, has said that if the meeting proved unsuccessful, military action will follow. Mr Barrow, who remains in Senegal, has said that he will not return to Banjul until the operation has ended. Ecowas mandated Senegal, which almost surrounds The Gambia, to lead a military intervention to install Mr Barrow. Nigeria has also sent aircraft and troops to Senegal, and deployed a warship. Mr Barrow has urged soldiers in The Gambia to remain in their barracks and warned those that do not will be considered rebels. The country is a popular tourist destination and after the British Foreign Office updated its travel advice, holiday companieshave been evacuating tourists. The UN Security Council unanimously backed Ecowas efforts to install Mr Barrow. However, the text of the resolution said this should be ""by political means first"" and made no explicit mention of military action. Some diplomats have suggested that formal UN authorisation for an intervention may not be necessary if Mr Barrow, having assumed the presidency, requested help. Mr Jammeh tried to bolster his position earlier this week by declaring a state of emergency and engineering a parliamentary vote to extend his presidency by three months. He said these moves would prevent a power vacuum while the Supreme Court considered a legal challenge he has submitted over the election result. The parliamentary vote took place while Mr Jammeh was officially president and is considered legally valid under Gambian law. This means The Gambia could now be considered to have two presidents, although each side obviously disputes the legitimacy of the other. Regional powers chose to disregard the parliamentary vote on the grounds that Mr Barrow won December's election fairly and should take office. Without the extension, Mr Jammeh's term ended at midnight on Wednesday. The Senegalese-led intervention force will be expected to have more firepower than the Gambian army but it is not clear how much resistance it will face. The army chief is a close Jammeh loyalist but has been quoted as saying he would not risk his men's lives in a political dispute. The elite regiment of the army, drawn mainly from the same ethnic group as Mr Jammeh, is well-armed and is regarded as being fiercely loyal. Mr Jammeh remains ensconced at State House with their protection and unnamed officials have been reported as saying these troops would resist any attempt to arrest him. However, they would be at a considerable numerical disadvantage to the intervening force. The loyalty of other Gambian regiments is much less certain. Correspondents say there has been talk that some are unhappy with recent events and want a peaceful resolution. Tension is high in the Gambian capital over concerns that the political conflict will escalate into violence. Thousands of people have fled to neighbouring countries and rural areas. Earlier this week, Mr Barrow's coalition urged Gambians to ""exercise restraint, observe the rule of law and not to respond to provocation"". Some celebrated when Mr Barrow won elections, but there are fears of possible violence now The BBC's Umaru Fofana, who is in Banjul, says people there are petrified. They are stocking up on food and water. Everyone has been praying for a peaceful resolution, he says. Mr Jammeh, who seized power in a 1994 coup, initially accepted that Mr Barrow hadwon the electionbut later reversed his position and said he would not step down. He filed a petition to the Supreme Court, challenging the election results, and says the existence of this legal process means it would be unconstitutional for Mr Barrow to assume office. He also asked the Supreme Court for an injunction to stop the inauguration but the chief justice declined to rule on it, saying he must recuse himself from any case that could affect his own position - he would normally conduct the swearing-in ceremony. Mr Jammeh has said there were irregularities in the election process, including the turning away of some of his supporters from polling stations, and errors made by the electoral commission. Yahya Jammeh is refusing to stand down and is thought to command the support of elite troops The commission accepted that some of the results it initially published contained errors, but said Mr Barrow still won. Retaining power would ensure he was not prosecuted inThe Gambiafor alleged abuses committed during his rule. Ministers are continuing to desert Mr Jammeh's government. Several ministers, and even the long-serving vice-president, have resigned in recent days. One of the ministers who resigned, former information chief Sheriff Bojang,said Mr Jammeh's arguments had a ""veneer of constitutionalism""but were an attempt to subvert the will of the Gambian people. The international community says Mr Barrow won fairly. The lawyer representing Mr Jammeh and his APRC party in the election challenge has also fled to Senegal and urged the long-time leader to step aside. Judges from Nigeria and Sierra Leone have been hired to hear the petition to overturn the election result, but they have yet to arrive in Banjul. Gambian chief justice Emmanuel Fagbenle has said the court will be able to convene no earlier than May, and possibly not until November, because the Nigerian who is to act as court president, Onogeme Uduma, is fully booked for the coming months. Nigerian leader Muhammadu Buhari (r) was in Banjul on Friday but could not persuade Mr Jammeh to change his mind Mr Barrow has distanced himself from comments, made by other opposition figures, suggesting Mr Jammeh may be prosecuted over alleged abuses in power. He said Mr Jammeh should be able to stay in The Gambia and would be honoured as, and receive the privileges of, a former head of state if he stepped down. However, Mr Jammeh does not appear to have been persuaded by his opponent's apparently conciliatory language. Another option, raised by Nigerian MPs, is that Mr Jammeh could be offered asylum and a comfortable retirement in another African country. Besides Nigeria, Morocco has been mooted as a possible destination (Mr Jammeh's wife is Moroccan). With the entry of Senegalese and Nigerian troops, a third possibility now appears to be unfolding - that Mr Jammeh, having rejected all offers so far, continues to cling to power with the backing of at least some of the army, until he is forcefully removed.

Armalite to armistice,"Out of the shadows: Martin McGuinness pictured on the Falls Road in 2001 It is a short flick in the dictionary from ""paramilitary"" to ""parliamentary""; it's more of agiant leap in a man's lifetime. Martin McGuinness, IRA commander turned Northern Ireland deputy first minister, switched from Armalite to an armistice. When McGuinnesstriggered the latest political crisis by his resignation at Stormont,the talk on the street was not of the political future. It was that shock picture, snapped through the back window of a rain-stained ministerial car window. Martin McGuinness' appearance shocked many as he arrived to announced his resignation It was about how frail and gaunt Northern Ireland's deputy first minister looked.It has been widely reported that he has a rare condition with a specific genetic link to Donegal,external- his past and the history that shaped him. Martin McGuinness' mother was from Donegal. She moved to Londonderry, where, like generations of women before her, she found work in the shirt factories. He was one of seven children - six boys and a girl - who grew up in Derry's Bogside in the 1960s. Times were tough. The Bogside was hopelessly overcrowded as a result of gerrymandering and the poverty of that time. The McGuinness family of nine had two bedrooms, an outside toilet and a scullery - a tiny working kitchen. Martin McGuinness says he made the transition to politics in the mid-1970s In an interview for the Guardian in 2009,external, pressed on why he decided to join the IRA, he talked about how, in 1965, he applied for a job as a mechanic. The interview consisted of three sentences: ""What's your name?""; ""What school did you go to?"" and: ""Out the door."" He became a trainee butcher - an occupation ripe for future headline writers. The young McGuinness was drawn to the civil rights movement, radicalised by discrimination and murder on the streets of his city and caught up in the riots. He took the violent route. In 1972, at the age of 21, he was second-in-command of the IRA in Derry at the time ofBloody Sunday, when 14 civil rights protesters were killed in the city by soldiers. Martin McGuinness (left) carries the coffin of IRA man Charles English with his brother William McGuinness (right) at the funeral in Derry 1984 He had a leading role in the IRA during a time when the paramilitary organisation was bombing his home city to bits. The following year, he was convicted by the Republic of Ireland's Special Criminal Court after being arrested near a car containing explosives and ammunition. He served two prison sentences - he was also convicted for IRA membership. But he knew how to talk. His leadership potential was spotted early - not just by his own side. He was 22 when he and Gerry Adams were flown to London for secret talks with the British government:MI5 considered him serious officer material with strategic vision. He maintained that he left the IRA in 1974 making the transition to politics. Sinn FÃ©in president Gerry Adams with Martin McGuinness in 1987 ""Reports that I am chief of staff of the IRA are untrue. But I regard them as a compliment,"" he once said. There were dark years that followed from the IRA hunger strikes to the Brighton bombing, when Margaret Thatcher and the Tory Party conference were targeted, to the 1987 Enniskillen bomb when 11 people died at a Remembrance Day ceremony. He later said he had no knowledge of the Enniskillen bomb, calling it ""absolutely wrong"" and he dismissed suggestions that throughout the 1980s he was a leading member of the IRA, a time when the organisation was responsible for hundreds of murders. In 1993, he was labelled ""Britain's number one terrorist"" in Central Television's The Cook Report. He called the report ""cowardly and dishonest"" television. The shift to the politics of peace came slowly. In 1986, the party decided to contest elections in the Republic of Ireland. Ten years later, the landscape in Northern Ireland had changed irrevocably. McGuinness was chief negotiator in the peace process. Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness smile after being sworn in as first and deputy first ministers of the Northern Ireland Assembly In 1997, he became MP for Mid Ulster. He took on the post of education minister in the Stormont administration and his legacy was the decision to kill off the 11-Plus examination - a political hot potato that still stokes up a fiery glow in the eyes of those opposed to the move. By 2007, he was Northern Ireland's deputy first minister standing alongside First Minister Ian Paisley. It was the kind of marriage that only a mad matchmaker contemplates. The father of the Free Presbyterian Church - the DUP leader famed for ""Never! Never! Never!"" - and the hardliner republican once wedded to the armed struggle? Martin McGuinness and Arlene Foster But there was a click. They became the poster boys for modern politics - the Chuckle Brothers who giggled together. When a stony-faced Peter Robinson, DUP, stepped into the first minister's shoes, McGuinness said the ""honeymoon"" was over. The pair was more like the Brothers Grimm. From rocky beginnings, it proved a slow thaw. When DUP leader Arlene Foster took the reins, it proved frostier again. A month after she took on the post of first minister in January 2016, she said it wasdifficult for her because he gave the graveside oration at the funeralof the man who, she believes, tried to kill her father. The ice thickened and became impenetrable after McGuinness resigned in protest ather refusal to stand asidefor an investigation into abotched green schemethat she set up. Stormont's institutions subsequently collapsed. Sinn FÃ©in's Martin McGuinness met the Queen for the first time in June 2012 Nevertheless, over the past ten years for Martin McGuinness, there were seismic moments. There was the famous handshakewith Queen Elizabeth II; there wasa toast to her Majesty at Windsor Castleas the band played God Save The Queen - gestures that stuck in the gullets of hard-line republicans and loyal servants of the Queen alike. In recent years, he said: ""My war is over. My job as a political leader is to prevent that war and I feel very passionate about it."" He did it his way... right up to the moment on Monday 9 January, when he signed off at Stormont, saying the time was right to ""call a halt to the DUP's arrogance"".

Remember these?,"This video can not be played Last month, UK suppliers told the BBC produce from the continent was being ""treated like gold"" Anyone trying to stock their kitchen full of vegetables may have noticed a shortage of their favourite greens or salad items. It started last month with some supermarkets having problems stocking courgettes and spinach, while iceberg lettuce is now being rationed by some chains. Retailers have blamed empty shelves on bad weather in Spain and Italy. A combination of flooding, cold weather and poor light levels in southern Europe is said to have created the""perfect storm"" of poor growing conditions. During the winter months, Spain's south-eastern Murcia region supplies 80% of Europe's fresh produce. But after suffering its heaviest rainfall in 30 years, only 30% of Murcia's growing fields are useable. Snow covers crops in a field in the countryside in Murcia This has coincided with a cold snap in Italy, which normally exports vegetables at this time of the year but is now having to import them. The effects of shortages are particularly pronounced in Britain, which imports an estimated 50% of its vegetables and 90% of its fruit. The Grocer magazine's fresh and chilled foods editor, Kevin White, told the BBC he could not recall the weather affecting supplies so severely. Courgettes and spinach supplies have been severely affected by the cold weather. Jordi Vorderman, UK sales manager at Dutch vegetable supplier Valstar Holland, said courgette prices were the worst affected, but that ""the cost of everything imported from Spain and Italy is sky-high at the moment"". Philippe Binard, of Freshfel Europe which represents the fresh produce industry, said the problems afflicting vegetable production were unprecedented and had left the yield of courgettes, aubergines, tomatoes, broccoli and peppers from Spain down by about 25%. Iceberg lettuces and cabbages have also been affected, with experts unsure where the shortages could fall next. Fruit and vegetable wholesaler Nick Padley told BBC News that more than 90% of Europe's iceberg lettuce came from one small region in south-east Spain. He said: ""There's a gap of about six weeks on iceberg lettuce, nothing is coming from Spain for six to eight weeks. Our supplier is now going to be bringing in iceberg from America which is obviously costing more. It's a tough time."" BBC News spoke to traders at New Covent Garden fruit and vegetable market, who said they were struggling to meet demand and were planning to import produce from the US. Michael Goodwin said: ""I've been in this trade for 40-odd years and I've never known it so bad, where everything is so dear. I've got plenty of English parsnips, potatoes and carrots but foreign produce is like gold."" At New Covent Garden market, vegetable seller Mark Gregory said: ""Whereas normally courgettes are Â£6 or Â£7 [a crate], they're now 20-22 quid and we're struggling to get them. ""We usually have a couple of pallets full of them, this morning we've got just 80 boxes."" He is awaiting delivery of a lorry load of courgettes which should have arrived on Wednesday but will not be in the UK until Friday. Mr Vorderman said some supermarkets were not prepared to buy courgettes at such high prices and would rather leave their shelves empty. Tessa Knowles, who goes to Italy each week buying fruit and vegetables for a wholesaler, said: ""Prices have rocketed. The cold weather has devastated their crops out there. It's also affected the upcoming fruit on trees so we may still feel the longer-term effects."" Another trader, Tom Craig, said: ""Because there's so little produce coming over, the prices have escalated out of control. ""It normally is a little bit more expensive in January because of the bad weather but this year is exceptionally bad. Aubergines are Â£20 [a crate], peppers are two or three pounds dearer than they are normally at this time of year so it's very hard."" This man's quest for courgettes ended in failure Supermarkets can chase the sun to get seasonal produce all year round, but the rest of Europe will also be looking for new sources for their produce - all of which could push up prices even further. Wholesalers have told the BBC they know of customers who have cleared supermarket shelves to try to supply restaurants and caterers. Though customers have noticed some empty shelves, not all the supermarkets are reporting shortages. Co-op said it was not experiencing any shortages, and Sainsbury's said it was working to maintain its courgette supply for customers. Similarly, Lidl said: ""We are working closely with our suppliers to maintain the supply of products affected by the weather conditions in Europe."" On a shortage of iceberg lettuce, Tesco said it was ""working with our suppliers to resolve them as quickly as possible"".

Jonathan Head: Is Malaysia dragging its heels over MH370 search costs?,"Many distraught relatives have called for the search to continue The announcement on 17 January that the search for MH370 was being suspended should have surprised no-one. At the tripartite meeting last July of the three countries involved in the search, Malaysia, Australia and China, they agreed that it would not be continued beyond the current 120,000sq km area (46,332 sq miles) of the southern Indian Ocean, unless there was credible new information showing a specific location for the crashed airliner. Nonetheless the families of the victims have condemned this requirement for a ""precise location"", calling it ""at best an erroneous expectation, and at worst a clever formulation to bury the search"". MH370: What we know Is it likely MH370 will ever be found? The passengers on board MH370 MH370: The key pieces of debris One man's search for answers They have pointed to a statement in December by the Australian Transport Safety Board, which is leading the search operation, that in view of the drift modelling carried out by the Australian scientific organisation CSIRO for debris from MH370 found along the East African coast, there was ""strong evidence that the aircraft is most likely to be located to the north of the current indicative underwater search area"". And with no trace of the airliner found after an exhaustive two-and-a-half-year search, all the experts agree they have been looking in the wrong area. There were 14 nationalities among the 227 passengers and 12 crew on board the plane The CSIRO drift models suggest the search should be shifted to a 25,000sq km area immediately north of the existing zone, along the arc that satellite data shows the plane must have travelled. It might require an additional $40-50m to extend the search operation into the new area, on top of the $160m already spent. But the three governments appear unmoved, sticking rigidly to the formula they agreed last July, although the Australian and Malaysian governments insist cost is not a factor in their decision to stop searching. However in an interview with ABC News on Tuesday, Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester made the point that any decision to resume the search was ""primarily Malaysia's call"". That underlines a problem which has troubled the search operation from the start: who is really responsible? Back in February 2015 Australia submitted a request to the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), which regulates international air travel, for clearer guidelines on which country should be responsible for both organising and funding an extended search operation. Under existing guidelines Australia is responsible for initial search-and-rescue efforts in the vast areas of ocean off its western coast. But once it was clear there would be no survivors, it became a search-and-recovery operation, for which responsibility is not clear. This video can not be played Flight MH370: Audio recording reveals final cockpit communications The ICAO designates to Malaysia, the flag state of the missing plane, the task of leading the accident investigation, but it is not clear whether that includes running the extended search. This was important because by 2015 Australia had shouldered most of the financial burden, and people were beginning to complain. After all, the specialised ships and detection equipment used in the search had to be rented from a Dutch salvage company; any of the three countries could have covered this cost. Only six of the MH370 passengers were Australians, whereas 153 came from China, which has so far contributed relatively little, around $16m, although the ICAO imposes no requirement on it do so. The Malaysian government now says it has contributed a total of $112m, but the official Australian figures suggest it has actually spent less than that. So why does Malaysia not take the initiative to fund an extended search? The Malaysian Transport Ministry responded to this question with the formula from last July, that all three countries had agreed they first needed indications of a specific location for the crash site, despite that fact that such detailed information in a huge expanse of sea is extremely unlikely to be found. Pieces probably from the plane have been found as far away as Madagascar Relatives of the passengers have also criticised the Malaysian authorities for being so slow to request recovered pieces of debris, eight of which are now believed to be almost certainly from the missing airliner. That debris is important: it has not only helped ascertain a probable alternative location for the plane; it has also helped confirm how the aircraft ended its flight, with Australian investigators concluding that it plunged into the sea, and was not under the control of the pilot. Malaysia has at times given the impression of being a reluctant lead investigator, happy for Australia to do most of the legwork. This video can not be played Grace Subathirai Nathan: ""I want to know what happened to my mother"" Aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas describes Malaysia's approach as ""inexcusable and irresponsible. It is their plane, and their responsibility to find out what happened to it. They are walking away from their commitment to international aviation and the flying public"". The Malaysian Ministry of Transport says only that ""all decisions with regards to the MH370 search have and will always be in the spirit of tripartite co-operation."" If it is primarily Malaysia's call to restart the search operation, it looks unlikely to make it.

A bum note,"This video can not be played The Marching Tornado Band has travelled all the way from Alabama. The only marching band from a historically black college to perform at the Trump presidential inauguration has experienced intense backlash. Regardless, on Thursday morning, the Talladega Marching Tornadoes blew into Washington. When students awoke after the 19-hour bus trip from Talladega, Alabama, one of the first scenes that greeted their bleary eyes in the nation's capital was Senator Bernie Sanders, waiting to cross the street. It was a sight few of the Talladega College marching band members thought they'd ever see - a former presidential candidate strolling to work - as the vast majority had never even been outside the state of Alabama. ""They're so talented, these young people. We're really excited to give them this opportunity,"" said Dr Sharon Whittaker-Davis, the school's vice-president of student affairs, as she watched the students pour out of the buses and into the African American Civil War Museum in Washington. ""We're here."" After 19 hours on the bus from Talladega, Alabama, the Marching Tornadoes arrive in Washington The night before, the mayor of tiny Talladega and a crowd of about 100 well-wishers cheered as the buses pulled out of town. It was a loving send-off that contrasted sharply with the treatment the band had faced in previous weeks. Several other high schools and colleges, including historically black institutions like Howard University, declined the invitation or didn't even apply to play at Donald Trump's inauguration. As soon as it was announced that the Marching Tornadoes was the sole black college to accept, they were called sell-outs, race traitors and worse. The college president received demands for his resignation, and then death threats. Alumni begged their alma mater not to go. ""Please do not march in this. Stand with people of colour against racism,"" one comment read on the band's Facebook page. However, after college president Barry Hawkins appeared on Fox News to explain his decision to let the band perform, donations to a GoFundMe page raising money for the trip shot through the roof, soaring toalmost $650,000,external(Â£527,000). The extra money will go towards scholarships, new band uniforms, new instruments and a new practice space - the college has only 700 students, almost all of whom receive some type of financial aid. Omarosa Manigault, Donald Trump's director of communications, take selfies with the Talladega Tornadoes Many of the band members come from low-income backgrounds and are the first in their families to attend college. The students were eager about the invitation and took the ensuing backlash personally. ""I just couldn't understand why they would do that to us,"" said 21-year-old alto saxophone player Eriel House. ""We're students. We're not involved in a political party. We just wanted to go show our talents."" ""[He's president] regardless,"" said Shylexis Robinson. ""I just want to march on Pennsylvania Avenue, period."" Once in Washington, the trip organisers had hoped to take the students straight to the Martin Luther King Memorial on the National Mall. But because streets were already blocked off for the inauguration, they instead headed to the African American Civil War Museum - a tribute to the black soldiers who fought for the Union. Talladega College itself was founded in 1867 by the descendants of slaves. Students took selfies in front of a monument to black soldiers who fought for the Union in the Civil War Inside the darkened museum, the students swished around in their matching blue-and-crimson tracksuits, peering into display cases of rusty slaves' shackles, a yellowed 1862 copy of the New York Times announcing the ""preliminary emancipation"" of slaves, and a sign that reads: ""We Serve Colored Carry Out Only"". When Mr Hawkins announced to the group that a special guest awaited the students across the street, a student said: ""Obama?"" Instead, Omarosa Manigault - former Apprentice star, director of Mr Trump's African-American outreach during the campaign, and now his director of communications - waited beside a statue of four black Union soldiers. Students clamoured for selfies. ""You have shown and exhibited such great courage... we can't move forward unless we are together,"" Ms Manigault called out. ""On behalf of the president, Donald J Trump, I want to just thank you, welcome you here and I cannot wait to see y'all show up and show out tomorrow at the inauguration parade!"" Milling around the memorial, Melissa Harris traced her hand along the names inscribed on the monument. ""I think I found one of my ancestors on one of these walls,"" she said. ""I hope we get to meet President Obama,"" another girl sighed. ""I don't think it's hitting us yet that he's going,"" said Marissa Melchor quietly. ""He's not dying,"" her friend said rolling her eyes. ""It feels unreal,"" Ms Melchor replied. ""But reality is going to hit us."" Elkena Washington on the E-flat alto saxophone and Melissa Harris on piccolo The students piled back onto the buses and took a long, slow ride through packed traffic to the University of the District of Columbia campus. There the students got their first meal since the previous day, and listened to remarks from local business people who donated to their GoFundMe campaign. None of the students who spoke to BBC News expressed a strong support for incoming President Trump, but they seemed cautiously optimistic. ""I don't like everything about him. I think it's going to be a pretty interesting couple of years,"" said Bernard Norris, an 18-year-old trombone player. ""I just wish him the best of luck and I hope he does the country right... I hope something good comes out of this."" In the hallway outside the dining hall, 21-year-old first chair trumpeteer Marco Vera said that even though he is excited to perform, it was hard to hear some of the remarks Mr Trump made during the campaign. ""Coming from a Hispanic background, having to see my parents struggle through everything to get where we're at... it hurts,"" he said. ""Yeah, he said some stuff about us, but I'm performing for my college. I'm performing for my parents. My parents told me to go out there and showcase my talent... so I'm just going to go out there and make my family proud.""

'They took our jobs',"Jesus Oliva lost his job when Ford pulled out of Mexico in favour of the US The arid desert landscape of Villa de Reyes is a world away from the glitz of the presidential inauguration on Capitol Hill. Yet since Donald Trump was elected, the sparsely populated communities and dry valleys of Central Mexico have been inexorably linked to events in Washington DC. Like so much with President-elect Trump, it began with a tweet. ""Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!"" he tweeted at General Motors earlier this month. The warning may have been aimed at GM but within hours, Ford, which had also been singled out for criticism during his campaignannounced that it was withdrawing from a $1.6bn (Â£1.3bn) car assembly plant in Villa de Reyes. Some of that money would be reinvested in Michigan in what the CEO of Ford described to the BBC as ""a vote of confidence"" in Mr Trump's business policies. Donald Trump has promised to punish companies who put their factories in other countries Today, that half-finished factory sits idle, gathering dust in the desert. The car plant has gone from a shining example of cross-border free trade to an eerie monument to Mr Trump's aggressive brand of economic protectionism. Trump supporters heralded the move as evidence that his harder stance towards Mexico will boost US jobs. For Jesus Oliva, though, it was just evidence that the next four years will be tougher than he'd hoped. He had worked on the site for six months when the entire workforce was told they were fired one morning. ""It was a decent job,"" he says of his time as a night-watchman. ""It was nearby so we could walk to work."" Jesus lives in the shadow of the abandoned Ford construction, in a community of around 500 families called La Presita. Plus, of course, it was regular pay. The factory now sits half-built and abandoned Jesus now harvests cactus to make a living from selling a fermented alcoholic beverage called aguamiel and a typical Mexican food, nopales. At 58, he has few other options, but he fears for the younger generation. ""Many will immigrate north or go to other places to try to build their lives. We need jobs here too so people can live honestly. I think that's where the delinquency and crime comes from - having no work."" Trump v the car industry Mexicans' Donald Trump fears The state authorities in San Luis Potosi admit that Ford's decision was ""not good news"". ""It was very good news nine months ago when we signed the agreement and announced that Ford was coming to San Luis Potosi,"" said Gustavo Puente Orozco, the state's secretary for economic development. Still he refrains from criticising the company - at least in public. Gustavo Puente Orozco, the state's secretary for economic development, has not criticised Ford for its decision ""Beyond being disappointed, I have to be very professional and I have to respect what the companies do and the decisions they make. As a former businessman I understand that markets and strategies can change."" ""We have to work with them to find the best solution for both parties,"" he adds, before underlining that Ford have not pulled out of Mexico altogether. Far from it, in fact. Their assembly plant in Hermosillo could even end up benefitting from these international movements of investment and capital that have accompanied Mr Trump's arrival in the White House. The local authorities insist that San Luis Potosi is still in good shape, with or without Ford, ranking fifth out of 32 states in terms of GDP growth per capita. ""We grew 5.4% in 2015 compared to the Mexican average of 2.5,"" said Mr Puente, which he attributes to a range of industries from mining to food production. Nevertheless there are likely to be complications ahead. This video can not be played Ford's chief executive says the move was a ""vote of confidence"" in Trump One of Mr Trump's key election promises was to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, or Nafta. Added to that is the thorny question of more walls - both ""real and through taxes"" as Secretary Puente puts it. As the Trump administration prepares to take office, the idea that Mexico will pay for an extended border wall is roundly dismissed by ordinary Mexicans and politicians alike. ""Mexico isn't going to pay for that wall. Not today, not ever, not even on credit,"" Senator Luis Humberto Fernandez said in a statement in the final days before Mr Trump's inauguration. Still, in San Luis Potosi, many fear the worst from the incoming administration. Among them is the community leader at La Presita - an aged rancher called Gregorio Flores, known locally as Don Goyo. People here are fearful of a Trump presidency He can see the empty structure from his patch of land as he feeds his pigs every morning. ""We'd hoped to build a school and we urgently need a road as we're so cut off,"" he says, lamenting the loss for the village. His neighbour, Jesus Oliva, perhaps one of the first casualties in a US trade conflict with Mexico, says he'd urge the president-elect to ""play fair"". ""They accuse Mexicans of taking their jobs. But now they're coming in and taking away ours.""

Great expectations,"This video can not be played Mr Trump's supporters who will be going to the inauguration What do the millions of Trump supporters want from their new president? The BBC's Rajini Vaidyanathan catches up with some of the voters she met while travelling across America during the election campaign. Sarah Jo Reynolds, 25,Arkansas Sarah Jo works for the Republican Party of Arkansas and I met her at her office in Little Rock a few days before the second presidential debate in October. While other Republican women in the state had voiced concerns over Donald Trump's threat to bring up Bill Clinton's past as an election issue, Sarah Jo was steadfastly behind her candidate. She remains so today, and has travelled to Washington DC for the inauguration. During the primaries she was the ""odd one out"" with her friends, who all supported Marco Rubio. ""I wasn't a bandwagon type of person. I wanted to support who I thought was best, and I guess I picked the right horse."" She wasn't upset about the comments Trump made on the Access Hollywood tape saying he would grab a woman ""by the pussy"". ""Everybody makes mistakes and I'd be mortified if something like that was caught on camera,"" she says. For Sarah Jo, the appeal lies in his promise of change, and his background as a businessman. Her two priorities are tax reform and repealing and replacing Obamacare. She's hopeful her candidate can heal divisions in the country. ""I am prayerful that he takes into account every single American citizen, not just those who voted for him. Change can't occur overnight but I think we are going to see great things with his first 100 days in office."" Will Estrada, 33, Virginia Will Estrada is the definition of a Washington insider. He's a lawyer, a lobbyist and the chair of the Loudon County Republican Party. When we met in August, some local congressional candidates in the Virginia district were refusing to endorse the party's nominee. But Will's loyalty was never in doubt. Now, as an invited guest to the inauguration, he'll get to witness Trump being sworn in up close. ""I think Trump has a huge opportunity to restore America's respect on the world stage,"" he says. ""Trump is a phenomenon who defies expectations. He's rewritten the rule book.  It's exciting to watch."" He has two ""non-negotiables"": the repeal of President Obama's healthcare reforms, and a conservative pick for the vacant Supreme Court seat. ""We'd seen the growth of government way larger than our founders had intended,"" Will says of Obamacare, adding that he's ""fine"" with Mr Trump's undefined plan to replace it. Back in the summer Will was an ardent critic of Hillary Clinton and agreed with the calls of many Trump supporters to ""lock her up"". But he understands why the new president has backed away from his promise to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Mrs Clinton. ""It would have created more divisiveness if a president went after Hillary Clinton. I'd like to move forward - the Clintons are a relic of the past."" Marco Gutierrez, 43,California I met Marco Gutierrez at the Republican National Convention in Ohio last July, where he was holding a ""Latinos for Trump"" sign. A real estate investor in California's Discovery Bay, he became one of the faces of Donald Trump's minority outreach. Many Hispanic voters were incensed by Mr Trump's plan to build a wall, but not Marco. He believes the barrier will stop the flow of drugs and illegal immigration across the border. ""My only reservation is the way the immigration force will work as far as protecting innocent families,"" he cautions. His public support for Mr Trump has cost him some friends and clients, but his wife, a fourth-generation Mexican-American, supports him. Marco was just 17 when he came to the United States from Mexico in 1991. His parents, who'd been working in the US fields for many summers, had been granted amnesty after Ronald Reagan's change in immigration policy. ""When I came here I had 75 cents in my pocket and a pair of jeans and a white T-shirt,"" Marco says. ""That was the beginning of my new life in the United States"" Even though he benefitted from an amnesty, Marco now believes in tougher immigration laws. ""Trump's a firm believer in results and so far I see results. That he's willing to sit down and talk about the problems. I think by March we're going to be able to judge whether he's making a difference. We have to give him a chance."" Bill Hartmann, 59, Michigan I met Bill Hartmann, a self-employed building repair man, as he delivered Trump yard signs in Detroit ahead of the Michigan primary back in March. ""He was the only candidate who said he wanted to make America great again. And that's what turned me on."" When he watched Clinton supporters in tears on election night, Bill says he had a flashback to the sadness he felt when Barack Obama won in 2008. ""I could totally relate to that"". Bill won't be among the inauguration crowds in Washington DC, but will be watching on a big screen at a local hall, with other supporters. This video can not be played Detroit voters are playing Trump's tune ""I think people have lost respect for America,"" Bill says, ""especially with Barack Obama going and bowing to other leaders in the world. Donald Trump doesn't want to be part of the new world order, he wants America to be independent."" Bill believes Trump's business past, can help deliver a fresh approach to foreign policy. ""He's someone who would be a good negotiator in contracts and agreements with foreign nations, he always seems to be open to discussion regardless of who the individual is."" June Savage, 49, Florida It was hard to miss June Savage when we met at a Trump rally in Miami, Florida. Dressed in a top hat, red boots and draped in an American flag, she was holding a Women for Trump placard. The former Miss Miami finalist, a lifelong Republican who works as a real estate agent, backed Mr Trump because he's a political outsider. ""You can't ask an attorney to be POTUS anymore. You need people who have built things, who have hired and fired people and who can stand up to these billionaire heads of state."" She's met the new president and sees his direct approach as a strength. ""He has a big mouth - we all know that. He says a lot of things that maybe people like or do not like."" Her one concern is Mr Trump's addiction to social media, but she says everyone has the same tendency these days. And to June, one of the biggest assets of a Trump presidency, is his VP pick, Mike Pence, the former governor of Indiana. ""They always say behind a good man is a very good woman,"" she says. ""Not to call Mike Pence a woman, but he's definitely the woman in this marriage.  So you have a very strong man, which is Pence, behind Trump."" Martha Lehner, 75, Texas Martha Lehner I met Martha, a retired teacher and volunteer for the Trump campaign in Texas, at a watch party for a Republican primary debate in Houston in February. Originally from Argentina, Martha came to the US nearly 30 years ago, and believes his wall on the US-Mexico border is a good idea. She hopes Trump keeps the promises he talked about during the campaign, including ""draining the swamp"", reducing illegal immigration and beefing up national security. She does have some advice for her new president though: get a thicker skin. ""Right now I think he's jumping on every negative comment that people in the media make of him, and he should just ignore it."" Cathy De Grazia, 56, Massachusetts Cathy jokes she may be the only Trump supporter in her town of 11,000 in Massachusetts. We met as she campaigned for Trump in the neighbouring state of New Hampshire in the weeks before the election. Cathy says she's become more conservative with age, but remains socially liberal. She was fed up with politicians from both parties. She hopes Mr Trump can unite the country, and blames President Obama for making things worse. ""I just don't remember having racial divides as badly in my lifetime as we have in the past administration,"" she says. But it was Mr Trump's economic policies that sealed her vote. Her father was a manufacturer who owned a textile mill in upstate New York in the 1980s. ""I know what's happened with trade agreements with other countries who don't have the same human rights standards and can lower costs, and unfairly compete with American workers."" On the campaign trail she said she heard similar stories from disenfranchised voters. ""A lot of people felt all of these jobs are disappearing and the government wasn't listening to us, things are decidedly worse for a lot of people."" Security, healthcare and the military also rank as Cathy's key concerns for a Trump administration. And even though she's concerned about climate change, she doesn't think ""pie in the sky agreements"" are the way forward. Cathy believes more needs to be done in making US cars more fuel efficient. ""We need to get our house in order before we start dictating to the rest of the world.""

Fighting for men,"Deepika Bhardwaj knows she's fighting a lone battle In India, where crimes against women are rampant, a female activist and documentary filmmaker stands out for being a rare voice for abused men. The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi profiles Deepika Narayan Bhardwaj as part of a series on the Asian women likely to make the news in 2017. India regularly gets hauled over the coals for its shabby treatment of women. And rightly so. Every 15 minutes a rape is recorded, every five minutes an incident of domestic violence is reported, a bride is killed for dowry every 69 minutes and every year hundreds of thousands of female foetuses are aborted and infant girls are killed, leading to an appallingly skewed gender ratio. Girls and women also have to battle lifelong discrimination, prejudice, violence and neglect. In a climate like that, 31-year-old Deepika Narayan Bhardwaj knows she sticks out like a sore thumb, but she has some questions that are reasonable enough: ""Are men not vulnerable? Do they not face discrimination? Can they not be victims?"" And she goes on to add: ""Just as you don't have to be a woman to fight for women, similarly, you don't have to be a man to fight for men. I don't talk about atrocities against women because there are millions who are talking about it."" Protests against the tough anti-dowry law have been growing Her fight at the moment is against the misuse of Section 498A of the Indian penal code which is a tough anti-dowry law. Ms Bhardwaj is travelling across India, screening Martyrs of Marriage, her first feature-length documentary, in an attempt to persuade the authorities to re-write the law. Asian women to watch in 2017 Regina Ip: The 'Iron Lady' who wants to lead Hong Kong Leila de Lima: The woman who dares to defy Duterte Hong Kong's rebellious lawmaker Yau Wai-ching Yip Pin Xiu: Singapore's all-conquering Paralympian India introduced Section 498A in 1983 after a spate of dowry deaths in Delhi and elsewhere in the country. There were daily reports of new brides being burnt to death by their husbands and in-laws and the murders were often passed off as ""kitchen accidents"". Angry protests by female MPs and activists forced parliament to bring in the law. India court says women 'misusing' dowry law Why are India's housewives killing themselves? Just who are men's rights activists? ""It was a law made with very noble intentions,"" agrees Ms Bhardwaj. ""But a law that was made to save lives, has taken many lives."" Ms Bhardwaj is not alone in her criticism. Over the years, Section 498A has acquired the reputation of being the ""most abused law in the history of Indian jurisprudence"". With cases of divorce in India steadily rising, campaigners say that disgruntled women, aided by unscrupulous lawyers, routinely misuse the law to harass their husbands and their relatives. It has also been questioned by the Supreme Court with one judge describing its misuse as ""legal terrorism"", warning that it was ""intended to be used as a shield and not as an assassin's weapon"", and the National Commission for Women expressing concerns over its misuse. Martyrs of Marriage focuses on the abuse of the anti-dowry law As the law prescribes the immediate arrest of those named in a complaint, 2.7 million people, including 650,000 women and 7,700 children, were arrested between 1998 and 2015. The accused in some of the cases were as young as two years old and, in a particularly bizarre case, a two-month-old baby was hauled into a police station. Perturbed by such reports, in July 2014, the Supreme Court ordered the police tofollow a nine-point checklistbefore arresting anyone on a dowry complaint. Ms Bhardwaj, a former journalist, says she began researching the subject in 2012 after ""a very personal experience"". ""In 2011, a cousin's marriage fell apart within three months and his wife accused him and our entire family of beating her and demanding dowry from her. She filed a false case against us. I was also named as an accused, as someone who beat her and tortured her regularly,"" she says. Ms Bhardwaj says her family paid ""a large sum of money"" to buy peace, but ""even though the case got over, I was not at peace"". ""The law has become a tool for extreme blackmail and extortion,"" she says. Banker Avadhesh Yadav left a suicide note, questioning the ""one-sided law"" Avadhesh Yadav's parents are unable to come to terms with the loss of their son Her research took her to police stations and courts, and put her in touch with theSave Indian Family,external, an NGO fighting for the rights of wronged men. The documentary, which took four years to complete, has powerful first-person accounts from men who have been falsely accused under the anti-dowry law - from husbands who spent years in jail only to be acquitted later by courts; from the parents of young men who killed themselves unable to bear the harassment and ignominy of being labelled wife-abusers; a tearful video message from a husband recorded minutes before he hanged himself; and a suicide note from a young banker questioning the ""one-sided law"". We also hear from a retired Delhi high court judge who says the law is often ""used as a leverage to settle scores""; a former Indian law minister who admits to the failure of governments to deal with the ""abuse of this law""; one women's rights activist who believes the law must be amended; while a second insists that ""cases of misuse are few"" and the law must remain unchanged to protect women from dowry abuse. Ms Bhardwaj, however, insists that laws must be gender neutral. ""You cannot deny it saying the number of such cases is small. In the past few years, thousands of people have reached out to me for help and I've referred them to the Save Indian Family. In Delhi, I'm told that 24% of calls to women's helplines are from men in distress. Lives are being destroyed. People are killing themselves."" She now wants to organise a screening of Martyrs of Marriage for Indian MPs. ""I have shown the documentary to judges, police officials and magistrates, activists and general public, men and women impacted by the law. I have received a tremendous response from the viewers. Now I want to take it to the parliament, to lobby for a change in the law to stop its misuse."" Retired Delhi judge SN Dhingra says the anti-dowry law is often used to settle scores In recent months, Ms Bhardwaj has also been speaking out against false rape cases. After the December 2012 gang rape of a young woman on a bus in the Indian capital, Delhi, and her subsequent death, India introduced Section 376, a tough new anti-rape law. Since then, there has been a surge in the registration of rape cases, amid reports from courts that many are filed by women after a consensual relationship has gone sour or to settle other disputes. Judges across India havewarned against its misuse,externaland the Delhi Commission for Women has said that 53.2% of the rape cases filed between April 2013 and July 2014were found to be false,external. India's Supreme Court has also questioned the abuse of the anti-dowry law by some women Ms Bhardwaj, too, has often taken to social media to speak up for men accused in false cases, attracting a severe backlash - she regularly gets trolled on social media, feminists and women's rights activists accuse her of bias, she's been called a ""pimp for rapists"" and is berated for her ""love for rapists"". Even her two-year-old niece has been dragged into the sordid debate by internet trolls who claim to feel sorry for the toddler ""for having an aunt like her"". But Ms Bhardwaj remains unfazed. ""Some feminists say it's politically incorrect for me to fight for men, but I want justice for everyone, regardless of their gender. My work is not against women. My work is against injustice.""

Final coin removed from huge Celtic hoard,"This video can not be played The last of nearly 70,000 coins is to be removed later from one of the largest Celtic hoards in the world The last of nearly 70,000 coins has been removed from one of the largest Celtic hoards in the world. The cache - thought to date from about 30-50 BC - was found in Jersey by two metal detector enthusiasts after a 30-year search sparked by a tip-off. Experts from Jersey Heritage removed the coins one by one from the field in Grouville for three years, with the last set extracted on Friday. They said there was still work to do, such as cleaning and logging the finds. More on the coin story, and other news from around the Channel Islands Neil Mahrer has been leading the team removing and cataloguing the coins one by one It is thought the hoard was buried by a tribe fleeing from advancing forces of the Roman Empire ""This is a significant milestone for the team,"" said Neil Mahrer, senior conservator. ""It has been painstaking but thoroughly intriguing work, which has delivered some very unexpected and amazing finds along the way. ""There is still plenty to do, and I am sure the hoard will continue to surprise us as we clean and record the material."" The hoard is believed to have been buried by the Coriosolitae tribe of Celts as they fled from the invading forces of the Roman Empire. It was excavated by a team from the Societe Jersiais, Jersey Heritage and Guernsey Museum in 2012. A number of gold neck torques, jewellery, glass beads, a leather purse and a woven bag of silver and gold were among the items found The exact value of the hoard is yet to be calculated and where it will end up remains undecided Known as Catillon II, the Iron Age coin hoard is about six times bigger than any other Celtic hoard found in the world. It also includes a large number of gold neck torques and other pieces of jewellery, as well as glass beads, a leather purse and a woven bag of silver and gold work. Now the hoard has been separated, it will be valued and Jersey's government will vote on whether to pay to keep it on the island. When it was first discovered, its value was estimated at about Â£10m. This video can not be played Two men who found a hoard of coins worth at least Â£10m look back on their moment of discovery Reg Mead and Richard Miles spent three decades searching in fields near where it was found after being told folk tales of ancient coins being found nearby. It was unearthed in 2012 and quickly made headlines around the world because it was said it could change the way experts view Iron Age trade. Richard Miles and Reg Mead: ""There was something there that drew us to it"" Mr Miles said: ""There was something there that drew us to it. Every Sunday, we would give it a try. ""The original story said the pot had been discovered on the tree line and we saw on old maps an old boundary that had been taken out. ""I found the first coin - and by the end of the first day we found 20 coins. ""Gradually, the tally began to climb."" That led them to find the hoard even deeper in the ground. ""We were literally scooping out the earth it was so deep,"" said Mr Miles. ""Reg said 'Give it one final try' and he forced the spade into the ground as deeply as he could and it struck something solid. ""You could hear the metal [striking the] hoard.""
