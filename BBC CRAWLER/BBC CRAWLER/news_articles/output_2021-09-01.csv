Wetherspoons runs low on beer amid driver shortage,"The Wetherspoons chain has said some of its pubs have run out of some beer brands because of supply chain issues. The group said Heineken, Carling and Coors were among the brands affected. Heineken and brewer Molson Coors said that like many in the industry, they had been hit by a shortage of HGV drivers. Meanwhile, a Coca-Cola bottling giant also said Diet Coke was unavailable in some supermarkets owing to the driver shortage. The UK is facing a shortage of lorry drivers that hauliers have blamed on Covid and Brexit, and have called for immigration rules to be changed to allow EU drivers to return. But the government has consistently said that the haulage industry and retailers need to be training new UK drivers. The logistical problems have led to empty shelves at some supermarkets, while the retail industry has flagged concerns about Christmas supplies. Fast-food chains have also been hit, with Nando's running short of chicken and McDonald's having to stop serving milkshakes. McDonald's runs out of milkshakes in England, Scotland and Wales There are also shortages of Diet Coke in some supermarkets due to the lack of HGV drivers, as well as problems sourcing aluminium cans, bottling giant Coca Cola Europacific Partners said. It said its supply chain was working ""flat out"" to meet demand. Wetherspoons also said on Wednesday that some of its pubs had seen some supply shortages. The pub chain said there had been problems with Heineken and Molson Coors deliveries. ""We are experiencing some supply problems with both Carling and Coors, which means that some pubs do not have the products available,"" a Wetherspoons spokesman said. ""We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused. We know that the brewers are trying to resolve the issue."" Molson Coors, which owns Carling and Coors, said: ""Like many in our great British brewing and pub sector, we have been hit by the HGV driver shortage. ""While overall our availability is good, there are intermittent pockets of pressure in our supply network that are unfortunately affecting a number of Wetherspoons pubs. ""After such a difficult period for our industry, it's heart breaking to be letting any customer down and we will continue to do everything in our power to get our much-loved brands back on every Wetherspoons bar,"" it said. How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? Wetherspoons boss denies facing shortage of EU workers Wetherspoons said its problems had been caused by planned industrial action by Heineken drivers working for GXO Logistics. The Unite union said no industrial action had taken place. Heineken said: ""We're working tirelessly to find solutions to delivery issues caused by considerable disruption in the haulage and logistics market. ""Pubs won't run dry - if your favourite pint isn't immediately available, there will be a tasty alternative to try."" The logistics industry has said that driver shortages across the UK are due to a combination of Covid and Brexit. On Wednesday Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin, a prominent supporter of Brexit, was taken to task by some critics on Twitter. Singer Billy Bragg wrote,external: ""Here's a lament for Tim Martin, whose Wetherspoons chain is struggling with the realities of the Brexit for which he campaigned so loudly."" Twitter userPearl Noir wrote,external: ""So how's Brexit working out for you so far Tim?"" The UK is short of about 100,000 drivers, according to the Road Haulage Association, with new recruits to the industry facing problems getting driving tests due a Covid-related backlog. In addition, when the pandemic struck last year, many European drivers went home, with few returning, according to hauliers. HGV driver says 40% pay rise shows industry's desperate situation Now the UK has left the EU, it is no longer part of the single market, so it is easier for European drivers to find work in the EU. Foreign drivers also now need visas and the Home Office is not keen on allowing lorry drivers on to a list of shortage occupations. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng this week rejected calls to loosen immigration rules, saying it would be a ""short-term temporary solution"" and that firms should employ UK workers, especially those facing an ""uncertain future"" when the furlough scheme ends next month. A government spokesperson said: ""We're working closely with industry to address sector challenges, which are similarly being faced by other countries around the world. ""This includes plans to streamline the process for new drivers to gain their HGV licence and to increase the number of driving tests able to be conducted. ""We want to see employers make long-term investments in the UK domestic workforce and make employment more attractive through offering training, careers options and wage increases."" The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said that retailers were doing all they could to avoid any possible disruption to supplies before Christmas. ""Government must address the HGV driver shortage by rapidly increasing the number of HGV driving tests taking place, providing visas for EU drivers, and looking for a longer-term solution,"" said Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at the BRC.

Scots to need vaccine passports for large events,"The move means people will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before being allowed into nightclubs and many other events Vaccine passports are to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from later this month, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The plans will apply to indoor and outdoor events, and will need to be signed off by MSPs next week. Ms Sturgeon said the move was needed to help stem the recent surge in the number of cases. A further 6,107 people have tested positive, with the number of people in hospital doubling in the past 10 days. And several areas of Scotland are among the regions with the highest rates of the virus in Europe. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Is the drive to get young people jabbed working? The new vaccine certification rules mean people over the age of 18 will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to: Nightclubs and adult entertainment venues. Unseated indoor live events, with more than 500 people in the audience. Unseated outdoor live events, with more than 4,000 people in the audience. Any event, of any nature, which has more than 10,000 people in attendance. The new rules will impact on many sporting events in Scotland - particularly football matches - as well as concerts and music festivals. SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said Premiership football clubs had""a significant number of questions and real concern""about the plan. He added: ""It's not clear what IT infrastructure will be in place, what time-scales clubs will be asked to work to, or what can be done for those without smart phones. ""And it's not clear if it's going to cut across terms and conditions of seasons tickets already bought by people across the land."" Ms Sturgeon said the hospitality industry as a whole would not be included in the certification scheme - although that decision would be kept under review. And there are no plans to include key services or settings where people have no choice over attendance - such as shops, public transport, education and medical services. Anyone who has good reasons for not getting fully vaccinated - including children and people with particular medical conditions - will be exempt. People can already request a paper copy of their vaccination record to allow them to travel, and from Friday they will be provided with a QR code so they can download a copy of the record to keep on their phone. Paper copies of vaccine certificates are already available for people who have been fully vaccinated A similar scheme will be introduced in England at the end of this month, with people needing to have a ""Covid pass"" to access ""higher risk"" settings such as nightclubs. Several other European countries - including France, Italy and Ireland - have already introduced certification. Scotland's health secretary, Humza Yousaf, said in July that he was ""sceptical"" about the case for vaccine passports, citing concerns that they ""might increase the inequality gap, and there would be ethical issues"". The country's deputy first minister, John Swinney, also said he did not believe it was right to exclude people who do not want to be vaccinated after the UK government set out its plans to introduce passports in England. In a statement at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that the certification scheme was now needed to ""help protect individuals and the country as a whole and reduce the risk of further restrictions being necessary"". The first minister added: ""Many of the events and venues that are covered by the certification scheme are important - they matter to our economy, and to our cultural and social life. ""That's why we want to enable them to stay open safely - but they are not essential services. ""And the nature of them - which involves bringing many people together in relatively small areas - does mean that, despite their very best efforts, they can contribute significantly to the spread of the virus."" She also said it would be ""grossly irresponsible"" to rule out re-introducing further restrictions in the future. The Scottish Greens are not keen on vaccine passports. The new minister for zero carbon buildings, active travel and tenants' rights, Patrick Harvie, has raised concerns about their introduction before. In July he argued vaccine certification ""would deepen discrimination against those who have not yet been vaccinated"". Today the party's health spokesperson, Gillian Mackay, said it was essential the Scottish government ensures the introduction of vaccine certification doesn't adversely affect disabled people, those with underlying health conditions and those from the global south who may not be able to access proof of vaccination. But the Greens are now in government. Vaccine certification isn't specifically excluded in the co-operation agreement they signed with the SNP and so the Greens are bound by collective responsibility on this issue and will have to support it when it's put to the vote at Holyrood. The first minister said it was a ""significant move"" and would need to be signed off by MSPs, with a debate and vote to take place next week. However the SNP has a comfortable majority with the backing of the Scottish Greens - who have previously been opposed to the move - and the cooperation agreement between the two parties commits them to working together on Covid-related matters. The Liberal Democrats were the only party to hit out directly against the plans following Ms Sturgeon's statement, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton saying vaccine passports were akin to ""medical ID cards"", adding: ""This is an illiberal step"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the Scottish government had ""wasted months"" that could have been spent making preparations, and was now ""introducing vaccine passports at the last minute"". He added: ""It's a striking u-turn from what John Swinney said last month, where he emphatically claimed vaccine passports were ""the wrong way"" to go. ""We need businesses to get in-depth guidance around these certificates as soon as possible. They should be involved in the process and the government needs to clarify whether they will be expected to police these new rules."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the virus was now out of control and Scotland - and claimed the government had no strategy to deal with it. Case levels in Scotland are 80% higher now than they were last week, and five times higher than they were four weeks ago. The number of people in hospital has more than doubled since 20 August, from 312 to 629. Intensive care admissions have not risen as quickly, but have still gone up from 34 to 59 over the same timescale. Meanwhile 4,108,804 people have had a first dose of vaccine, and 3,691,066 have had two. That includes 95% of people over 40 who are now fully vaccinated, as well as 71% of 30 to 39-year-olds and 51% of 18 to 29-year-olds. The Federation of Small Businesses said the many affected firms would not welcome the certificate scheme - but would accept it as an alternative to stricter restrictions. But it said the system needed to be user-friendly for both businesses and the public, and warned against a ""rush"" to extend the scheme to other settings. The Scottish Licensed Trade Association (SLTA) said the scheme was a ""threat hanging over the whole of the hospitality industry"", while the UK Hospitality Scotland said the move would ""cause dismay amongst businesses"" that had only recently been allowed to reopen.

'A drugs gang made life like a horror movie',"This video can not be played ""It changed the way we lived, it got quite frightening"" A chainsaw slices through the front door of a terraced home. It's a quiet cul-de-sac, on a new-ish estate, in a small, rural town in mid Wales. Three doors away, for a brief moment Joy Jones tenses up. What fresh grief can the residents of this property be bringing to her street? What she sees sends her running upstairs in delight. From the bedroom window she can see a street full of police, and her phone starts pinging with messages from neighbours. ""Everyone was shouting at each other and celebrating, the relief was unbelievable."" The police were finallyarresting the drugs gangthat had blighted their lives for nearly a year. Ms Jones has lived on the estate for over 20 years, raised her children there and sat on the county council. But she could not stop the damage the gang inflicted on her neighbourhood. ""It changed the way we lived, it got quite frightening,"" she said. People would turn up at the house day and night - buying, seeking or moving drugs. Couriers - some just teenagers - would use one of a number of pedal bikes left on the front lawn to play their part in the sale and distribution of heroin and cocaine within the town. ""It was just horrible, it was like living in some kind of horror movie. It got so bad we would stay away from our home because we just couldn't bear to be here,"" she said. And then there was the whistling. ""It was something they did when they were letting each other know something was going on, it seemed to be some kind of code,"" explained Ms Jones. It was a stark contrast to the quiet, friendly neighbourhood she knew before. Â£1.1m heroin and cocaine trafficking gang jailed Final heroin and cocaine drugs gang member jailed The estate is a mix of privately owned homes and housing association properties. When Anthony Butterworth first moved in things were fine, said Ms Jones, but when someone else moved in with him, it became a lot busier. She estimates that in a 24-hour period, 50 people or more would visit the house. ""We'd see youngsters turning up, they'd knock the door, pick up a bike from the front lawn and disappear. ""We realised quite early on it was drugs being dealt there, but not the severity and the quantities."" Joy Jones said the ""relief was incredible"" when arrests were made The house was being used by a Liverpool drugs gang as their safe house, where heroin and crack cocaine would be stored before being distributed in the town. Just over an hour from Wrexham, less than two to Birmingham, with a population of about 12,000, it faced the same drugs problems as bigger towns and cities. ""It is rife within our communities,"" said Det Insp Gareth Grant. At the time of the arrests he was head of Dyfed-Powys Police's serious and organised crime team - the unit charged with investigating the drugs that were infiltrating rural Powys. ""For the size of these towns, it was a major problem."" Det Insp Gareth Grant was head of Dyfed-Powys Police's serious and organised crime team during the operation It's not a new phenomenon. Just like a legal business, drugs gangs expand their operation, and seek out the profits to be made in smaller towns and communities. But today you're more likely to hear it described as county lines. And unlike the legal retail sector, violence will be used to drive out local dealers, while children or vulnerable adults will be threatened and coerced into transporting drugs and collecting payment. So the risks are kept at arm's length from the gang and dealers make the sale remotely, using dedicated mobile phones. ""You had one individual working along the county lines model, embedded in that house with a vulnerable individual who lived there previously,"" explains Det Insp Grant. ""They would then send out messages and then the drugs would be taken from there for onward supply to individuals around the town."" Eighteen members of the gang were convicted At the trial, Butterworth's barrister said the 52-year-old's involvement in the conspiracy to supply the Class A drugs had been relatively short-lived. The gang only moved into his house when the electricity was cut off at the previous house they had been using. Prior to that he had convictions for cannabis possession. The judge in the case acknowledged Butterworth had his own vulnerabilities, but he did not feel the gang had coerced him into working for them. During the trial, the court heard over the space of 12 months, police received 46 calls about activity in and around Butterworth's house - which did not go unnoticed. On the ground, officers targeted drug movement and sales with stop checks and searches but work was also done to get the community on board and increase calls to 999, as well as protecting others at risk of having their homes taken over by dealers. Meanwhile, 80 miles away at Dyfed-Powys Police headquarters, the serious and organised crime team had been tasked with investigating the bigger issue of heroin and crack cocaine being shipped into two mid Wales towns. Det Insp Grant had a core team of eight full-time detectives. He said they were arresting people throughout the duration of an 18-month investigation but they knew expectations were low. ""Right at the start I'm not sure the communities were assured we were going to have the impact we knew we could have,"" he said. He was all too aware of the impact the drugs were having. ""It ruins the lives of the individuals taking the drugs, has a massive impact on their families, but ultimately it has a massive impact on the communities because of the associated crime trends we tend to see with this type of drug use. ""You'll see a massive rise in antisocial behaviour, associated thefts, violence, robberies etc they can all play a part in drug use."" He would not reveal the covert techniques used as part of the operation, but by the time they reached the arrest phase, 40 to 50 officers were involved. ""Over a million pounds worth of drugs were seized, we've now convicted 20 individuals of drug dealing offences, and they've been jailed for a total of 150 years. ""We were able to go quite a way up the chain in this investigation."" It is something the judge in the case acknowledged - praising the force for not being content targeting only the user or street dealer but ""the source"". The leaders of the conspiracy, Jack Ross, Karl O'Hara, Michael Williams, Ryan Langshaw and Daniel Putterill, all from Liverpool, were sentenced to a total of 47 years for the supply of Class A drugs into Newtown and Llandrindod Wells. Anthony Butterworth received five years for conspiracy to supply drugs and died in prison last year. The property that was used by the gang is still boarded up It depends who you ask. For Ms Jones and her neighbours - the difference was obvious and ""it's wonderful"". The force have said since 2019 no county line has been identified in the region. Det Insp Grant said: ""It is one of our biggest challenges that when we conclude one investigation the big thing for us is trying to prevent something getting as much of a problem again - and it is very difficult. ""What we will have then is people trying to establish themselves as the new drug dealers within those towns. It's up to us - along with a multi agency plan - to have something in place where we can try and prevent these problems escalating."" In practical terms, that means making arrests the minute new dealers emerge - so other gangs cannot fill the void created. ""But it'll certainly make a big difference for a town this size for quite a considerable amount of time,"" he said. Barry Eveleigh says more money needs to go into treating drug addiction Barry Eveleigh, from drug and alcohol charity Kaleidoscope, said the arrests had not made much difference as ""markets are replaced pretty quickly"". He said: ""If anything you find the purity goes down, prices go up and potentially people have to commit more crime in order to fund the same habit. ""You want a substitute, which is what treatment services can offer. But by and large that doesn't happen."" ""On average we might see someone twice a month - how can you change somebody that's been addicted to heroin for 10 years just by seeing them for an hour, twice a month? It's very, very difficult."" He said the violence associated with drugs was also an issue, but he said: ""I don't want to start panicking people that Newtown is a place that's rife with drugs, knives and violence. ""It's just a small undercurrent that generally doesn't spill out into the wider community. But when it does it can be quite serious.""

Uhura, 30, makes pop culture podcasts herself and is one half of The Unpacked Podcast. She thinks it's great that Cheryl is such a big fan of R&B music, but doesn't think she should have been given this platform, ahead of a black artist. ""I honestly feel that if you're going to give a platform about R&B music to a woman, and the platform is the BBC, it should be a black woman musician,"" she tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""There are so many black British female artists who have been overlooked within the UK constantly. ""These women are talented, they are knowledgeable, they are experts in their fields."" She names Mica Paris or Beverley Knight as her preferred hosts. Uhura would have liked a black female artist who has ""lived and breathed R&B music"" host the BBC Sounds podcast ""It feels like again, black voices and black talent is being pushed to the side and ignored,"" Uhura adds. ""Yet again, there is a white woman being rewarded. ""Does she really have the credentials? From my understanding she's a pop singer, not an R&B singer."" Sheryl Nwosu asks why people like Jamelia or Craig David haven't been given the same platform by the BBC Sheryl Nwosu, the chair of the Black Music Coalition, says she was surprised when she heard about the podcast. ""I think it really ignores some of the voices, which were raised in 2020, and some of the issues which were validly raised by black artists within the music industry, who have specifically spoken of the lack of access to opportunities for them,"" she tells Newsbeat. ""She's never done anything to promote the genre, but she's given this platform as a vehicle to promote herself and talk about herself using R&B as the backdrop."" BBC Sounds, which made the podcast in collaboration with BBC Radio 2, said it was one of many new music commissions, with a variety of hosts. ""We feature a wide range of voices spanning different genres across our extensive music output. ""Many of our shows are fronted by DJs who are experts in their fields, others are hosted by people with a passion for their topic,"" it said in a statement.

In 2009she told Holly Willoughby,external, in TV special Cheryl Cole's Night In, that ""everybody knows I like R&B, I love hip hop"" andin 2010 told Piers Morgan,external, on his Life Stories series, that she wanted to dress like US R&B group, TLC.

New eco-petrol baffles a quarter of motorists,"A more eco-friendly petrol is coming to British filling stations this month, but a quarter of drivers do not know whether their cars can run on it, new research says. The government intends to make E10 the new standard petrol grade. It contains less carbon than other motor fuels and more ethanol, a kind of alcohol manufactured from plants. But according to the RAC, 24% of motorists are unaware of it, while 27% do not know if their car is compatible. Current petrol grades in the UK - known as E5 - contain up to 5% ethanol, with the other 95% being regular unleaded petrol. Their replacement, E10, will see this percentage increased to 10% - a proportion that would bring the UK in line with countries such as Belgium, Finland, France and Germany. What is E10 petrol and can my car run it? Shell sets out carbon neutral plans Introducing E10 could cut carbon emissions by 750,000 tonnes a year, says the Department for Transport, the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off the road and an important step towards the government's climate change targets. The new fuel is being rolled out everywhere in the UK except Northern Ireland, where it is not due to arrive until early 2022. Every petrol vehicle built after 2011 should accept E10. But it will not be compatible with some older vehicles - as many as 600,000 of those currently on UK roads, the RAC estimates. The introduction of E10 fuel comes after the government announced new climate change commitments in a bid for the UKto cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035. Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions and the Earth is now in a period of rapid climate change, with global temperatures rising because of human activities, such as the burning of coal, oil and gas. Reducing the impact of climate change and hitting carbon emissions targets will require more electric cars, low-carbon heating, renewable electricity and, for many, cutting down on meat and dairy products, scientists say. This video can not be played What is climate change? The government has set upa website,externalwhere drivers can check whether their car will run on E10 fuel. But it warns it will not be liable for any damage to vehicles as a result of drivers using its checker - especially if their car has been fitted with replacement parts. The RAC said 26% of drivers surveyed had already checked online, with a further 15% saying they had found their car was compatible by another means. Those with incompatible vehicles will have to use E5 super unleaded instead, which the RAC says can cost 12p a litre more than standard unleaded. According to its survey, 59% of drivers who know their cars are incompatible with E10 are worried about the higher cost of filling up, while 20% fear mistakenly filling their tanks with E10. RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes said E10 petrol had already started appearing on forecourts to replace the old E5 blend and the process would continue ""at pace"" in coming weeks. He said that while it would make no difference to ""the vast majority"" of petrol car drivers, a ""sizeable minority"" would be adversely affected. ""Drivers who will continue to rely on E5 will also need to make sure the filling station they're visiting stocks the fuel in the first place, or risk running out of fuel and having to call on their breakdown provider,"" he added. ""We'd also like to remind owners of classic cars that need to be careful not to accidentally top up with E10 and then leave it sat unused in the tank for long periods, something which can lead to expensive damaged plastics, metals and seals."" In another development, oil giant Shell announced on Wednesday it was aiming to install 50,000 charging points on Britain's streets by 2025, as part of a government-backed push to increase electric vehicle numbers and reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Shell will roll out the charging points through on-street charging point company Ubitricity, which it acquired in February. The government hasestimated,externalthat the UK will need between 280,000 and 480,000 charging points by 2030, the year it plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Shell said it would support local authorities financially to install more on-street chargers in towns and cities. David Bunch, Shell's UK country chairman, said: ""It's vital to speed up the pace of EV charger installation across the UK and this aim and financing offer is designed to help achieve that. ""Whether at home, at work or on-the-go, we want to give drivers across the UK accessible EV charging options, so that more drivers can switch to electric."" Shell currently has 60,000 charging points globally, but plans to increase that number to 500,000 by 2025 and to 2.5 million by 2030. What is E10 petrol and can my car run on it?

Stabbed woman's partner killed himself,"Maddie Durdant-Hollamby was stabbed to death, Northamptonshire Police said A couple found dead in an apparent murder-suicide both died from knife wounds, police said. The bodies of Maddie Durdant-Hollamby, 22, and partner Benjamin Green, 41, were found at a house in Slate Drive, Kettering, last Friday.

LiveLiveTaliban victory parade as they plan government1 minute ago,"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

India avoided a strict lockdown even as cases reached record levels in spring The economy in Indiarebounded at a record rateeven while a devastating wave of Covid-19 cases hit the country. While nations around the world sent aid and oxygen to struggling hospitals in India, the government declined to implement the same tight pandemic restrictions as it did in 2020. It meant businesses were less affected and gross domestic product grew by 20.1% from April to June compared with a year earlier. At the peak in May, there were more than 400,000 daily infections while deaths reached 4,000 a day. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has prioritised investment in infrastructure, privatisation of state-owned businesses and tax reforms to drive growth. But consumer spending is still lower than before the pandemic and India's economy, the third largest in Asia, remains smaller than before March 2020. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The news another 207 Covid deaths have been recorded
looks more alarming than it is. The figure has been inflated by delays reporting deaths over
the Bank Holiday weekend. On average just under 100 deaths a day are being seen. And
the figure has started falling â last week it was over 100. This was exactly where government scientists expected us to
be at this stage of the summer â and to put it in context is similar to what
would be seen during a winter flu season.  The more difficult thing to predict is what will happen in September when schools are fully open across the UK and people are back in workplaces and return to more normal behaviour and mixing patterns. Scotland, where the holiday season ends earlier, has already seen a sharp rise. If this increase is sustained and then repeated across the UK it could cause significant pressures on the NHS, not to mention pose some very difficult questions about the level of virus that we can tolerate circulating. But there is also hope the level of immunity built up will keep a lid on the virus and mean any rise in infections and serious illness is limited. Rail journeys have reached a new recent high of 66% of pre-pandemic levels,provisional statistics,externalfrom the Department for Transport show. Last week, the rail industryrevealed,externaladvance purchases of tickets for leisure journeys to seaside destinations over the bank holiday weekend were surpassing pre-pandemic levels. But overall, commuting and business journeys by rail are still
well below pre-pandemic levels and rail industry revenue is just 59% of that
seen in 2019, research by WPI Economics for the Rail Delivery
Group shows. Jacqueline Starr, chief executive of the Rail Delivery
Group, says: âItâs great to see more and more daytrippers and
staycationers travelling by train to see the people and places they love as
life gets back on track, whether thatâs a seaside trip, a night out or a
shopping spree. ""These journeys are boosting businesses and high streets that
have struggled during the pandemic, helping to build a fair and clean economic
recovery from the pandemic.â Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The study on long Covid in children we've been discussing today was also able to provide some insight into how the
stress and strain of the pandemic and existing health may be playing a role. Those taking part were asked about their emotional health
and physical health. Older girls with poorer physical and mental health were the
group most likely to report ongoing symptoms. Overall four in 10 of everyone who took part - among both
those who tested positive and negative - reported feeling sad, worried or
unhappy. Researchers say it's clear the pandemic has had a
damaging effect on young people because of the closure of schools, not seeing
their friends and concern about the risk from the virus. They say those who have been struggling emotionally and mentally
could be more attuned to even minor physical illnesses and acknowledged a
positive Covid test could help trigger that. Dr Liz Whittaker, the Royal College of Paediatrics
and Child Health lead on infectious disease, says the evidence on how mental health has been
impacted shows how important it is to get âback to normalâ and have schools
open. Here's the daily coronavirus data from the government at a glance. The figures also show us the number of people in mechanical ventilation beds in hospital is over 1,000 for first time since 15 March. The UK has given90,994,627coronavirus vacinations according to government data. That's48,086,605first doses and42,908,022second doses. Just over156,000jabs were given yesterday -38,596first doses and117,437second. The figure of 207 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test is the highest daily total in six months. The last time the number of daily deaths recorded reached the 200s was on 9 March when the figure was 231. Today's high number could in part be attributed to the bank holiday as, like weekends, they often cause a lag in the reporting of data. The day after the previous UK-wide bank holiday, at the end of May, was the only day since the UK's first coronavirus fatality that no deaths have been recorded (1 June). But then the jump the next day was only to 12 deaths. A further 207 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the UK,according to the latest government data.,external This is the number of people who have died in the 28 days after testing positive for Covid-19. The total is now 132,742 by this measure. There were also 35,693 new coronavirus infections recorded. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon has apologised to customers after its beer supplies became the latest casualty of the UK's supply chain crunch. The hospitality giant confirmed it has seen supplies of Carling and Coors beer hit by the disruption, with some pubs not receiving deliveries. The firm did not provide further details regarding the supply issues but it is understood it is directly related to a shortage of HGV drivers. Bosses at the Road Haulage Association warned last week that there is a shortfall of around 100,000 drivers. It said this has been driven by thousands of European drivers leaving during the pandemic and not returning. Now the UK has left the EU, it is no longer part of the single market, so it is easier for European drivers to find work in the EU than in the UK. Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin has been a passionate supporter of Brexit and earlier this year denied reports that his pubs were impacted by Brexit-related staff shortages. BBC Radio 5 Live An immuno-suppressed man has spoken about his 13-year-old
daughterâs decision to have the Covid vaccine. Speaking to Nicky Campbell on 5 Live Breakfast, Mark says he believes
it comes down to who you trust in relation to vaccination. Mark says: ""We went through the risks of things, and on the balance of that risk, vaccination is a proven way of controlling disease. âWhatâs really clear is that it prevents serious illness,â
he adds. ""So, think about her first, me second."" Both of Markâs daughters, aged 13 and 17, have now had the jab. Listen to 5 Liveon the free BBC Sounds app. Allow Twitter content?

Scotland could make vaccine certificates mandatory for entry to nightclubs and other live events by next month, the first minister says. Nicola Sturgeon says the Scottish Parliament is proposing proof of vaccination for entry to:  Sturgeon says the new rules should be introduced later this month once all adults have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated. She says vaccine certification will not apply to key services such as public transport, education, access to health service or shops. She has called for a full debate a vote on vaccine certification next week. Coronavirus case levels in Scotland are 80% higher now than last week and five times higher than four weeks ago, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. She says in her Covid briefing test positivity has increased from 5% at start of August to 11.5% today. She says: ""If we are to avoid any imposition of restrictions, even in a limited way, we must all play a part to slow down transmission."" Sturgeon urges people to follow restrictions and says if they do she is hopeful Scotland will turn a corner. ""The next few days will be crucial in our assessment,"" she says. ""What is inescapably the case is that we must turn that corner and see the sharp increase in cases level off and then come down."" Police in Italy are guarding several train stations amid threats from people protesting against a new Covid pass being used in the country. The ""green pass"" is compulsory for domestic flights, ferries and long-distance or fast trains, as well as schools and universities. The increased security at stations in Rome, Florence and Rimini comes after protesters said they would disrupt high-speed trains. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio has condemned a climate of hatred over the launch of the pass - he's among several public figures to have been targeted by anti-vaccination protesters in recent days. Journalists and medical experts have also complained of being stalked, while Mr Di Maio faced death threats online. Read more here.  Plans to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs from the end of September have been met with disappointment from the nightlife industry. They fear it could lead to a rise in the number of house parties - and could lead to clubs being involved in discrimination cases. Downing Street says the government intends to continue with its plans, which have also been criticised by MPs from both Labour and its own Conservative MPs. Under the scheme, people would have to prove they're fully vaccinated before they can enter clubs and other large-scale events. Sacha Lord, night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester and co-founder of Manchester's Parklife festival, said: ""It's disappointing that despite the calls from all sides, including the industry and customers themselves, the government is continuing to move ahead with this. ""The measures will cause enormous disruption to an already struggling industry."" We're due to hear from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in about a quarter of an hour as she updates Holyrood on the pandemic in Scotland. Scotland currently has the highest rate of infection in the UK, with over 644 cases per 100,000 people. Sturgeon has suggested the return of pupils to school, earlier than in the rest of the UK, may be fuelling the rise. But we're not expecting to hear any changes to rules or restrictions from the first minister today. You'll be able to followwhat Sturgeon says in detail here, while we'll bring you the headlines from her statement. Officials will be able to make decisions about school safety on hard data, Prof Sir Terence Stephenson says Prof Sir Terence Stephenson, the lead author of the University College London study on long Covid in children, has been talking to BBC Radio 4's the World At One about its implications. He says that when they began the research in December 2020, some people were speculating that as many as half of all children who caught coronavirus would develop long Covid. The study offers reassurance that it is nowhere near that prevalent, he says, suggesting that more like one-in-seven or one-in-14 cases become long Covid. Prof Stephenson says the data should help policy-makers make decisions on issues such as school safety or the vaccination of children. ""This provides some data that allows them to make judgements and policy decisions on hard evidence, rather than speculation,"" he says. ""Itâs good that we can say itâs not overwhelming. But itâs also important to say we canât trivialise this."" There was ""no difference"" in mental health between those who contracted Covid, those who didn't, and young people surveyed over the last ten years, Prof Stephenson says. It seems young people's mental health is ""bearing up well"" in the pandemic, he says. The most common lasting symptoms were headaches, fatigue, dizziness and the loss of a sense of smell or taste. But Prof Stephenson says all of these are treatable. He says they will continue to monitor young people's health at six months, 12 months and 24 months after their positive test. More than 8,000 deaths linked to Covid-19 have now been recorded in Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics. There were 18 deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest weekly figures, one fewer than the week before. But it takes the overall total since the pandemic began to 8,002 in Wales. There has been a big decline in deaths in the third wave so far, with 102 deaths since the start of June. During the second wave in December and January, there were an average of 49 deaths a day.

Holidaymakers have been asked to use the service only if they are travelling soon,because of technical problems. Here's our guide to proving you've been vaccinated. India avoided a strict lockdown even as cases reached record levels in spring The economy in Indiarebounded at a record rateeven while a devastating wave of Covid-19 cases hit the country. While nations around the world sent aid and oxygen to struggling hospitals in India, the government declined to implement the same tight pandemic restrictions as it did in 2020. It meant businesses were less affected and gross domestic product grew by 20.1% from April to June compared with a year earlier. At the peak in May, there were more than 400,000 daily infections while deaths reached 4,000 a day. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has prioritised investment in infrastructure, privatisation of state-owned businesses and tax reforms to drive growth. But consumer spending is still lower than before the pandemic and India's economy, the third largest in Asia, remains smaller than before March 2020. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The news another 207 Covid deaths have been recorded
looks more alarming than it is. The figure has been inflated by delays reporting deaths over
the Bank Holiday weekend. On average just under 100 deaths a day are being seen. And
the figure has started falling â last week it was over 100. This was exactly where government scientists expected us to
be at this stage of the summer â and to put it in context is similar to what
would be seen during a winter flu season.  The more difficult thing to predict is what will happen in September when schools are fully open across the UK and people are back in workplaces and return to more normal behaviour and mixing patterns. Scotland, where the holiday season ends earlier, has already seen a sharp rise. If this increase is sustained and then repeated across the UK it could cause significant pressures on the NHS, not to mention pose some very difficult questions about the level of virus that we can tolerate circulating. But there is also hope the level of immunity built up will keep a lid on the virus and mean any rise in infections and serious illness is limited. Rail journeys have reached a new recent high of 66% of pre-pandemic levels,provisional statistics,externalfrom the Department for Transport show. Last week, the rail industryrevealed,externaladvance purchases of tickets for leisure journeys to seaside destinations over the bank holiday weekend were surpassing pre-pandemic levels. But overall, commuting and business journeys by rail are still
well below pre-pandemic levels and rail industry revenue is just 59% of that
seen in 2019, research by WPI Economics for the Rail Delivery
Group shows. Jacqueline Starr, chief executive of the Rail Delivery
Group, says: âItâs great to see more and more daytrippers and
staycationers travelling by train to see the people and places they love as
life gets back on track, whether thatâs a seaside trip, a night out or a
shopping spree. ""These journeys are boosting businesses and high streets that
have struggled during the pandemic, helping to build a fair and clean economic
recovery from the pandemic.â Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The study on long Covid in children we've been discussing today was also able to provide some insight into how the
stress and strain of the pandemic and existing health may be playing a role. Those taking part were asked about their emotional health
and physical health. Older girls with poorer physical and mental health were the
group most likely to report ongoing symptoms. Overall four in 10 of everyone who took part - among both
those who tested positive and negative - reported feeling sad, worried or
unhappy. Researchers say it's clear the pandemic has had a
damaging effect on young people because of the closure of schools, not seeing
their friends and concern about the risk from the virus. They say those who have been struggling emotionally and mentally
could be more attuned to even minor physical illnesses and acknowledged a
positive Covid test could help trigger that. Dr Liz Whittaker, the Royal College of Paediatrics
and Child Health lead on infectious disease, says the evidence on how mental health has been
impacted shows how important it is to get âback to normalâ and have schools
open. Here's the daily coronavirus data from the government at a glance. The figures also show us the number of people in mechanical ventilation beds in hospital is over 1,000 for first time since 15 March. The UK has given90,994,627coronavirus vacinations according to government data. That's48,086,605first doses and42,908,022second doses. Just over156,000jabs were given yesterday -38,596first doses and117,437second. The figure of 207 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test is the highest daily total in six months. The last time the number of daily deaths recorded reached the 200s was on 9 March when the figure was 231. Today's high number could in part be attributed to the bank holiday as, like weekends, they often cause a lag in the reporting of data. The day after the previous UK-wide bank holiday, at the end of May, was the only day since the UK's first coronavirus fatality that no deaths have been recorded (1 June). But then the jump the next day was only to 12 deaths. A further 207 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the UK,according to the latest government data.,external This is the number of people who have died in the 28 days after testing positive for Covid-19. The total is now 132,742 by this measure. There were also 35,693 new coronavirus infections recorded. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon has apologised to customers after its beer supplies became the latest casualty of the UK's supply chain crunch. The hospitality giant confirmed it has seen supplies of Carling and Coors beer hit by the disruption, with some pubs not receiving deliveries. The firm did not provide further details regarding the supply issues but it is understood it is directly related to a shortage of HGV drivers. Bosses at the Road Haulage Association warned last week that there is a shortfall of around 100,000 drivers. It said this has been driven by thousands of European drivers leaving during the pandemic and not returning. Now the UK has left the EU, it is no longer part of the single market, so it is easier for European drivers to find work in the EU than in the UK. Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin has been a passionate supporter of Brexit and earlier this year denied reports that his pubs were impacted by Brexit-related staff shortages.

Scots to need vaccine passports for large eventsNicola Sturgeon tells MSPs that vaccine passports will be introduced in Scotland later this month.ScotlandComments,"The move means people will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before being allowed into nightclubs and many other events Vaccine passports are to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from later this month, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The plans will apply to indoor and outdoor events, and will need to be signed off by MSPs next week. Ms Sturgeon said the move was needed to help stem the recent surge in the number of cases. A further 6,107 people have tested positive, with the number of people in hospital doubling in the past 10 days. And several areas of Scotland are among the regions with the highest rates of the virus in Europe. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Is the drive to get young people jabbed working? The new vaccine certification rules mean people over the age of 18 will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to: Nightclubs and adult entertainment venues. Unseated indoor live events, with more than 500 people in the audience. Unseated outdoor live events, with more than 4,000 people in the audience. Any event, of any nature, which has more than 10,000 people in attendance. The new rules will impact on many sporting events in Scotland - particularly football matches - as well as concerts and music festivals. SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said Premiership football clubs had""a significant number of questions and real concern""about the plan. He added: ""It's not clear what IT infrastructure will be in place, what time-scales clubs will be asked to work to, or what can be done for those without smart phones. ""And it's not clear if it's going to cut across terms and conditions of seasons tickets already bought by people across the land."" Ms Sturgeon said the hospitality industry as a whole would not be included in the certification scheme - although that decision would be kept under review. And there are no plans to include key services or settings where people have no choice over attendance - such as shops, public transport, education and medical services. Anyone who has good reasons for not getting fully vaccinated - including children and people with particular medical conditions - will be exempt. People can already request a paper copy of their vaccination record to allow them to travel, and from Friday they will be provided with a QR code so they can download a copy of the record to keep on their phone. Paper copies of vaccine certificates are already available for people who have been fully vaccinated A similar scheme will be introduced in England at the end of this month, with people needing to have a ""Covid pass"" to access ""higher risk"" settings such as nightclubs. Several other European countries - including France, Italy and Ireland - have already introduced certification. Scotland's health secretary, Humza Yousaf, said in July that he was ""sceptical"" about the case for vaccine passports, citing concerns that they ""might increase the inequality gap, and there would be ethical issues"". The country's deputy first minister, John Swinney, also said he did not believe it was right to exclude people who do not want to be vaccinated after the UK government set out its plans to introduce passports in England. In a statement at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that the certification scheme was now needed to ""help protect individuals and the country as a whole and reduce the risk of further restrictions being necessary"". The first minister added: ""Many of the events and venues that are covered by the certification scheme are important - they matter to our economy, and to our cultural and social life. ""That's why we want to enable them to stay open safely - but they are not essential services. ""And the nature of them - which involves bringing many people together in relatively small areas - does mean that, despite their very best efforts, they can contribute significantly to the spread of the virus."" She also said it would be ""grossly irresponsible"" to rule out re-introducing further restrictions in the future. The Scottish Greens are not keen on vaccine passports. The new minister for zero carbon buildings, active travel and tenants' rights, Patrick Harvie, has raised concerns about their introduction before. In July he argued vaccine certification ""would deepen discrimination against those who have not yet been vaccinated"". Today the party's health spokesperson, Gillian Mackay, said it was essential the Scottish government ensures the introduction of vaccine certification doesn't adversely affect disabled people, those with underlying health conditions and those from the global south who may not be able to access proof of vaccination. But the Greens are now in government. Vaccine certification isn't specifically excluded in the co-operation agreement they signed with the SNP and so the Greens are bound by collective responsibility on this issue and will have to support it when it's put to the vote at Holyrood. The first minister said it was a ""significant move"" and would need to be signed off by MSPs, with a debate and vote to take place next week. However the SNP has a comfortable majority with the backing of the Scottish Greens - who have previously been opposed to the move - and the cooperation agreement between the two parties commits them to working together on Covid-related matters. The Liberal Democrats were the only party to hit out directly against the plans following Ms Sturgeon's statement, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton saying vaccine passports were akin to ""medical ID cards"", adding: ""This is an illiberal step"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the Scottish government had ""wasted months"" that could have been spent making preparations, and was now ""introducing vaccine passports at the last minute"". He added: ""It's a striking u-turn from what John Swinney said last month, where he emphatically claimed vaccine passports were ""the wrong way"" to go. ""We need businesses to get in-depth guidance around these certificates as soon as possible. They should be involved in the process and the government needs to clarify whether they will be expected to police these new rules."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the virus was now out of control and Scotland - and claimed the government had no strategy to deal with it. Case levels in Scotland are 80% higher now than they were last week, and five times higher than they were four weeks ago. The number of people in hospital has more than doubled since 20 August, from 312 to 629. Intensive care admissions have not risen as quickly, but have still gone up from 34 to 59 over the same timescale. Meanwhile 4,108,804 people have had a first dose of vaccine, and 3,691,066 have had two. That includes 95% of people over 40 who are now fully vaccinated, as well as 71% of 30 to 39-year-olds and 51% of 18 to 29-year-olds. The Federation of Small Businesses said the many affected firms would not welcome the certificate scheme - but would accept it as an alternative to stricter restrictions. But it said the system needed to be user-friendly for both businesses and the public, and warned against a ""rush"" to extend the scheme to other settings. The Scottish Licensed Trade Association (SLTA) said the scheme was a ""threat hanging over the whole of the hospitality industry"", while the UK Hospitality Scotland said the move would ""cause dismay amongst businesses"" that had only recently been allowed to reopen.

Wetherspoon runs low on beer amid driver shortageThe pub chain and a Coca-Cola bottler are among firms affected by a shortage of UK lorry drivers.BusinessComments,"The Wetherspoons chain has said some of its pubs have run out of some beer brands because of supply chain issues. The group said Heineken, Carling and Coors were among the brands affected. Heineken and brewer Molson Coors said that like many in the industry, they had been hit by a shortage of HGV drivers. Meanwhile, a Coca-Cola bottling giant also said Diet Coke was unavailable in some supermarkets owing to the driver shortage. The UK is facing a shortage of lorry drivers that hauliers have blamed on Covid and Brexit, and have called for immigration rules to be changed to allow EU drivers to return. But the government has consistently said that the haulage industry and retailers need to be training new UK drivers. The logistical problems have led to empty shelves at some supermarkets, while the retail industry has flagged concerns about Christmas supplies. Fast-food chains have also been hit, with Nando's running short of chicken and McDonald's having to stop serving milkshakes. McDonald's runs out of milkshakes in England, Scotland and Wales There are also shortages of Diet Coke in some supermarkets due to the lack of HGV drivers, as well as problems sourcing aluminium cans, bottling giant Coca Cola Europacific Partners said. It said its supply chain was working ""flat out"" to meet demand. Wetherspoons also said on Wednesday that some of its pubs had seen some supply shortages. The pub chain said there had been problems with Heineken and Molson Coors deliveries. ""We are experiencing some supply problems with both Carling and Coors, which means that some pubs do not have the products available,"" a Wetherspoons spokesman said. ""We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused. We know that the brewers are trying to resolve the issue."" Molson Coors, which owns Carling and Coors, said: ""Like many in our great British brewing and pub sector, we have been hit by the HGV driver shortage. ""While overall our availability is good, there are intermittent pockets of pressure in our supply network that are unfortunately affecting a number of Wetherspoons pubs. ""After such a difficult period for our industry, it's heart breaking to be letting any customer down and we will continue to do everything in our power to get our much-loved brands back on every Wetherspoons bar,"" it said. How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? Wetherspoons boss denies facing shortage of EU workers Wetherspoons said its problems had been caused by planned industrial action by Heineken drivers working for GXO Logistics. The Unite union said no industrial action had taken place. Heineken said: ""We're working tirelessly to find solutions to delivery issues caused by considerable disruption in the haulage and logistics market. ""Pubs won't run dry - if your favourite pint isn't immediately available, there will be a tasty alternative to try."" The logistics industry has said that driver shortages across the UK are due to a combination of Covid and Brexit. On Wednesday Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin, a prominent supporter of Brexit, was taken to task by some critics on Twitter.

Wetherspoon runs low on beer amid driver shortage,"The Wetherspoons chain has said some of its pubs have run out of some beer brands because of supply chain issues. The group said Heineken, Carling and Coors were among the brands affected. Heineken and brewer Molson Coors said that like many in the industry, they had been hit by a shortage of HGV drivers. Meanwhile, a Coca-Cola bottling giant also said Diet Coke was unavailable in some supermarkets owing to the driver shortage. The UK is facing a shortage of lorry drivers that hauliers have blamed on Covid and Brexit, and have called for immigration rules to be changed to allow EU drivers to return. But the government has consistently said that the haulage industry and retailers need to be training new UK drivers. The logistical problems have led to empty shelves at some supermarkets, while the retail industry has flagged concerns about Christmas supplies. Fast-food chains have also been hit, with Nando's running short of chicken and McDonald's having to stop serving milkshakes. McDonald's runs out of milkshakes in England, Scotland and Wales There are also shortages of Diet Coke in some supermarkets due to the lack of HGV drivers, as well as problems sourcing aluminium cans, bottling giant Coca Cola Europacific Partners said. It said its supply chain was working ""flat out"" to meet demand. Wetherspoons also said on Wednesday that some of its pubs had seen some supply shortages. The pub chain said there had been problems with Heineken and Molson Coors deliveries. ""We are experiencing some supply problems with both Carling and Coors, which means that some pubs do not have the products available,"" a Wetherspoons spokesman said. ""We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused. We know that the brewers are trying to resolve the issue."" Molson Coors, which owns Carling and Coors, said: ""Like many in our great British brewing and pub sector, we have been hit by the HGV driver shortage. ""While overall our availability is good, there are intermittent pockets of pressure in our supply network that are unfortunately affecting a number of Wetherspoons pubs. ""After such a difficult period for our industry, it's heart breaking to be letting any customer down and we will continue to do everything in our power to get our much-loved brands back on every Wetherspoons bar,"" it said. How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? Wetherspoons boss denies facing shortage of EU workers Wetherspoons said its problems had been caused by planned industrial action by Heineken drivers working for GXO Logistics. The Unite union said no industrial action had taken place. Heineken said: ""We're working tirelessly to find solutions to delivery issues caused by considerable disruption in the haulage and logistics market. ""Pubs won't run dry - if your favourite pint isn't immediately available, there will be a tasty alternative to try."" The logistics industry has said that driver shortages across the UK are due to a combination of Covid and Brexit. On Wednesday Wetherspoons boss Tim Martin, a prominent supporter of Brexit, was taken to task by some critics on Twitter.

JoJo Maman Bebe blames shortages for raising pricesThe baby goods retailer tells the BBC that it has raised prices for the first time in five years.BusinessComments,"JoJo Maman Bebe is raising prices for the first time in about five years due to widespread supply chain issues. The baby clothing and goods retailer said it had seen shipping costs quadruple in recent months. Its commercial director, Gwynn Milligan, said: ""We've had no choice but to pass on some of these costs to our customers."" Price hikes will not be uniform across the board, but will depend on each item and what it is made up of. Ms Milligan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the firm had seen increases in the cost of raw materials such as wood, paper and plastics, for example, which may affect items such as its toys or changing mats. She added that the company was also having to absorb increased costs on some products, because of  competition from retail rivals. Shopping bills set to rise this autumn, says BRC How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Price rises cool amid clothes and shoe discounting ""We've looked at prices across our competitors and also what customers realistically want to pay. ""There's no set increase in any area, but it depends on what we've looked at and what's going on in that sector."" While the retailer does not believe that price increases will be sustained, it did point to problems with deliveries too - largely down to a shortage of lorry drivers at ports and difficulties in obtaining shipping containers. Ms Milligan said: ""We're advising customers not to panic because we've increased our orders to deal with the ever-growing demand of JoJo."" The baby goods retailer said it was expecting a 'bigger' Christmas than last year Customers have already starting planning their Christmas buys, according to the retailer. The term ""Christmas"" was the third-highest search on its website last week, and it believes that spending will be higher due to lockdown restrictions hampering festive plans for many people in the UK last December. It comes as the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned that price increases could last into the winter months. According to new figures released by the trade body and market research firm Nielsen, retail prices in August saw a slight increase on the previous month. Some non-food categories, such as electricals, reported sharp rises in inflation compared with last year due to ""global issues from delayed shipping and shortages of microchips"". While overall retail prices fell 0.8% year-on-year, Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: ""There are some modest indications that rising costs are starting to filter through into product prices."" Retailers such as Tesco and Aldi have increased wages for lorry drivers amid shortages. She warned: ""Low prices are already under threat, and now the HGV driver shortage has created an additional problem with a shortfall of 90,000 drivers."" The BRC issued a warning on lorry driver shortageswith Logistics UK in August saying that while Brexit and Covid-19 caused many to leave the UK, a temporary visa for drivers from the European Union could lure them back. On Wednesday, Ms Dickinson said in the run-up to the key Christmas trading period customers may see reduced choice or higher prices for their presents of choice and she called on the government to increase the number of HGV driving tests taking place. ""Without government action, it will be the British consumers who will pay the price."" The government has slightly relaxed the Drivers' Hours rules, which means drivers will be able to increase their daily driving limit from nine hours to 11 hours twice a week. Companies such asTescoandAldi,externalhave also increased wages for HGV drivers, or have started to offer sign-on bonuses.

Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

India avoided a strict lockdown even as cases reached record levels in spring The economy in Indiarebounded at a record rateeven while a devastating wave of Covid-19 cases hit the country. While nations around the world sent aid and oxygen to struggling hospitals in India, the government declined to implement the same tight pandemic restrictions as it did in 2020. It meant businesses were less affected and gross domestic product grew by 20.1% from April to June compared with a year earlier. At the peak in May, there were more than 400,000 daily infections while deaths reached 4,000 a day. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has prioritised investment in infrastructure, privatisation of state-owned businesses and tax reforms to drive growth. But consumer spending is still lower than before the pandemic and India's economy, the third largest in Asia, remains smaller than before March 2020. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The news another 207 Covid deaths have been recorded
looks more alarming than it is. The figure has been inflated by delays reporting deaths over
the Bank Holiday weekend. On average just under 100 deaths a day are being seen. And
the figure has started falling â last week it was over 100. This was exactly where government scientists expected us to
be at this stage of the summer â and to put it in context is similar to what
would be seen during a winter flu season.  The more difficult thing to predict is what will happen in September when schools are fully open across the UK and people are back in workplaces and return to more normal behaviour and mixing patterns. Scotland, where the holiday season ends earlier, has already seen a sharp rise. If this increase is sustained and then repeated across the UK it could cause significant pressures on the NHS, not to mention pose some very difficult questions about the level of virus that we can tolerate circulating. But there is also hope the level of immunity built up will keep a lid on the virus and mean any rise in infections and serious illness is limited. Rail journeys have reached a new recent high of 66% of pre-pandemic levels,provisional statistics,externalfrom the Department for Transport show. Last week, the rail industryrevealed,externaladvance purchases of tickets for leisure journeys to seaside destinations over the bank holiday weekend were surpassing pre-pandemic levels. But overall, commuting and business journeys by rail are still
well below pre-pandemic levels and rail industry revenue is just 59% of that
seen in 2019, research by WPI Economics for the Rail Delivery
Group shows. Jacqueline Starr, chief executive of the Rail Delivery
Group, says: âItâs great to see more and more daytrippers and
staycationers travelling by train to see the people and places they love as
life gets back on track, whether thatâs a seaside trip, a night out or a
shopping spree. ""These journeys are boosting businesses and high streets that
have struggled during the pandemic, helping to build a fair and clean economic
recovery from the pandemic.â Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The study on long Covid in children we've been discussing today was also able to provide some insight into how the
stress and strain of the pandemic and existing health may be playing a role. Those taking part were asked about their emotional health
and physical health. Older girls with poorer physical and mental health were the
group most likely to report ongoing symptoms. Overall four in 10 of everyone who took part - among both
those who tested positive and negative - reported feeling sad, worried or
unhappy. Researchers say it's clear the pandemic has had a
damaging effect on young people because of the closure of schools, not seeing
their friends and concern about the risk from the virus. They say those who have been struggling emotionally and mentally
could be more attuned to even minor physical illnesses and acknowledged a
positive Covid test could help trigger that. Dr Liz Whittaker, the Royal College of Paediatrics
and Child Health lead on infectious disease, says the evidence on how mental health has been
impacted shows how important it is to get âback to normalâ and have schools
open. Here's the daily coronavirus data from the government at a glance. The figures also show us the number of people in mechanical ventilation beds in hospital is over 1,000 for first time since 15 March. The UK has given90,994,627coronavirus vacinations according to government data. That's48,086,605first doses and42,908,022second doses. Just over156,000jabs were given yesterday -38,596first doses and117,437second. The figure of 207 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test is the highest daily total in six months. The last time the number of daily deaths recorded reached the 200s was on 9 March when the figure was 231. Today's high number could in part be attributed to the bank holiday as, like weekends, they often cause a lag in the reporting of data. The day after the previous UK-wide bank holiday, at the end of May, was the only day since the UK's first coronavirus fatality that no deaths have been recorded (1 June). But then the jump the next day was only to 12 deaths. A further 207 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the UK,according to the latest government data.,external This is the number of people who have died in the 28 days after testing positive for Covid-19. The total is now 132,742 by this measure. There were also 35,693 new coronavirus infections recorded. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon has apologised to customers after its beer supplies became the latest casualty of the UK's supply chain crunch. The hospitality giant confirmed it has seen supplies of Carling and Coors beer hit by the disruption, with some pubs not receiving deliveries. The firm did not provide further details regarding the supply issues but it is understood it is directly related to a shortage of HGV drivers. Bosses at the Road Haulage Association warned last week that there is a shortfall of around 100,000 drivers. It said this has been driven by thousands of European drivers leaving during the pandemic and not returning. Now the UK has left the EU, it is no longer part of the single market, so it is easier for European drivers to find work in the EU than in the UK. Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin has been a passionate supporter of Brexit and earlier this year denied reports that his pubs were impacted by Brexit-related staff shortages. BBC Radio 5 Live An immuno-suppressed man has spoken about his 13-year-old
daughterâs decision to have the Covid vaccine. Speaking to Nicky Campbell on 5 Live Breakfast, Mark says he believes
it comes down to who you trust in relation to vaccination. Mark says: ""We went through the risks of things, and on the balance of that risk, vaccination is a proven way of controlling disease. âWhatâs really clear is that it prevents serious illness,â
he adds. ""So, think about her first, me second."" Both of Markâs daughters, aged 13 and 17, have now had the jab. Listen to 5 Liveon the free BBC Sounds app. Allow Twitter content?

Scotland could make vaccine certificates mandatory for entry to nightclubs and other live events by next month, the first minister says. Nicola Sturgeon says the Scottish Parliament is proposing proof of vaccination for entry to:  Sturgeon says the new rules should be introduced later this month once all adults have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated. She says vaccine certification will not apply to key services such as public transport, education, access to health service or shops. She has called for a full debate a vote on vaccine certification next week. Coronavirus case levels in Scotland are 80% higher now than last week and five times higher than four weeks ago, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. She says in her Covid briefing test positivity has increased from 5% at start of August to 11.5% today. She says: ""If we are to avoid any imposition of restrictions, even in a limited way, we must all play a part to slow down transmission."" Sturgeon urges people to follow restrictions and says if they do she is hopeful Scotland will turn a corner. ""The next few days will be crucial in our assessment,"" she says. ""What is inescapably the case is that we must turn that corner and see the sharp increase in cases level off and then come down."" Police in Italy are guarding several train stations amid threats from people protesting against a new Covid pass being used in the country. The ""green pass"" is compulsory for domestic flights, ferries and long-distance or fast trains, as well as schools and universities. The increased security at stations in Rome, Florence and Rimini comes after protesters said they would disrupt high-speed trains. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio has condemned a climate of hatred over the launch of the pass - he's among several public figures to have been targeted by anti-vaccination protesters in recent days. Journalists and medical experts have also complained of being stalked, while Mr Di Maio faced death threats online. Read more here.  Plans to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs from the end of September have been met with disappointment from the nightlife industry. They fear it could lead to a rise in the number of house parties - and could lead to clubs being involved in discrimination cases. Downing Street says the government intends to continue with its plans, which have also been criticised by MPs from both Labour and its own Conservative MPs. Under the scheme, people would have to prove they're fully vaccinated before they can enter clubs and other large-scale events. Sacha Lord, night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester and co-founder of Manchester's Parklife festival, said: ""It's disappointing that despite the calls from all sides, including the industry and customers themselves, the government is continuing to move ahead with this. ""The measures will cause enormous disruption to an already struggling industry."" We're due to hear from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in about a quarter of an hour as she updates Holyrood on the pandemic in Scotland. Scotland currently has the highest rate of infection in the UK, with over 644 cases per 100,000 people. Sturgeon has suggested the return of pupils to school, earlier than in the rest of the UK, may be fuelling the rise. But we're not expecting to hear any changes to rules or restrictions from the first minister today. You'll be able to followwhat Sturgeon says in detail here, while we'll bring you the headlines from her statement. Officials will be able to make decisions about school safety on hard data, Prof Sir Terence Stephenson says Prof Sir Terence Stephenson, the lead author of the University College London study on long Covid in children, has been talking to BBC Radio 4's the World At One about its implications. He says that when they began the research in December 2020, some people were speculating that as many as half of all children who caught coronavirus would develop long Covid. The study offers reassurance that it is nowhere near that prevalent, he says, suggesting that more like one-in-seven or one-in-14 cases become long Covid. Prof Stephenson says the data should help policy-makers make decisions on issues such as school safety or the vaccination of children. ""This provides some data that allows them to make judgements and policy decisions on hard evidence, rather than speculation,"" he says. ""Itâs good that we can say itâs not overwhelming. But itâs also important to say we canât trivialise this."" There was ""no difference"" in mental health between those who contracted Covid, those who didn't, and young people surveyed over the last ten years, Prof Stephenson says. It seems young people's mental health is ""bearing up well"" in the pandemic, he says. The most common lasting symptoms were headaches, fatigue, dizziness and the loss of a sense of smell or taste. But Prof Stephenson says all of these are treatable. He says they will continue to monitor young people's health at six months, 12 months and 24 months after their positive test. More than 8,000 deaths linked to Covid-19 have now been recorded in Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics. There were 18 deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest weekly figures, one fewer than the week before. But it takes the overall total since the pandemic began to 8,002 in Wales. There has been a big decline in deaths in the third wave so far, with 102 deaths since the start of June. During the second wave in December and January, there were an average of 49 deaths a day.

Taliban victory parade as they plan government,"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

But consumer spending is still lower than before the pandemic and India's economy, the third largest in Asia, remains smaller than before March 2020. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The news another 207 Covid deaths have been recorded
looks more alarming than it is. The figure has been inflated by delays reporting deaths over
the Bank Holiday weekend. On average just under 100 deaths a day are being seen. And
the figure has started falling â last week it was over 100. This was exactly where government scientists expected us to
be at this stage of the summer â and to put it in context is similar to what
would be seen during a winter flu season.  The more difficult thing to predict is what will happen in September when schools are fully open across the UK and people are back in workplaces and return to more normal behaviour and mixing patterns. Scotland, where the holiday season ends earlier, has already seen a sharp rise. If this increase is sustained and then repeated across the UK it could cause significant pressures on the NHS, not to mention pose some very difficult questions about the level of virus that we can tolerate circulating. But there is also hope the level of immunity built up will keep a lid on the virus and mean any rise in infections and serious illness is limited. Rail journeys have reached a new recent high of 66% of pre-pandemic levels,provisional statistics,externalfrom the Department for Transport show. Last week, the rail industryrevealed,externaladvance purchases of tickets for leisure journeys to seaside destinations over the bank holiday weekend were surpassing pre-pandemic levels. But overall, commuting and business journeys by rail are still
well below pre-pandemic levels and rail industry revenue is just 59% of that
seen in 2019, research by WPI Economics for the Rail Delivery
Group shows. Jacqueline Starr, chief executive of the Rail Delivery
Group, says: âItâs great to see more and more daytrippers and
staycationers travelling by train to see the people and places they love as
life gets back on track, whether thatâs a seaside trip, a night out or a
shopping spree. ""These journeys are boosting businesses and high streets that
have struggled during the pandemic, helping to build a fair and clean economic
recovery from the pandemic.â Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The study on long Covid in children we've been discussing today was also able to provide some insight into how the
stress and strain of the pandemic and existing health may be playing a role. Those taking part were asked about their emotional health
and physical health. Older girls with poorer physical and mental health were the
group most likely to report ongoing symptoms. Overall four in 10 of everyone who took part - among both
those who tested positive and negative - reported feeling sad, worried or
unhappy. Researchers say it's clear the pandemic has had a
damaging effect on young people because of the closure of schools, not seeing
their friends and concern about the risk from the virus. They say those who have been struggling emotionally and mentally
could be more attuned to even minor physical illnesses and acknowledged a
positive Covid test could help trigger that. Dr Liz Whittaker, the Royal College of Paediatrics
and Child Health lead on infectious disease, says the evidence on how mental health has been
impacted shows how important it is to get âback to normalâ and have schools
open. Here's the daily coronavirus data from the government at a glance. The figures also show us the number of people in mechanical ventilation beds in hospital is over 1,000 for first time since 15 March. The UK has given90,994,627coronavirus vacinations according to government data. That's48,086,605first doses and42,908,022second doses. Just over156,000jabs were given yesterday -38,596first doses and117,437second. The figure of 207 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test is the highest daily total in six months. The last time the number of daily deaths recorded reached the 200s was on 9 March when the figure was 231. Today's high number could in part be attributed to the bank holiday as, like weekends, they often cause a lag in the reporting of data. The day after the previous UK-wide bank holiday, at the end of May, was the only day since the UK's first coronavirus fatality that no deaths have been recorded (1 June). But then the jump the next day was only to 12 deaths. A further 207 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the UK,according to the latest government data.,external This is the number of people who have died in the 28 days after testing positive for Covid-19. The total is now 132,742 by this measure. There were also 35,693 new coronavirus infections recorded. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon has apologised to customers after its beer supplies became the latest casualty of the UK's supply chain crunch. The hospitality giant confirmed it has seen supplies of Carling and Coors beer hit by the disruption, with some pubs not receiving deliveries. The firm did not provide further details regarding the supply issues but it is understood it is directly related to a shortage of HGV drivers. Bosses at the Road Haulage Association warned last week that there is a shortfall of around 100,000 drivers. It said this has been driven by thousands of European drivers leaving during the pandemic and not returning. Now the UK has left the EU, it is no longer part of the single market, so it is easier for European drivers to find work in the EU than in the UK. Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin has been a passionate supporter of Brexit and earlier this year denied reports that his pubs were impacted by Brexit-related staff shortages. BBC Radio 5 Live An immuno-suppressed man has spoken about his 13-year-old
daughterâs decision to have the Covid vaccine. Speaking to Nicky Campbell on 5 Live Breakfast, Mark says he believes
it comes down to who you trust in relation to vaccination. Mark says: ""We went through the risks of things, and on the balance of that risk, vaccination is a proven way of controlling disease. âWhatâs really clear is that it prevents serious illness,â
he adds. ""So, think about her first, me second."" Both of Markâs daughters, aged 13 and 17, have now had the jab. Listen to 5 Liveon the free BBC Sounds app. Allow Twitter content?

Scotland could make vaccine certificates mandatory for entry to nightclubs and other live events by next month, the first minister says. Nicola Sturgeon says the Scottish Parliament is proposing proof of vaccination for entry to:  Sturgeon says the new rules should be introduced later this month once all adults have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated. She says vaccine certification will not apply to key services such as public transport, education, access to health service or shops. She has called for a full debate a vote on vaccine certification next week. Coronavirus case levels in Scotland are 80% higher now than last week and five times higher than four weeks ago, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. She says in her Covid briefing test positivity has increased from 5% at start of August to 11.5% today. She says: ""If we are to avoid any imposition of restrictions, even in a limited way, we must all play a part to slow down transmission."" Sturgeon urges people to follow restrictions and says if they do she is hopeful Scotland will turn a corner. ""The next few days will be crucial in our assessment,"" she says. ""What is inescapably the case is that we must turn that corner and see the sharp increase in cases level off and then come down."" Police in Italy are guarding several train stations amid threats from people protesting against a new Covid pass being used in the country. The ""green pass"" is compulsory for domestic flights, ferries and long-distance or fast trains, as well as schools and universities. The increased security at stations in Rome, Florence and Rimini comes after protesters said they would disrupt high-speed trains. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio has condemned a climate of hatred over the launch of the pass - he's among several public figures to have been targeted by anti-vaccination protesters in recent days. Journalists and medical experts have also complained of being stalked, while Mr Di Maio faced death threats online. Read more here.  Plans to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs from the end of September have been met with disappointment from the nightlife industry. They fear it could lead to a rise in the number of house parties - and could lead to clubs being involved in discrimination cases. Downing Street says the government intends to continue with its plans, which have also been criticised by MPs from both Labour and its own Conservative MPs. Under the scheme, people would have to prove they're fully vaccinated before they can enter clubs and other large-scale events. Sacha Lord, night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester and co-founder of Manchester's Parklife festival, said: ""It's disappointing that despite the calls from all sides, including the industry and customers themselves, the government is continuing to move ahead with this. ""The measures will cause enormous disruption to an already struggling industry."" We're due to hear from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in about a quarter of an hour as she updates Holyrood on the pandemic in Scotland. Scotland currently has the highest rate of infection in the UK, with over 644 cases per 100,000 people. Sturgeon has suggested the return of pupils to school, earlier than in the rest of the UK, may be fuelling the rise. But we're not expecting to hear any changes to rules or restrictions from the first minister today. You'll be able to followwhat Sturgeon says in detail here, while we'll bring you the headlines from her statement. Officials will be able to make decisions about school safety on hard data, Prof Sir Terence Stephenson says Prof Sir Terence Stephenson, the lead author of the University College London study on long Covid in children, has been talking to BBC Radio 4's the World At One about its implications. He says that when they began the research in December 2020, some people were speculating that as many as half of all children who caught coronavirus would develop long Covid. The study offers reassurance that it is nowhere near that prevalent, he says, suggesting that more like one-in-seven or one-in-14 cases become long Covid. Prof Stephenson says the data should help policy-makers make decisions on issues such as school safety or the vaccination of children. ""This provides some data that allows them to make judgements and policy decisions on hard evidence, rather than speculation,"" he says. ""Itâs good that we can say itâs not overwhelming. But itâs also important to say we canât trivialise this."" There was ""no difference"" in mental health between those who contracted Covid, those who didn't, and young people surveyed over the last ten years, Prof Stephenson says. It seems young people's mental health is ""bearing up well"" in the pandemic, he says. The most common lasting symptoms were headaches, fatigue, dizziness and the loss of a sense of smell or taste. But Prof Stephenson says all of these are treatable. He says they will continue to monitor young people's health at six months, 12 months and 24 months after their positive test. More than 8,000 deaths linked to Covid-19 have now been recorded in Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics. There were 18 deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest weekly figures, one fewer than the week before. But it takes the overall total since the pandemic began to 8,002 in Wales. There has been a big decline in deaths in the third wave so far, with 102 deaths since the start of June. During the second wave in December and January, there were an average of 49 deaths a day.

The UK has given90,994,627coronavirus vacinations according to government data. That's48,086,605first doses and42,908,022second doses. Just over156,000jabs were given yesterday -38,596first doses and117,437second. The figure of 207 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test is the highest daily total in six months. The last time the number of daily deaths recorded reached the 200s was on 9 March when the figure was 231. Today's high number could in part be attributed to the bank holiday as, like weekends, they often cause a lag in the reporting of data. The day after the previous UK-wide bank holiday, at the end of May, was the only day since the UK's first coronavirus fatality that no deaths have been recorded (1 June). But then the jump the next day was only to 12 deaths. A further 207 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the UK,according to the latest government data.,external This is the number of people who have died in the 28 days after testing positive for Covid-19. The total is now 132,742 by this measure. There were also 35,693 new coronavirus infections recorded. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon has apologised to customers after its beer supplies became the latest casualty of the UK's supply chain crunch. The hospitality giant confirmed it has seen supplies of Carling and Coors beer hit by the disruption, with some pubs not receiving deliveries. The firm did not provide further details regarding the supply issues but it is understood it is directly related to a shortage of HGV drivers. Bosses at the Road Haulage Association warned last week that there is a shortfall of around 100,000 drivers. It said this has been driven by thousands of European drivers leaving during the pandemic and not returning. Now the UK has left the EU, it is no longer part of the single market, so it is easier for European drivers to find work in the EU than in the UK. Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin has been a passionate supporter of Brexit and earlier this year denied reports that his pubs were impacted by Brexit-related staff shortages. BBC Radio 5 Live An immuno-suppressed man has spoken about his 13-year-old
daughterâs decision to have the Covid vaccine. Speaking to Nicky Campbell on 5 Live Breakfast, Mark says he believes
it comes down to who you trust in relation to vaccination. Mark says: ""We went through the risks of things, and on the balance of that risk, vaccination is a proven way of controlling disease. âWhatâs really clear is that it prevents serious illness,â
he adds. ""So, think about her first, me second."" Both of Markâs daughters, aged 13 and 17, have now had the jab. Listen to 5 Liveon the free BBC Sounds app. Allow Twitter content?

Scotland could make vaccine certificates mandatory for entry to nightclubs and other live events by next month, the first minister says. Nicola Sturgeon says the Scottish Parliament is proposing proof of vaccination for entry to:  Sturgeon says the new rules should be introduced later this month once all adults have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated. She says vaccine certification will not apply to key services such as public transport, education, access to health service or shops. She has called for a full debate a vote on vaccine certification next week. Coronavirus case levels in Scotland are 80% higher now than last week and five times higher than four weeks ago, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. She says in her Covid briefing test positivity has increased from 5% at start of August to 11.5% today. She says: ""If we are to avoid any imposition of restrictions, even in a limited way, we must all play a part to slow down transmission."" Sturgeon urges people to follow restrictions and says if they do she is hopeful Scotland will turn a corner. ""The next few days will be crucial in our assessment,"" she says. ""What is inescapably the case is that we must turn that corner and see the sharp increase in cases level off and then come down."" Police in Italy are guarding several train stations amid threats from people protesting against a new Covid pass being used in the country. The ""green pass"" is compulsory for domestic flights, ferries and long-distance or fast trains, as well as schools and universities. The increased security at stations in Rome, Florence and Rimini comes after protesters said they would disrupt high-speed trains. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio has condemned a climate of hatred over the launch of the pass - he's among several public figures to have been targeted by anti-vaccination protesters in recent days. Journalists and medical experts have also complained of being stalked, while Mr Di Maio faced death threats online. Read more here.  Plans to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs from the end of September have been met with disappointment from the nightlife industry. They fear it could lead to a rise in the number of house parties - and could lead to clubs being involved in discrimination cases. Downing Street says the government intends to continue with its plans, which have also been criticised by MPs from both Labour and its own Conservative MPs. Under the scheme, people would have to prove they're fully vaccinated before they can enter clubs and other large-scale events. Sacha Lord, night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester and co-founder of Manchester's Parklife festival, said: ""It's disappointing that despite the calls from all sides, including the industry and customers themselves, the government is continuing to move ahead with this. ""The measures will cause enormous disruption to an already struggling industry."" We're due to hear from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in about a quarter of an hour as she updates Holyrood on the pandemic in Scotland. Scotland currently has the highest rate of infection in the UK, with over 644 cases per 100,000 people. Sturgeon has suggested the return of pupils to school, earlier than in the rest of the UK, may be fuelling the rise. But we're not expecting to hear any changes to rules or restrictions from the first minister today. You'll be able to followwhat Sturgeon says in detail here, while we'll bring you the headlines from her statement. Officials will be able to make decisions about school safety on hard data, Prof Sir Terence Stephenson says Prof Sir Terence Stephenson, the lead author of the University College London study on long Covid in children, has been talking to BBC Radio 4's the World At One about its implications. He says that when they began the research in December 2020, some people were speculating that as many as half of all children who caught coronavirus would develop long Covid. The study offers reassurance that it is nowhere near that prevalent, he says, suggesting that more like one-in-seven or one-in-14 cases become long Covid. Prof Stephenson says the data should help policy-makers make decisions on issues such as school safety or the vaccination of children. ""This provides some data that allows them to make judgements and policy decisions on hard evidence, rather than speculation,"" he says. ""Itâs good that we can say itâs not overwhelming. But itâs also important to say we canât trivialise this."" There was ""no difference"" in mental health between those who contracted Covid, those who didn't, and young people surveyed over the last ten years, Prof Stephenson says. It seems young people's mental health is ""bearing up well"" in the pandemic, he says. The most common lasting symptoms were headaches, fatigue, dizziness and the loss of a sense of smell or taste. But Prof Stephenson says all of these are treatable. He says they will continue to monitor young people's health at six months, 12 months and 24 months after their positive test. More than 8,000 deaths linked to Covid-19 have now been recorded in Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics. There were 18 deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest weekly figures, one fewer than the week before. But it takes the overall total since the pandemic began to 8,002 in Wales. There has been a big decline in deaths in the third wave so far, with 102 deaths since the start of June. During the second wave in December and January, there were an average of 49 deaths a day.

Breaking|Breaking newsScots to need vaccine passports for large eventsNicola Sturgeon tells MSPs that vaccine passports will be introduced in Scotland later in September.Scotland,"The move means people will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before being allowed into nightclubs and many other events Vaccine passports are to be required for entry to nightclubs and many large events in Scotland from later this month, Nicola Sturgeon has said. The plans will apply to indoor and outdoor events, and will need to be signed off by MSPs next week. Ms Sturgeon said the move was needed to help stem the recent surge in the number of cases. A further 6,107 people have tested positive, with the number of people in hospital doubling in the past 10 days. And several areas of Scotland are among the regions with the highest rates of the virus in Europe. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? Is the drive to get young people jabbed working? The new vaccine certification rules mean people over the age of 18 will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to: Nightclubs and adult entertainment venues. Unseated indoor live events, with more than 500 people in the audience. Unseated outdoor live events, with more than 4,000 people in the audience. Any event, of any nature, which has more than 10,000 people in attendance. The new rules will impact on many sporting events in Scotland - particularly football matches - as well as concerts and music festivals. SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster said Premiership football clubs had""a significant number of questions and real concern""about the plan. He added: ""It's not clear what IT infrastructure will be in place, what time-scales clubs will be asked to work to, or what can be done for those without smart phones. ""And it's not clear if it's going to cut across terms and conditions of seasons tickets already bought by people across the land."" Ms Sturgeon said the hospitality industry as a whole would not be included in the certification scheme - although that decision would be kept under review. And there are no plans to include key services or settings where people have no choice over attendance - such as shops, public transport, education and medical services. Anyone who has good reasons for not getting fully vaccinated - including children and people with particular medical conditions - will be exempt. People can already request a paper copy of their vaccination record to allow them to travel, and from Friday they will be provided with a QR code so they can download a copy of the record to keep on their phone. Paper copies of vaccine certificates are already available for people who have been fully vaccinated A similar scheme will be introduced in England at the end of this month, with people needing to have a ""Covid pass"" to access ""higher risk"" settings such as nightclubs. Several other European countries - including France, Italy and Ireland - have already introduced certification. Scotland's health secretary, Humza Yousaf, said in July that he was ""sceptical"" about the case for vaccine passports, citing concerns that they ""might increase the inequality gap, and there would be ethical issues"". The country's deputy first minister, John Swinney, also said he did not believe it was right to exclude people who do not want to be vaccinated after the UK government set out its plans to introduce passports in England. In a statement at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon told MSPs that the certification scheme was now needed to ""help protect individuals and the country as a whole and reduce the risk of further restrictions being necessary"". The first minister added: ""Many of the events and venues that are covered by the certification scheme are important - they matter to our economy, and to our cultural and social life. ""That's why we want to enable them to stay open safely - but they are not essential services. ""And the nature of them - which involves bringing many people together in relatively small areas - does mean that, despite their very best efforts, they can contribute significantly to the spread of the virus."" She also said it would be ""grossly irresponsible"" to rule out re-introducing further restrictions in the future. The Scottish Greens are not keen on vaccine passports. The new minister for zero carbon buildings, active travel and tenants' rights, Patrick Harvie, has raised concerns about their introduction before. In July he argued vaccine certification ""would deepen discrimination against those who have not yet been vaccinated"". Today the party's health spokesperson, Gillian Mackay, said it was essential the Scottish government ensures the introduction of vaccine certification doesn't adversely affect disabled people, those with underlying health conditions and those from the global south who may not be able to access proof of vaccination. But the Greens are now in government. Vaccine certification isn't specifically excluded in the co-operation agreement they signed with the SNP and so the Greens are bound by collective responsibility on this issue and will have to support it when it's put to the vote at Holyrood. The first minister said it was a ""significant move"" and would need to be signed off by MSPs, with a debate and vote to take place next week. However the SNP has a comfortable majority with the backing of the Scottish Greens - who have previously been opposed to the move - and the cooperation agreement between the two parties commits them to working together on Covid-related matters. The Liberal Democrats were the only party to hit out directly against the plans following Ms Sturgeon's statement, with leader Alex Cole-Hamilton saying vaccine passports were akin to ""medical ID cards"", adding: ""This is an illiberal step"". Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said the Scottish government had ""wasted months"" that could have been spent making preparations, and was now ""introducing vaccine passports at the last minute"". He added: ""It's a striking u-turn from what John Swinney said last month, where he emphatically claimed vaccine passports were ""the wrong way"" to go. ""We need businesses to get in-depth guidance around these certificates as soon as possible. They should be involved in the process and the government needs to clarify whether they will be expected to police these new rules."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the virus was now out of control and Scotland - and claimed the government had no strategy to deal with it. Case levels in Scotland are 80% higher now than they were last week, and five times higher than they were four weeks ago. The number of people in hospital has more than doubled since 20 August, from 312 to 629. Intensive care admissions have not risen as quickly, but have still gone up from 34 to 59 over the same timescale. Meanwhile 4,108,804 people have had a first dose of vaccine, and 3,691,066 have had two. That includes 95% of people over 40 who are now fully vaccinated, as well as 71% of 30 to 39-year-olds and 51% of 18 to 29-year-olds. The Federation of Small Businesses said the many affected firms would not welcome the certificate scheme - but would accept it as an alternative to stricter restrictions. But it said the system needed to be user-friendly for both businesses and the public, and warned against a ""rush"" to extend the scheme to other settings. The Scottish Licensed Trade Association (SLTA) said the scheme was a ""threat hanging over the whole of the hospitality industry"", while the UK Hospitality Scotland said the move would ""cause dismay amongst businesses"" that had only recently been allowed to reopen.

Era of US wars to remake countries is over - Biden,"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

Holidaymakers have been asked to use the service only if they are travelling soon,because of technical problems. Here's our guide to proving you've been vaccinated. India avoided a strict lockdown even as cases reached record levels in spring The economy in Indiarebounded at a record rateeven while a devastating wave of Covid-19 cases hit the country. While nations around the world sent aid and oxygen to struggling hospitals in India, the government declined to implement the same tight pandemic restrictions as it did in 2020. It meant businesses were less affected and gross domestic product grew by 20.1% from April to June compared with a year earlier. At the peak in May, there were more than 400,000 daily infections while deaths reached 4,000 a day. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has prioritised investment in infrastructure, privatisation of state-owned businesses and tax reforms to drive growth. But consumer spending is still lower than before the pandemic and India's economy, the third largest in Asia, remains smaller than before March 2020. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The news another 207 Covid deaths have been recorded
looks more alarming than it is. The figure has been inflated by delays reporting deaths over
the Bank Holiday weekend. On average just under 100 deaths a day are being seen. And
the figure has started falling â last week it was over 100. This was exactly where government scientists expected us to
be at this stage of the summer â and to put it in context is similar to what
would be seen during a winter flu season.  The more difficult thing to predict is what will happen in September when schools are fully open across the UK and people are back in workplaces and return to more normal behaviour and mixing patterns. Scotland, where the holiday season ends earlier, has already seen a sharp rise. If this increase is sustained and then repeated across the UK it could cause significant pressures on the NHS, not to mention pose some very difficult questions about the level of virus that we can tolerate circulating. But there is also hope the level of immunity built up will keep a lid on the virus and mean any rise in infections and serious illness is limited. Rail journeys have reached a new recent high of 66% of pre-pandemic levels,provisional statistics,externalfrom the Department for Transport show. Last week, the rail industryrevealed,externaladvance purchases of tickets for leisure journeys to seaside destinations over the bank holiday weekend were surpassing pre-pandemic levels. But overall, commuting and business journeys by rail are still
well below pre-pandemic levels and rail industry revenue is just 59% of that
seen in 2019, research by WPI Economics for the Rail Delivery
Group shows. Jacqueline Starr, chief executive of the Rail Delivery
Group, says: âItâs great to see more and more daytrippers and
staycationers travelling by train to see the people and places they love as
life gets back on track, whether thatâs a seaside trip, a night out or a
shopping spree. ""These journeys are boosting businesses and high streets that
have struggled during the pandemic, helping to build a fair and clean economic
recovery from the pandemic.â Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The study on long Covid in children we've been discussing today was also able to provide some insight into how the
stress and strain of the pandemic and existing health may be playing a role. Those taking part were asked about their emotional health
and physical health. Older girls with poorer physical and mental health were the
group most likely to report ongoing symptoms. Overall four in 10 of everyone who took part - among both
those who tested positive and negative - reported feeling sad, worried or
unhappy. Researchers say it's clear the pandemic has had a
damaging effect on young people because of the closure of schools, not seeing
their friends and concern about the risk from the virus. They say those who have been struggling emotionally and mentally
could be more attuned to even minor physical illnesses and acknowledged a
positive Covid test could help trigger that. Dr Liz Whittaker, the Royal College of Paediatrics
and Child Health lead on infectious disease, says the evidence on how mental health has been
impacted shows how important it is to get âback to normalâ and have schools
open. Here's the daily coronavirus data from the government at a glance. The figures also show us the number of people in mechanical ventilation beds in hospital is over 1,000 for first time since 15 March. The UK has given90,994,627coronavirus vacinations according to government data. That's48,086,605first doses and42,908,022second doses. Just over156,000jabs were given yesterday -38,596first doses and117,437second. The figure of 207 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test is the highest daily total in six months. The last time the number of daily deaths recorded reached the 200s was on 9 March when the figure was 231. Today's high number could in part be attributed to the bank holiday as, like weekends, they often cause a lag in the reporting of data. The day after the previous UK-wide bank holiday, at the end of May, was the only day since the UK's first coronavirus fatality that no deaths have been recorded (1 June). But then the jump the next day was only to 12 deaths. A further 207 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the UK,according to the latest government data.,external This is the number of people who have died in the 28 days after testing positive for Covid-19. The total is now 132,742 by this measure. There were also 35,693 new coronavirus infections recorded. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon has apologised to customers after its beer supplies became the latest casualty of the UK's supply chain crunch. The hospitality giant confirmed it has seen supplies of Carling and Coors beer hit by the disruption, with some pubs not receiving deliveries. The firm did not provide further details regarding the supply issues but it is understood it is directly related to a shortage of HGV drivers. Bosses at the Road Haulage Association warned last week that there is a shortfall of around 100,000 drivers. It said this has been driven by thousands of European drivers leaving during the pandemic and not returning. Now the UK has left the EU, it is no longer part of the single market, so it is easier for European drivers to find work in the EU than in the UK. Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin has been a passionate supporter of Brexit and earlier this year denied reports that his pubs were impacted by Brexit-related staff shortages. BBC Radio 5 Live An immuno-suppressed man has spoken about his 13-year-old
daughterâs decision to have the Covid vaccine. Speaking to Nicky Campbell on 5 Live Breakfast, Mark says he believes
it comes down to who you trust in relation to vaccination. Mark says: ""We went through the risks of things, and on the balance of that risk, vaccination is a proven way of controlling disease. âWhatâs really clear is that it prevents serious illness,â
he adds. ""So, think about her first, me second."" Both of Markâs daughters, aged 13 and 17, have now had the jab. Listen to 5 Liveon the free BBC Sounds app. Allow Twitter content?

Scotland could make vaccine certificates mandatory for entry to nightclubs and other live events by next month, the first minister says. Nicola Sturgeon says the Scottish Parliament is proposing proof of vaccination for entry to:  Sturgeon says the new rules should be introduced later this month once all adults have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated. She says vaccine certification will not apply to key services such as public transport, education, access to health service or shops. She has called for a full debate a vote on vaccine certification next week. Coronavirus case levels in Scotland are 80% higher now than last week and five times higher than four weeks ago, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. She says in her Covid briefing test positivity has increased from 5% at start of August to 11.5% today. She says: ""If we are to avoid any imposition of restrictions, even in a limited way, we must all play a part to slow down transmission."" Sturgeon urges people to follow restrictions and says if they do she is hopeful Scotland will turn a corner. ""The next few days will be crucial in our assessment,"" she says. ""What is inescapably the case is that we must turn that corner and see the sharp increase in cases level off and then come down."" Police in Italy are guarding several train stations amid threats from people protesting against a new Covid pass being used in the country. The ""green pass"" is compulsory for domestic flights, ferries and long-distance or fast trains, as well as schools and universities. The increased security at stations in Rome, Florence and Rimini comes after protesters said they would disrupt high-speed trains. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio has condemned a climate of hatred over the launch of the pass - he's among several public figures to have been targeted by anti-vaccination protesters in recent days. Journalists and medical experts have also complained of being stalked, while Mr Di Maio faced death threats online. Read more here.  Plans to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs from the end of September have been met with disappointment from the nightlife industry. They fear it could lead to a rise in the number of house parties - and could lead to clubs being involved in discrimination cases. Downing Street says the government intends to continue with its plans, which have also been criticised by MPs from both Labour and its own Conservative MPs. Under the scheme, people would have to prove they're fully vaccinated before they can enter clubs and other large-scale events. Sacha Lord, night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester and co-founder of Manchester's Parklife festival, said: ""It's disappointing that despite the calls from all sides, including the industry and customers themselves, the government is continuing to move ahead with this. ""The measures will cause enormous disruption to an already struggling industry."" We're due to hear from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in about a quarter of an hour as she updates Holyrood on the pandemic in Scotland. Scotland currently has the highest rate of infection in the UK, with over 644 cases per 100,000 people. Sturgeon has suggested the return of pupils to school, earlier than in the rest of the UK, may be fuelling the rise. But we're not expecting to hear any changes to rules or restrictions from the first minister today. You'll be able to followwhat Sturgeon says in detail here, while we'll bring you the headlines from her statement. Officials will be able to make decisions about school safety on hard data, Prof Sir Terence Stephenson says Prof Sir Terence Stephenson, the lead author of the University College London study on long Covid in children, has been talking to BBC Radio 4's the World At One about its implications. He says that when they began the research in December 2020, some people were speculating that as many as half of all children who caught coronavirus would develop long Covid. The study offers reassurance that it is nowhere near that prevalent, he says, suggesting that more like one-in-seven or one-in-14 cases become long Covid. Prof Stephenson says the data should help policy-makers make decisions on issues such as school safety or the vaccination of children. ""This provides some data that allows them to make judgements and policy decisions on hard evidence, rather than speculation,"" he says. ""Itâs good that we can say itâs not overwhelming. But itâs also important to say we canât trivialise this."" There was ""no difference"" in mental health between those who contracted Covid, those who didn't, and young people surveyed over the last ten years, Prof Stephenson says. It seems young people's mental health is ""bearing up well"" in the pandemic, he says. The most common lasting symptoms were headaches, fatigue, dizziness and the loss of a sense of smell or taste. But Prof Stephenson says all of these are treatable. He says they will continue to monitor young people's health at six months, 12 months and 24 months after their positive test. More than 8,000 deaths linked to Covid-19 have now been recorded in Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics. There were 18 deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest weekly figures, one fewer than the week before. But it takes the overall total since the pandemic began to 8,002 in Wales. There has been a big decline in deaths in the third wave so far, with 102 deaths since the start of June. During the second wave in December and January, there were an average of 49 deaths a day.

JoJo Maman Bebe blames shortages for raising prices,"JoJo Maman Bebe is raising prices for the first time in about five years due to widespread supply chain issues. The baby clothing and goods retailer said it had seen shipping costs quadruple in recent months. Its commercial director, Gwynn Milligan, said: ""We've had no choice but to pass on some of these costs to our customers."" Price hikes will not be uniform across the board, but will depend on each item and what it is made up of. Ms Milligan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the firm had seen increases in the cost of raw materials such as wood, paper and plastics, for example, which may affect items such as its toys or changing mats. She added that the company was also having to absorb increased costs on some products, because of  competition from retail rivals. Shopping bills set to rise this autumn, says BRC How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Price rises cool amid clothes and shoe discounting ""We've looked at prices across our competitors and also what customers realistically want to pay. ""There's no set increase in any area, but it depends on what we've looked at and what's going on in that sector."" While the retailer does not believe that price increases will be sustained, it did point to problems with deliveries too - largely down to a shortage of lorry drivers at ports and difficulties in obtaining shipping containers. Ms Milligan said: ""We're advising customers not to panic because we've increased our orders to deal with the ever-growing demand of JoJo."" The baby goods retailer said it was expecting a 'bigger' Christmas than last year Customers have already starting planning their Christmas buys, according to the retailer. The term ""Christmas"" was the third-highest search on its website last week, and it believes that spending will be higher due to lockdown restrictions hampering festive plans for many people in the UK last December. It comes as the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned that price increases could last into the winter months. According to new figures released by the trade body and market research firm Nielsen, retail prices in August saw a slight increase on the previous month. Some non-food categories, such as electricals, reported sharp rises in inflation compared with last year due to ""global issues from delayed shipping and shortages of microchips"". While overall retail prices fell 0.8% year-on-year, Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: ""There are some modest indications that rising costs are starting to filter through into product prices."" Retailers such as Tesco and Aldi have increased wages for lorry drivers amid shortages. She warned: ""Low prices are already under threat, and now the HGV driver shortage has created an additional problem with a shortfall of 90,000 drivers."" The BRC issued a warning on lorry driver shortageswith Logistics UK in August saying that while Brexit and Covid-19 caused many to leave the UK, a temporary visa for drivers from the European Union could lure them back. On Wednesday, Ms Dickinson said in the run-up to the key Christmas trading period customers may see reduced choice or higher prices for their presents of choice and she called on the government to increase the number of HGV driving tests taking place. ""Without government action, it will be the British consumers who will pay the price."" The government has slightly relaxed the Drivers' Hours rules, which means drivers will be able to increase their daily driving limit from nine hours to 11 hours twice a week. Companies such asTescoandAldi,externalhave also increased wages for HGV drivers, or have started to offer sign-on bonuses.

The more difficult thing to predict is what will happen in September when schools are fully open across the UK and people are back in workplaces and return to more normal behaviour and mixing patterns. Scotland, where the holiday season ends earlier, has already seen a sharp rise. If this increase is sustained and then repeated across the UK it could cause significant pressures on the NHS, not to mention pose some very difficult questions about the level of virus that we can tolerate circulating. But there is also hope the level of immunity built up will keep a lid on the virus and mean any rise in infections and serious illness is limited.

Last week, the rail industryrevealed,externaladvance purchases of tickets for leisure journeys to seaside destinations over the bank holiday weekend were surpassing pre-pandemic levels. But overall, commuting and business journeys by rail are still
well below pre-pandemic levels and rail industry revenue is just 59% of that
seen in 2019, research by WPI Economics for the Rail Delivery
Group shows. Jacqueline Starr, chief executive of the Rail Delivery

staycationers travelling by train to see the people and places they love as
life gets back on track, whether thatâs a seaside trip, a night out or a

have struggled during the pandemic, helping to build a fair and clean economic
recovery from the pandemic.â Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The study on long Covid in children we've been discussing today was also able to provide some insight into how the
stress and strain of the pandemic and existing health may be playing a role. Those taking part were asked about their emotional health
and physical health. Older girls with poorer physical and mental health were the
group most likely to report ongoing symptoms. Overall four in 10 of everyone who took part - among both
those who tested positive and negative - reported feeling sad, worried or
unhappy. Researchers say it's clear the pandemic has had a
damaging effect on young people because of the closure of schools, not seeing
their friends and concern about the risk from the virus. They say those who have been struggling emotionally and mentally
could be more attuned to even minor physical illnesses and acknowledged a
positive Covid test could help trigger that. Dr Liz Whittaker, the Royal College of Paediatrics
and Child Health lead on infectious disease, says the evidence on how mental health has been
impacted shows how important it is to get âback to normalâ and have schools
open. Here's the daily coronavirus data from the government at a glance. The figures also show us the number of people in mechanical ventilation beds in hospital is over 1,000 for first time since 15 March. The UK has given90,994,627coronavirus vacinations according to government data. That's48,086,605first doses and42,908,022second doses. Just over156,000jabs were given yesterday -38,596first doses and117,437second. The figure of 207 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test is the highest daily total in six months. The last time the number of daily deaths recorded reached the 200s was on 9 March when the figure was 231. Today's high number could in part be attributed to the bank holiday as, like weekends, they often cause a lag in the reporting of data. The day after the previous UK-wide bank holiday, at the end of May, was the only day since the UK's first coronavirus fatality that no deaths have been recorded (1 June). But then the jump the next day was only to 12 deaths. A further 207 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the UK,according to the latest government data.,external This is the number of people who have died in the 28 days after testing positive for Covid-19. The total is now 132,742 by this measure. There were also 35,693 new coronavirus infections recorded. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon has apologised to customers after its beer supplies became the latest casualty of the UK's supply chain crunch. The hospitality giant confirmed it has seen supplies of Carling and Coors beer hit by the disruption, with some pubs not receiving deliveries. The firm did not provide further details regarding the supply issues but it is understood it is directly related to a shortage of HGV drivers. Bosses at the Road Haulage Association warned last week that there is a shortfall of around 100,000 drivers. It said this has been driven by thousands of European drivers leaving during the pandemic and not returning. Now the UK has left the EU, it is no longer part of the single market, so it is easier for European drivers to find work in the EU than in the UK. Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin has been a passionate supporter of Brexit and earlier this year denied reports that his pubs were impacted by Brexit-related staff shortages. BBC Radio 5 Live An immuno-suppressed man has spoken about his 13-year-old
daughterâs decision to have the Covid vaccine. Speaking to Nicky Campbell on 5 Live Breakfast, Mark says he believes
it comes down to who you trust in relation to vaccination. Mark says: ""We went through the risks of things, and on the balance of that risk, vaccination is a proven way of controlling disease. âWhatâs really clear is that it prevents serious illness,â

Scotland could make vaccine certificates mandatory for entry to nightclubs and other live events by next month, the first minister says. Nicola Sturgeon says the Scottish Parliament is proposing proof of vaccination for entry to:  Sturgeon says the new rules should be introduced later this month once all adults have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated. She says vaccine certification will not apply to key services such as public transport, education, access to health service or shops. She has called for a full debate a vote on vaccine certification next week. Coronavirus case levels in Scotland are 80% higher now than last week and five times higher than four weeks ago, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. She says in her Covid briefing test positivity has increased from 5% at start of August to 11.5% today. She says: ""If we are to avoid any imposition of restrictions, even in a limited way, we must all play a part to slow down transmission."" Sturgeon urges people to follow restrictions and says if they do she is hopeful Scotland will turn a corner. ""The next few days will be crucial in our assessment,"" she says. ""What is inescapably the case is that we must turn that corner and see the sharp increase in cases level off and then come down."" Police in Italy are guarding several train stations amid threats from people protesting against a new Covid pass being used in the country. The ""green pass"" is compulsory for domestic flights, ferries and long-distance or fast trains, as well as schools and universities. The increased security at stations in Rome, Florence and Rimini comes after protesters said they would disrupt high-speed trains. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio has condemned a climate of hatred over the launch of the pass - he's among several public figures to have been targeted by anti-vaccination protesters in recent days. Journalists and medical experts have also complained of being stalked, while Mr Di Maio faced death threats online. Read more here.  Plans to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs from the end of September have been met with disappointment from the nightlife industry. They fear it could lead to a rise in the number of house parties - and could lead to clubs being involved in discrimination cases. Downing Street says the government intends to continue with its plans, which have also been criticised by MPs from both Labour and its own Conservative MPs. Under the scheme, people would have to prove they're fully vaccinated before they can enter clubs and other large-scale events. Sacha Lord, night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester and co-founder of Manchester's Parklife festival, said: ""It's disappointing that despite the calls from all sides, including the industry and customers themselves, the government is continuing to move ahead with this. ""The measures will cause enormous disruption to an already struggling industry."" We're due to hear from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in about a quarter of an hour as she updates Holyrood on the pandemic in Scotland. Scotland currently has the highest rate of infection in the UK, with over 644 cases per 100,000 people. Sturgeon has suggested the return of pupils to school, earlier than in the rest of the UK, may be fuelling the rise. But we're not expecting to hear any changes to rules or restrictions from the first minister today. You'll be able to followwhat Sturgeon says in detail here, while we'll bring you the headlines from her statement. Officials will be able to make decisions about school safety on hard data, Prof Sir Terence Stephenson says Prof Sir Terence Stephenson, the lead author of the University College London study on long Covid in children, has been talking to BBC Radio 4's the World At One about its implications. He says that when they began the research in December 2020, some people were speculating that as many as half of all children who caught coronavirus would develop long Covid. The study offers reassurance that it is nowhere near that prevalent, he says, suggesting that more like one-in-seven or one-in-14 cases become long Covid. Prof Stephenson says the data should help policy-makers make decisions on issues such as school safety or the vaccination of children. ""This provides some data that allows them to make judgements and policy decisions on hard evidence, rather than speculation,"" he says. ""Itâs good that we can say itâs not overwhelming. But itâs also important to say we canât trivialise this."" There was ""no difference"" in mental health between those who contracted Covid, those who didn't, and young people surveyed over the last ten years, Prof Stephenson says. It seems young people's mental health is ""bearing up well"" in the pandemic, he says. The most common lasting symptoms were headaches, fatigue, dizziness and the loss of a sense of smell or taste. But Prof Stephenson says all of these are treatable. He says they will continue to monitor young people's health at six months, 12 months and 24 months after their positive test. More than 8,000 deaths linked to Covid-19 have now been recorded in Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics. There were 18 deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest weekly figures, one fewer than the week before. But it takes the overall total since the pandemic began to 8,002 in Wales. There has been a big decline in deaths in the third wave so far, with 102 deaths since the start of June. During the second wave in December and January, there were an average of 49 deaths a day.

India avoided a strict lockdown even as cases reached record levels in spring The economy in Indiarebounded at a record rateeven while a devastating wave of Covid-19 cases hit the country. While nations around the world sent aid and oxygen to struggling hospitals in India, the government declined to implement the same tight pandemic restrictions as it did in 2020. It meant businesses were less affected and gross domestic product grew by 20.1% from April to June compared with a year earlier. At the peak in May, there were more than 400,000 daily infections while deaths reached 4,000 a day. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has prioritised investment in infrastructure, privatisation of state-owned businesses and tax reforms to drive growth. But consumer spending is still lower than before the pandemic and India's economy, the third largest in Asia, remains smaller than before March 2020. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The news another 207 Covid deaths have been recorded
looks more alarming than it is. The figure has been inflated by delays reporting deaths over
the Bank Holiday weekend. On average just under 100 deaths a day are being seen. And
the figure has started falling â last week it was over 100. This was exactly where government scientists expected us to
be at this stage of the summer â and to put it in context is similar to what

"Weather-related disasters increase five-foldFloods, storms and extreme events increase five-fold but the number of people dying in them fell.Science & EnvironmentComments","The number of weather-related disasters to hit the world has increased five-fold over the past 50 years, says the World Meteorological Organization. However, the number of deaths because of the greater number of storms, floods and droughts has fallen sharply. Scientists say that climate change, more extreme weather and better reporting are behind the rise in these extreme events. But improvements to warning systems have helped limit the number of deaths. Queen to attend COP26 climate conference in Glasgow Europe's 2020 heat reached 'troubling' level How much can wetlands protect from coastal flooding? As global temperatures have risen in recent decades, there has been a significant uptick in the number of disasters related to weather and water extremes. In the 50 years between 1970 and 2019, there were more than 11,000 such disasters, according to a newatlas,externalfrom the WMO that charts the scale of these events. Flooding in Bangladesh has taken a huge toll in lives and economic damage over recent decades Over two million people died as a result of these hazards, with economic losses amounting to $3.64 trillion. ""The number of weather, climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Prof Petteri Taalas. ""That means more heatwaves, drought and forest fires such as those we have observed recently in Europe and North America. We have more water vapour in the atmosphere, which is exacerbating extreme rainfall and deadly flooding. The warming of the oceans has affected the frequency and area of existence of the most intense tropical storms,"" he added. Four ways climate change links to extreme weather More than 90% of the deaths related to weather disasters have occurred in developing countries. The biggest killers have been droughts, responsible for 650,000 deaths; while at the other end of the scale, extreme temperatures took nearly 56,000 lives. But over the 50-year period, the overall death toll from disasters fell rapidly. ""Behind the stark statistics lies a message of hope,"" said Prof Taalas. ""Improved multi-hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in mortality. Quite simply, we are better than ever before at saving lives."" While more people have been saved in the face of an increasing number of extremes, the economic toll has mounted. Reported losses in the decade between 2010-2019 were around $383m per day, a seven-fold increase on the $49m per day between 1970-1979. The town of Kingswood in Texas was hit badly by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 Three of the extreme events with the biggest financial impact all occurred in the same year - 2017. It saw Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma hit the US. Taken together, the economic impact of the three accounted for 35% of the total losses from the top 10 disasters between 1970 and 2019. The atlas points out that, while improvements in warning systems are helping to save lives, there is much more work to be done. Only half of the 193 countries that are members of the WMO have multi-hazard early warning systems in place. The aftermath of Hurricane Irma, which brought devastation to parts of the Caribbean and the US in 2017 There are also huge gaps in weather and hydrological observing networks in Africa, some parts of Latin America and among island states in the Pacific and Caribbean. ""More lives are being saved thanks to early warning systems but it is also true that the number of people exposed to disaster risk is increasing due to population growth in hazard-exposed areas and the growing intensity and frequency of weather events,"" said Mami Mizutori, special representative of the UN's Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction. ""More international cooperation is needed to tackle the chronic problem of huge numbers of people being displaced each year by floods, storms and drought. ""We need greater investment in comprehensive disaster risk management, ensuring that climate change adaptation is integrated in national and local disaster risk-reduction strategies,"" she said.

"New eco-petrol baffles a quarter of motoristsE10 is set to become the new standard petrol, but 24% of drivers are unaware of it, says the RAC.","A more eco-friendly petrol is coming to British filling stations this month, but a quarter of drivers do not know whether their cars can run on it, new research says. The government intends to make E10 the new standard petrol grade. It contains less carbon than other motor fuels and more ethanol, a kind of alcohol manufactured from plants. But according to the RAC, 24% of motorists are unaware of it, while 27% do not know if their car is compatible. Current petrol grades in the UK - known as E5 - contain up to 5% ethanol, with the other 95% being regular unleaded petrol. Their replacement, E10, will see this percentage increased to 10% - a proportion that would bring the UK in line with countries such as Belgium, Finland, France and Germany. What is E10 petrol and can my car run it? Shell sets out carbon neutral plans Introducing E10 could cut carbon emissions by 750,000 tonnes a year, says the Department for Transport, the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off the road and an important step towards the government's climate change targets. The new fuel is being rolled out everywhere in the UK except Northern Ireland, where it is not due to arrive until early 2022. Every petrol vehicle built after 2011 should accept E10. But it will not be compatible with some older vehicles - as many as 600,000 of those currently on UK roads, the RAC estimates. The introduction of E10 fuel comes after the government announced new climate change commitments in a bid for the UKto cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035. Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions and the Earth is now in a period of rapid climate change, with global temperatures rising because of human activities, such as the burning of coal, oil and gas. Reducing the impact of climate change and hitting carbon emissions targets will require more electric cars, low-carbon heating, renewable electricity and, for many, cutting down on meat and dairy products, scientists say. This video can not be played What is climate change? The government has set upa website,externalwhere drivers can check whether their car will run on E10 fuel. But it warns it will not be liable for any damage to vehicles as a result of drivers using its checker - especially if their car has been fitted with replacement parts. The RAC said 26% of drivers surveyed had already checked online, with a further 15% saying they had found their car was compatible by another means. Those with incompatible vehicles will have to use E5 super unleaded instead, which the RAC says can cost 12p a litre more than standard unleaded. According to its survey, 59% of drivers who know their cars are incompatible with E10 are worried about the higher cost of filling up, while 20% fear mistakenly filling their tanks with E10. RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes said E10 petrol had already started appearing on forecourts to replace the old E5 blend and the process would continue ""at pace"" in coming weeks. He said that while it would make no difference to ""the vast majority"" of petrol car drivers, a ""sizeable minority"" would be adversely affected. ""Drivers who will continue to rely on E5 will also need to make sure the filling station they're visiting stocks the fuel in the first place, or risk running out of fuel and having to call on their breakdown provider,"" he added. ""We'd also like to remind owners of classic cars that need to be careful not to accidentally top up with E10 and then leave it sat unused in the tank for long periods, something which can lead to expensive damaged plastics, metals and seals."" In another development, oil giant Shell announced on Wednesday it was aiming to install 50,000 charging points on Britain's streets by 2025, as part of a government-backed push to increase electric vehicle numbers and reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Shell will roll out the charging points through on-street charging point company Ubitricity, which it acquired in February. The government hasestimated,externalthat the UK will need between 280,000 and 480,000 charging points by 2030, the year it plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Shell said it would support local authorities financially to install more on-street chargers in towns and cities. David Bunch, Shell's UK country chairman, said: ""It's vital to speed up the pace of EV charger installation across the UK and this aim and financing offer is designed to help achieve that. ""Whether at home, at work or on-the-go, we want to give drivers across the UK accessible EV charging options, so that more drivers can switch to electric."" Shell currently has 60,000 charging points globally, but plans to increase that number to 500,000 by 2025 and to 2.5 million by 2030. What is E10 petrol and can my car run on it?

Weather-related disasters increase five-fold,"The number of weather-related disasters to hit the world has increased five-fold over the past 50 years, says the World Meteorological Organization. However, the number of deaths because of the greater number of storms, floods and droughts has fallen sharply. Scientists say that climate change, more extreme weather and better reporting are behind the rise in these extreme events. But improvements to warning systems have helped limit the number of deaths. Queen to attend COP26 climate conference in Glasgow Europe's 2020 heat reached 'troubling' level How much can wetlands protect from coastal flooding? As global temperatures have risen in recent decades, there has been a significant uptick in the number of disasters related to weather and water extremes. In the 50 years between 1970 and 2019, there were more than 11,000 such disasters, according to a newatlas,externalfrom the WMO that charts the scale of these events. Flooding in Bangladesh has taken a huge toll in lives and economic damage over recent decades Over two million people died as a result of these hazards, with economic losses amounting to $3.64 trillion. ""The number of weather, climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Prof Petteri Taalas. ""That means more heatwaves, drought and forest fires such as those we have observed recently in Europe and North America. We have more water vapour in the atmosphere, which is exacerbating extreme rainfall and deadly flooding. The warming of the oceans has affected the frequency and area of existence of the most intense tropical storms,"" he added. Four ways climate change links to extreme weather More than 90% of the deaths related to weather disasters have occurred in developing countries. The biggest killers have been droughts, responsible for 650,000 deaths; while at the other end of the scale, extreme temperatures took nearly 56,000 lives. But over the 50-year period, the overall death toll from disasters fell rapidly. ""Behind the stark statistics lies a message of hope,"" said Prof Taalas. ""Improved multi-hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in mortality. Quite simply, we are better than ever before at saving lives."" While more people have been saved in the face of an increasing number of extremes, the economic toll has mounted. Reported losses in the decade between 2010-2019 were around $383m per day, a seven-fold increase on the $49m per day between 1970-1979. The town of Kingswood in Texas was hit badly by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 Three of the extreme events with the biggest financial impact all occurred in the same year - 2017. It saw Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma hit the US. Taken together, the economic impact of the three accounted for 35% of the total losses from the top 10 disasters between 1970 and 2019. The atlas points out that, while improvements in warning systems are helping to save lives, there is much more work to be done. Only half of the 193 countries that are members of the WMO have multi-hazard early warning systems in place. The aftermath of Hurricane Irma, which brought devastation to parts of the Caribbean and the US in 2017 There are also huge gaps in weather and hydrological observing networks in Africa, some parts of Latin America and among island states in the Pacific and Caribbean. ""More lives are being saved thanks to early warning systems but it is also true that the number of people exposed to disaster risk is increasing due to population growth in hazard-exposed areas and the growing intensity and frequency of weather events,"" said Mami Mizutori, special representative of the UN's Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction. ""More international cooperation is needed to tackle the chronic problem of huge numbers of people being displaced each year by floods, storms and drought. ""We need greater investment in comprehensive disaster risk management, ensuring that climate change adaptation is integrated in national and local disaster risk-reduction strategies,"" she said.

Shortages force JoJo Maman Bebe to hike prices,"JoJo Maman Bebe is raising prices for the first time in about five years due to widespread supply chain issues. The baby clothing and goods retailer said it had seen shipping costs quadruple in recent months. Its commercial director, Gwynn Milligan, said: ""We've had no choice but to pass on some of these costs to our customers."" Price hikes will not be uniform across the board, but will depend on each item and what it is made up of. Ms Milligan told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the firm had seen increases in the cost of raw materials such as wood, paper and plastics, for example, which may affect items such as its toys or changing mats. She added that the company was also having to absorb increased costs on some products, because of  competition from retail rivals. Shopping bills set to rise this autumn, says BRC How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Price rises cool amid clothes and shoe discounting ""We've looked at prices across our competitors and also what customers realistically want to pay. ""There's no set increase in any area, but it depends on what we've looked at and what's going on in that sector."" While the retailer does not believe that price increases will be sustained, it did point to problems with deliveries too - largely down to a shortage of lorry drivers at ports and difficulties in obtaining shipping containers. Ms Milligan said: ""We're advising customers not to panic because we've increased our orders to deal with the ever-growing demand of JoJo."" The baby goods retailer said it was expecting a 'bigger' Christmas than last year Customers have already starting planning their Christmas buys, according to the retailer. The term ""Christmas"" was the third-highest search on its website last week, and it believes that spending will be higher due to lockdown restrictions hampering festive plans for many people in the UK last December. It comes as the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned that price increases could last into the winter months. According to new figures released by the trade body and market research firm Nielsen, retail prices in August saw a slight increase on the previous month. Some non-food categories, such as electricals, reported sharp rises in inflation compared with last year due to ""global issues from delayed shipping and shortages of microchips"". While overall retail prices fell 0.8% year-on-year, Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said: ""There are some modest indications that rising costs are starting to filter through into product prices."" Retailers such as Tesco and Aldi have increased wages for lorry drivers amid shortages. She warned: ""Low prices are already under threat, and now the HGV driver shortage has created an additional problem with a shortfall of 90,000 drivers."" The BRC issued a warning on lorry driver shortageswith Logistics UK in August saying that while Brexit and Covid-19 caused many to leave the UK, a temporary visa for drivers from the European Union could lure them back. On Wednesday, Ms Dickinson said in the run-up to the key Christmas trading period customers may see reduced choice or higher prices for their presents of choice and she called on the government to increase the number of HGV driving tests taking place. ""Without government action, it will be the British consumers who will pay the price."" The government has slightly relaxed the Drivers' Hours rules, which means drivers will be able to increase their daily driving limit from nine hours to 11 hours twice a week. Companies such asTescoandAldi,externalhave also increased wages for HGV drivers, or have started to offer sign-on bonuses.

What next for Afghanistan?,"Fighting has been going on for 40 years - most Afghans can't remember a time of peace After 20 years of war, the Taliban has swept to victory in Afghanistan. The group completedtheir shockingly rapid advance across the countryby capturing Kabul on 15 August. It came after foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan following a deal between the US and the Taliban, two decades after US forces removed the militants from power in 2001. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people and displaced millions. Taliban forces have pledged not to allow Afghanistan to become a base for terrorists who could threaten the West. But questions are already being asked about how the group will govern the country, and what their rule means for women, human rights, and political freedoms. Back in 2001, the US was responding tothe 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington, in which nearly 3,000 people were killed. Officials identified Islamist militant group al-Qaeda, and its leader Osama Bin Laden, as responsible. Bin Laden was in Afghanistan, under the protection of the Taliban, the Islamists who had been in power since 1996. When they refused to hand him over, the US intervened militarily, quickly removing the Taliban and vowing to support democracy and eliminate the terrorist threat. The Afghan conflict became America's longest war The militants slipped away and later regrouped. Nato allies had joined the US and a new Afghan government took over in 2004 but deadly Taliban attacks continued. President Barack Obama's ""troop surge"" in 2009 helped push back the Taliban but it was not long term. In 2014, at the end of what was the bloodiest year since 2001, Nato's international forces ended their combat mission, leaving responsibility for security to the Afghan army. That gave the Taliban momentum and they seized more territory. Peace talks between the US and the Taliban started tentatively, with the Afghan government pretty much uninvolved, and the agreement on a withdrawal came in February 2020 in Qatar. The US-Taliban deal did not stop the Taliban attacks - they switched their focus instead to Afghan security forces and civilians, and targeted assassinations. Their areas of control grew. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance. They emerged in the civil war that followed the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, predominantly in the south-west and the Pakistan border areas. This video can not be played Full interview: Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen speaks to the BBC's Yalda Hakim They vowed to fight corruption and improve security, but also followed an austere form of Islam. By 1998, they had taken control of almost all of the country. What has the conflict cost the US? In numbers: Life in Afghanistan as US leaves Who's who in the Taliban leadership When the BBC visited the Taliban They enforced their own hardline version of Sharia, or Islamic law, and introduced brutal punishments. Men were made to grow beards and women had to wear the all-covering burka. TV, music and cinema were banned. After their overthrow they regrouped in Pakistani border areas. In terms of lives lost, it is obviously not easy to say exactly. The number of coalition casualties is much better recorded than Taliban and Afghan civilians. Research by Brown University estimates losses in the Afghan security forces at 69,000. It puts the number of civilians and militants killed at about 51,000 each. More than 3,500 coalition soldiers have died since 2001 - about two-thirds of them Americans. More than 20,000 US soldiers have been injured. According to the UN, Afghanistan has the third-largest displaced population in the world. Since 2012, some five million people have fled and not been able to return home, either displaced within Afghanistan or taking refuge in neighbouring countries. Brown University research also puts the US spending on the conflict - including military and reconstruction funds in both Afghanistan and Pakistan - at $978bn (Â£706bn) up to 2020. How the Taliban plan to govern Afghanistan remains unclear. Women face an uncertain future. Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen says the group will respect the rights of women and minorities ""as per Afghan norms and Islamic values"". The militants had declared an amnesty across Afghanistan and said it wanted women to join its government. But there are fears over women's freedom to work, to dress as they choose, or even to leave home alone under Taliban rule. During the 1990s the Taliban forced women to dress in certain ways and denied them equal rights Another major fear is that the country will once again become a training ground for terrorism. Taliban officials insist that they will fully adhere to the US deal and prevent any group from using Afghan soil as a base for attacks against the US and its allies. They say they aim only to implement an ""Islamic government"" and will not pose a threat to any other country. But many analysts say the Taliban and al-Qaeda are inseparable, with the latter's fighters heavily embedded and engaged in training activity. It is also important to remember that the Taliban are not a centralised and unified force. Some leaders may want to keep the West muted by not stirring up trouble but hardliners may be reluctant to break links with al-Qaeda. Just how powerful al-Qaeda is and whether it could now rebuild its global network is also unclear. Then there is the regional branch of the Islamic State group - ISKP (Khorasan Province) - which the Taliban oppose. Like al-Qaeda, ISKP has been degraded by the US and Nato but could use the post-withdrawal period to regroup. Its fighter numbers could be only between a few hundred and 2,000 but it may try to gain footholds in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and parts of Tajikistan, which could be a serious regional concern.

Fleeing the Taliban into Pakistan,"Women and children look exhausted as they wait in the heat With the Taliban taking control of Afghanistan, thousands have fled their homes in fear. While much of the attention has focused on the crowds thronging Kabul airport, thousands of others have fled to neighbouring Pakistan over the Chaman border. Shumaila Jaffery speaks to some of them. The Chaman Spin Boldak border is one of the busiest crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan with thousands of traders and travellers passing through this dusty town every day. But these days, the traffic from the Afghan side is particularly high as thousands flee possible persecution by the Taliban. From dawn till dusk they pour in - hundreds of men with luggage on their shoulders, burqa-clad women walking briskly behind their men, children clinging to their mothers, exhausted in the scorching heat, and even patients pushed on wheelbarrows. Zirqoon Bibi*, a 57-year-old woman belonging to the minority Hazara community, has only just arrived in Pakistan when I meet her. The Hazara group has been persecuted by the Taliban in the past, witha recent brutal attack on some men of the communityreigniting fears of what Taliban rule would look like for them. ""My heart is burning (with pain)"" she repeatedly sobs when I ask how she is. ""I ask myself what will become of my son, my only son"". Taliban 'tortured and massacred' Afghan men Her son, who works for a British company, has been trying to leave the country without success. She says she already lost her daughter-in-law to a bomb blast by the Taliban targeting the Hazara community a few years ago. ""I felt so lost (after her death) that I couldn't sleep for a long time. The Taliban are terrible people, I am scared of them"". Before arriving in Pakistan, Zirqoon Bibi was housed in a small makeshift camp on the border with around 24 other Hazara women and children from different parts of Afghanistan. She left her home in the capital Kabul along with her two daughters and granddaughter. As she speaks, her granddaughter sits on her lap, completely oblivious to the fact that she has no home now. ""I don't care about my house or our belongings, I am only worried for my son and his daughter,"" Zirqoon Bibi says while gently massaging the child's shoulders. ""Where can I go? what can I do? I have put this girl's mother in the grave with my own hands. It takes a lot of effort and love to raise children, I can't lose another one"". A country abandoned: John Simpson on Afghanistan Black Hawks and Humvees: Taliban's military gains Zarmeeney Begum*, a 60-year-old Afghan who is a Shia Muslim, has also just arrived with a group of other women. Shia Muslims in Afghanistan have been targeted by the Taliban in the past. She says when her community received news of the Taliban takeover, they felt they had no option but to leave Afghanistan. Elderly people and patients were transported in wheelbarrows ""We fear the Taliban will resume their acts of terrorism again. They will conduct raids on our houses. They are already looking for government officials. We feel that bombings may start any day,"" she says. Many of the new arrivals are young Afghan men and women who feel that their futures have now become uncertain. Among them is Muhammad Ahmer* who was studying and working as an English language instructor in Kabul. He is still in disbelief over how quickly Kabul fell. ""It was so unbelievable. To be honest, we didn't know they would take all of Kabul in just one night. But I was only scared about my school and my education,"" he said. He said he currently doesn't know what to do next, but is certain that his future doesn't belong to Afghanistan under the current rule. ""I want to make my own choices in life, I want freedom, so I am not going back."" Business is bad and unemployment rates are through the roof, said some who are migrating to find work in Pakistan Jamal Khan*, also a student in Kabul, has similar sentiments. ""Everybody wants to live in their homes, but we were forced to leave Afghanistan. We are not feeling good about migrating to Pakistan or other countries, all people are worried, but they don't have any hope,"" he says. Others say there is no hope of survival under the Taliban. Obaidullah*, a labourer from Kandahar says he decided to flee to Pakistan because ""businesses are destroyed, there is no government and the economy is in complete shambles"". ""The situation in Kandahar is normal, but there is no work, I have come here so I can find some work, I will probably drive a rickshaw,"" he said. Meanwhile, the Taliban has been trying to portray a more restrained image since its takeover. This is reflected in the stance of one foot soldier who stops to talk to us at the border. He insists the situation is completely peaceful now and says the ""trauma of the Afghan people will end as soon as foreign occupation forces leave the country"". ""It's only a trust issue, people will soon know that we mean what we have promised,"" he adds. Thousands cross the Chaman Spin Boldak every day, but the influx from Afghanistan has been exceptionally high since the Taliban took over But even as people pour in, they say these words mean little. ""The Taliban may act differently this time, but people who have suffered from their hands in the past are not ready to trust them yet,"" says Mr Ahmer. They flee even though they know their futures are uncertain. The desperate scramble to escape Afghanistan Pakistan is already hosting millions of Afghans and says it cannot deal with another influx. Many believe it's only a matter of time before Islamabad completely halts their entry. The Pakistan government has already said that unlike the 1980s, when millions of Afghans came over following the Soviet invasion, this time refugee camps would be set up on the borders and Afghans would not be allowed into the heartland. So far however, people are free to enter the country through the Chaman Spin Boldak border. But they understand the window is small, so they are willing to take any risk to get out. Where they can go after that remains to be seen. *Names have been changed to protect identities A country abandoned: John Simpson on Afghanistan Taliban 'tortured and massacred' Afghan men Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Donald Trump spared prison or fine as judge sentences him in historic case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"New eco-petrol baffles a quarter of motoristsE10 is set to become the new standard petrol, but 24% of drivers are unaware of it, says the RAC.Business","A more eco-friendly petrol is coming to British filling stations this month, but a quarter of drivers do not know whether their cars can run on it, new research says. The government intends to make E10 the new standard petrol grade. It contains less carbon than other motor fuels and more ethanol, a kind of alcohol manufactured from plants. But according to the RAC, 24% of motorists are unaware of it, while 27% do not know if their car is compatible. Current petrol grades in the UK - known as E5 - contain up to 5% ethanol, with the other 95% being regular unleaded petrol. Their replacement, E10, will see this percentage increased to 10% - a proportion that would bring the UK in line with countries such as Belgium, Finland, France and Germany. What is E10 petrol and can my car run it? Shell sets out carbon neutral plans Introducing E10 could cut carbon emissions by 750,000 tonnes a year, says the Department for Transport, the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off the road and an important step towards the government's climate change targets. The new fuel is being rolled out everywhere in the UK except Northern Ireland, where it is not due to arrive until early 2022. Every petrol vehicle built after 2011 should accept E10. But it will not be compatible with some older vehicles - as many as 600,000 of those currently on UK roads, the RAC estimates. The introduction of E10 fuel comes after the government announced new climate change commitments in a bid for the UKto cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035. Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions and the Earth is now in a period of rapid climate change, with global temperatures rising because of human activities, such as the burning of coal, oil and gas. Reducing the impact of climate change and hitting carbon emissions targets will require more electric cars, low-carbon heating, renewable electricity and, for many, cutting down on meat and dairy products, scientists say. This video can not be played What is climate change? The government has set upa website,externalwhere drivers can check whether their car will run on E10 fuel. But it warns it will not be liable for any damage to vehicles as a result of drivers using its checker - especially if their car has been fitted with replacement parts. The RAC said 26% of drivers surveyed had already checked online, with a further 15% saying they had found their car was compatible by another means. Those with incompatible vehicles will have to use E5 super unleaded instead, which the RAC says can cost 12p a litre more than standard unleaded. According to its survey, 59% of drivers who know their cars are incompatible with E10 are worried about the higher cost of filling up, while 20% fear mistakenly filling their tanks with E10. RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes said E10 petrol had already started appearing on forecourts to replace the old E5 blend and the process would continue ""at pace"" in coming weeks. He said that while it would make no difference to ""the vast majority"" of petrol car drivers, a ""sizeable minority"" would be adversely affected. ""Drivers who will continue to rely on E5 will also need to make sure the filling station they're visiting stocks the fuel in the first place, or risk running out of fuel and having to call on their breakdown provider,"" he added. ""We'd also like to remind owners of classic cars that need to be careful not to accidentally top up with E10 and then leave it sat unused in the tank for long periods, something which can lead to expensive damaged plastics, metals and seals."" In another development, oil giant Shell announced on Wednesday it was aiming to install 50,000 charging points on Britain's streets by 2025, as part of a government-backed push to increase electric vehicle numbers and reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Shell will roll out the charging points through on-street charging point company Ubitricity, which it acquired in February. The government hasestimated,externalthat the UK will need between 280,000 and 480,000 charging points by 2030, the year it plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Shell said it would support local authorities financially to install more on-street chargers in towns and cities. David Bunch, Shell's UK country chairman, said: ""It's vital to speed up the pace of EV charger installation across the UK and this aim and financing offer is designed to help achieve that. ""Whether at home, at work or on-the-go, we want to give drivers across the UK accessible EV charging options, so that more drivers can switch to electric."" Shell currently has 60,000 charging points globally, but plans to increase that number to 500,000 by 2025 and to 2.5 million by 2030. What is E10 petrol and can my car run on it?

Wales considers U-turn on private Covid travel testsA ban on travellers using non-NHS coronavirus tests could be scrapped by the Welsh government.Wales politics'A drugs gang made life like a horror movie'Joy Jones's quiet cul-de-sac became home to drug dealers and their customers.Wales,"People returning to Wales are currently required to use NHS PCR tests at Â£68 each A ban on travellers using private Covid tests when returning from abroad could be scrapped by the Welsh government. Rules say travellers from Wales should use NHS tests, costing Â£68 each, when going abroad or face a Â£1,000 fine. First Minister Mark Drakeford had said in July he had""no plans"" to changeWales' preferred approach of using NHS tests as theWelsh government was advising against foreign travel. But a Welsh government spokesman has said the policy is now being reviewed. The statement followed a BBC Wales investigation that found Welsh travellers had been able to use private PCR tests without facing any repercussions. What are the holiday rules for travel? How do I get my free Covid tests? Watchdog will look at Covid test cost immediately Wales is now the only UK nation requiring those who have been abroad to use NHS PCR tests on day two of their return - and day eight if unvaccinated - at a cost of Â£68 each. The Scottish government announced last Friday that it would follow England and Northern Ireland in allowing travellers to use PCR tests provided by private companies on their return from international travel. Mr Drakeford said in July thatthere were ""good reasons""why the more expensive NHS test is preferable and guarantees variants from abroad can be ""spotted quickly"". ""I don't intend to divert the activities of my officials into making it easier for people to do something that the Welsh government so clearly thinks is unadvisable,"" he said. Conservative MP David TC Davies last week called for Wales' Labour government to change the rules so thattravellers could ""shop around"" for PCR testsoffered by private companies, which can be cheaper, but says that this should not happen by the back door. Mr Davies, a UK government Wales Office minister, said: ""No-one is allowed to break the rules. Although I'm not happy with the situation in Wales, people have to follow Welsh rules."" In July Mark Drakeford said there were ""no plans"" to change the policy Earlier this month, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) announced areview into the Covid testing system for travellersafter complaints about pricing and performance among some private providers in England. A number of Welsh travellers have told BBC Wales they have used private PCR tests without any issues. The Welsh government has said anyone who arrives in Wales and has booked tests with a private test provider could still face a fine of Â£1,000. The cost of an NHS test is set by the UK government. Ithas been reducedfrom Â£88 for a single test to Â£68, but in England people can choose between private providers and could pay less than Â£50 per test. Anyone over the age of 11 must have proof of a negative coronavirus test before they travel to Wales from overseas,with some exemptions,external. All travellers aged five and over must have a post-arrival testing package booked before they return to Wales. Those travelling to Wales from green-list countries need to take a PCR test on day two after arrival, even if their flight or ferry arrived in England, and do not need to isolate. People who are fully vaccinated and have travelled from an amber country to Wales, also need to take a PCR test on day two of quarantine and do not need to isolate. People travelling from an amber country who are not fully vaccinated will need to take another test on day eight and must isolate for 10 days. If you have visited or passed through a red-list country you will only be able to enter Wales via a designated port of entry in England or Scotland. You will need to take a PCR on days two and eight of isolation and quarantine for 10 days in a managed quarantine hotel. One of the private companies identified by users, Randox, has four drop off points across south Wales where people can return their tests. There have been complaints about some private providers in England One of Randox's boxes is based outside the Vivo Clinic in Cardiff whose web page, before being contacted by BBC Wales, offered customers the option to ""book your day two and day eight PCR tests at our Cardiff clinic"", adding it was a ""government listed PCR test provider in partnership with Randox"". The Vivo Clinic said it is a ""national company offering testing services in a sector where guidance is continually changing. Cost of travellers' PCR tests in Wales criticised People 'snapping up' post-Covid bucket list trips Holiday let firms 'blown away' by surge in demand ""However, the accusation of not following Welsh rules is unfair and unjust,"" said a spokesperson. ""Many of our clients cross the English/Welsh border on a daily basis and for some clients they may be based in England but their nearest clinic is in Wales. ""Due to such a high demand for PCR testing services along the English/Welsh border, we offer all services in Bristol, Cardiff and Swansea to give customers more choice of where to go for their pre/post travel tests. ""Our website does make it clear that all customers must check their own local guidance to ensure they are undertaking the correct tests based on these requirements. A Randox drop off box outside the Vivo Clinic in Cardiff ""Nevertheless, at this current stage we have removed day 2/8 testing from our Welsh clinics until we receive further guidance on policy and protocol."" Welsh Conservatives health spokesman Russell George said ""Labour's monopoly system"" on tests had meant ""only the wealthiest in Wales can afford to go away this summer, which isn't right or fair"". ""I'm pleased that the minister will be working with the British government to see what can be learnt and gained from having more than one supplier of PCR tests available, as their job is to make it easier, not harder, for people to enjoy a holiday."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We continue to review the position with regard to private testing in Wales and are working with the UK government to ensure that only those companies who achieve mutually agreed standards are allowed to provide tests. ""It is critical any positive cases and harmful variants are identified at the earliest opportunity. ""For this reason, for the time being, we require the tests to be provided by the NHS, so that we can identify positive cases as quickly as possible for our Test, Trace, Protect system to follow up.""

'A drugs gang made life like a horror movie'Joy Jones's quiet cul-de-sac became home to drug dealers and their customers.Wales,"This video can not be played ""It changed the way we lived, it got quite frightening"" A chainsaw slices through the front door of a terraced home. It's a quiet cul-de-sac, on a new-ish estate, in a small, rural town in mid Wales. Three doors away, for a brief moment Joy Jones tenses up. What fresh grief can the residents of this property be bringing to her street? What she sees sends her running upstairs in delight. From the bedroom window she can see a street full of police, and her phone starts pinging with messages from neighbours. ""Everyone was shouting at each other and celebrating, the relief was unbelievable."" The police were finallyarresting the drugs gangthat had blighted their lives for nearly a year. Ms Jones has lived on the estate for over 20 years, raised her children there and sat on the county council. But she could not stop the damage the gang inflicted on her neighbourhood. ""It changed the way we lived, it got quite frightening,"" she said. People would turn up at the house day and night - buying, seeking or moving drugs. Couriers - some just teenagers - would use one of a number of pedal bikes left on the front lawn to play their part in the sale and distribution of heroin and cocaine within the town. ""It was just horrible, it was like living in some kind of horror movie. It got so bad we would stay away from our home because we just couldn't bear to be here,"" she said. And then there was the whistling. ""It was something they did when they were letting each other know something was going on, it seemed to be some kind of code,"" explained Ms Jones. It was a stark contrast to the quiet, friendly neighbourhood she knew before. Â£1.1m heroin and cocaine trafficking gang jailed Final heroin and cocaine drugs gang member jailed The estate is a mix of privately owned homes and housing association properties. When Anthony Butterworth first moved in things were fine, said Ms Jones, but when someone else moved in with him, it became a lot busier. She estimates that in a 24-hour period, 50 people or more would visit the house. ""We'd see youngsters turning up, they'd knock the door, pick up a bike from the front lawn and disappear. ""We realised quite early on it was drugs being dealt there, but not the severity and the quantities."" Joy Jones said the ""relief was incredible"" when arrests were made The house was being used by a Liverpool drugs gang as their safe house, where heroin and crack cocaine would be stored before being distributed in the town. Just over an hour from Wrexham, less than two to Birmingham, with a population of about 12,000, it faced the same drugs problems as bigger towns and cities. ""It is rife within our communities,"" said Det Insp Gareth Grant. At the time of the arrests he was head of Dyfed-Powys Police's serious and organised crime team - the unit charged with investigating the drugs that were infiltrating rural Powys. ""For the size of these towns, it was a major problem."" Det Insp Gareth Grant was head of Dyfed-Powys Police's serious and organised crime team during the operation It's not a new phenomenon. Just like a legal business, drugs gangs expand their operation, and seek out the profits to be made in smaller towns and communities. But today you're more likely to hear it described as county lines. And unlike the legal retail sector, violence will be used to drive out local dealers, while children or vulnerable adults will be threatened and coerced into transporting drugs and collecting payment. So the risks are kept at arm's length from the gang and dealers make the sale remotely, using dedicated mobile phones. ""You had one individual working along the county lines model, embedded in that house with a vulnerable individual who lived there previously,"" explains Det Insp Grant. ""They would then send out messages and then the drugs would be taken from there for onward supply to individuals around the town."" Eighteen members of the gang were convicted At the trial, Butterworth's barrister said the 52-year-old's involvement in the conspiracy to supply the Class A drugs had been relatively short-lived. The gang only moved into his house when the electricity was cut off at the previous house they had been using. Prior to that he had convictions for cannabis possession. The judge in the case acknowledged Butterworth had his own vulnerabilities, but he did not feel the gang had coerced him into working for them. During the trial, the court heard over the space of 12 months, police received 46 calls about activity in and around Butterworth's house - which did not go unnoticed. On the ground, officers targeted drug movement and sales with stop checks and searches but work was also done to get the community on board and increase calls to 999, as well as protecting others at risk of having their homes taken over by dealers. Meanwhile, 80 miles away at Dyfed-Powys Police headquarters, the serious and organised crime team had been tasked with investigating the bigger issue of heroin and crack cocaine being shipped into two mid Wales towns. Det Insp Grant had a core team of eight full-time detectives. He said they were arresting people throughout the duration of an 18-month investigation but they knew expectations were low. ""Right at the start I'm not sure the communities were assured we were going to have the impact we knew we could have,"" he said. He was all too aware of the impact the drugs were having. ""It ruins the lives of the individuals taking the drugs, has a massive impact on their families, but ultimately it has a massive impact on the communities because of the associated crime trends we tend to see with this type of drug use. ""You'll see a massive rise in antisocial behaviour, associated thefts, violence, robberies etc they can all play a part in drug use."" He would not reveal the covert techniques used as part of the operation, but by the time they reached the arrest phase, 40 to 50 officers were involved. ""Over a million pounds worth of drugs were seized, we've now convicted 20 individuals of drug dealing offences, and they've been jailed for a total of 150 years. ""We were able to go quite a way up the chain in this investigation."" It is something the judge in the case acknowledged - praising the force for not being content targeting only the user or street dealer but ""the source"". The leaders of the conspiracy, Jack Ross, Karl O'Hara, Michael Williams, Ryan Langshaw and Daniel Putterill, all from Liverpool, were sentenced to a total of 47 years for the supply of Class A drugs into Newtown and Llandrindod Wells. Anthony Butterworth received five years for conspiracy to supply drugs and died in prison last year. The property that was used by the gang is still boarded up It depends who you ask. For Ms Jones and her neighbours - the difference was obvious and ""it's wonderful"". The force have said since 2019 no county line has been identified in the region. Det Insp Grant said: ""It is one of our biggest challenges that when we conclude one investigation the big thing for us is trying to prevent something getting as much of a problem again - and it is very difficult. ""What we will have then is people trying to establish themselves as the new drug dealers within those towns. It's up to us - along with a multi agency plan - to have something in place where we can try and prevent these problems escalating."" In practical terms, that means making arrests the minute new dealers emerge - so other gangs cannot fill the void created. ""But it'll certainly make a big difference for a town this size for quite a considerable amount of time,"" he said. Barry Eveleigh says more money needs to go into treating drug addiction Barry Eveleigh, from drug and alcohol charity Kaleidoscope, said the arrests had not made much difference as ""markets are replaced pretty quickly"". He said: ""If anything you find the purity goes down, prices go up and potentially people have to commit more crime in order to fund the same habit. ""You want a substitute, which is what treatment services can offer. But by and large that doesn't happen."" ""On average we might see someone twice a month - how can you change somebody that's been addicted to heroin for 10 years just by seeing them for an hour, twice a month? It's very, very difficult."" He said the violence associated with drugs was also an issue, but he said: ""I don't want to start panicking people that Newtown is a place that's rife with drugs, knives and violence. ""It's just a small undercurrent that generally doesn't spill out into the wider community. But when it does it can be quite serious.""

"Weather-related disasters increase five-foldFloods, storms and extreme events increase five-fold but the number of people dying in them fell.Science & EnvironmentNew eco-petrol baffles a quarter of motoristsE10 is set to become the new standard petrol, but 24% of drivers are unaware of it, says the RAC.Business","The number of weather-related disasters to hit the world has increased five-fold over the past 50 years, says the World Meteorological Organization. However, the number of deaths because of the greater number of storms, floods and droughts has fallen sharply. Scientists say that climate change, more extreme weather and better reporting are behind the rise in these extreme events. But improvements to warning systems have helped limit the number of deaths. Queen to attend COP26 climate conference in Glasgow Europe's 2020 heat reached 'troubling' level How much can wetlands protect from coastal flooding? As global temperatures have risen in recent decades, there has been a significant uptick in the number of disasters related to weather and water extremes. In the 50 years between 1970 and 2019, there were more than 11,000 such disasters, according to a newatlas,externalfrom the WMO that charts the scale of these events. Flooding in Bangladesh has taken a huge toll in lives and economic damage over recent decades Over two million people died as a result of these hazards, with economic losses amounting to $3.64 trillion. ""The number of weather, climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Prof Petteri Taalas. ""That means more heatwaves, drought and forest fires such as those we have observed recently in Europe and North America. We have more water vapour in the atmosphere, which is exacerbating extreme rainfall and deadly flooding. The warming of the oceans has affected the frequency and area of existence of the most intense tropical storms,"" he added. Four ways climate change links to extreme weather More than 90% of the deaths related to weather disasters have occurred in developing countries. The biggest killers have been droughts, responsible for 650,000 deaths; while at the other end of the scale, extreme temperatures took nearly 56,000 lives. But over the 50-year period, the overall death toll from disasters fell rapidly. ""Behind the stark statistics lies a message of hope,"" said Prof Taalas. ""Improved multi-hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in mortality. Quite simply, we are better than ever before at saving lives."" While more people have been saved in the face of an increasing number of extremes, the economic toll has mounted. Reported losses in the decade between 2010-2019 were around $383m per day, a seven-fold increase on the $49m per day between 1970-1979. The town of Kingswood in Texas was hit badly by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 Three of the extreme events with the biggest financial impact all occurred in the same year - 2017. It saw Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma hit the US. Taken together, the economic impact of the three accounted for 35% of the total losses from the top 10 disasters between 1970 and 2019. The atlas points out that, while improvements in warning systems are helping to save lives, there is much more work to be done. Only half of the 193 countries that are members of the WMO have multi-hazard early warning systems in place. The aftermath of Hurricane Irma, which brought devastation to parts of the Caribbean and the US in 2017 There are also huge gaps in weather and hydrological observing networks in Africa, some parts of Latin America and among island states in the Pacific and Caribbean. ""More lives are being saved thanks to early warning systems but it is also true that the number of people exposed to disaster risk is increasing due to population growth in hazard-exposed areas and the growing intensity and frequency of weather events,"" said Mami Mizutori, special representative of the UN's Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction. ""More international cooperation is needed to tackle the chronic problem of huge numbers of people being displaced each year by floods, storms and drought. ""We need greater investment in comprehensive disaster risk management, ensuring that climate change adaptation is integrated in national and local disaster risk-reduction strategies,"" she said.

"New eco-petrol baffles a quarter of motoristsE10 is set to become the new standard petrol, but 24% of drivers are unaware of it, says the RAC.BusinessWeather-related disasters increase five-foldFloods, storms and extreme events increase five-fold but the number of people dying in them fell.Science & Environment","A more eco-friendly petrol is coming to British filling stations this month, but a quarter of drivers do not know whether their cars can run on it, new research says. The government intends to make E10 the new standard petrol grade. It contains less carbon than other motor fuels and more ethanol, a kind of alcohol manufactured from plants. But according to the RAC, 24% of motorists are unaware of it, while 27% do not know if their car is compatible. Current petrol grades in the UK - known as E5 - contain up to 5% ethanol, with the other 95% being regular unleaded petrol. Their replacement, E10, will see this percentage increased to 10% - a proportion that would bring the UK in line with countries such as Belgium, Finland, France and Germany. What is E10 petrol and can my car run it? Shell sets out carbon neutral plans Introducing E10 could cut carbon emissions by 750,000 tonnes a year, says the Department for Transport, the equivalent of taking 350,000 cars off the road and an important step towards the government's climate change targets. The new fuel is being rolled out everywhere in the UK except Northern Ireland, where it is not due to arrive until early 2022. Every petrol vehicle built after 2011 should accept E10. But it will not be compatible with some older vehicles - as many as 600,000 of those currently on UK roads, the RAC estimates. The introduction of E10 fuel comes after the government announced new climate change commitments in a bid for the UKto cut carbon emissions by 78% by 2035. Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions and the Earth is now in a period of rapid climate change, with global temperatures rising because of human activities, such as the burning of coal, oil and gas. Reducing the impact of climate change and hitting carbon emissions targets will require more electric cars, low-carbon heating, renewable electricity and, for many, cutting down on meat and dairy products, scientists say. This video can not be played What is climate change? The government has set upa website,externalwhere drivers can check whether their car will run on E10 fuel. But it warns it will not be liable for any damage to vehicles as a result of drivers using its checker - especially if their car has been fitted with replacement parts. The RAC said 26% of drivers surveyed had already checked online, with a further 15% saying they had found their car was compatible by another means. Those with incompatible vehicles will have to use E5 super unleaded instead, which the RAC says can cost 12p a litre more than standard unleaded. According to its survey, 59% of drivers who know their cars are incompatible with E10 are worried about the higher cost of filling up, while 20% fear mistakenly filling their tanks with E10. RAC head of policy Nicholas Lyes said E10 petrol had already started appearing on forecourts to replace the old E5 blend and the process would continue ""at pace"" in coming weeks. He said that while it would make no difference to ""the vast majority"" of petrol car drivers, a ""sizeable minority"" would be adversely affected. ""Drivers who will continue to rely on E5 will also need to make sure the filling station they're visiting stocks the fuel in the first place, or risk running out of fuel and having to call on their breakdown provider,"" he added. ""We'd also like to remind owners of classic cars that need to be careful not to accidentally top up with E10 and then leave it sat unused in the tank for long periods, something which can lead to expensive damaged plastics, metals and seals."" In another development, oil giant Shell announced on Wednesday it was aiming to install 50,000 charging points on Britain's streets by 2025, as part of a government-backed push to increase electric vehicle numbers and reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. Shell will roll out the charging points through on-street charging point company Ubitricity, which it acquired in February. The government hasestimated,externalthat the UK will need between 280,000 and 480,000 charging points by 2030, the year it plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Shell said it would support local authorities financially to install more on-street chargers in towns and cities. David Bunch, Shell's UK country chairman, said: ""It's vital to speed up the pace of EV charger installation across the UK and this aim and financing offer is designed to help achieve that. ""Whether at home, at work or on-the-go, we want to give drivers across the UK accessible EV charging options, so that more drivers can switch to electric."" Shell currently has 60,000 charging points globally, but plans to increase that number to 500,000 by 2025 and to 2.5 million by 2030. What is E10 petrol and can my car run on it?

India avoided a strict lockdown even as cases reached record levels in spring The economy in Indiarebounded at a record rateeven while a devastating wave of Covid-19 cases hit the country. While nations around the world sent aid and oxygen to struggling hospitals in India, the government declined to implement the same tight pandemic restrictions as it did in 2020. It meant businesses were less affected and gross domestic product grew by 20.1% from April to June compared with a year earlier. At the peak in May, there were more than 400,000 daily infections while deaths reached 4,000 a day. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has prioritised investment in infrastructure, privatisation of state-owned businesses and tax reforms to drive growth. But consumer spending is still lower than before the pandemic and India's economy, the third largest in Asia, remains smaller than before March 2020. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The news another 207 Covid deaths have been recorded
looks more alarming than it is. The figure has been inflated by delays reporting deaths over
the Bank Holiday weekend. On average just under 100 deaths a day are being seen. And
the figure has started falling â last week it was over 100. This was exactly where government scientists expected us to
be at this stage of the summer â and to put it in context is similar to what
would be seen during a winter flu season.  The more difficult thing to predict is what will happen in September when schools are fully open across the UK and people are back in workplaces and return to more normal behaviour and mixing patterns. Scotland, where the holiday season ends earlier, has already seen a sharp rise. If this increase is sustained and then repeated across the UK it could cause significant pressures on the NHS, not to mention pose some very difficult questions about the level of virus that we can tolerate circulating. But there is also hope the level of immunity built up will keep a lid on the virus and mean any rise in infections and serious illness is limited. Rail journeys have reached a new recent high of 66% of pre-pandemic levels,provisional statistics,externalfrom the Department for Transport show. Last week, the rail industryrevealed,externaladvance purchases of tickets for leisure journeys to seaside destinations over the bank holiday weekend were surpassing pre-pandemic levels. But overall, commuting and business journeys by rail are still
well below pre-pandemic levels and rail industry revenue is just 59% of that
seen in 2019, research by WPI Economics for the Rail Delivery
Group shows. Jacqueline Starr, chief executive of the Rail Delivery
Group, says: âItâs great to see more and more daytrippers and
staycationers travelling by train to see the people and places they love as
life gets back on track, whether thatâs a seaside trip, a night out or a
shopping spree. ""These journeys are boosting businesses and high streets that
have struggled during the pandemic, helping to build a fair and clean economic
recovery from the pandemic.â Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The study on long Covid in children we've been discussing today was also able to provide some insight into how the
stress and strain of the pandemic and existing health may be playing a role. Those taking part were asked about their emotional health
and physical health. Older girls with poorer physical and mental health were the
group most likely to report ongoing symptoms. Overall four in 10 of everyone who took part - among both
those who tested positive and negative - reported feeling sad, worried or
unhappy. Researchers say it's clear the pandemic has had a
damaging effect on young people because of the closure of schools, not seeing
their friends and concern about the risk from the virus. They say those who have been struggling emotionally and mentally
could be more attuned to even minor physical illnesses and acknowledged a
positive Covid test could help trigger that. Dr Liz Whittaker, the Royal College of Paediatrics
and Child Health lead on infectious disease, says the evidence on how mental health has been
impacted shows how important it is to get âback to normalâ and have schools
open. Here's the daily coronavirus data from the government at a glance. The figures also show us the number of people in mechanical ventilation beds in hospital is over 1,000 for first time since 15 March. The UK has given90,994,627coronavirus vacinations according to government data. That's48,086,605first doses and42,908,022second doses. Just over156,000jabs were given yesterday -38,596first doses and117,437second. The figure of 207 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test is the highest daily total in six months. The last time the number of daily deaths recorded reached the 200s was on 9 March when the figure was 231. Today's high number could in part be attributed to the bank holiday as, like weekends, they often cause a lag in the reporting of data. The day after the previous UK-wide bank holiday, at the end of May, was the only day since the UK's first coronavirus fatality that no deaths have been recorded (1 June). But then the jump the next day was only to 12 deaths. A further 207 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the UK,according to the latest government data.,external This is the number of people who have died in the 28 days after testing positive for Covid-19. The total is now 132,742 by this measure. There were also 35,693 new coronavirus infections recorded. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon has apologised to customers after its beer supplies became the latest casualty of the UK's supply chain crunch. The hospitality giant confirmed it has seen supplies of Carling and Coors beer hit by the disruption, with some pubs not receiving deliveries. The firm did not provide further details regarding the supply issues but it is understood it is directly related to a shortage of HGV drivers. Bosses at the Road Haulage Association warned last week that there is a shortfall of around 100,000 drivers. It said this has been driven by thousands of European drivers leaving during the pandemic and not returning. Now the UK has left the EU, it is no longer part of the single market, so it is easier for European drivers to find work in the EU than in the UK. Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin has been a passionate supporter of Brexit and earlier this year denied reports that his pubs were impacted by Brexit-related staff shortages. BBC Radio 5 Live An immuno-suppressed man has spoken about his 13-year-old
daughterâs decision to have the Covid vaccine. Speaking to Nicky Campbell on 5 Live Breakfast, Mark says he believes
it comes down to who you trust in relation to vaccination. Mark says: ""We went through the risks of things, and on the balance of that risk, vaccination is a proven way of controlling disease. âWhatâs really clear is that it prevents serious illness,â
he adds. ""So, think about her first, me second."" Both of Markâs daughters, aged 13 and 17, have now had the jab. Listen to 5 Liveon the free BBC Sounds app. Allow Twitter content?

Scotland could make vaccine certificates mandatory for entry to nightclubs and other live events by next month, the first minister says. Nicola Sturgeon says the Scottish Parliament is proposing proof of vaccination for entry to:  Sturgeon says the new rules should be introduced later this month once all adults have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated. She says vaccine certification will not apply to key services such as public transport, education, access to health service or shops. She has called for a full debate a vote on vaccine certification next week. Coronavirus case levels in Scotland are 80% higher now than last week and five times higher than four weeks ago, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. She says in her Covid briefing test positivity has increased from 5% at start of August to 11.5% today. She says: ""If we are to avoid any imposition of restrictions, even in a limited way, we must all play a part to slow down transmission."" Sturgeon urges people to follow restrictions and says if they do she is hopeful Scotland will turn a corner. ""The next few days will be crucial in our assessment,"" she says. ""What is inescapably the case is that we must turn that corner and see the sharp increase in cases level off and then come down."" Police in Italy are guarding several train stations amid threats from people protesting against a new Covid pass being used in the country. The ""green pass"" is compulsory for domestic flights, ferries and long-distance or fast trains, as well as schools and universities. The increased security at stations in Rome, Florence and Rimini comes after protesters said they would disrupt high-speed trains. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio has condemned a climate of hatred over the launch of the pass - he's among several public figures to have been targeted by anti-vaccination protesters in recent days. Journalists and medical experts have also complained of being stalked, while Mr Di Maio faced death threats online. Read more here.  Plans to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs from the end of September have been met with disappointment from the nightlife industry. They fear it could lead to a rise in the number of house parties - and could lead to clubs being involved in discrimination cases. Downing Street says the government intends to continue with its plans, which have also been criticised by MPs from both Labour and its own Conservative MPs. Under the scheme, people would have to prove they're fully vaccinated before they can enter clubs and other large-scale events. Sacha Lord, night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester and co-founder of Manchester's Parklife festival, said: ""It's disappointing that despite the calls from all sides, including the industry and customers themselves, the government is continuing to move ahead with this. ""The measures will cause enormous disruption to an already struggling industry."" We're due to hear from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in about a quarter of an hour as she updates Holyrood on the pandemic in Scotland. Scotland currently has the highest rate of infection in the UK, with over 644 cases per 100,000 people. Sturgeon has suggested the return of pupils to school, earlier than in the rest of the UK, may be fuelling the rise. But we're not expecting to hear any changes to rules or restrictions from the first minister today. You'll be able to followwhat Sturgeon says in detail here, while we'll bring you the headlines from her statement. Officials will be able to make decisions about school safety on hard data, Prof Sir Terence Stephenson says Prof Sir Terence Stephenson, the lead author of the University College London study on long Covid in children, has been talking to BBC Radio 4's the World At One about its implications. He says that when they began the research in December 2020, some people were speculating that as many as half of all children who caught coronavirus would develop long Covid. The study offers reassurance that it is nowhere near that prevalent, he says, suggesting that more like one-in-seven or one-in-14 cases become long Covid. Prof Stephenson says the data should help policy-makers make decisions on issues such as school safety or the vaccination of children. ""This provides some data that allows them to make judgements and policy decisions on hard evidence, rather than speculation,"" he says. ""Itâs good that we can say itâs not overwhelming. But itâs also important to say we canât trivialise this."" There was ""no difference"" in mental health between those who contracted Covid, those who didn't, and young people surveyed over the last ten years, Prof Stephenson says. It seems young people's mental health is ""bearing up well"" in the pandemic, he says. The most common lasting symptoms were headaches, fatigue, dizziness and the loss of a sense of smell or taste. But Prof Stephenson says all of these are treatable. He says they will continue to monitor young people's health at six months, 12 months and 24 months after their positive test. More than 8,000 deaths linked to Covid-19 have now been recorded in Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics. There were 18 deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest weekly figures, one fewer than the week before. But it takes the overall total since the pandemic began to 8,002 in Wales. There has been a big decline in deaths in the third wave so far, with 102 deaths since the start of June. During the second wave in December and January, there were an average of 49 deaths a day.

"Weather-related disasters increase five-foldFloods, storms and extreme events increase five-fold but the number of people dying in them fell.","The number of weather-related disasters to hit the world has increased five-fold over the past 50 years, says the World Meteorological Organization. However, the number of deaths because of the greater number of storms, floods and droughts has fallen sharply. Scientists say that climate change, more extreme weather and better reporting are behind the rise in these extreme events. But improvements to warning systems have helped limit the number of deaths. Queen to attend COP26 climate conference in Glasgow Europe's 2020 heat reached 'troubling' level How much can wetlands protect from coastal flooding? As global temperatures have risen in recent decades, there has been a significant uptick in the number of disasters related to weather and water extremes. In the 50 years between 1970 and 2019, there were more than 11,000 such disasters, according to a newatlas,externalfrom the WMO that charts the scale of these events. Flooding in Bangladesh has taken a huge toll in lives and economic damage over recent decades Over two million people died as a result of these hazards, with economic losses amounting to $3.64 trillion. ""The number of weather, climate and water extremes are increasing and will become more frequent and severe in many parts of the world as a result of climate change,"" said WMO Secretary-General Prof Petteri Taalas. ""That means more heatwaves, drought and forest fires such as those we have observed recently in Europe and North America. We have more water vapour in the atmosphere, which is exacerbating extreme rainfall and deadly flooding. The warming of the oceans has affected the frequency and area of existence of the most intense tropical storms,"" he added. Four ways climate change links to extreme weather More than 90% of the deaths related to weather disasters have occurred in developing countries. The biggest killers have been droughts, responsible for 650,000 deaths; while at the other end of the scale, extreme temperatures took nearly 56,000 lives. But over the 50-year period, the overall death toll from disasters fell rapidly. ""Behind the stark statistics lies a message of hope,"" said Prof Taalas. ""Improved multi-hazard early warning systems have led to a significant reduction in mortality. Quite simply, we are better than ever before at saving lives."" While more people have been saved in the face of an increasing number of extremes, the economic toll has mounted. Reported losses in the decade between 2010-2019 were around $383m per day, a seven-fold increase on the $49m per day between 1970-1979. The town of Kingswood in Texas was hit badly by Hurricane Harvey in 2017 Three of the extreme events with the biggest financial impact all occurred in the same year - 2017. It saw Hurricanes Harvey, Maria and Irma hit the US. Taken together, the economic impact of the three accounted for 35% of the total losses from the top 10 disasters between 1970 and 2019. The atlas points out that, while improvements in warning systems are helping to save lives, there is much more work to be done. Only half of the 193 countries that are members of the WMO have multi-hazard early warning systems in place. The aftermath of Hurricane Irma, which brought devastation to parts of the Caribbean and the US in 2017 There are also huge gaps in weather and hydrological observing networks in Africa, some parts of Latin America and among island states in the Pacific and Caribbean. ""More lives are being saved thanks to early warning systems but it is also true that the number of people exposed to disaster risk is increasing due to population growth in hazard-exposed areas and the growing intensity and frequency of weather events,"" said Mami Mizutori, special representative of the UN's Secretary-General for Disaster Risk Reduction. ""More international cooperation is needed to tackle the chronic problem of huge numbers of people being displaced each year by floods, storms and drought. ""We need greater investment in comprehensive disaster risk management, ensuring that climate change adaptation is integrated in national and local disaster risk-reduction strategies,"" she said.

Holidaymakers have been asked to use the service only if they are travelling soon,because of technical problems. Here's our guide to proving you've been vaccinated. India avoided a strict lockdown even as cases reached record levels in spring The economy in Indiarebounded at a record rateeven while a devastating wave of Covid-19 cases hit the country. While nations around the world sent aid and oxygen to struggling hospitals in India, the government declined to implement the same tight pandemic restrictions as it did in 2020. It meant businesses were less affected and gross domestic product grew by 20.1% from April to June compared with a year earlier. At the peak in May, there were more than 400,000 daily infections while deaths reached 4,000 a day. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has prioritised investment in infrastructure, privatisation of state-owned businesses and tax reforms to drive growth. But consumer spending is still lower than before the pandemic and India's economy, the third largest in Asia, remains smaller than before March 2020. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The news another 207 Covid deaths have been recorded
looks more alarming than it is. The figure has been inflated by delays reporting deaths over
the Bank Holiday weekend. On average just under 100 deaths a day are being seen. And
the figure has started falling â last week it was over 100. This was exactly where government scientists expected us to
be at this stage of the summer â and to put it in context is similar to what
would be seen during a winter flu season.  The more difficult thing to predict is what will happen in September when schools are fully open across the UK and people are back in workplaces and return to more normal behaviour and mixing patterns. Scotland, where the holiday season ends earlier, has already seen a sharp rise. If this increase is sustained and then repeated across the UK it could cause significant pressures on the NHS, not to mention pose some very difficult questions about the level of virus that we can tolerate circulating. But there is also hope the level of immunity built up will keep a lid on the virus and mean any rise in infections and serious illness is limited. Rail journeys have reached a new recent high of 66% of pre-pandemic levels,provisional statistics,externalfrom the Department for Transport show. Last week, the rail industryrevealed,externaladvance purchases of tickets for leisure journeys to seaside destinations over the bank holiday weekend were surpassing pre-pandemic levels. But overall, commuting and business journeys by rail are still
well below pre-pandemic levels and rail industry revenue is just 59% of that
seen in 2019, research by WPI Economics for the Rail Delivery
Group shows. Jacqueline Starr, chief executive of the Rail Delivery
Group, says: âItâs great to see more and more daytrippers and
staycationers travelling by train to see the people and places they love as
life gets back on track, whether thatâs a seaside trip, a night out or a
shopping spree. ""These journeys are boosting businesses and high streets that
have struggled during the pandemic, helping to build a fair and clean economic
recovery from the pandemic.â Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The study on long Covid in children we've been discussing today was also able to provide some insight into how the
stress and strain of the pandemic and existing health may be playing a role. Those taking part were asked about their emotional health
and physical health. Older girls with poorer physical and mental health were the
group most likely to report ongoing symptoms. Overall four in 10 of everyone who took part - among both
those who tested positive and negative - reported feeling sad, worried or
unhappy. Researchers say it's clear the pandemic has had a
damaging effect on young people because of the closure of schools, not seeing
their friends and concern about the risk from the virus. They say those who have been struggling emotionally and mentally
could be more attuned to even minor physical illnesses and acknowledged a
positive Covid test could help trigger that. Dr Liz Whittaker, the Royal College of Paediatrics
and Child Health lead on infectious disease, says the evidence on how mental health has been
impacted shows how important it is to get âback to normalâ and have schools
open. Here's the daily coronavirus data from the government at a glance. The figures also show us the number of people in mechanical ventilation beds in hospital is over 1,000 for first time since 15 March. The UK has given90,994,627coronavirus vacinations according to government data. That's48,086,605first doses and42,908,022second doses. Just over156,000jabs were given yesterday -38,596first doses and117,437second. The figure of 207 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test is the highest daily total in six months. The last time the number of daily deaths recorded reached the 200s was on 9 March when the figure was 231. Today's high number could in part be attributed to the bank holiday as, like weekends, they often cause a lag in the reporting of data. The day after the previous UK-wide bank holiday, at the end of May, was the only day since the UK's first coronavirus fatality that no deaths have been recorded (1 June). But then the jump the next day was only to 12 deaths. A further 207 coronavirus deaths have been reported in the UK,according to the latest government data.,external This is the number of people who have died in the 28 days after testing positive for Covid-19. The total is now 132,742 by this measure. There were also 35,693 new coronavirus infections recorded. Pub chain JD Wetherspoon has apologised to customers after its beer supplies became the latest casualty of the UK's supply chain crunch. The hospitality giant confirmed it has seen supplies of Carling and Coors beer hit by the disruption, with some pubs not receiving deliveries. The firm did not provide further details regarding the supply issues but it is understood it is directly related to a shortage of HGV drivers. Bosses at the Road Haulage Association warned last week that there is a shortfall of around 100,000 drivers. It said this has been driven by thousands of European drivers leaving during the pandemic and not returning. Now the UK has left the EU, it is no longer part of the single market, so it is easier for European drivers to find work in the EU than in the UK. Wetherspoon founder and chairman Tim Martin has been a passionate supporter of Brexit and earlier this year denied reports that his pubs were impacted by Brexit-related staff shortages. BBC Radio 5 Live An immuno-suppressed man has spoken about his 13-year-old
daughterâs decision to have the Covid vaccine. Speaking to Nicky Campbell on 5 Live Breakfast, Mark says he believes
it comes down to who you trust in relation to vaccination. Mark says: ""We went through the risks of things, and on the balance of that risk, vaccination is a proven way of controlling disease. âWhatâs really clear is that it prevents serious illness,â
he adds. ""So, think about her first, me second."" Both of Markâs daughters, aged 13 and 17, have now had the jab. Listen to 5 Liveon the free BBC Sounds app. Allow Twitter content?

Scotland could make vaccine certificates mandatory for entry to nightclubs and other live events by next month, the first minister says. Nicola Sturgeon says the Scottish Parliament is proposing proof of vaccination for entry to:  Sturgeon says the new rules should be introduced later this month once all adults have had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated. She says vaccine certification will not apply to key services such as public transport, education, access to health service or shops. She has called for a full debate a vote on vaccine certification next week. Coronavirus case levels in Scotland are 80% higher now than last week and five times higher than four weeks ago, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. She says in her Covid briefing test positivity has increased from 5% at start of August to 11.5% today. She says: ""If we are to avoid any imposition of restrictions, even in a limited way, we must all play a part to slow down transmission."" Sturgeon urges people to follow restrictions and says if they do she is hopeful Scotland will turn a corner. ""The next few days will be crucial in our assessment,"" she says. ""What is inescapably the case is that we must turn that corner and see the sharp increase in cases level off and then come down."" Police in Italy are guarding several train stations amid threats from people protesting against a new Covid pass being used in the country. The ""green pass"" is compulsory for domestic flights, ferries and long-distance or fast trains, as well as schools and universities. The increased security at stations in Rome, Florence and Rimini comes after protesters said they would disrupt high-speed trains. Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio has condemned a climate of hatred over the launch of the pass - he's among several public figures to have been targeted by anti-vaccination protesters in recent days. Journalists and medical experts have also complained of being stalked, while Mr Di Maio faced death threats online. Read more here.  Plans to introduce vaccine passports for nightclubs from the end of September have been met with disappointment from the nightlife industry. They fear it could lead to a rise in the number of house parties - and could lead to clubs being involved in discrimination cases. Downing Street says the government intends to continue with its plans, which have also been criticised by MPs from both Labour and its own Conservative MPs. Under the scheme, people would have to prove they're fully vaccinated before they can enter clubs and other large-scale events. Sacha Lord, night-time economy adviser for Greater Manchester and co-founder of Manchester's Parklife festival, said: ""It's disappointing that despite the calls from all sides, including the industry and customers themselves, the government is continuing to move ahead with this. ""The measures will cause enormous disruption to an already struggling industry."" We're due to hear from First Minister Nicola Sturgeon in about a quarter of an hour as she updates Holyrood on the pandemic in Scotland. Scotland currently has the highest rate of infection in the UK, with over 644 cases per 100,000 people. Sturgeon has suggested the return of pupils to school, earlier than in the rest of the UK, may be fuelling the rise. But we're not expecting to hear any changes to rules or restrictions from the first minister today. You'll be able to followwhat Sturgeon says in detail here, while we'll bring you the headlines from her statement. Officials will be able to make decisions about school safety on hard data, Prof Sir Terence Stephenson says Prof Sir Terence Stephenson, the lead author of the University College London study on long Covid in children, has been talking to BBC Radio 4's the World At One about its implications. He says that when they began the research in December 2020, some people were speculating that as many as half of all children who caught coronavirus would develop long Covid. The study offers reassurance that it is nowhere near that prevalent, he says, suggesting that more like one-in-seven or one-in-14 cases become long Covid. Prof Stephenson says the data should help policy-makers make decisions on issues such as school safety or the vaccination of children. ""This provides some data that allows them to make judgements and policy decisions on hard evidence, rather than speculation,"" he says. ""Itâs good that we can say itâs not overwhelming. But itâs also important to say we canât trivialise this."" There was ""no difference"" in mental health between those who contracted Covid, those who didn't, and young people surveyed over the last ten years, Prof Stephenson says. It seems young people's mental health is ""bearing up well"" in the pandemic, he says. The most common lasting symptoms were headaches, fatigue, dizziness and the loss of a sense of smell or taste. But Prof Stephenson says all of these are treatable. He says they will continue to monitor young people's health at six months, 12 months and 24 months after their positive test. More than 8,000 deaths linked to Covid-19 have now been recorded in Wales, according to the Office for National Statistics. There were 18 deaths involving Covid-19 in the latest weekly figures, one fewer than the week before. But it takes the overall total since the pandemic began to 8,002 in Wales.

"Life-saving cholesterol jab recommended on NHSInclisiran is a new treatment that works even when other fat-busting drugs, like statins, have not.","An expensive but ""game-changing"" anti-cholesterol drug could soon be offered to hundreds of thousands of people in England and Wales on the NHS. NHS England says inclisiran, given as a twice-a-year injection, could save about 30,000 lives within a decade. It normally costs nearly Â£2,000 per dose but Novartis, which makes it, has agreed an undisclosed discount. It can lower bad fat in the blood when other cheaper drugs, like statins, have not done enough, saysdraft advice,external. The health watchdog NICE is recommending it as an option for people who have already had a stroke or heart attack and are not responding to other cholesterol-lowering treatments. Experts hope it will help to cut their risk of further life-threatening cardiovascular events. Although there is no long-term proof of this yet from studies, they believe it is worth recommending based on existing evidence. It will bring England and Wales in line withguidance for Scotland,external. More than two in five people in England are thought to have high cholesterol and around 6.5 million adults are taking medicines, called statins, to help lower it. Zena Forster has now tried several different kinds of statins to control her high cholesterol Zena Forster, 65, from Newcastle, has had a stroke and a heart attack and been diagnosed with an inherited condition that means her cholesterol levels are always high, despite taking statins. ""I'm on my fourth statin now,"" she told the BBC One's Breakfast programme. ""Heart disease is relentless and there is no cure - and I just aim to slow the progress."" The new drug was ""good news"" for people like herself, Ms Forster said, and offered hope as another treatment option. And taking it twice a year would be no burden compared with remembering to take a daily pill. Cholesterol is a fatty substance - a lipid - found in some foods and also produced in the liver There are different types, but too much ""bad"" low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol can clog the arteries, increasing the risk of heart problems and stroke It's mainly caused by eating fatty food, not exercising enough, being overweight, smoking and drinking alcohol. It can also run in families You might need medication to lower your cholesterol if it has not gone down after changing your diet and lifestyle While statins - which are taken daily - slow down the production of cholesterol in the liver, inclisiran works in a different way. It uses gene-silencing to help the liver remove harmful cholesterol. Listen:The Silence of the Genes It turns off, or silences, a gene called PCSK9, which results in the liver absorbing more ""bad"" LDL cholesterol from the blood and breaking it down. It can be used on its own or alongside statins. Meindert Boysen, NICE deputy chief executive and director of the Centre for Health Technology Evaluation, said: ""Inclisiran represents a potential game-changer in preventing thousands of people from dying prematurely from heart attacks and strokes. ""We're therefore pleased to be able to recommend it as a cost effective option on the NHS."" Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of the NHS, said heart disease was still ""one of the major killer conditions"". ""It is fantastic that we now have such an effective and convenient treatment for those living with dangerously high cholesterol levels."" She said the rollout of inclisiran would save lives and benefit hundreds of thousands of people.

One in three wild trees face extinction,"Half of all magnolia species are threatened with extinction in the wild At least 30% of the world's tree species face extinction in the wild, according to a new assessment. They range from well-known oaks and magnolias to tropical timber trees. Experts say 17,500 tree species are at risk - twice the number of threatened mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles combined. Conservation groups are calling for urgent protection efforts amid threats such as deforestation, logging and climate change. ""We have nearly 60,000 tree species on the planet, and for the first time we now know which of these species are in need of conservation action, what are the greatest threats to them and where they are,"" said Dr Malin Rivers of the charity Botanic Gardens Conservation International in Kew, London. Half of Amazon trees 'face extinction' Madagascar palms 'are dying out' Ash tree set for extinction in Europe The Global Tree Assessment, by 500 tree experts and 61 institutions, brings together data on the conservation status of all trees For a healthy world, we need tree species diversity, added Sara Oldfield, co-chair of the Global Tree Specialist Group of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. ""Each tree species has a unique ecological role to play,"" she said. ""With 30% of the world's tree species threatened with extinction, we need to urgently scale-up conservation action."" The report, State of the World's Trees, found that at least 30% of the 60,000 known tree species face extinction. Some 142 species have already vanished from the wild, while 442 are on the very edge of extinction, with fewer than 50 individual trees remaining. The biggest threats to trees globally are forest clearance for crops (impacting 29% of species), logging (27%), clearance for livestock grazing or farming (14%), clearance for development (13%) and fire (13%). One-in-five tree species are used by humans for food, fuel, timber, medicines and more Climate change, extreme weather and sea level rise are growing threats to trees. But the authors say with conservation action, there is hope for the future. ""The report gives us that road map to mobilise the wider conservation community and other key players to ensure that tree conservation is at the forefront of the conservation agenda,"" said Dr Rivers. The experts are calling for a number of actions, including: Preserving existing forests and expanding protected areas (currently at least 64% of all tree species can be found in at least one protected area) Keeping threatened species in botanic gardens or seed banks in the hope they can one day be returned to the wild (currently about 30% of all trees are backed up in this way) Providing education to ensure reforestation and tree planting schemes are carried out scientifically, with the right tree in the right place, including rare and threatened species Increasing funding for tree conservation. Tropical forests are facing threats from climate change and extreme weather Scientists estimate that one million animals and plant species are threatened with extinction. Over the past 300 years, global forest area has decreased by about 40% and 29 countries have lost more than 90% of their forest cover. Research shows that seven main commodities drive more than half of deforestation worldwide. Trees at particular risk of extinction include: Large tropical trees known as dipterocarps that are being lost due to the expansion of palm oil plantations Oak trees lost to farming and development in parts of Mexico, Chile and Argentina Ebony and rosewood trees being felled for timber in Madagascar Magnolia trees at threat from unsustainable plant collecting Trees such as ash that are dying from pests and diseases in the UK and North America Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

"Premier League spending drops again, yet tops Â£1bn","Cristiano Ronaldo, Daniel James, Nikola Vlasic and Emerson Royal were among the movers on deadline day Cristiano Ronaldo completed his shock move back to Manchester United on transfer deadline day to help push Premier League clubs' outlay past Â£1bn - but overall spending has dropped for the second year in a row. The Portugal forward'seye-catching Old Trafford returnwas one of the early moves to be rubber-stamped on Tuesday, before England's summer window closed at 23:00 BST. The biggest deal was Nikola Vlasic's Â£26.8m move fromCSKA Moscow to West Ham, while Chelsea left it late to sign Saul Niguez on loan from Atletico Madrid. However, there would be no late move for Kylian Mbappe as Paris St-Germain rejected two bids from Real Madrid for the France World Cup-winning forward. In total, Premier League clubs spent Â£1.1bn on transfers during the window, which was open from 9 June until 31 August. That outlay was 11% lower than the previous summer's total of Â£1.3bn, itself was a 9% fall from 2019. According to financial services firm Deloitte, this is the lowest collective gross spend by Premier League clubs since 2015, and the first time there has been a consecutive decline since the global financial crisis between 2008 and 2010. Some of Deloitte's other key findings from the window include: Deadline day activity totalled Â£150m, meaning Premier League clubs have spent in excess of Â£1bn for the sixth summer in a row; Premier League clubs signed 148 players, compared with 132 in summer 2020 and 128 in summer 2019; No less than 22% of all players signed by Premier League clubs this summer were acquired on free transfers, up from 20% in summer 2020; Only four Premier League clubs did not acquire a player on a free transfer, while there were eight in summer 2020; The German Bundesliga is the only European 'big five' league to increase its gross spending this year; The Premier League's net player transfer spend of Â£560m dwarfed that of La Liga (Â£55m), Serie A (Â£50m) and Ligue 1 (Â£15m). Dan Jones, of Deloitte's sports business group, said: ""This has been a remarkable transfer window. ""Club spending records have been broken, player moves - including the two greatest players of their generation [Lionel Messiand Cristiano Ronaldo] - have grabbed the headlines and Premier League clubs have spent in excess of Â£1bn for the sixth summer in a row. ""Perhaps most remarkable is that all this has been achieved with lower spending than we have seen in the previous two summers."" Recap of deadline day as it happened All the deadline-day deals in one place Tottenham spent Â£25.8m on Barcelona full-backEmerson Royal, while winger Daniel Jamesjoined Leedsfrom Manchester United for Â£25m. Brighton signedSpain defender Marc Cucurellafrom Getafe for around Â£15.4m while Senegal striker Abdallah Sima also joined the Seagulls from Slavia Prague before moving to Stoke on loan. As well as Vlasic, West Ham also brought in midfielder Alex Kral on loan from Spartak Moscow. Leicester signed winger Ademola Lookman on aseason-long loanfrom RB Leipzig. Burnley signed their second full-back in the space of a few days by bringing in Wales internationalConnor Roberts from Swansea. Crystal Palace landed strikerOdsonne Edouard from Celticfor Â£15m. Arsenal wrapped uptheir busy summerby signing Japanese defender Takehiro Tomiyasu from Bologna while allowing Hector Bellerin to join Real Betis and Reiss Nelson to move to Feyenoord, both on loan. Everton announced thefree transfersigning of Salomon Rondon just as the window closed in England at 23:00 BST. Film fans will appreciate Newcastle signingMexican striker Santiago Munoz, whose name is strikingly similar to Santiago Munez, the fictional character who played for the Magpies in the 2005 movie Goal. Elsewhere in Europe, the major clubs were active on transfer deadline day, even though Real Madrid were unsuccessful in their attempt to sign Mbappe. Instead, the Spanish giants signed highly-rated France midfielderEduardo Camavinga from Rennes. Juventus responded to losing Ronaldo to Manchester United by re-signing Italy striker Moise Kean from Everton on a two-year loan. Barcelona, seeking to move out players in order to ease financial concerns, sold Ilaix Moriba to RB Leipzig before leaving it late to loan Antoine Griezmann back to Atletico Madrid. With the exception of Germany's Bundesliga, gross transfer spend is down for all of Europe's other 'big five' leagues - in England, Italy, Spain and France - for the second consecutive year. Behind the Premier League, Serie A is the next highest spending league with Â£475m. The Premier League clubs' total gross transfer spend, though, is still more than double that of Serie A's clubs. Jack Grealish and Romelu Lukaku were the two most expensive Premier League signings of the window Arsenal, Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea were, in gross terms, the four biggest- spending Premier League clubs and were responsible for the four highest-value individual transfers in this window. Manchester City completed the biggest single deal of the window, breaking the British transfer record to sign Jack Grealish from Aston Villa for Â£100m. European champions Chelsea were not far behind, re-signing striker Romelu Lukaku from Inter Milan for Â£97.5m. As well as Ronaldo, Manchester United spent Â£73m to sign Jadon Sancho from Dortmund and Â£34m to bring in Raphael Varane from Real Madrid. Arsenal were also one of the big spenders this summer, splashing out around Â£140m on players including Ben White from Brighton (Â£50m), Martin Odegaard from Real Madrid (Â£30m) and Aaron Ramsdale from Sheffield United (Â£24m). Liverpool were relatively quiet in the window, spending Â£36m to sign defender Ibrahima Konate from RB Leipzig. They did, however, tie up new contracts for a number of key players including captain Jordan Henderson, who signed anew four-year dealon deadline day itself. Arguably the most eye-catching deal of the summer was a free transfer - Lionel Messi breaking down in tears as he confirmed his Barcelona departure after 21 years beforeheading to Paris St-Germain. Kylian Mbappe, Harry Kane and Jules Kounde were all linked with big-money moves that didn't happen The summer 2021 transfer window will also likely be remembered for the deals that did not happen. Manchester City spent much of the summer pursuing England captain Harry Kane, only for the striker to commit his future to Spurs. Real Madrid tried twice to sign Mbappe, but their two bids in excess of Â£100m were rejected by Paris St-Germain. Chelsea were interested in another France international, defender Jules Kounde, but Sevilla would not entertain bids for less than his 80m euro release clause. Ainsley Maitland-Niles took to social media to try to force a move away from Arsenal but ended up staying. Jesse Lingard will fight for his place at Manchester United after a permanent move to West Ham failed to materialise. And Wolves abandoned a late move for Lille midfielder Renato Sanches. Analysis by BBC Sport's Simon Stone Where does the financial power now lie in European football? Perhaps that can be best summed up by a transfer deal that did not go through this summer. Despite wrestling with well-publicised financial issues as the transfer window edged towards Tuesday's deadline, Real Madrid were able to offer more than Â£100m for Mbappe. Even though Mbappe is known to hanker after a move to the Bernabeu, and even though his contract runs out in less than 12 months' time, meaning he could join Real for nothing next summer and sign a pre-contract agreement as early as January, his club PSG said no. Financially, the decision makes no sense. But from a footballing perspective - for a club who have signed Messi and Sergio Ramos, among others, this summer in a determined effort to win the Champions League - it was the right move. PSG opted not to join the discreditedEuropean Super League plan. They didn't have to. They didn't need the extra revenue. The same could be argued for the six Premier League representatives. After all, despite the massive impact of the coronavirus pandemic, Manchester City still spent a British record Â£100m on Jack Grealish, Chelsea almost as much on Romelu Lukaku, and Manchester United more than that as they brought in Cristiano Ronaldo, Jadon Sancho and Raphael Varane. Tottenham were able to turn down City's attempt to sign Harry Kane and Arsenal were the biggest spenders of all, on six new players. There may be some sniggering at the moment about Arsenal's plight, bottom of the table, with no points and no goals after three matches of the new Premier League season, but that situation will not last. And if this summer is anything to go by, the reality is that for all the public discontent about the European Super League - and Project Big Picture before that - the only difference from the present landscape is that there are currently fewer clubs able to compete on that scale than the 15 who would have been granted entry to the Super League.

Troubles pensions scheme opens for applications,"This video can not be played In separate IRA bomb attacks Jennifer McNern lost both her legs and Margaret Yeaman was blinded A pension scheme for people who were badly injured during the Troubles has opened for applications. The start of the Troubles Permanent Disablement Payment Scheme is more than a year behind schedule, having been the subject of political rows. To qualify, a person must have suffered a severe and permanent physical or psychological injury caused through no fault of their own during the Troubles. Recipients will receive annual payments of between Â£2,000 and Â£10,000. The UK government and the Northern Ireland Executive havelong been at odds about how the scheme will be funded, with the overall costs potentially topping Â£1.2bn over the next 20 to 30 years. The Troubles claimed more than 3,500 lives and it has been estimated that another 40,000 were injured Last year a judge ruled Stormont's Executive Office wasacting unlawfully in delaying the introduction of the scheme. He said the start of the scheme was being deliberately stymied in order to pressurise the government into funding it. He also determined there was an attempt by Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill to have the scheme's eligibility criteria changed, with her party, Sinn FÃ©in, having said the rules potentially discriminated against some republicans with Troubles-era convictions. Funding for the scheme has been agreed for this year, but Stormont ministers still want the government to provide extra cash to help cover future expenditure. Margaret Yeaman, who was blinded in an IRA bomb in Banbridge, County Down, in 1982, said it had been a ""long, bumpy road"" for her and others injured during the Troubles who have been waiting for the payments. ""I'll not even say that we're getting it until I have it in my hand,"" she said. The level of payment through the scheme will depend on the severity of a victim's injuries Jennifer McNern described the payments as ""recognition"" of what she had been through since she lost both of her legs after an IRA bomb explosion in Belfast in 1972. ""This is really an acknowledgement of the harm caused physically, psychologically and financially,"" she said. Executive must fund Troubles pension, court rules The victims' group, the Wave Trauma Centre, said the opening of the scheme was a ""triumph for the courageous and determined campaigners who have fought for over a decade"" for the payments. ""At times it was desperately frustrating but they never lost their focus on gaining tangible recognition for all those like themselves who had been severely and permanently injured through no fault of their own,"" said the group's co-ordinator Alan McBride. ""We'll also remember those who campaigned but didn't live long enough to see this day."" The group Relatives For Justice said the qualification criteria for the pension should be extended. AndrÃ©e Murphy, its deputy director, welcomed the initiative but insisted modifications need to be considered. ""It is very possible that a paramedic or a police officer or an eye-witness at a scene will be eligible for a payment and a loved-one who has suffered the deep psychological distress and trauma since then will not be eligible for this,"" she said. ""That is going to feel unfair and we have to resolve it,"" she added. This video can not be played The roots of Northern Irelandâs Troubles lie deep in Irish history After a series of delays, the scheme was to have opened in June but Mr Justice McAlinden, who chairs the panel overseeing the awarding of the payments,pushed it back until the end of August. That final delay, he said, was to allow applicants to ""familiarise themselves"" with ""complex"" medical assessment guidance before making their submissions. He said he hopes that money will start being distributed to victims before the end of this year. In an interview with BBC News NI, he said he was confident that enough funding would be available for everyone entitled to payments, and he hoped the process would begin soon. The judge said: ""I would hope that there would be a speedy turnaround for non-complex, relatively straight-forward cases. ""We'll just have to see how we measure up to our goals but I would hope that, let's say, it will be within months as opposed to years for the vast majority of applicants to receive determinations from the board."" Asked if this meant that the money would start being paid before the end of this year, he said: ""Yes. I would hope so."" ""I'm not worried about the issue of funding,"" Mr Justice McAlinden told the BBC Asked about the provision of funding, Mr Justice McAlinden said there was still political ""debate, discussion, disagreement as to where the funding will ultimately come from."" But he added: ""I have an undertaking, given in court, to the Court of Appeal that in terms of the role of the board, the payments that the board allocate and award, those payments will be met."" The scheme covers violence related to the Troubles between 1966 and 2010, including incidents in Great Britain and Europe. Non-UK residents injured outside the UK cannot apply, such as victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings carried out by loyalists in 1974. After the death of a recipient, their spouse or carer will get the payments for a further 10 years. Welcoming the opening of the scheme, First Minister Paul Givan said the scheme would give people who had suffered as a result of the Troubles ""the practical support and recognition that they deserve"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it had been ""a difficult and painful road for victims and survivors"", and encouraged anyone who had suffered permanent physical or psychological disablement as a result of the conflict to make an application. Justice Minister Naomi Long said it was an important day for all victims and survivors, ""but particularly for those who campaigned for this scheme with dignity and commitment for so long"".

When Barcelona signed Antoine Griezmann in 2019, there were doubts about how he would gel with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez. I wonder what odds you'd have got on none of them playing for Barcelona by 1 September 2021. Griezmann and Suarez link up again at Atleti... #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only - standard message rates apply) Clubs have weeks, or months, to sort out transfers - yet most are left to the last minute. Can I offer my services to do a bit of organisational skills training for them? A one day course should do it. As they all seem pretty flush I will bump up my rate though. Kenny, Edinburgh Barcelona say Atletico Madrid will pay all of Antoine Griezmann's wages. That will presumably help Barca register their new players. They add that there is a ""compulsory permanent transfer clause"" too. Griezmann is the 11th player to leave financially-struggling Barcelona this summer, including Lionel Messi - and the third today. Right-back Emerson Royal joined Tottenham for Â£25.8m and teenage midfielder Ilaix Moriba moved to RB Leipzig for Â£13.7m. Atletico Madrid say the Antoine Griezmann signing from Barcelona is a loan for one season with the option of another. Two years ago the France international made the move the other way after Barca paid his Â£107m buyout clause. But the 30-year-old's time at the Nou Camp has been a disappointment as he scored 35 goals in 102 games and only won the Copa del Rey. He has never won La Liga, joining Atletico Madrid in 2014, Barcelona in 2019 and Atleti now - every time just after his new side had won the league. Atletico Madrid re-sign forward Antoine Griezmann from Barcelona The biggest move of the day and a shock one. France World Cup winner Antoine Griezmann has rejoined Atletico Madrid from Barcelona on a season-long loan deal. As that guy says 'here we go'... Interesting.La Liga's transfers page,externalalready has Antoine Griezmann to Atletico. Done deal? The big one we're still waiting on is Atletico Madrid signing Antoine Griezmann from Barcelona. There is also some talk Barca might sign Sevilla striker Luuk de Jong as a replacement. De Jong and Martin Braithwaite up front. What a dream. We told you earlier that Swansea were trying to sign Brentford winger Tariqe Fosu on a season-long loan. Well that has fallen through so the Ghana international, 25, is likely to stay with the Premier League side. Good news for people who inexplicably named their fantasy football team after Fosu. Not naming any names. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
