WTA 'has had no direct contact with Peng Shuai',"This video can not be played WTA chairman 'worried about Peng's safety' Chinese player Peng Shuai has still not directly been in contact with the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), which says ""no amount of money"" would stop it pulling events out of China. Peng, 35, made sexual assault allegations against a former China vice-premier two weeks ago. WTA chairman Steve Simon told the BBC there will be no events in China next year without proof that Peng is safe. ""We cannot stand by compromises. This is a right and wrong issue,"" he said. The WTA has been told Peng is safe, and in Beijing, by the Chinese Tennis Association, although Simon said there has been no confirmation that is true. Later on Friday, three photographs of Peng were posted on a WeChat account under her name with the caption 'Happy Weekend'. However, the authenticity of the post on the Chinese instant messaging servicewas questioned by BBC China media analyst Kerry Allen.,external ""I'm very, very concerned about her,"" Simon said in an interview with the BBC. World number one Novak Djokovic said he would support the WTA pulling tournaments out of China if it came to that. ""I support the statement of WTA as an organisation and also their president absolutely,"" he said. ""The whole tennis community, needs to back her up and her family, make sure that she's safe and sound because if you would have tournaments on Chinese soil without resolving this situation, it would be a little bit strange. ""I heard that the WTA is willing to pull out from China with all the tournaments unless this is resolved. I support it 100%."" Meanwhile, the United States has urged China to ""provide independent, verifiable proof"" of Peng's whereabouts and safety. US 'deeply concerned' over Peng Fears for Peng's welfare have continued to grow since she said on 3 November she was ""forced"" into a sexual relationship with former China vice-premier Zhang Gaoli. Peng made the allegations in a post on Chinese social media site Weibo and they were soon deleted from China's internet. It is the first time such a claim has been made against one of China's senior political leaders. Simon added: ""I'm very concerned about the challenges that come when somebody has the courage to step up and speak out, bringing a past experience that is tied to sexual assault or harassment. ""It takes an awful lot of courage just to get to that point - and now she's dealing with more pressures if she is hearing what is going on. ""It is critical to us that we are able to make sure she knows we are worried about her and that we're prepared to offer any level of support that she needs."" Peng is a former world number one doubles player who has won two Grand Slam titles - at Wimbledon in 2013 and the 2014 French Open, both alongside Chinese Taipei's Hsieh Su-wei. Peng Shuai also achieved a career-high singles rankings of 14 in 2011 and reached the US Open singles semi-finals in 2014 Earlier this week, Chinese state media released an email attributed to Peng, butSimon cast doubtabout its authenticity. Talking to BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller, Simon said he did not believe speaking out strongly and demanding answers from the Chinese authorities would be counterproductive. ""Diplomacy is always very, very strong and I am sure that they would prefer we are not talking about this,"" he said. ""I think we are better addressing it than working in a vacuum where nobody knows and the world is trying to figure out our position. ""I'm very comfortable with the approach that we have taken right now, and we'll continue to do it in a very respectful and hopefully responsible way."" The WTA has heavily relied on Chinese investment in its players' tour, leading to a number of lucrative tournaments and the season-ending finals being held in the country over recent years. China hosted nine tournaments in the 2019 season with a total of $30.4m (Â£22.6m) in prize money. No events have been held in the country since the coronavirus pandemic started in March 2020. But Simon said assurances about Peng's safety and a transparent investigation into her allegations were of paramount importance to the WTA, not the financial implications of potentially pulling events out of China if these conditions are not met. ""This is not about the money, this is about doing what is right and making sure Peng Shuai is safe and free,"" added Simon. ""The sad part about this is that we have some tremendous partners and some tremendous friendships in China. ""We don't want to be in this position, but at the end of the day this is one of those decisions where compromises are not acceptable. ""We have to do what is right here and we will figure that out if we end up being in that position at the end of the day."" This video can not be played Ros Atkins on...the missing Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai Serena Williams, Andy Murray and Djokovic have been among those who have expressed their concerns about Peng's whereabouts. People from across tennis - including past and present players, coaches and journalists - have been demanding answers about Peng's welfare, as have other high-profile sports stars, actors and politicians. Many have been using #WhereIsPengShuai on Twitter posts, along with a photo of her. Wimbledon said it had been ""working in support of the WTA's efforts"" to establish her safety and was ""united with the rest of tennis in the need to understand that Peng Shuai is safe"". French doubles player Nicolas Mahut said he would not play in China until the situation is resolved and urged his fellow professionals to ""be united"" on the stance. Mahut also criticised IOC president Thomas Bach, saying it was ""embarrassing"" he had not spoken out about Peng, who is a three-time Olympian. With the Winter Olympics set to be held in Beijing in February, Global Athlete - a body which represents the interests of sports stars and includes several Olympians in its panel - said it ""condemned the IOC for staying silent"". ""The IOC has a duty to care for its athletes. Silence is unacceptable,"" it added. The United Nations said it wanted proof of Peng's whereabouts and has urged the need for an investigation ""with full transparency"". The Lawn Tennis Association, the sport's governing body in the United Kingdom, said it has ""offered assistance"" to the WTA to ""establish the safety and wellbeing"" of Peng. Allow Twitter content?

Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent Pulling out of China would have significant repercussions for the finances of the WTA Tour, the earnings of its players and the spread of the sport among the country's 1.4 billion inhabitants. Steve Simon disputes the Tour has put too many eggs in one basket, but there are usually 10 Chinese events a year on the WTA schedule. Many are very lucrative. The last time the WTA Finals were able to take place in Shenzhen, in 2019, there was $14m in prize money. And 15 of the world's top 20 did not make their way to Wuhan, barely two weeks after the conclusion of the 2019 US Open, just to visit the birthplace of Li Na. The financial loss would cut deep. But Simon believes that on this issue ""compromises are not acceptable"".

Austria to go into full lockdown as Covid surges,"One in three Austrians is not yet vaccinated, one of the lowest rates in Western Europe Days after Austria imposed a lockdown on the unvaccinated, it has announced a full national Covid-19 lockdown starting on Monday. Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said it would last a maximum of 20 days and there would be a legal requirement to get vaccinated from 1 February 2022. He was responding to record case numbers and one of the lowest vaccination levels in Western Europe. Many other European countries are imposing restrictions as cases rise. ""We don't want a fifth wave,"" said Mr Schallenberg after meeting the governors of Austria's nine provinces at a resort in the west of the country. For a long time, there had been a consensus over avoiding mandatory vaccinations, the chancellor said. However, too many people had been incited not to get the jab, because of ""too many political forces, flimsy vaccination opponents and fake news"", he added. The measures are yet to be finalised. Latest figures show the incidence rate has risen to 1,049.9 cases per 100,000 people in the past week,external, and Health Minister Wolfgang MÃ¼ckstein said imposing a lockdown was a ""last resort"". A record 15,809 cases were reported in the past 24 hours, in a population of under nine million. Under the measures, Austrians will be asked to work from home, non-essential shops will close, and schools will remain open for children who require face-to-face learning. They will continue until 12 December, but will be reassessed after 10 days. NeighbouringGermanyhas seen several days of record infections this week, and Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken of ""a national emergency that requires a combined national effort"". German leaders have already agreed to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people in areas with high hospital admissions. And parliament has backed requirements for people to show Covid passes on buses and trains, and in workplaces. But now inBavaria, which borders Austria, state premier Markus SÃ¶der has gone further, declaring  a ""de facto lockdown for the unvaccinated"". Bars and clubs will close for three weeks and all Christmas markets have been cancelled. Where weekly incidence rates top 1,000 per 100,000 people - restaurants, hotels, sport and culture will also close. SlovakPrime Minister Eduard Heger has already announced that a ""lockdown for the unvaccinated"" will start on Monday, and theCzechgovernment is also limiting access to a variety of services. TheNetherlandsintroduced a partial lockdown last weekend. In theUK- where there is currently no lockdown,although masks have to be worn in some parts of the country- the incidence rate per 100,000 is 395.4 cases,officials figures show,external. Austria's is the first full lockdown imposed by an EU country this winter. The Europe regional director of the World Health Organization,Hans Kluge, has warned of a hard winter ahead. He blamed insufficient vaccination coverage along with ""the easing of preventive measures and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant"". Russiaon Friday declared a record number of 1,254 Covid deaths in the past 24 hours, for the third day in a row. Hungaryreported its highest level of infections - with 11,289 new cases in a population of 10 million. A third booster jab will be made mandatory for health workers from Saturday, along with masks in most enclosed spaces. Tighter restrictions also come into force inBelgiumon Saturday, requiring working from home for four days a week. There are only two ways for countries to slow the spread of Covid - build up enough immunity or limit contact between other people. That wall of immunity - from a year of vaccination - is facing its first real test as winter rolls in across Europe. It is already clear some countries - Austria being the most notable - have not vaccinated enough and feel the ""need"" to go back to restrictions that nobody ""wants"". But it does not mean that every country is doomed to a winter lockdown. Those that have vaccinated more, given boosters to more and protected more of the vulnerable and elderly (who are the most likely to need hospital care) have the best shot at a manageable winter. The impact of the UK having high levels of Covid through autumn, which will have topped up immunity levels, will be closely watched too. However, it is still only November. There are many dark months to get through before the weather improves and makes it harder for Covid to spread.

Paul Dacre quits race to head Ofcom media watchdog,"Former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre has pulled out of the contest to become the next chair of media regulator Ofcom. In aletter to the Times,external, he said he was not going to re-apply for the role, after his initial application was rejected by a recruitment panel. The process is currently being re-run after the initial interviews failed to settle on a candidate. But Dacre said he had now decided to take up an ""exciting new job in the private sector"" instead. Ofcom has wide-ranging powers over television, radio, telecoms and postal services, dealing with licensing, complaints and much else besides. It is set to be handed new powers to regulate social media companies as part of the government's draft online safety legislation. Ofcom chair selection process to be re-started Paul Dacre and Ofcom: What's going on? Paul Dacre stepping down as Mail editor Dacre, 73, who left the Daily Mail in 2018 after more than a quarter of a century as editor, had been seen as Downing Street's favourite for the Ofcom job. The Times quoted him as describing his experience of applying for the role as an ""infelicitous dalliance"" with ""the Blob"" - a term sometimes used to refer to the Whitehall establishment. The journalist, known for his conservative views, was also quoted saying his ""strong convictions"" had led to him being judged ""unappointable"". He wrote that Ofcom would face an ""awesome challenge"" in trying to regulate ""omnipotent"", ""ruthless"" and ""amoral"" tech giants ""without damaging freedom of expression"". He also said he would ""die in a ditch"" to defend the BBC but it needed to be ""saved from both itself and the frighteningly well-resourced streaming giants"". A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport said the recruitment process for Ofcom chair was ""fair and open"". ""The process is regulated by the commissioner for public appointments, who is responsible for ensuring that the appointment is made in accordance with strict guidelines,"" they added. Meanwhile, a group of Scottish and Welsh ministers have written to Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries asking to be included in the process to appoint a new Ofcom chair. The ministers say they are ""extremely concerned"" about a ""perceived lack of impartiality and transparency"" in the process. Involving the devolved governments in the decision would help maintain ""credibility"", the ministers added. The two-page document was signed by Angus Robertson, the Scottish culture secretary, and Kate Forbes, Scotland's finance and economy secretary, as well as the Welsh government's deputy minister for arts, Dawn Bowden, and its deputy minister for climate change, Lee Waters. Ministers shared concerns that the prolonged process ""might adversely affect the standing of the public service broadcasting system whose duty is to serve all the nations"".

Investigation into spike in newborn baby deaths,"A spike in the number of deaths of newborn babies in Scotland is to be investigated. At least 21 babies under four weeks old died in September, a rate of 4.9 per 1,000 births. Infant death rates vary widely from month to month, but the increase is larger than expected from chance alone. Public Health Scotland (PHS) and other agencies will now look into whether the Covid pandemic or other factors could be behind the increase. The average mortality rate among newborns is just over two per 1,000 births. Rise in pregnant women needing ICU treatment While all child deaths are investigated, theHerald newspaper reported,externalthat this wider inquiry was triggered when the mortality rate passed a ""control"" threshold, designed to pick up abnormal trends in infant deaths. In a commentary on the figures, PHS says: ""Exceeding the upper control limit indicates there is a higher likelihood that there are factors beyond random variation that may have contributed to the number of deaths."" PHS said there was ""currently no indication of links between these deaths and Covid-19 infection"" although the data will be examined further. Dr Sarah Stock, an expert in maternal and fetal health at University of Edinburgh, said it was rare for newborn babies to become infected or seriously-ill with Covid but she said the virus could be having an impact in other ways. ""We know, for instance, that when pregnant women have Covid they can become seriously unwell, and in order to protect the mother and baby that can lead to pre-term deliveries,"" she said. ""Pre-term delivery is the biggest driver of neonatal mortality. ""We also know that the pandemic has put a lot of pressure on health services and that could be having an impact."" PHS is now working with the Scottish National Neonatal Network , the Maternity and Children Quality Improvement Collaborative and the Scottish government to understand possible contributing factors. Figures for the number of stillborn babies also increased in September but not beyond the upper warning or control limit. Deaths of newborn babies have fallen steadily in recent decades with the mortality rate per 1,000 births dropping from double figures in the 1970s to 2.1 in 2020.

Sex assault ex-MP says he can't afford court costs,"""Serious allegations"" about Elphicke were initially passed to police in 2017 A former MP who was jailed for sexually assaulting two women said he cannot afford Â£35,000 he owes in court costs. Charlie Elphicke was handed a two year sentence in September 2020 after being found guilty of three counts of sexual assault following a trial. The former Tory MP was released after one year, but still owed the money towards the costs of the prosecution. He told Uxbridge Magistrates' Court he was unemployed and making a Universal Credit claim. ""I find myself in a very difficult and embarrassed position,"" he told magistrates, after beingsummoned to attend the courton Friday for the non-payment. ""I have no job. I have no career. I am long-term unemployed."" The former Government whip, who is on licence until next year, offered to repay his debt at Â£1 per month, but this was not accepted by the court. The court heard Elphicke received Â£51,000 from the sale of his marital home, but most of the money had been used ""in legal fees and to pay rent"". He said he had paid six months' rent up front for a one-bedroom flat, valued online at nearly Â£475,000, in Fulham, south west London, adding: ""That is why I have very limited cash to meet my living expenses."" Charlie Elphicke's wife Natalie, the MP for Dover, supported him during the trial Elphicke's claim for Universal Credit is being processed, and he told the court he had worked with the Step Change debt charity to assess his financial situation. He said he was working with the job centre and a probation officer to find a new career and must find somewhere else to live after separating with his wife Natalie Elphicke, the current MP for Dover. Magistrates agreed to adjourn the case to 17 December, allowing time for Elphicke's benefits claim to be assessed before a payment order is made. In March, he lost a Court of Appeal challenge against his jail term after his lawyers argued the sentence was too long and should have been suspended. Mrs Justice Whipple, Elphicke's sentencing judge, described him as a ""sexual predator"" who used his ""success and respectability as a cover"" and told a ""pack of lies"". During his trial, jurors heard how he had asked one of his victims about bondage and sex, then kissed her and groped her breast before chasing her around his home, chanting: ""I'm a naughty Tory.""

"Taylor Swift lands eighth UK number one albumHer re-recorded version of Red tops the album chart, just as the original did nine years ago.","Swift is the first and only female artist to have eight UK number one albums this century Taylor Swift has landed her eighth straight number one album, with her re-recorded rendition of Red topping the UK chart on Friday. Red (Taylor's Version) is the American singer's recreation of her fourth album, which also went to number one on its original release in 2012. It's her second re-recorded album release of 2021, following Fearless. She plans to re-record and re-release her first six albums in order to have complete control over her music. The move follows the 2019 acquisition of her master recordings by music mogul Scooter Braun and his subsequent sale of them to an investment fund. Taylor Swift speaks out after her masters are sold Taylor Swift 'bullied' by man who now owns her music Swift v Braun: Personal or strictly business? She hopes fans will listen to and buy the new versions of her albums on streaming services and download stores, rather than the originals. Red includes the hit singles We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together and I Knew You Were Trouble, with Taylor's Version adding a number of bonus tracks that didn't make it onto the original album.

Paul Dacre quits race to head Ofcom media watchdogThe former Daily Mail editor says he will not take part in a re-run process to find the next chair.,"Former Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre has pulled out of the contest to become the next chair of media regulator Ofcom. In aletter to the Times,external, he said he was not going to re-apply for the role, after his initial application was rejected by a recruitment panel. The process is currently being re-run after the initial interviews failed to settle on a candidate. But Dacre said he had now decided to take up an ""exciting new job in the private sector"" instead. Ofcom has wide-ranging powers over television, radio, telecoms and postal services, dealing with licensing, complaints and much else besides. It is set to be handed new powers to regulate social media companies as part of the government's draft online safety legislation. Ofcom chair selection process to be re-started Paul Dacre and Ofcom: What's going on? Paul Dacre stepping down as Mail editor Dacre, 73, who left the Daily Mail in 2018 after more than a quarter of a century as editor, had been seen as Downing Street's favourite for the Ofcom job. The Times quoted him as describing his experience of applying for the role as an ""infelicitous dalliance"" with ""the Blob"" - a term sometimes used to refer to the Whitehall establishment. The journalist, known for his conservative views, was also quoted saying his ""strong convictions"" had led to him being judged ""unappointable"". He wrote that Ofcom would face an ""awesome challenge"" in trying to regulate ""omnipotent"", ""ruthless"" and ""amoral"" tech giants ""without damaging freedom of expression"". He also said he would ""die in a ditch"" to defend the BBC but it needed to be ""saved from both itself and the frighteningly well-resourced streaming giants"". A spokesperson for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media & Sport said the recruitment process for Ofcom chair was ""fair and open"". ""The process is regulated by the commissioner for public appointments, who is responsible for ensuring that the appointment is made in accordance with strict guidelines,"" they added. Meanwhile, a group of Scottish and Welsh ministers have written to Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries asking to be included in the process to appoint a new Ofcom chair. The ministers say they are ""extremely concerned"" about a ""perceived lack of impartiality and transparency"" in the process. Involving the devolved governments in the decision would help maintain ""credibility"", the ministers added. The two-page document was signed by Angus Robertson, the Scottish culture secretary, and Kate Forbes, Scotland's finance and economy secretary, as well as the Welsh government's deputy minister for arts, Dawn Bowden, and its deputy minister for climate change, Lee Waters. Ministers shared concerns that the prolonged process ""might adversely affect the standing of the public service broadcasting system whose duty is to serve all the nations"".

'Still no direct contact' with tennis star Peng,"This video can not be played WTA chairman 'worried about Peng's safety' Chinese player Peng Shuai has still not directly been in contact with the Women's Tennis Association (WTA), which says ""no amount of money"" would stop it pulling events out of China. Peng, 35, made sexual assault allegations against a former China vice-premier two weeks ago. WTA chairman Steve Simon told the BBC there will be no events in China next year without proof that Peng is safe. ""We cannot stand by compromises. This is a right and wrong issue,"" he said. The WTA has been told Peng is safe, and in Beijing, by the Chinese Tennis Association, although Simon said there has been no confirmation that is true. Later on Friday, three photographs of Peng were posted on a WeChat account under her name with the caption 'Happy Weekend'. However, the authenticity of the post on the Chinese instant messaging servicewas questioned by BBC China media analyst Kerry Allen.,external ""I'm very, very concerned about her,"" Simon said in an interview with the BBC. World number one Novak Djokovic said he would support the WTA pulling tournaments out of China if it came to that. ""I support the statement of WTA as an organisation and also their president absolutely,"" he said. ""The whole tennis community, needs to back her up and her family, make sure that she's safe and sound because if you would have tournaments on Chinese soil without resolving this situation, it would be a little bit strange. ""I heard that the WTA is willing to pull out from China with all the tournaments unless this is resolved. I support it 100%."" Meanwhile, the United States has urged China to ""provide independent, verifiable proof"" of Peng's whereabouts and safety. US 'deeply concerned' over Peng Fears for Peng's welfare have continued to grow since she said on 3 November she was ""forced"" into a sexual relationship with former China vice-premier Zhang Gaoli. Peng made the allegations in a post on Chinese social media site Weibo and they were soon deleted from China's internet. It is the first time such a claim has been made against one of China's senior political leaders. Simon added: ""I'm very concerned about the challenges that come when somebody has the courage to step up and speak out, bringing a past experience that is tied to sexual assault or harassment. ""It takes an awful lot of courage just to get to that point - and now she's dealing with more pressures if she is hearing what is going on. ""It is critical to us that we are able to make sure she knows we are worried about her and that we're prepared to offer any level of support that she needs."" Peng is a former world number one doubles player who has won two Grand Slam titles - at Wimbledon in 2013 and the 2014 French Open, both alongside Chinese Taipei's Hsieh Su-wei. Peng Shuai also achieved a career-high singles rankings of 14 in 2011 and reached the US Open singles semi-finals in 2014 Earlier this week, Chinese state media released an email attributed to Peng, butSimon cast doubtabout its authenticity. Talking to BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller, Simon said he did not believe speaking out strongly and demanding answers from the Chinese authorities would be counterproductive. ""Diplomacy is always very, very strong and I am sure that they would prefer we are not talking about this,"" he said. ""I think we are better addressing it than working in a vacuum where nobody knows and the world is trying to figure out our position. ""I'm very comfortable with the approach that we have taken right now, and we'll continue to do it in a very respectful and hopefully responsible way."" The WTA has heavily relied on Chinese investment in its players' tour, leading to a number of lucrative tournaments and the season-ending finals being held in the country over recent years. China hosted nine tournaments in the 2019 season with a total of $30.4m (Â£22.6m) in prize money. No events have been held in the country since the coronavirus pandemic started in March 2020. But Simon said assurances about Peng's safety and a transparent investigation into her allegations were of paramount importance to the WTA, not the financial implications of potentially pulling events out of China if these conditions are not met. ""This is not about the money, this is about doing what is right and making sure Peng Shuai is safe and free,"" added Simon. ""The sad part about this is that we have some tremendous partners and some tremendous friendships in China. ""We don't want to be in this position, but at the end of the day this is one of those decisions where compromises are not acceptable. ""We have to do what is right here and we will figure that out if we end up being in that position at the end of the day."" This video can not be played Ros Atkins on...the missing Chinese tennis star Peng Shuai Serena Williams, Andy Murray and Djokovic have been among those who have expressed their concerns about Peng's whereabouts. People from across tennis - including past and present players, coaches and journalists - have been demanding answers about Peng's welfare, as have other high-profile sports stars, actors and politicians. Many have been using #WhereIsPengShuai on Twitter posts, along with a photo of her. Wimbledon said it had been ""working in support of the WTA's efforts"" to establish her safety and was ""united with the rest of tennis in the need to understand that Peng Shuai is safe"". French doubles player Nicolas Mahut said he would not play in China until the situation is resolved and urged his fellow professionals to ""be united"" on the stance. Mahut also criticised IOC president Thomas Bach, saying it was ""embarrassing"" he had not spoken out about Peng, who is a three-time Olympian. With the Winter Olympics set to be held in Beijing in February, Global Athlete - a body which represents the interests of sports stars and includes several Olympians in its panel - said it ""condemned the IOC for staying silent"". ""The IOC has a duty to care for its athletes. Silence is unacceptable,"" it added. The United Nations said it wanted proof of Peng's whereabouts and has urged the need for an investigation ""with full transparency"". The Lawn Tennis Association, the sport's governing body in the United Kingdom, said it has ""offered assistance"" to the WTA to ""establish the safety and wellbeing"" of Peng. Allow Twitter content?

Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent Pulling out of China would have significant repercussions for the finances of the WTA Tour, the earnings of its players and the spread of the sport among the country's 1.4 billion inhabitants. Steve Simon disputes the Tour has put too many eggs in one basket, but there are usually 10 Chinese events a year on the WTA schedule. Many are very lucrative. The last time the WTA Finals were able to take place in Shenzhen, in 2019, there was $14m in prize money. And 15 of the world's top 20 did not make their way to Wuhan, barely two weeks after the conclusion of the 2019 US Open, just to visit the birthplace of Li Na. The financial loss would cut deep. But Simon believes that on this issue ""compromises are not acceptable"".

Europe's Covid passes set to stay,"The Dutch Coronacheck app is not checked everywhere, the BBC's Anna Holligan has found There have been protests and complaints of restricted freedom, but much of Europe is now using Covid passports to enter bars, restaurants, cinemas and museums. Italy also requires a Covid pass to enter a workplace and Austria is about to follow suit. Although England does not require a pass, from Friday, the UK's digital Covid pass will be accepted across the European Union. Our correspondents around Europe have been getting to grips with the rules. Italyhas adopted arguably the most rigid Covid pass rules in Europe, writesMark Lowen in Rome. TheGreen PassQR code - from at least one Covid vaccination, negative test or proof of recovery - has to be shown for everything from indoor restaurants to cinemas, gyms and intercity trains. It is also required by all employees in the public and private sectors when they turn up for work. Passes are checked regularly and my family, visiting from the UK, were amazed how rigidly Covid rules, including masks, are respected here. InFranceit is surprising how quickly thepasse sanitairehas become part of daily life, writesHugh Schofield in Paris. Few think twice now before presenting their mobile phones at bars, cinemas and museums, or on TGV trains and at airports. It is a normalised ritual. Hugh Schofield showing his pass in France It's a different story in theNetherlands, writesAnna Holligan.In all the beach bars, restaurants and city cafes I've visited since the pass was introduced on 25 September, I have not once been asked to flash my pass, although I have been asked at the cinema. Therules state anyone aged 13 and over has to show a Covid entry pass,external, although not for shops or taking part in sports events. Denmarkactually phased out itscoronapaslast month, writesAdrienne Murray in Copenhagen. It was first in Europe to adopt a pass in April but has now downgraded Covid-19 to a no longer ""socially critical"" disease. InGermany,if you go out to eat or drink, it's good to know the latest Covid regulation lingo,writes Damien McGuinness in Berlin. Handmade signs with a large 2G have popped up on the doors of many restaurants, cafes and bars. 2G means only people who are eithergeimpft(vaccinated) orgenesen (recovered)can go in.No sign means the usual 3G rule applies, which includes negative tests too. Austrianshave used 3G certificates for months, writesBethany Bell in Vienna. A friend and I went recently to one of my favourite restaurants in Vienna, which serves excellent Wiener Schnitzel and apple strudel. ""You have your Green Passes, I suppose?"" asked the waiter suspiciously. He glanced briefly at our digital certificates, then handed over the menus. Some establishments check on the passes very strictly, others don't even bother to ask. InSwitzerland,Covid passes are obligatory and the rules strictly applied, saysImogen Foulkes in Bern. And now that Covid tests aren't free anymore, going out for a beer gets pretty expensive. The vaccination rate is stagnating at around 62% and the government wants more people to get the jab. Anna Holligan:After some early consternation, the majority of pragmatic Dutch accepted the pass as a means of resurrecting their social lives while shrugging off social distancing. When I've asked waiters or box-office workers if they want to see the QR code proving my vaccination the answers vary from ""no, it's okay, we trust you"" to ""we don't actually have the technology"". A recent study by I&O Research found around a third of cafes and restaurants in the Netherlands were not scanning the coronapasses. Adrienne Murray:Danes are tech-savvy and accepted the app quickly as it offered a quick path out of lockdown. But because the coronapas came in well before people were double-vaccinated it required regular testing. Free test centres sprung up in neighbourhoods all over Copenhagen and towns elsewhere. These have mostly closed now that 75% of over-12s are fully vaccinated and a third booster is being rolled out. Guy Delauney says lip-service is often paid to the Covid passes in Balkan countries Guy Delauney, Balkans correspondent: I've detected little enthusiasm for the passes, travelling through Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and North Macedonia. While one restaurant on the main square in the Macedonian capital Skopje barred entry to people without passes, another had no checks at all. Staff complain of abuse, so a sign or a sticker on a table often acts as a fig leaf for official policies. Mark Lowen:There's a stereotype of Italians as a nation not minded to follow rules - but by being hit first in Europe, the pandemic seems to have changed that, and Italy's ""no-vax"" movement is relatively small. Dockers in Trieste have been among the most vocal protesters against having the Covid pass compulsory at work There have been some protests. Crowds stormed and smashed up a trade union building and then anti-Green Pass workers staged sit-ins and protests in Trieste, blockading the country's most important commercial port. Police broke them up with tear gas and water cannon. Imogen Foulkes:Opponents of the Swiss pass complain the strict policies undermine their constitutional freedoms. There are demonstrations every week, some of which have turned violent. Enough signatures have been gathered to call a referendum on 28 November to abolish the passes. If the Swiss do vote to get rid of them, it could make travel in Europe problematic - as the Swiss pass is recognised across Europe's passport-free Schengen area. Hugh Schofield:Of course there are people in France who object on principle to having to prove their credentials at every turn. Every Saturday there are demonstrations in Paris and other cities, bringing together anti-vaxxers with libertarians and protesters against ""health discrimination"". Contrary to what some expected, though, these have not turned into a mass movement, and are dwindling in strength. Anna Holligan:There have been a few challenges in the Netherlands: one failed lawsuit argued the pass was discriminatory because it treated unvaccinated people differently without good reason. Supermodel Doutzen Kroes announced on Instagram that she would not be ""forced to take the shot"" or ""forced to prove my health to participate in society"". But opposition to the pass in the Netherlands appears to be more a matter of principle than practicality. Bethany Bell:While many Austrians welcomed the passes as a step towards more freedoms, the opposition far-right Freedom Party has championed those who disagree with the measures. Its head, Herbert Kickl, has accused the government of splitting society into ""the good vaccinated and the bad unvaccinated"". Guy Delauney:There have been protests in Slovenia's capital every Wednesday in recent weeks and some have involved violent confrontations with the police, who have used teargas and water cannon to clear the crowds. Slovenian protesters have challenged restrictions regularly in the capital Ljubljana Serbian protesters have also been making themselves heard in Belgrade in recent days - despite the fact that the Covid pass there only applies to bars and restaurants after 22:00. One epidemiologist described that approach as ""trying to put out a fire with a glass of water"". Adrienne Murray:Denmark's coronapas was agreed across all parliamentary parties, even the opposition, with the promise that it would only be used for a finite time. And it was. Some public protests were held but they were attended by hundreds not thousands. Scottish vaccine passport scheme now enforceable by law Hugh Schofield:The effect of the Frenchpasse sanitaireon levels of vaccination seems incontrovertible. From the beginning of August vaccinations shot up.  Clearly many who were hesitating decided for the sake of a return to normal-ish life, it was necessary to take the plunge. Today 50 million French people have been totally vaccinated, including 88.4% of over-12s. And since mid-October a second part of the national arm-twist has come into effect: the end of free tests. The passe sanitaire has two options: either show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test. With this second option now incurring a cost, there'll be a further incentive for vaccination. Damien McGuinness:Germany has also dropped free antigen tests under its 3G rule, so anyone eligible who refuses the vaccine has to pay. Businesses can now choose for themselves whether to allow unvaccinated customers inside and this 2G rule is seen as a way of encouraging vaccination. It can be a selling point for customers. One Berlin cafe-owner said he had only had one objection from a regular. ""I just replied that he had excluded himself by deciding to not get vaccinated,"" he told me. Covid rules are broadly followed in Italy: Mark Lowen says his eight-year-old niece was expected to wear a mask in cafes, shops and museums Mark Lowen:Nothing motivates an Italian like threatening to bar them from their favouritetrattoriaand when compulsory passes were announced there was a sudden spike in vaccination appointments. Italy has some of the highest vaccination rates in Europe, with around 82% having received both doses, but that rate has slowed slightly and 40% of the workers at Trieste port still haven't been vaccinated, while far-right parties have courted the anti-vax and anti-Green Pass movement. Guy Delauney:Slovenia has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the EU, and its efforts to implement a Covid pass system initially helped boost take-up. That was until the constitutional court suspended a mandatory pass for public sector workers. Shops and restaurants all display notices reminding customers they need a valid PCT certificate, as it is known. But enforcement is patchy and official inspectors are thin on the ground. Mark Lowen:They'll certainly stay in Italy until the end of the year, but possibly in a nod to the protest movement the deputy health minister has said they could be ""reassessed"" next year if the data continues to show manageable infection numbers, low hospitalisations, and rising vaccine rates. The government says the alternative to compulsory passes is new restrictions, and most Italians will do whatever they can to avoid another lockdown. Adrienne Murray:The passes in Denmark may have gone but Covid is still here. Cases have recently risen back above 1,000 a day and are expected to go up further. However, there is little trace of the pandemic in everyday life, just the hand gel at the entrance to the supermarket. There's no social distancing, it's rare to see anyone in a face mask and guidance to work from home lifted in early August. Bethany Bell:As of 1 November, Austrians will have to show 3G passes to go to work. And this winter they will also have to show the certificates if they want to go skiing. Passes will be checked when people buy tickets for the ski lifts. And there are even stricter plans for aprÃ¨s-ski, where antigen tests will no longer be accepted - only a vaccination certificate, proof of recovery or negative PCR test result will do. Hugh Schofield:The initial hope was that thepasse sanitairecould be phased out in France from mid-November. That is not going to happen. The government is warning that though the Covid situation is vastly improved from two months ago, there are still risks of a winter resurgence. Last week a new health bill passed its first reading in parliament, which would make possible an extension of the passe until July 2022. Guy Delauney:Coronavirus case numbers have been surging across the Western Balkans, so despite the poor response to Covid passes, governments are likely to try again.

Taylor Swift lands eighth UK number one album,"Swift is the first and only female artist to have eight UK number one albums this century Taylor Swift has landed her eighth straight number one album, with her re-recorded rendition of Red topping the UK chart on Friday. Red (Taylor's Version) is the American singer's recreation of her fourth album, which also went to number one on its original release in 2012. It's her second re-recorded album release of 2021, following Fearless. She plans to re-record and re-release her first six albums in order to have complete control over her music. The move follows the 2019 acquisition of her master recordings by music mogul Scooter Braun and his subsequent sale of them to an investment fund. Taylor Swift speaks out after her masters are sold Taylor Swift 'bullied' by man who now owns her music Swift v Braun: Personal or strictly business? She hopes fans will listen to and buy the new versions of her albums on streaming services and download stores, rather than the originals. Red includes the hit singles We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together and I Knew You Were Trouble, with Taylor's Version adding a number of bonus tracks that didn't make it onto the original album.

Progress in EU-UK talks but gaps remain - Frost,"Lord Frost said it was possible to generate momentum after meeting MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ on Friday There has been progress in talks between the EU and UK but ""significant gaps remain"", Lord Frost has said. The UK Brexit minister made the comments after meeting European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ. Lord Frost said there was the potential to ""generate some momentum"" in the talks, which will continue next week. The men were discussing the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the deal between the EU and UK which was agreed as a way to avoid a hardening of the Irish land border. It leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, meaning goods can flow freely with the Republic of Ireland. However, goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control - amounting to a so-called Irish Sea border. The EU has acknowledged its is causing difficulties to some businesses and needs to be improved. However the UK is seeking more fundamental changes, including removing the European Court of Justice from an oversight role. Technical talks ahead of Friday's meeting had focused on guaranteeing the supply of medicines from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Mr Å efÄoviÄ said there had been progress in this area, adding: ""We now need to press on and get this crucial issue across the line. ""This is a real test of political goodwill."" He said that on the issue of customs there had been ""initial useful engagement at a technical level"". Goods arriving in Belfast from GB are subject to checks and controls Lord Frost said that with medicines, any solution needed to ensure that products were available at the same time and on the same basis across the whole of the UK. He added that there had not been ""substantive progress on the fundamental customs and SPS (agrifood) issues relating to goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland"". The two men are due to meet again in London next Friday. Earlier, UK cabinet minister Michael Gove saidhe was confident of making progress on issues over the Northern Ireland Protocolwithouttriggering Article 16. Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem What is Article 16 and why does it matter? Article 16 of the protocol allows unilateral ""safeguard"" measures to be taken if either the EU or UK concluded that the deal was leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade. That would amount to a suspension of parts of the deal. On Thursday, the Lord Frost reiterated that triggering Article 16 remained an option for the UK. The EU believes the use of Article 16 is unjustified and would be used by the UK as pretext to repudiate the protocol. Mr Gove said the protocol had meant disruption to trade and inconvenience for people in Northern Ireland. But he praised a constructive approach from the European Commission. Speaking at the British-Irish Council summit in Cardiff, Mr Gove said Lord Frost had ""signalled that while of course it is always possible Article 16 may require to be invoked - we are confident we will be able to make progress without it"". This video can not be played What's the Irish PM's message to the UK? Late on Thursday night, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin saidthere was ""serious intent"" in the EU to solve the disagreementon Northern Ireland.

Power NI to raise electricity prices by 21.4%,"The firm's latest price rise will mean an average bill will increase by Â£131 a year Northern Ireland's largest electricity company Power NI is to increase its prices for domestic customers by 21.4% from 1 January 2022. It means a typical household bill will go up by Â£131 a year. The tariff has been approved by the Utility Regulator. Power NI said the increase was due to a rise in prices across the global wholesale gas market. It has about 450,000 domestic customers and this is the second tariff increase it has announced this year. In July,it announced a 6.9% price rise. Consumers across Northern Ireland are facing higher prices this winter as gas and electricity providers pass on increasing costs to customers. William Steele, customer solutions director for Power NI, said the firm would try to assist customers struggling to pay their bills. ""We work very hard to keep our prices as low as possible but regrettably there has been a rapid and sustained increase in wholesale gas prices over recent months,"" he said. Why are energy bills going up? How can I cut down on my energy bills? ""Like other suppliers we have no choice but to pay these increased costs, which feed into the cost of wholesale electricity and have a knock-on effect on our tariffs. ""In these challenging times and with such a volatile market we held off making this change for as long as possible, with this price change not coming into effect until January 2022. Wind power is a cheap but unpredictable source of energy ""As soon as we see an opportunity to reduce prices, we will do so without delay. ""For any customers who are worried about paying a bill, please get in contact and we can help you."" The company said customers could help to offset the increase by ensuring they were on the best payment plan and registering for online billing. John French, chief executive of the Utility Regulator, said it was unclear how long it would be before global prices began to fall. ""The drivers behind this increase are that we have had one of the least windy summers since 1961, meaning generation from cheaper wind power has been very low,"" he said. ""This low output from wind has meant that there has been an increased use of conventional gas, coal, and oil fired power stations. Firmus raises gas price by further 38% in NI towns How has powering Northern Ireland changed? ""Unfortunately, the cost of gas, coal, and oil has increased significantly on global markets over the last 12 months, and since the wholesale cost of electricity makes up over 60% of a domestic customer's bill these sharp increases impact heavily on Power NI's tariff."" Mr French said market analysts were predicting higher wholesale prices ""for the next 18 to 36 months"". ""If wholesale prices begin to reduce, our system of regulation in Northern Ireland allows us to act to make sure that reductions are fully passed onto consumers as quickly as possible.""

Serious EU intent to fix NI border row - taoiseach,"This video can not be played What's the Irish PM's message to the UK? There is ""serious intent"" in the EU to solve post-Brexit difficulties over the Northern Ireland border, Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin has said. Speaking to the BBC, he said the ""mood music"" surrounding EU-UK negotiations had improved in recent weeks. The Northern Ireland Protocol in the Brexit deal aims to avoid implementing border checks on the island of Ireland. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But the protocol also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, meaning some goods such as meat and eggs are subject to checks when they enter Northern Ireland from Great Britain. This has angered some Northern Irish politicians, including DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who said the protocol was disrupting businesses and harming trade. Laura Kuenssberg: Is harmony about to break out? Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem UK looks likely to trigger Article 16 - then what? What is Article 16 and why does it matter? In aninterview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg,Mr Martin admitted feeling ""frustrated"" that the issue had hindered the ""full flowering"" of the two sides' alliance. And he warned the UK against acting unilaterally, saying it would ""undermine"" relationships. The Taoiseach's comments come ahead of a meeting between the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost and the EU Commission Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ in Brussels on Friday aimed at resolving problems arising from the protocol. Speaking immediately before his meeting with Lord Frost, Mr Å efÄoviÄ warned the post-Brexit trade deal was ""intrinsically linked"" to settling the protocol, adding: ""One cannot exist without the other"". He ruled out a renegotiation of the protocol, insisting solutions were available within its framework, which could ""become reality if the UK plays its part"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ welcomed what he said was a ""change in tone"" from the UK during the negotiations, adding that he hoped ""actions will follow the words"". Ahead of the meeting, Lord Frost told reporters there were still ""significant gaps"" between the two sides Arriving for the talks, Lord Frost told reporters he was ""very much"" looking forward to seeing if progress could be made, adding that his preference was for a ""negotiated"" way through the problem, but if not, Article 16 of the protocol remained on the table. The article allows either side to suspend any part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that causes ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". If the UK did trigger Article 16, the EU could respond by imposing tariffs on trade between the two sides. Lord Frost warned there were still ""quite significant gaps"" between the two sides but welcomed the Taoiseach's comment about the EU's ""serious intent"" to resolve the difficulties. Loyalist demonstrators protesting against the Northern Ireland protocol in Belfast earlier this year In his BBC interview, Mr Martin insisted there was ""not an abundance of checks"" on the border and that Northern Ireland benefitted from having access to both the European and UK markets. However, he added that the EU ""sincerely"" wanted to engage with the problems, which he said could be ""resolved with goodwill on all sides"". He acknowledged that ""there have been periods during these talks when they've dragged on with very little happening"" but added that ""now there's a bit of engagement, of serious intent"". Mr Martin said the protocol was ""never going to be perfect"", adding: ""It's important that we don't allow perfect become the enemy of the good."" He also urged the prime minister to believe that Brussels' offer of compromise was genuine and urged him not to take too long to move towards a deal saying ""don't leave it to Christmas Eve this year"" - a reference to last year's Brexit deal which was agreed on 24 December. Mr Martin is an affable kind of politician. UK ministers talk well of him in private. And clearly, like many leaders around the continent, and indeed like Downing Street, he would rather that a deal was done. It seems that he himself, having warned only a couple of weeks ago that the UK's threatened course of action would be ""reckless"" and ""unwise"", has concluded that it's wiser in contrast, to play down the tensions, to talk up the chances of a deal. But there's still a rub. Read more from Laura Earlier this month, Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warned that the whole post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU could collapse over the Northern Ireland Protocol. But, Mr Martin suggested the ""mood music"" had since changed. ""A number of weeks ago there was a different atmosphere governing the situation and there was all sorts of rumours and vibes... since then, that has calmed down somewhat,"" he said. But he still warned the UK against acting ""unilaterally"", arguing it could ""undermine"" the two countries' relationship.

Firm offers staff unlimited leave to stop burnout,"Workers at a London stockbrokers will have unlimited holiday from next year to try to prevent staff burnout. Finncapp employees will have to take a minimum of four weeks leave plus two or three days every quarter. Unlimited paid holiday is a perk popular among some US tech firms but less so among financial services companies. For some companies it works well, increasing productivity, but others found staff took less time off. Finncapp, which also gives financial advice, has been ""exceptionally busy"" as City mergers and capital markets boom, chief executive Sam Smith told the BBC. Ms Smith said the company really started to notice how much mental health strain employees were under in February this year. On Zoom calls, people were getting frustrated and some were not wanting to communicate. ""People were fed up and had no resilience left because of having been in the pandemic for a long time,"" she said. Staff had worked very long hours from home in the pandemic, especially during lockdowns, and the ""lines between work and life became blurred"", Ms Smith said. ""There were no boundaries, no respite, it was just constant,"" she said, not only in her company but in others. FinnCap's boss Sam Smith says some staff were getting frustrated during Zoom calls And because everyone else was working, that put more pressure on people to just keep working, she said. By June, mental health pressures were starting to hit employees' physical health, with people taking time off, and the company decided to change its working practices. From 1 January, staff will have to take minimum leave, and that does not include time off to care for sick parents, children or pets, or time off for parents evenings or to deal with household problems such as a broken boiler. ""All these things are not holiday,"" Ms Smith said. The company decided to set out minimum amounts of leave that must be taken - which wasfirst reported by Bloomberg,external- as the fear was that just having a blanket policy of offering unlimited leave could backfire. That is what happened at software firm CharlieHR, where an unlimited leave policy led to staff not taking enough holiday. ""The reality is that it's not actually unlimited,"" chief operating officer Ben Gatelypreviously told the BBC. Other firms have been trying to deal with workplace stress by giving workers some time off. Dating app Bumbletemporarily closed its officesin June for a week to combat workplace stress. It brought in a policy where twice a year there is a week-long company-wide holiday. Employees have unlimited paid leave and UK workers must take 24 days holiday.

These updates were written by Alex Therrien, Douglas Faulkner, and Jennifer Meierhans. The page was edited by Hamish Mackay and Lauren Turner. From all of us, have a good evening We're going to be pausing our live coverage of the pandemic shortly. Here's a recap of what's been happening in the UK and around the world today: We've been reporting rising coronavirus cases in many European countries today but Italy's daily figures show a slight drop in new infections and deaths. Italy reported 48 coronavirus-related deaths today, against 69 yesterday, while the daily tally of new infections has fallen to 10,544 from 10,638. Italy has registered 133,082 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after the UK, and the ninth-highest in the world. The country has reported 4.9 million cases to date. Children aged five to 11 in Canada will be able to receive a coronavirus vaccine after the countryauthorised the use of the Pfizer jab for the age group. Trials of the vaccine among children show similar safety and efficacy results to those recorded in trials among people 16 to 25, according to Pfizer. Health Canada previously said it would only approve the vaccine for children if its analysis demonstrated benefits outweighed any possible risks. It is the first Covid-19 vaccine approved for this age group in Canada. Dr Supriya Sharma, a senior medical advisor with Health Canada, says  the move is good news for adults and children alike. ""It provides another tool to protect Canadians, and to the relief of many parents, will help bring back a degree of normality to children's lives."" Nearly 75% of all Canadians are fully vaccinated, according to Health Canada's most recent data, including 84% of those 12 and older. The widow of a Scottish government official who died after contracting Covid iscalling on the first minister to take immediate action against the hospital where he was being treated. Andrew Slorance, 49, went into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for cancer treatment a year ago but died nearly six weeks into his stay - with the cause of death listed as Covid pneumonia. His wife Louise believes he caught Covid and another infection there but that the details were concealed. She says she does not accept that the health board has been honest with her and has called on First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to step in to ""stop these type of events happening in the future"". Father-of-five Andrew was head of the Scottish government's response and communication unit, which was responsible for its handling of the Covid pandemic. After requesting a copy of his medical notes, Louise discovered her husband had also been treated for an infection caused by a fungus called aspergillus, which had not been discussed with either of them during his hospital stay. On Thursday, the first minister paid tribute to Andrew Slorance in the Scottish parliament and pledged to ensure his family would get the answers they are seeking. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde says infection control procedures at QEUH are ""rigorous and of the highest standard"" and they are providing support to the Scottish hospitals public inquiry. In the world of football, Manchester City playmaker Kevin de Bruyne will miss two gamesafter testing positive for Covid-19on his return from international duty. The 30-year-old will isolate for 10 days, meaning he will miss Sunday's Premier League match at home to Everton and Wednesday's Champions League game against Paris St-Germain. De Bruyne, who is vaccinated, scored for Belgium in their World Cup qualifying draw with Wales on Tuesday. ""The symptoms will be minor hopefully,"" says City manager Pep Guardiola. ""As soon as possible, he can come back. We do not worry about what we are going to miss. The person is more important. We have to help him and hope it goes well while he's isolated."" The UK has given a total of111,082,929Covid vaccinations, according to the latest government data. That's50,707,953first doses,46,108,608second doses and14,266,368booster or third doses. That means88.2%of the popualtion aged over 12 have had their first jab,80.2%have had their second and24.8%their third. There have been a further 44,242 coronavirus cases reported in the UK,the latest government figures show.,external There have also been another 157 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test. This video can not be played Swansea cinema owner dubs Covid passes 'hill I'm going to die on' As we reported earlier, a cinema in Wales has been ordered to close after refusing to comply with Welsh government rules which require customers to show Covid passes to attend. Anna Redfern, who owns Cinema & Co in Swansea, tells the BBC the law went against her principles. âIf Iâm going to die, that is the hill Iâm going to die on,"" Redfern says. Notices have since been pinned outside the premises, stating the business had not carried out a Covid risk assessment. The Welsh government says the use of Covid passes is required by law and not optional. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer has said he does not think the country is facing the prospect of another coronavirus lockdown. Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster, Sir Michael Bride says Northern Ireland is facing a very serious situation and some further restrictions may be required if efforts to suppress the current Covid-19 wave fail. He says it is unlikely a lockdown will be required because of the protection provided to the population by vaccinations. But he warns: ""If we don't act now and if we don't act decisively, unfortunately we may well be back advising the executive [Northern Ireland's devolved government] that further interventions are needed to prevent our health service being overwhelmed."" It comes as a number of countries in mainland Europe begin re-imposing restrictions in an attempt to curb a surge in cases. Earlier today, Austria announced it was going into a national lockdown. The rate at which coronavirus spreads - as measured by the R number - varies across the UK. In England, the latest R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sageis between 0.8 and 1,external. That means, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between eight and 10 others. In Northern Ireland it is estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.3 - meaning every 10 people with Covid will pass it on to between 11 and 13 others. An R value of 1 means that the total number of infections is stable. Here's how the R number looks across the UK and English regions. Czech Republic Prime Minister Andrej Babis has said his country will not be introducing a national lockdown or mandatory vaccines The Czech Republic will not be following the approach of its neighbour, Austria, in imposing a national lockdown and making vaccines mandatory, the country's Prime Minister Andrej Babis has said. The government has approved higher compensation for those in quarantine and a new round of testing in schools and firms. On Monday, new regulations will come into force in the country that target unvaccinated Czechs. A negative PCR test will no longer be sufficient to enter pubs or restaurants, use services or attend events. Proof of vaccination or previous infection will be the only way to access such facilities. There were more than 13,000 new recorded cases on Thursday. There are now 4,750 in hospital, with almost 700 in intensive care, and some rural facilities saying they are running low on intensive care unit capacity. An intensive care consultant says NHS staff are ""cracked but not broken"" ina moving open letter. Dr Matt Morgan, who works at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, read his letter onBBC Radio 4's Todaythis morning. Colleagues took to social media to thank him for having ""captured our mood"". In his letter he tells staff: ""You may be cracked, but not broken. ""You are still there. You still care. But now the helpers need help."" Describing the ""scaffold smiles"" to hide the pain of another long day at work, he advises worn-out NHS workers to ""fill the cracks with life outside work, your family, your hobbies, with things that make you feel more like you"".

Jenny HillBBC Berlin correspondent All bars, clubs and discos in Bavaria are to close for the next three weeks and there will be no Christmas markets in the German state this year, the regionâs prime minister has announced. Cultural and sporting events will restrict spectators to 25% of a venueâs capacity and those attending must be vaccinated or have recovered from an infection â but will also have to show a negative test. ""The situation is very, very serious and difficult,"" state premier Markus Soeder tells a news conference. Bavaria recorded a weekly incidence rate of 625.3 recorded infections per 100,000 people today, according to the Robert Koch Institute, up on the nationwide figure of 340.7. The famous Christmas market at Munich, Bavaria's state capital, had already been cancelled due to the resurgence of coronavirus. It normally attracts three million visitors a year. Waning immunity in adults could mean Covid cases ""really take off"" and extend the strain on the NHS, a scientist who advises the government on coronavirus says. Prof John Edmunds, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) tells BBC Radio 4's The World At One it is really important to boost immunity in older individuals so ""we might be able to avoid any significant fourth wave"". He says the UK is ahead of other parts of Europe - where the Covid-19 situation is worsening - due to the rollout of boosters and the level of infection, but warns over the length of pressure being heaped on the NHS. ""It has been [under strain] for months and months, and that's not going to ease up any time soon because this very high level of infection that we have now and we've had for months isn't going to decline significantly,"" he says. If you want to read more on this our health correspondent James Gallagher has taken a look at the issue of waning immunityhere. France is sending police reinforcements to its overseas territory of Guadeloupe in an effort to quell days of violent protests against coronavirus measures. The government says 200 officers will be deployed to the Caribbean island to restore order. Protests broke out on Monday when unions called for a general strike against France's Covid health pass and compulsory vaccinations for healthcare workers. Police clashed with demonstrators who blocked roads and set cars alight. A joint statement from the French interior and overseas ministers strongly condemned the violence. Anna Redfern, who manages the cinema in Swansea, says she will not be implementing passes for customers A cinema has been told to shut downafter its owner refused to ask for Covid passes. Earlier this week, Anna Redfern, owner of Cinema & Co in Swansea,said she would not be complying with the Welsh government rules. Notices were pinned outside the premises, stating the business had not carried out a Covid risk assessment. The owner confirmed to the BBC she has been told to close by Swansea council, but would not comment further. The Welsh government says the scheme, which requires proof of being fully vaccinated or having had a negative lateral flow test within 48 hours, played a key role in keeping people safe from the virus. The Covid pass scheme, which applies to anyone over the age of 18, has been in place since 11 October fornightclubs and large-scale events, but now also applies to theatres, concert halls and cinemas. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Austria will go into a national lockdown on Monday It wasnât supposed to be like this. There are only two ways for countries to slow the spread of
Covid - build up enough immunity or limit contact between other people. That wall of immunity â from a year of vaccination â is
facing its first real test as winter rolls in across Europe. It is already clear some countries â Austria being the most
notable - have not vaccinated enough and feel the âneedâ to go back to
restrictions that nobody âwantsâ. But it does not mean that every country is doomed to a
winter lockdown. Those that have vaccinated more, given boosters to more and
protected more of the vulnerable and elderly (who are the most likely to need
hospital care) have the best shot at a manageable winter. The impact of the UK having high levels of Covid through
autumn, which will have topped up immunity levels, will be closely watched
too. However, it is still only November. There are many dark
months to get through before the weather improves and makes it harder for Covid
to spread. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan The world's first known Covid-19 case was woman working at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan - not an accountant with no links to the place, according to a US study. The 41-year-old man was widely thought to be the first case because symptoms from dental work he had were confused with those from the virus he caught days later. A joint study by China and the World Health Organization (WHO) this yearall but ruled out the theory that Covid-19 originated in a laboratory. The report says the most likely hypothesis is that it infected humans naturally, and was probably transmitted from bats to humans through another animal but that further research was needed. Now a new study published in the journal Science says the seafood vendor is the earliest known case, as her symptoms started on 11 December 2019. When interviewed, the accountant reported that his Covid-19 symptoms started with a fever on 16 December. His illness reported on 8 December was a dental problem related to baby teeth retained into adulthood,the report says.,external Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent An international warrant has reportedly been issued for a group of 14 Dutch holidaymakers, who allegedly ran off after some of them tested positive for Covid-19. The local mayor of the Spanish village where they were staying has described their apparent flight as a ""surreal crime"". The Dutch tourists were supposed to quarantine in their accommodation, after five of them contracted the virus. The day after they were diagnosed, the Spanish health authorities reportedly discovered they had left isolation and vanished from the country house they'd been renting in the village of Navas del Madrono. The local authorities are understood to have issued an international warrant for their detainment.

Italy reported 48 coronavirus-related deaths today, against 69 yesterday, while the daily tally of new infections has fallen to 10,544 from 10,638. Italy has registered 133,082 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after the UK, and the ninth-highest in the world. The country has reported 4.9 million cases to date. Children aged five to 11 in Canada will be able to receive a coronavirus vaccine after the countryauthorised the use of the Pfizer jab for the age group. Trials of the vaccine among children show similar safety and efficacy results to those recorded in trials among people 16 to 25, according to Pfizer. Health Canada previously said it would only approve the vaccine for children if its analysis demonstrated benefits outweighed any possible risks. It is the first Covid-19 vaccine approved for this age group in Canada. Dr Supriya Sharma, a senior medical advisor with Health Canada, says  the move is good news for adults and children alike. ""It provides another tool to protect Canadians, and to the relief of many parents, will help bring back a degree of normality to children's lives."" Nearly 75% of all Canadians are fully vaccinated, according to Health Canada's most recent data, including 84% of those 12 and older. The widow of a Scottish government official who died after contracting Covid iscalling on the first minister to take immediate action against the hospital where he was being treated. Andrew Slorance, 49, went into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for cancer treatment a year ago but died nearly six weeks into his stay - with the cause of death listed as Covid pneumonia. His wife Louise believes he caught Covid and another infection there but that the details were concealed. She says she does not accept that the health board has been honest with her and has called on First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to step in to ""stop these type of events happening in the future"". Father-of-five Andrew was head of the Scottish government's response and communication unit, which was responsible for its handling of the Covid pandemic. After requesting a copy of his medical notes, Louise discovered her husband had also been treated for an infection caused by a fungus called aspergillus, which had not been discussed with either of them during his hospital stay. On Thursday, the first minister paid tribute to Andrew Slorance in the Scottish parliament and pledged to ensure his family would get the answers they are seeking. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde says infection control procedures at QEUH are ""rigorous and of the highest standard"" and they are providing support to the Scottish hospitals public inquiry. In the world of football, Manchester City playmaker Kevin de Bruyne will miss two gamesafter testing positive for Covid-19on his return from international duty. The 30-year-old will isolate for 10 days, meaning he will miss Sunday's Premier League match at home to Everton and Wednesday's Champions League game against Paris St-Germain. De Bruyne, who is vaccinated, scored for Belgium in their World Cup qualifying draw with Wales on Tuesday. ""The symptoms will be minor hopefully,"" says City manager Pep Guardiola. ""As soon as possible, he can come back. We do not worry about what we are going to miss. The person is more important. We have to help him and hope it goes well while he's isolated."" The UK has given a total of111,082,929Covid vaccinations, according to the latest government data. That's50,707,953first doses,46,108,608second doses and14,266,368booster or third doses. That means88.2%of the popualtion aged over 12 have had their first jab,80.2%have had their second and24.8%their third. There have been a further 44,242 coronavirus cases reported in the UK,the latest government figures show.,external There have also been another 157 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test.

Anna Redfern, who owns Cinema & Co in Swansea, tells the BBC the law went against her principles. âIf Iâm going to die, that is the hill Iâm going to die on,"" Redfern says. Notices have since been pinned outside the premises, stating the business had not carried out a Covid risk assessment. The Welsh government says the use of Covid passes is required by law and not optional. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer has said he does not think the country is facing the prospect of another coronavirus lockdown. Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster, Sir Michael Bride says Northern Ireland is facing a very serious situation and some further restrictions may be required if efforts to suppress the current Covid-19 wave fail. He says it is unlikely a lockdown will be required because of the protection provided to the population by vaccinations. But he warns: ""If we don't act now and if we don't act decisively, unfortunately we may well be back advising the executive [Northern Ireland's devolved government] that further interventions are needed to prevent our health service being overwhelmed."" It comes as a number of countries in mainland Europe begin re-imposing restrictions in an attempt to curb a surge in cases. Earlier today, Austria announced it was going into a national lockdown. The rate at which coronavirus spreads - as measured by the R number - varies across the UK. In England, the latest R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sageis between 0.8 and 1,external. That means, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between eight and 10 others. In Northern Ireland it is estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.3 - meaning every 10 people with Covid will pass it on to between 11 and 13 others. An R value of 1 means that the total number of infections is stable. Here's how the R number looks across the UK and English regions. Czech Republic Prime Minister Andrej Babis has said his country will not be introducing a national lockdown or mandatory vaccines The Czech Republic will not be following the approach of its neighbour, Austria, in imposing a national lockdown and making vaccines mandatory, the country's Prime Minister Andrej Babis has said. The government has approved higher compensation for those in quarantine and a new round of testing in schools and firms. On Monday, new regulations will come into force in the country that target unvaccinated Czechs. A negative PCR test will no longer be sufficient to enter pubs or restaurants, use services or attend events. Proof of vaccination or previous infection will be the only way to access such facilities. There were more than 13,000 new recorded cases on Thursday. There are now 4,750 in hospital, with almost 700 in intensive care, and some rural facilities saying they are running low on intensive care unit capacity. An intensive care consultant says NHS staff are ""cracked but not broken"" ina moving open letter. Dr Matt Morgan, who works at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, read his letter onBBC Radio 4's Todaythis morning. Colleagues took to social media to thank him for having ""captured our mood"". In his letter he tells staff: ""You may be cracked, but not broken. ""You are still there. You still care. But now the helpers need help."" Describing the ""scaffold smiles"" to hide the pain of another long day at work, he advises worn-out NHS workers to ""fill the cracks with life outside work, your family, your hobbies, with things that make you feel more like you"".

Jenny HillBBC Berlin correspondent All bars, clubs and discos in Bavaria are to close for the next three weeks and there will be no Christmas markets in the German state this year, the regionâs prime minister has announced. Cultural and sporting events will restrict spectators to 25% of a venueâs capacity and those attending must be vaccinated or have recovered from an infection â but will also have to show a negative test. ""The situation is very, very serious and difficult,"" state premier Markus Soeder tells a news conference. Bavaria recorded a weekly incidence rate of 625.3 recorded infections per 100,000 people today, according to the Robert Koch Institute, up on the nationwide figure of 340.7. The famous Christmas market at Munich, Bavaria's state capital, had already been cancelled due to the resurgence of coronavirus. It normally attracts three million visitors a year. Waning immunity in adults could mean Covid cases ""really take off"" and extend the strain on the NHS, a scientist who advises the government on coronavirus says. Prof John Edmunds, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) tells BBC Radio 4's The World At One it is really important to boost immunity in older individuals so ""we might be able to avoid any significant fourth wave"". He says the UK is ahead of other parts of Europe - where the Covid-19 situation is worsening - due to the rollout of boosters and the level of infection, but warns over the length of pressure being heaped on the NHS. ""It has been [under strain] for months and months, and that's not going to ease up any time soon because this very high level of infection that we have now and we've had for months isn't going to decline significantly,"" he says. If you want to read more on this our health correspondent James Gallagher has taken a look at the issue of waning immunityhere. France is sending police reinforcements to its overseas territory of Guadeloupe in an effort to quell days of violent protests against coronavirus measures. The government says 200 officers will be deployed to the Caribbean island to restore order. Protests broke out on Monday when unions called for a general strike against France's Covid health pass and compulsory vaccinations for healthcare workers. Police clashed with demonstrators who blocked roads and set cars alight. A joint statement from the French interior and overseas ministers strongly condemned the violence. Anna Redfern, who manages the cinema in Swansea, says she will not be implementing passes for customers A cinema has been told to shut downafter its owner refused to ask for Covid passes. Earlier this week, Anna Redfern, owner of Cinema & Co in Swansea,said she would not be complying with the Welsh government rules. Notices were pinned outside the premises, stating the business had not carried out a Covid risk assessment. The owner confirmed to the BBC she has been told to close by Swansea council, but would not comment further. The Welsh government says the scheme, which requires proof of being fully vaccinated or having had a negative lateral flow test within 48 hours, played a key role in keeping people safe from the virus. The Covid pass scheme, which applies to anyone over the age of 18, has been in place since 11 October fornightclubs and large-scale events, but now also applies to theatres, concert halls and cinemas. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Austria will go into a national lockdown on Monday It wasnât supposed to be like this. There are only two ways for countries to slow the spread of
Covid - build up enough immunity or limit contact between other people. That wall of immunity â from a year of vaccination â is
facing its first real test as winter rolls in across Europe. It is already clear some countries â Austria being the most
notable - have not vaccinated enough and feel the âneedâ to go back to
restrictions that nobody âwantsâ. But it does not mean that every country is doomed to a
winter lockdown. Those that have vaccinated more, given boosters to more and
protected more of the vulnerable and elderly (who are the most likely to need
hospital care) have the best shot at a manageable winter. The impact of the UK having high levels of Covid through
autumn, which will have topped up immunity levels, will be closely watched
too. However, it is still only November. There are many dark
months to get through before the weather improves and makes it harder for Covid
to spread. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan The world's first known Covid-19 case was woman working at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan - not an accountant with no links to the place, according to a US study. The 41-year-old man was widely thought to be the first case because symptoms from dental work he had were confused with those from the virus he caught days later. A joint study by China and the World Health Organization (WHO) this yearall but ruled out the theory that Covid-19 originated in a laboratory. The report says the most likely hypothesis is that it infected humans naturally, and was probably transmitted from bats to humans through another animal but that further research was needed. Now a new study published in the journal Science says the seafood vendor is the earliest known case, as her symptoms started on 11 December 2019. When interviewed, the accountant reported that his Covid-19 symptoms started with a fever on 16 December. His illness reported on 8 December was a dental problem related to baby teeth retained into adulthood,the report says.,external Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent An international warrant has reportedly been issued for a group of 14 Dutch holidaymakers, who allegedly ran off after some of them tested positive for Covid-19. The local mayor of the Spanish village where they were staying has described their apparent flight as a ""surreal crime"". The Dutch tourists were supposed to quarantine in their accommodation, after five of them contracted the virus. The day after they were diagnosed, the Spanish health authorities reportedly discovered they had left isolation and vanished from the country house they'd been renting in the village of Navas del Madrono. The local authorities are understood to have issued an international warrant for their detainment. The Dutch ministry of foreign affairs is aware of the media reports, but a representative tells the BBC they have not been contacted for consular assistance. Â© 2025 BBC.

Workers offered unlimited holiday to stop burnout,"Workers at a London stockbrokers will have unlimited holiday from next year to try to prevent staff burnout. Finncapp employees will have to take a minimum of four weeks leave plus two or three days every quarter. Unlimited paid holiday is a perk popular among some US tech firms but less so among financial services companies. For some companies it works well, increasing productivity, but others found staff took less time off. Finncapp, which also gives financial advice, has been ""exceptionally busy"" as City mergers and capital markets boom, chief executive Sam Smith told the BBC. Ms Smith said the company really started to notice how much mental health strain employees were under in February this year. On Zoom calls, people were getting frustrated and some were not wanting to communicate. ""People were fed up and had no resilience left because of having been in the pandemic for a long time,"" she said. Staff had worked very long hours from home in the pandemic, especially during lockdowns, and the ""lines between work and life became blurred"", Ms Smith said. ""There were no boundaries, no respite, it was just constant,"" she said, not only in her company but in others. FinnCap's boss Sam Smith says some staff were getting frustrated during Zoom calls And because everyone else was working, that put more pressure on people to just keep working, she said. By June, mental health pressures were starting to hit employees' physical health, with people taking time off, and the company decided to change its working practices. From 1 January, staff will have to take minimum leave, and that does not include time off to care for sick parents, children or pets, or time off for parents evenings or to deal with household problems such as a broken boiler. ""All these things are not holiday,"" Ms Smith said. The company decided to set out minimum amounts of leave that must be taken - which wasfirst reported by Bloomberg,external- as the fear was that just having a blanket policy of offering unlimited leave could backfire. That is what happened at software firm CharlieHR, where an unlimited leave policy led to staff not taking enough holiday. ""The reality is that it's not actually unlimited,"" chief operating officer Ben Gatelypreviously told the BBC. Other firms have been trying to deal with workplace stress by giving workers some time off. Dating app Bumbletemporarily closed its officesin June for a week to combat workplace stress. It brought in a policy where twice a year there is a week-long company-wide holiday. Employees have unlimited paid leave and UK workers must take 24 days holiday. ""Our teams were expressing Zoom fatigue, as well as actual burnout,"" said Tariq Shaukat, president of Bumble.

Calls to raise minimum unit alcohol price to 65p,"A group has called for the minimum unit price of alcohol to be raised from 50p to 65p A group of charities and medical experts have urged the Scottish government to increase the minimum unit price (MUP) of alcohol from 50p to 65p. The group argue that the positive effects of the policy will have been affected by inflation and the pandemic. The policy sets a floor price for drinks depending on how many units of alcohol they contain. At First Minister's Questions Nicola Sturgeon said the level of the price would be kept under review. An MUP of 65p would see a cheap litre of vodka at 37.5% ABV (alcohol by volume) increase in price from at least Â£18.75 to Â£24.38. Minimum unit alcohol price has 'lasting impact' Minimum alcohol pricing had 'minimal crime impact' Five things we know from the alcohol death figures The group calling for the change is made up of 28 organisations, including health and children's charities and a number of medical royal colleges. In a letter to the Scottish government, they say inflation will have ""significantly eroded"" the effect of MUP, while the pandemic may have eliminated any health improvement in the population. They argued that since the policy was introduced in 2018, Scotland has seen a reduction in alcohol consumption and decreases in hospital admissions from alcohol-related liver conditions. Alcohol Focus Scotland said that although there was a 10% decrease in alcohol related deaths in 2019,they rose by 17% in 2020to their highest level in more than a decade. Chief executive Alison Douglas blamed changing drinking habits during the pandemic for the increase. ""We've seen that minimum unit pricing can have a positive effect,"" she said. ""We need to off-set both the effects of inflation and of the pandemic, and adjust the minimum unit price to a level that will save more lives and prevent a new generation from developing an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. ""We urge the Scottish government to take action now and raise the minimum unit price to at least 65p."" The Scottish government committed to review the minimum unit price two years after it began, but this was delayed due to the pandemic. Dr Alastair MacGilchrist, who is chairman of Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems (SHAAP), said Scotland could ""not afford"" to wait any longer. He added: ""This support from a wide range of organisations shows that experts in public health and beyond believe increasing the minimum unit price is the right thing to do."" Dr MacGilchrist said he believed there had to be a ""sweet spot"" when setting the MUP for it to have the greatest impact. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""If you set it too low it's not gong to be effective, but if you set it too high it's going to have an unfair impact on moderate drinkers. ""We think that to at least 65p would be the correct level just now and would certainly save lives."" The level of alcohol MUP was initially set in 2012, with the introduction of the policy delayed by a lengthy legal challenge in the years before its introduction. In May a study found MUP had had a lasting impact in Scotland, and that alcohol sales had fallen by 8%. According to the research, the impact was mainly seen in households that bought the most alcohol - but the exception was in high-purchasing, low-income homes, who did not seem to change their habits. Walesintroduced the policy last Marchand campaigners have called for it to be implemented in England and Northern Ireland. TheRepublic of Ireland is due to introduce its own MUP policy on 1 January 2022. Asked about MUP at First Minister's Questions on Thursday, Ms Sturgeon said an evaluation into pricing was ""ongoing"". She said a Public Health Scotland report on the issue was due to be published in 2023 and noted any change must have a ""robust evidence base"". She added the UK government's Internal Market Act was a source of ""great concern"" as it may affect the ability to adjust prices. A Scottish government spokesperson added: ""We continue to gather evidence and analyse the impact the policy has had since its introduction in 2018. ""Prior to the pandemic, we were seeing early encouraging signs of a reduction in alcohol sales and a reduction in alcohol specific deaths. ""The pandemic and the changed legal landscape post-Brexit are two significant events that are impacting on this work and must be factored into the analysis.""

Millions sent to allies of Congo ex-leader - leak,"Joseph Kabila was president of DR Congo from 2001-2019 Companies owned by family and friends of former Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila had millions of dollars of public funds funnelled through their bank accounts, according to Africa's biggest data leak. The money was transferred to the companies' accounts at the Congolese arm of the BGFI bank. Millions of dollars in cash were then taken out of the accounts. Mr Kabila was president at the time of the bank transfers. In a statement published online, he called the reports ""unfounded accusations"". The leak included more than three million documents and information on millions of transactions from the BGFI (Banque Gabonaise et FranÃ§aise Internationale) bank, which works in several African countries and France. Online French investigative journal Mediapart and the NGO Platform to Protect Whistleblowers in Africa (PPLAAF) obtained the information. BBC Africa Eye had access to the evidence, as part of a consortium called Congo Hold-up, co-ordinated by the media network European Investigative Collaborations (EIC). The investigation raises questions about who benefitted from the money transfers and possible conflicts of interests. The managing director of BGFI's DR Congo subsidiary, BGFI Banque RDC, from 2012 to 2018 was Francis Selemani, Joseph Kabila's foster-brother. Mr Kabila's sister, Gloria Mteyu, owned 40% of BGFI's DR Congo operation, which was set up in 2010. One privately owned company, Sud Oil, was shown to have received nearly $86m in public funds from November 2013 to August 2017. These include at least $46m from the DR Congo banking regulator, BCC, $15m from the state mining company GÃ©camines, and $1.3m from the country's electoral body, Ceni. The only information the BBC found from the leak concerning these payments was an invoice for just over $1m from Ceni to Sud Oil for petroleum products. The electoral commission, Ceni, paid Sud Oil $1m for petroleum products The BBC found no evidence Sud Oil was trading in petroleum products at the time. Mr Selemani's wife, Aneth Lutale, owned 80% of Sud Oil and Mrs Mteyu owned the remaining 20% from 2013 to 2018. Millions of dollars were transferred out of Sud Oil's BGFI accounts to other private companies' BGFI accounts. Some of these were owned by relatives or business associates of Mr Kabila, who was president from 2001-2019. One of these companies, Kwanza Capital, was majority owned by Congolese businessman Pascal Kinduelo, with Sud Oil taking a minority stake. Mr Kinduelo was chair of BGFI Bank RDC at the time. Mr Kinduelo was also a former owner of Sud Oil, before transferring ownership. The investigation found the bank allowed many high-value cash withdrawals from Sud Oil accounts, including one for $6 million. By law a maximum of $10,000 is allowed to be withdrawn in cash per day. This limit can only be breached for specific, documented purposes, such as national emergency or defence reasons. BBC Africa Eye found no evidence in the leak that correct procedures were followed in these instances. These cash withdrawals from Sud Oil accounts totalled at least $50 million covering a four-year period. Once the money was withdrawn, it is believed to have become untraceable. Our investigation was only able to establish that Sud Oil, for the period 2013 to 2018, had one employee, managing director David Ezekiel, and a small office in the capital Kinshasa as its address. In October 2013 Sud Oil purchased a real estate complex in the capital for $12m, basing the company there. It also had a contract with BGFI Banque RDC to provide new vehicles to several of its senior management, including Mr Selemani. It charged $70,000 to provide his four-wheel drive car. BBC Africa Eye found no evidence of any other business activities. The investigation had access to an internal BGFI audit, completed in July 2018, heavily criticising the bank's DR Congo operation. The audit was never meant to be made public. It gave a score of ""very high risk"" for the DR Congo subsidiary. It also referenced a lack of integrity and transparency in the declaration of conflicts of interest and compliance in its operations with clients. The audit named Mr Selemani as having at least 16 declared conflicts of interest, including links to private companies holding accounts at the bank. It also highlighted several high-value transactions by Sud Oil. Two weeks after the report was complete, Mr Selemani was moved to a new role at BGFI's head office in Gabon. He reportedly received $1.4m on leaving BGFI Banque RDC. He is reported to have left BGFI in November 2018. Sud Oil changed ownership in 2018  and Kwanza Capital was closed down the same year. Mrs Mteyu is understood to have given up her 40% stake in BGFI Banque RDC. BBC Africa Eye contacted BGFI, Joseph Kabila, Francis Selemani, Aneth Lutale, David Ezekiel and Gloria Mteyu over the information contained in the leak. None responded to our questions. We also contacted Pascal Kinduelo, who declined to respond. Gecamines and BCC did not reply to the BBC's requests for a response. The head of Ceni at the time of its dealings with Sud Oil, Corneille Nangaa, declined to comment on the payment, citing parliamentary confidentiality rules.

Serious EU intent to fix NI border row - Irish PM,"This video can not be played What's the Irish PM's message to the UK? There is ""serious intent"" in the EU to solve post-Brexit difficulties over the Northern Ireland border, Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin has said. Speaking to the BBC, he said the ""mood music"" surrounding EU-UK negotiations had improved in recent weeks. The Northern Ireland Protocol in the Brexit deal aims to avoid implementing border checks on the island of Ireland. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But the protocol also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, meaning some goods such as meat and eggs are subject to checks when they enter Northern Ireland from Great Britain. This has angered some Northern Irish politicians, including DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who said the protocol was disrupting businesses and harming trade. Laura Kuenssberg: Is harmony about to break out? Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem UK looks likely to trigger Article 16 - then what? What is Article 16 and why does it matter? In aninterview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg,Mr Martin admitted feeling ""frustrated"" that the issue had hindered the ""full flowering"" of the two sides' alliance. And he warned the UK against acting unilaterally, saying it would ""undermine"" relationships. The Taoiseach's comments come ahead of a meeting between the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost and the EU Commission Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ in Brussels on Friday aimed at resolving problems arising from the protocol. Speaking immediately before his meeting with Lord Frost, Mr Å efÄoviÄ warned the post-Brexit trade deal was ""intrinsically linked"" to settling the protocol, adding: ""One cannot exist without the other"". He ruled out a renegotiation of the protocol, insisting solutions were available within its framework, which could ""become reality if the UK plays its part"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ welcomed what he said was a ""change in tone"" from the UK during the negotiations, adding that he hoped ""actions will follow the words"". Ahead of the meeting, Lord Frost told reporters there were still ""significant gaps"" between the two sides Arriving for the talks, Lord Frost told reporters he was ""very much"" looking forward to seeing if progress could be made, adding that his preference was for a ""negotiated"" way through the problem, but if not, Article 16 of the protocol remained on the table. The article allows either side to suspend any part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that causes ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". If the UK did trigger Article 16, the EU could respond by imposing tariffs on trade between the two sides. Lord Frost warned there were still ""quite significant gaps"" between the two sides but welcomed the Taoiseach's comment about the EU's ""serious intent"" to resolve the difficulties. Loyalist demonstrators protesting against the Northern Ireland protocol in Belfast earlier this year In his BBC interview, Mr Martin insisted there was ""not an abundance of checks"" on the border and that Northern Ireland benefitted from having access to both the European and UK markets. However, he added that the EU ""sincerely"" wanted to engage with the problems, which he said could be ""resolved with goodwill on all sides"". He acknowledged that ""there have been periods during these talks when they've dragged on with very little happening"" but added that ""now there's a bit of engagement, of serious intent"". Mr Martin said the protocol was ""never going to be perfect"", adding: ""It's important that we don't allow perfect become the enemy of the good."" He also urged the prime minister to believe that Brussels' offer of compromise was genuine and urged him not to take too long to move towards a deal saying ""don't leave it to Christmas Eve this year"" - a reference to last year's Brexit deal which was agreed on 24 December. Mr Martin is an affable kind of politician. UK ministers talk well of him in private. And clearly, like many leaders around the continent, and indeed like Downing Street, he would rather that a deal was done. It seems that he himself, having warned only a couple of weeks ago that the UK's threatened course of action would be ""reckless"" and ""unwise"", has concluded that it's wiser in contrast, to play down the tensions, to talk up the chances of a deal. But there's still a rub. Read more from Laura Earlier this month, Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warned that the whole post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU could collapse over the Northern Ireland Protocol. But, Mr Martin suggested the ""mood music"" had since changed. ""A number of weeks ago there was a different atmosphere governing the situation and there was all sorts of rumours and vibes... since then, that has calmed down somewhat,"" he said.

Bowie and Queen photographer Mick Rock dies,"Mick Rock was David Bowie's preferred photographer and videographer Mick Rock, the photographer who took iconic images of stars like David Bowie and Queen, has died at the age of 72. Once dubbed ""the man who shot the 70s"", Rock also worked with the likes of Iggy Pop, Blondie, Lou Reed. A statement on his Twitter page,externalread: ""It is with the heaviest of hearts that we share our beloved psychedelic renegade Mick Rock has made the Jungian journey to the other side."" Sharon Osbournepaid tribute,external, saying his work would ""live on forever"". She added: ""We lost a legend, a true artist Mick Rock."" Her husband Ozzy Osbourne was among the other stars who Rock captured, along with Pink Floyd and their former singer Syd Barrett, T-Rex's Marc Bolan and the Sex Pistols. Rock's famous album covers included a shot of Queen with their faces lit up against a black background for Queen II; the stark black-and-white photo for Reed's Transformer; and a shirtless Iggy Pop for The Stooges' Raw Power. Rock in 2004 with one of his photos of Blondie's Debbie Harry The statement continued: ""Those who had the pleasure of existing in his orbit know that Mick was always so much more than 'The Man Who Shot the 70s'. ""He was a photographic poet - a true force of nature who spent his days doing exactly what he loved, always in his own delightfully outrageous way."" It noted how ""the stars seemed to effortlessly align for Mick when he was behind the camera"", describing him as ""a man fascinated with image"", who created ""some of the most magnificent images rock music has ever seen"". Bowie's former bandmateMike Garson said,externalhe was ""so sad"" to hear of Rock's death, writing: ""He was one of a kind with such an eye for aesthetics and seizing the right moments. ""He was also quite fun to travel with back in the days of the Spiders [From Mars]. Mick gave so much to this planet and he adored David. Mick's journey shall continue."" As well as being Bowie's official photographer, he also directed videos for Jean Genie and Space Oddity. He went on to work with modern artists like Miley Cyrus, Lady Gaga, Snoop Dogg and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Rock said Lou Reed (left) and David Bowie were ""true friends and true heroes"" Rock was born in London in 1948 and studied at Cambridge University, where he started to take photographs of local gigs and made contacts including Cambridge native Barrett and Mick Jagger's younger brother Chris. His own life was caught on camera in Barnaby Clay's 2016 film Shot! The Psycho-Spiritual Mantra of Rock, which Rock dedicated to ""the timeless genius of David Bowie and Lou Reed"". ""They made an important contribution to the development of my own sensibility,""he told Rolling Stone,externalin 2017. ""When I was having trouble, they both helped me out financially. They bought my prints. When I was in the hospital for my heart bypass surgery, the first flowers that were there waiting for me were from Lou and David."" Paying tribute, Charlatans frontmanTim Burgess said,externalRock ""made music look so exciting"".

"Social media has been hijacked, Dorries says","This video can not be played Nadine Dorries says critics of her appointment were ""misogynistic"" Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has said people have become afraid to say what they think for fear of being ""cancelled"", and that left-wing activists have ""hijacked"" social media. In her first TV interview since taking the job, she said she does not plan ""to charge out on a culture war battle"". She criticised online campaigners for frightening young people ""who actually do want to engage"" in serious debate. She also described negative reaction to her new role as ""quite misogynistic"". After her appointment in September, comedianDom Joly said,externalit was ""like the result of some drunk bet"" while fellow comicMark Thomas said,externalDorries, who is also a successful author, had ""written more books"" than she had read. ""People were making these comments for political attack and nothing else,"" she told BBC culture editor Katie Razzall. ""I just found them thoroughly unpleasant."" As culture secretary, her in-tray includes deciding whether to privatise Channel 4, introducing a law protecting young people from harms online and setting the BBC's funding by deciding the level of the licence fee until 2027. This video can not be played Dorries says ""hard discussions"" are needed about the BBC Dorries has previously said the corporation needs ""real change"". She told Razzall the BBC was ""the best of British"", but how it competes with streaming giants and how it is funded after 2027 will be ""discussions for the future"". She also welcomeddirector general Tim Davie's recent 10-point planto deal with ""issues like a lack of impartiality"". ""I think they've made a good attempt to start dealing with some of these issues,"" she said. Since this interview with Dorries took place, she has defended deleting a tweet in response to the BBC's Political Editor, Laura Kuenssberg, which the culture secretary later denied was a ""rebuke"" for reporting criticism of the prime minister from an unnamed Conservative MP. On Friday, Dorries also announced a further Â£107m as part of the Culture Recovery Fund to help almost 1,000 arts and heritage organisations continue their recovery from the pandemic. Last month,The Observer described Dorries,externalas the ""minister for culture wars"". But in the interview, Dorries said that was ""what other people say about me, not what I say"". She explained: ""Sometimes I think we just need to tone down the condemnation and the judgement, and evaluate and engage a little bit more than we do. I think social media probably contributes a lot to this. ""People are afraid because of the amplification in the echo chambers of social media."" This video can not be played Dorries discusses her top priority as culture secretary The culture secretary has been outspoken on social media herself in the past,and her remarks got short shrift from those who pointed to her own record. LBC presenter James O'Brien, who has previously exchanged insults with Dorriesin the press,externalandon Twitter,external,said on Friday,externalthat she ""is part of the problem of online abuse"". Former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Woodwrote that,externalthe culture secretary ""is gaslighting us"". Gaslighting refers to psychological manipulation to make someone question what's true or real. Dorries told the BBC her own strident posts are aimed at campaigners ""on the left who have hijacked that space"" rather than people who ""do want to talk about these issues seriously"". As a backbencher in 2017, Dorries famously wrote on Twitter that ""left-wing snowflakes are killing comedy"". She stood by that comment, noting that some comedians had recently expressed concerns that they could no longer make light of certain subjects. ""I just said it first,"" she told the BBC. She also said she doesn't agree with removing statues and other memorials connected to the slave trade and other aspects of history, such asthe Bank of England's removal,externalof paintings and busts of past governors and directors. ""You can't, with this whole cancel culture, wipe it all out like it didn't happen and pretend it didn't exist,"" she said. ""You can't wipe away our history, either the good or the bad."" The bank said in response it would feature the portraits in a future Bank of England exhibition ""in their appropriate context"". It added it has appointed a researcher to work in its museum to ""examine in detail the bank's historic links to the transatlantic slave trade"". Dorries grew up in one of the poorest parts of Liverpool, and said her priority is to help young people from backgrounds like hers to get involved in arts, culture and sport. ""Those people in those backgrounds are of every colour and every sexuality, but are we looking after everybody when we talk about diversity?"" she said. Her reputation precedes her - as a politician who shoots from the hip, who has previously got into fairly heated Twitter rows with detractors, and who has been dubbed in some quarters the ""minister for culture wars"". Ahead of our meeting at the Young Vic theatre in London, one MP even told me to ""strap yourself in for that interview"". She's a far more interesting culture secretary than many who have gone before, not least because she's sold more than two million books. She may also be right that the critical reaction to her appointment from some in the sector was sexist and snobbish. Some of her responses about how we all need to be kinder and listen a bit more to each other will raise eyebrows and worse. She's not known as someone who is kind to people on social media, or as someone who listens to those with different views. People are already accusing her of hypocrisy. And clearly if you blame the left, as she did in the interview, you are being political, sticking the boot in to the opposition. Her professed mission - to widen access to the cultural and sporting world - felt sincere. She's not the first to say it. But the difference is she speaks with authenticity as a result of her personal experiences. She's levelled up personally, rewarded with a cabinet job after intense loyalty to Boris Johnson. But as the 10th culture secretary in 10 years, will she be around for long enough to make a difference? The Â£107m Culture Recovery Fund money that was announced on Friday will help 925 theatres, museums, cinemas and other cultural venues and organisations ""through the recovery period"", Dorries said. The recipients include Leeds Grand Theatre, English National Ballet and The Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury, Kent, which have all received at least Â£1m each. ""Make no mistake about this. Many theatres would not be standing today if the government hadn't supported them over the last 20 months,"" she said. The unlikely rise of Nadine Dorries New culture secretary says BBC needs real change Some commercial theatre operators like Sir Cameron Mackintosh did not receive emergency funding, but those who applied opened their accounts to the Treasury, she said. ""You'll hear some people in the theatre sector say, 'We didn't get any of that money', but they are still standing and they are still running with plays back up, which actually is testament to the fact that they didn't need the funding, because they are still here. They have private investors."" Dorries is also working on the new Online Safety Bill, which will require social media platforms to remove harmful content quickly or potentially face multi-billion-pound fines or even jail time for executives. She told them to get ready. ""They've had notice. They've got fair warning,"" she said. ""This bill is coming. Abide by your terms and conditions now. Remove your harmful algorithms now.""

"ED overcrowding causes excess deaths, report claimsThe figure is calculated in a UK-wide report on emergency departments between 2020 and 2021.Northern Ireland","More than 500 excess deaths may have occurred in Northern Ireland's emergency departments between 2020 and 2021 due to crowding, a report has said. The findings are from a Royal College of Emergency Medicine report. Excess deaths are a measure of how many more people died than would be expected based on figures from previous years. The Department of Health said it would study the report carefully, adding patient safety was its priority. The UK-wide report, which looked at the harm crowding has on patients, calculated the Northern Ireland figure using a mathematical model. Emergency department overcrowding has made headlines recentlyas UK hospitals struggle to cope with rising numbers. The report, which also examined the impact of prolonged waits, said that crowding has always been ""unconscionable"". It said the figures for across the UK ""lay bare the reality that lives are being lost to an issue that could be eradicated for good"". It calculated that as many as 566 excess deaths could have occurred in Northern Ireland between 2020 and 2021. While they cannot confirm at this stage the actual number, the report also suggested that, in time and with further research, the figure could prove to be higher. 2020 saw a huge and unexpected rise in deaths because of the pandemic. The president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in Northern Ireland, Dr Paul Kerr, told BBC News NI that the findings should be ""treated with caution"". ""These figures are concerning,"" he said. ""However the calculation of the extra deaths associated with prolonged waits in emergency departments is complex and the methodology used in NHS England may not be directly applicable to Northern Ireland,"" he added. ""We hope this early work will lead to further work specifically for local hospitals, which we have been recommending for some time, to give a better insight into the harm caused by crowding and long waits for admission,"" he said. In a statement, the Department of Health said emergency departments continue to face ""sustained and severe pressures"". It said it had taken a range of actions to support them, including financial supports. ""The HSCB (Health and Social Care Board) is also working collaboratively with the Public Health Agency, the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service and the five provider Trusts to improve waiting times at our emergency departments, enhance flows through the system and facilitate timely discharge,"" the department said. The report, which specifically examines hospitals in England, calls on the government to restore bed capacity to what it was pre-pandemic. Hospital overcrowding caused deaths, say doctors Why the NHS is struggling like never before Ambulances diverted due to hospital pressures It said workforce planning is also essential, which must include actions to retain existing staff who are reaching burnout as well as efforts to recruit new staff. By applying mortality data and figures for those who waited between eight to 12 hours in an emergency department, the report estimated 303 excess deaths in Scotland, 709 in Wales and 4,519 in England. The report also said that what these figures do not show is the harm that may come to those waiting even longer than 12 hours.

Since this interview with Dorries took place, she has defended deleting a tweet in response to the BBC's Political Editor, Laura Kuenssberg, which the culture secretary later denied was a ""rebuke"" for reporting criticism of the prime minister from an unnamed Conservative MP. On Friday, Dorries also announced a further Â£107m as part of the Culture Recovery Fund to help almost 1,000 arts and heritage organisations continue their recovery from the pandemic. Last month,The Observer described Dorries,externalas the ""minister for culture wars"". But in the interview, Dorries said that was ""what other people say about me, not what I say"". She explained: ""Sometimes I think we just need to tone down the condemnation and the judgement, and evaluate and engage a little bit more than we do. I think social media probably contributes a lot to this. ""People are afraid because of the amplification in the echo chambers of social media."" This video can not be played Dorries discusses her top priority as culture secretary The culture secretary has been outspoken on social media herself in the past,and her remarks got short shrift from those who pointed to her own record. LBC presenter James O'Brien, who has previously exchanged insults with Dorriesin the press,externalandon Twitter,external,said on Friday,externalthat she ""is part of the problem of online abuse"". Former Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Woodwrote that,externalthe culture secretary ""is gaslighting us"". Gaslighting refers to psychological manipulation to make someone question what's true or real. Dorries told the BBC her own strident posts are aimed at campaigners ""on the left who have hijacked that space"" rather than people who ""do want to talk about these issues seriously"". As a backbencher in 2017, Dorries famously wrote on Twitter that ""left-wing snowflakes are killing comedy"". She stood by that comment, noting that some comedians had recently expressed concerns that they could no longer make light of certain subjects. ""I just said it first,"" she told the BBC. She also said she doesn't agree with removing statues and other memorials connected to the slave trade and other aspects of history, such asthe Bank of England's removal,externalof paintings and busts of past governors and directors. ""You can't, with this whole cancel culture, wipe it all out like it didn't happen and pretend it didn't exist,"" she said. ""You can't wipe away our history, either the good or the bad."" The bank said in response it would feature the portraits in a future Bank of England exhibition ""in their appropriate context"". It added it has appointed a researcher to work in its museum to ""examine in detail the bank's historic links to the transatlantic slave trade"". Dorries grew up in one of the poorest parts of Liverpool, and said her priority is to help young people from backgrounds like hers to get involved in arts, culture and sport. ""Those people in those backgrounds are of every colour and every sexuality, but are we looking after everybody when we talk about diversity?"" she said. Her reputation precedes her - as a politician who shoots from the hip, who has previously got into fairly heated Twitter rows with detractors, and who has been dubbed in some quarters the ""minister for culture wars"". Ahead of our meeting at the Young Vic theatre in London, one MP even told me to ""strap yourself in for that interview"". She's a far more interesting culture secretary than many who have gone before, not least because she's sold more than two million books. She may also be right that the critical reaction to her appointment from some in the sector was sexist and snobbish. Some of her responses about how we all need to be kinder and listen a bit more to each other will raise eyebrows and worse. She's not known as someone who is kind to people on social media, or as someone who listens to those with different views. People are already accusing her of hypocrisy. And clearly if you blame the left, as she did in the interview, you are being political, sticking the boot in to the opposition. Her professed mission - to widen access to the cultural and sporting world - felt sincere. She's not the first to say it. But the difference is she speaks with authenticity as a result of her personal experiences. She's levelled up personally, rewarded with a cabinet job after intense loyalty to Boris Johnson. But as the 10th culture secretary in 10 years, will she be around for long enough to make a difference? The Â£107m Culture Recovery Fund money that was announced on Friday will help 925 theatres, museums, cinemas and other cultural venues and organisations ""through the recovery period"", Dorries said. The recipients include Leeds Grand Theatre, English National Ballet and The Marlowe Theatre in Canterbury, Kent, which have all received at least Â£1m each. ""Make no mistake about this. Many theatres would not be standing today if the government hadn't supported them over the last 20 months,"" she said. The unlikely rise of Nadine Dorries New culture secretary says BBC needs real change Some commercial theatre operators like Sir Cameron Mackintosh did not receive emergency funding, but those who applied opened their accounts to the Treasury, she said. ""You'll hear some people in the theatre sector say, 'We didn't get any of that money', but they are still standing and they are still running with plays back up, which actually is testament to the fact that they didn't need the funding, because they are still here. They have private investors."" Dorries is also working on the new Online Safety Bill, which will require social media platforms to remove harmful content quickly or potentially face multi-billion-pound fines or even jail time for executives. She told them to get ready. ""They've had notice. They've got fair warning,"" she said. ""This bill is coming. Abide by your terms and conditions now. Remove your harmful algorithms now.""

Modi backs down after year-long farmer protests,"This video can not be played Farmers celebrating the repeal of controversial laws Indian PM Narendra Modi has announced the repeal of three controversial farm laws after a year of protests. Thousands of farmers had camped at Delhi's borders since last November and dozens died from heat, cold and Covid. Farmers say the laws will allow the entry of private players in farming and that will hurt their income. Friday's surprise announcement marks a major U-turn as the government had not taken any initiative to talk to farmers in recent months. And Mr Modi's ministers have been steadfastly insisting that the laws were good for farmers and there was no question of taking them back. Farm unions are seeing this as a huge victory. But experts say the upcoming state elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh - both have a huge base of farmers - may have forced the decision. The announcement on Friday morning came on a day Sikhs - the dominant community in Punjab - are celebrating the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism. How PM Modi misread the mood of India's farmers The defining image of farmers' protest in India In his nationally-televised address, Mr Modi said the farm laws were meant to strengthen the small farmers. ""But despite several attempts to explain the benefits to the farmers, we have failed. On the occasion of Guru Purab, the government has decided to repeal the three farm laws,"" he added. Taken together, they loosened rules around sale, pricing and storage of farm produce - rules that have protected India's farmers from the free market for decades. One of the biggest changes was that farmers were allowed to sell their produce at a market price directly to private players - agricultural businesses, supermarket chains and online grocers. Most Indian farmers currently sell the majority of their produce at government-controlled wholesale markets or mandis at assured floor prices (also known as minimum support price or MSP). The farmers were protesting on motorways connecting Delhi to other states The laws allowed private buyers to hoard food like rice, wheat and pulses for future sales, which only government-authorised agents could do earlier. What has brought India's farmers to the streets? How PM Modi misread the mood of India's farmers The reforms, at least on paper, gave farmers the option of selling outside of this so-called ""mandi system"". But the protesters said the laws would weaken the farmers and allow private players to dictate prices and control their fate. They said the MSP was keeping many farmers going and without it, many of them will struggle to survive. They said India's stringent laws around the sale of agricultural produce and high subsidies had protected farmers from market forces for decades and there was no need to change that. But the government argued that it was time to make farming profitable for even small farmers and the new laws were going to achieve that. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana are celebrating the news, raising flags of victory and distributing sweets. But they say the fight is not over. ""We have no faith in a verbal promise. Unless we see it in writing that the laws have actually been repealed, we will stay here,"" Raj Singh Chaudhary, a 99-year-old protester, told the BBC's Salman Ravi. Farmers celebrating at the Delhi-Singhu border Mr Chaudhary is among hundreds of farmers who have been striking at the Delhi-Ghazipur border for a year. His view was echoed by Rakesh Tikait, a prominent farmer leader who said they would call off the protest only after the laws were repealed in the winter session of parliament. Another farmer leader said they needed additional promises from the government around assured prices for their crops to end their protest. The announcement has stunned political observers as well as those who both support and oppose the laws - many tweeted saying it was a huge victory for the farmers and a ""major climbdown"" for Mr Modi. But some farm leaders and economists who saw merit in the laws have expressed disappointment over their repeal.  Anil Ghanwat, head of a farmers' union in western India, said it was an""unfortunate"" decision,externaldriven by political considerations. Opposition parties welcomed the decision, with Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi calling it ""a win against injustice"". And West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, took to social media to praise farmers and congratulate them. BJP members said the decision to repeal the laws had nothing to do with the polls and the decision was taken to end the protest. They did not say if there were plans to bring back the laws in another form later. Narendra Modi's decision to repeal the contentious farm laws is, at once, a strategic and political move and a belated admission of the government's haste and high-handedness. The laws had whipped up an unprecedented firestorm of protests in the states of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh and posed a real challenge to Mr Modi. They had mobilised farmers and civil society in Sikh-majority Punjab and spread to parts of Uttar Pradesh, states which will see key elections early next year. By repealing the laws, Mr Modi hopes to regain the confidence of the farmers in general and Sikhs in particular. It would also boost the BJP's chances in the polls. Click hereto read the full analysis. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella group of some 40 farmers' unions, had refused to back down despite appeals from the government to end their protest. Farmers continued to block motorways to Delhi through harsh winter and summer months and even through deadly Covid waves. They called for strikes across the country and dozens of them even died due to cold, heat and Covid. The government initially engaged with them and offered to put the laws in abeyance for two years. But after farmers rejected their overtures, the authorities retreated, preferring to go with the wait-and-watch attitude. Farmers have set up camps on motorways But two things changed in the last few months. First, the son of a federal minister allegedly drove his car into a group of protesting farmers in Lakhimpur in Uttar Pradesh in early October. He denied the allegation, but was arrested. Eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed in the incident which sparked outrage across the country and put the government on the back foot. Second, PM Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is up against strong regional parties in the upcoming elections in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and the government knows that angry farmers would hurt the BJP's chances of winning the crucial polls.

British troops to help at Poland-Belarus borderAbout 150 army engineers are to help reinforce the EU border after migrants tried to enter from Belarus.UK,"About 150 British army Royal Engineers will be sent to help reinforce Poland's border with Belarus, the defence secretary has said. The border is seen as an entry point to the EU, and there have been tensions in recent weeks with Belarus being accused of pushing migrants towards it. Ben Wallace said a small reconnaissance team of engineers had already been to the area to assess the situation. They would not be combat troops but ""guys with diggers"", he added. Belarus's long-time authoritarian leader, Alexander Lukashenko, denies facilitating the arrival of migrants and sending them towards the border with Poland in revenge forEU sanctions imposed in June. The crisis deepened on Tuesday when Polish forces used tear gas and water cannon to repel those trying to cross into the country. Some attempted to breach a heavily fortified crossing and threw missiles at the Polish forces, leaving several with injuries. Belarus moves migrants stuck in border stand-off Polish forces tear-gas migrants at Belarus border How are migrants getting to the border with Poland? Mr Wallace said the engineers would be dispatched ""within days or weeks"" but said he would first inform parliament about the planned deployment. Speaking to the BBC during a visit to Poland Mr Wallace said: ""What we will do is send some Royal Engineers - that is part of the Army designed for building or making fences or roads or putting in infrastructure. ""We are going to be using that part of our forces to help the Poles and potentially other Baltic states to secure their border."" He stressed the soldiers would not be combat troops but people with ""the ability to build roads and checkpoints and observation posts"", adding: ""This is not combat this is support to the Poles."" On the humanitarian situation, the defence secretary said: ""I'm particularly worried for the women and children and the vulnerable people who are being trafficked by the Belarusians into this game they seem to be playing. ""It's a horrendous thing to do to force migrants to be a tool in a game to try to destabilise their neighbours."" This video can not be played Watch the BBC's Steve Rosenberg at the scene of the chaos as water cannon and tear gas is used During his visit Mr Wallace visited British troops already stationed in Poland as part of Nato's Enhanced Forward Presence. He also signed an agreement in principle to sell Poland air defence missiles. Migrants have been living in camps in freezing conditions and with little food or water just inside Belarus, stranded between Polish guards on one side and Belarusian guards on the other. On Wednesday, after more than a week of stalemate, Belarus said it hadprovided temporary shelter for about 1,000 people. Poland, with EU backing, is determined not to let the migrants into the bloc and has warned that the situation may go on for months. It has also been accused of pushing people back across the border into Belarus, contrary to international rules of asylum. The European Commission has accused Belarus of promising easy entry to the EU. But Belarus has said it is trying to repatriate stranded migrants along the border, but that many have refused to return to their home countries.

""But despite several attempts to explain the benefits to the farmers, we have failed. On the occasion of Guru Purab, the government has decided to repeal the three farm laws,"" he added. Taken together, they loosened rules around sale, pricing and storage of farm produce - rules that have protected India's farmers from the free market for decades. One of the biggest changes was that farmers were allowed to sell their produce at a market price directly to private players - agricultural businesses, supermarket chains and online grocers. Most Indian farmers currently sell the majority of their produce at government-controlled wholesale markets or mandis at assured floor prices (also known as minimum support price or MSP). The farmers were protesting on motorways connecting Delhi to other states The laws allowed private buyers to hoard food like rice, wheat and pulses for future sales, which only government-authorised agents could do earlier. What has brought India's farmers to the streets? How PM Modi misread the mood of India's farmers The reforms, at least on paper, gave farmers the option of selling outside of this so-called ""mandi system"". But the protesters said the laws would weaken the farmers and allow private players to dictate prices and control their fate. They said the MSP was keeping many farmers going and without it, many of them will struggle to survive. They said India's stringent laws around the sale of agricultural produce and high subsidies had protected farmers from market forces for decades and there was no need to change that. But the government argued that it was time to make farming profitable for even small farmers and the new laws were going to achieve that. Farmers in Punjab and Haryana are celebrating the news, raising flags of victory and distributing sweets. But they say the fight is not over. ""We have no faith in a verbal promise. Unless we see it in writing that the laws have actually been repealed, we will stay here,"" Raj Singh Chaudhary, a 99-year-old protester, told the BBC's Salman Ravi. Farmers celebrating at the Delhi-Singhu border Mr Chaudhary is among hundreds of farmers who have been striking at the Delhi-Ghazipur border for a year. His view was echoed by Rakesh Tikait, a prominent farmer leader who said they would call off the protest only after the laws were repealed in the winter session of parliament. Another farmer leader said they needed additional promises from the government around assured prices for their crops to end their protest. The announcement has stunned political observers as well as those who both support and oppose the laws - many tweeted saying it was a huge victory for the farmers and a ""major climbdown"" for Mr Modi. But some farm leaders and economists who saw merit in the laws have expressed disappointment over their repeal.  Anil Ghanwat, head of a farmers' union in western India, said it was an""unfortunate"" decision,externaldriven by political considerations. Opposition parties welcomed the decision, with Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi calling it ""a win against injustice"". And West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, took to social media to praise farmers and congratulate them. BJP members said the decision to repeal the laws had nothing to do with the polls and the decision was taken to end the protest. They did not say if there were plans to bring back the laws in another form later. Narendra Modi's decision to repeal the contentious farm laws is, at once, a strategic and political move and a belated admission of the government's haste and high-handedness. The laws had whipped up an unprecedented firestorm of protests in the states of Punjab and Uttar Pradesh and posed a real challenge to Mr Modi. They had mobilised farmers and civil society in Sikh-majority Punjab and spread to parts of Uttar Pradesh, states which will see key elections early next year. By repealing the laws, Mr Modi hopes to regain the confidence of the farmers in general and Sikhs in particular. It would also boost the BJP's chances in the polls. Click hereto read the full analysis. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella group of some 40 farmers' unions, had refused to back down despite appeals from the government to end their protest. Farmers continued to block motorways to Delhi through harsh winter and summer months and even through deadly Covid waves. They called for strikes across the country and dozens of them even died due to cold, heat and Covid. The government initially engaged with them and offered to put the laws in abeyance for two years. But after farmers rejected their overtures, the authorities retreated, preferring to go with the wait-and-watch attitude. Farmers have set up camps on motorways But two things changed in the last few months. First, the son of a federal minister allegedly drove his car into a group of protesting farmers in Lakhimpur in Uttar Pradesh in early October. He denied the allegation, but was arrested. Eight people, including four farmers and a journalist, were killed in the incident which sparked outrage across the country and put the government on the back foot. Second, PM Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is up against strong regional parties in the upcoming elections in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand and the government knows that angry farmers would hurt the BJP's chances of winning the crucial polls.

Comedian Godley reveals she has ovarian cancerThe 60-year-old entertainer said she was diagnosed after suffering from a bloated feeling in her stomach.Scotland,"Janey Godley has urged anyone with symptoms like hers to get checked out Comedian Janey Godley, who found viral fame with her dubbed sketches about First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, has revealed she has ovarian cancer. The 60-year-old Glaswegian shared the news on social media and published a picture of herself in a hospital bed. Godley said she arranged an appointment at hospital on Thursday after suffering from a bloated feeling in her stomach. She said she had ""done nothing but cry and cry and cry"" since being diagnosed but thanked the ""brilliant"" NHS. She tweeted: ""Sorry but my last weekend of the tour can't go ahead in Edinburgh and Musselburgh as I am in hospital with ovarian cancer. Look after each other. #MentalHealthMatters."" Janey Godley dropped from Covid ads over tweets Godley was due to appear at the Festival Theatre in Edinburgh on Friday and The Brunton in Musselburgh on Saturday. The comedian, who is being treated in hospital in Glasgow, urged anyone with symptoms to get them checked out. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Covid passes set to stay as Europe heads for winter,"The Dutch Coronacheck app is not checked everywhere, the BBC's Anna Holligan has found There have been protests and complaints of restricted freedom, but much of Europe is now using Covid passports to enter bars, restaurants, cinemas and museums. Italy also requires a Covid pass to enter a workplace and Austria is about to follow suit. Although England does not require a pass, from Friday, the UK's digital Covid pass will be accepted across the European Union. Our correspondents around Europe have been getting to grips with the rules. Italyhas adopted arguably the most rigid Covid pass rules in Europe, writesMark Lowen in Rome. TheGreen PassQR code - from at least one Covid vaccination, negative test or proof of recovery - has to be shown for everything from indoor restaurants to cinemas, gyms and intercity trains. It is also required by all employees in the public and private sectors when they turn up for work. Passes are checked regularly and my family, visiting from the UK, were amazed how rigidly Covid rules, including masks, are respected here. InFranceit is surprising how quickly thepasse sanitairehas become part of daily life, writesHugh Schofield in Paris. Few think twice now before presenting their mobile phones at bars, cinemas and museums, or on TGV trains and at airports. It is a normalised ritual. Hugh Schofield showing his pass in France It's a different story in theNetherlands, writesAnna Holligan.In all the beach bars, restaurants and city cafes I've visited since the pass was introduced on 25 September, I have not once been asked to flash my pass, although I have been asked at the cinema. Therules state anyone aged 13 and over has to show a Covid entry pass,external, although not for shops or taking part in sports events. Denmarkactually phased out itscoronapaslast month, writesAdrienne Murray in Copenhagen. It was first in Europe to adopt a pass in April but has now downgraded Covid-19 to a no longer ""socially critical"" disease. InGermany,if you go out to eat or drink, it's good to know the latest Covid regulation lingo,writes Damien McGuinness in Berlin. Handmade signs with a large 2G have popped up on the doors of many restaurants, cafes and bars. 2G means only people who are eithergeimpft(vaccinated) orgenesen (recovered)can go in.No sign means the usual 3G rule applies, which includes negative tests too. Austrianshave used 3G certificates for months, writesBethany Bell in Vienna. A friend and I went recently to one of my favourite restaurants in Vienna, which serves excellent Wiener Schnitzel and apple strudel. ""You have your Green Passes, I suppose?"" asked the waiter suspiciously. He glanced briefly at our digital certificates, then handed over the menus. Some establishments check on the passes very strictly, others don't even bother to ask. InSwitzerland,Covid passes are obligatory and the rules strictly applied, saysImogen Foulkes in Bern. And now that Covid tests aren't free anymore, going out for a beer gets pretty expensive. The vaccination rate is stagnating at around 62% and the government wants more people to get the jab. Anna Holligan:After some early consternation, the majority of pragmatic Dutch accepted the pass as a means of resurrecting their social lives while shrugging off social distancing. When I've asked waiters or box-office workers if they want to see the QR code proving my vaccination the answers vary from ""no, it's okay, we trust you"" to ""we don't actually have the technology"". A recent study by I&O Research found around a third of cafes and restaurants in the Netherlands were not scanning the coronapasses. Adrienne Murray:Danes are tech-savvy and accepted the app quickly as it offered a quick path out of lockdown. But because the coronapas came in well before people were double-vaccinated it required regular testing. Free test centres sprung up in neighbourhoods all over Copenhagen and towns elsewhere. These have mostly closed now that 75% of over-12s are fully vaccinated and a third booster is being rolled out. Guy Delauney says lip-service is often paid to the Covid passes in Balkan countries Guy Delauney, Balkans correspondent: I've detected little enthusiasm for the passes, travelling through Slovenia, Croatia, Serbia and North Macedonia. While one restaurant on the main square in the Macedonian capital Skopje barred entry to people without passes, another had no checks at all. Staff complain of abuse, so a sign or a sticker on a table often acts as a fig leaf for official policies. Mark Lowen:There's a stereotype of Italians as a nation not minded to follow rules - but by being hit first in Europe, the pandemic seems to have changed that, and Italy's ""no-vax"" movement is relatively small. Dockers in Trieste have been among the most vocal protesters against having the Covid pass compulsory at work There have been some protests. Crowds stormed and smashed up a trade union building and then anti-Green Pass workers staged sit-ins and protests in Trieste, blockading the country's most important commercial port. Police broke them up with tear gas and water cannon. Imogen Foulkes:Opponents of the Swiss pass complain the strict policies undermine their constitutional freedoms. There are demonstrations every week, some of which have turned violent. Enough signatures have been gathered to call a referendum on 28 November to abolish the passes. If the Swiss do vote to get rid of them, it could make travel in Europe problematic - as the Swiss pass is recognised across Europe's passport-free Schengen area. Hugh Schofield:Of course there are people in France who object on principle to having to prove their credentials at every turn. Every Saturday there are demonstrations in Paris and other cities, bringing together anti-vaxxers with libertarians and protesters against ""health discrimination"". Contrary to what some expected, though, these have not turned into a mass movement, and are dwindling in strength. Anna Holligan:There have been a few challenges in the Netherlands: one failed lawsuit argued the pass was discriminatory because it treated unvaccinated people differently without good reason. Supermodel Doutzen Kroes announced on Instagram that she would not be ""forced to take the shot"" or ""forced to prove my health to participate in society"". But opposition to the pass in the Netherlands appears to be more a matter of principle than practicality. Bethany Bell:While many Austrians welcomed the passes as a step towards more freedoms, the opposition far-right Freedom Party has championed those who disagree with the measures. Its head, Herbert Kickl, has accused the government of splitting society into ""the good vaccinated and the bad unvaccinated"". Guy Delauney:There have been protests in Slovenia's capital every Wednesday in recent weeks and some have involved violent confrontations with the police, who have used teargas and water cannon to clear the crowds. Slovenian protesters have challenged restrictions regularly in the capital Ljubljana Serbian protesters have also been making themselves heard in Belgrade in recent days - despite the fact that the Covid pass there only applies to bars and restaurants after 22:00. One epidemiologist described that approach as ""trying to put out a fire with a glass of water"". Adrienne Murray:Denmark's coronapas was agreed across all parliamentary parties, even the opposition, with the promise that it would only be used for a finite time. And it was. Some public protests were held but they were attended by hundreds not thousands. Scottish vaccine passport scheme now enforceable by law Hugh Schofield:The effect of the Frenchpasse sanitaireon levels of vaccination seems incontrovertible. From the beginning of August vaccinations shot up.  Clearly many who were hesitating decided for the sake of a return to normal-ish life, it was necessary to take the plunge. Today 50 million French people have been totally vaccinated, including 88.4% of over-12s. And since mid-October a second part of the national arm-twist has come into effect: the end of free tests. The passe sanitaire has two options: either show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test. With this second option now incurring a cost, there'll be a further incentive for vaccination. Damien McGuinness:Germany has also dropped free antigen tests under its 3G rule, so anyone eligible who refuses the vaccine has to pay. Businesses can now choose for themselves whether to allow unvaccinated customers inside and this 2G rule is seen as a way of encouraging vaccination. It can be a selling point for customers. One Berlin cafe-owner said he had only had one objection from a regular. ""I just replied that he had excluded himself by deciding to not get vaccinated,"" he told me. Covid rules are broadly followed in Italy: Mark Lowen says his eight-year-old niece was expected to wear a mask in cafes, shops and museums Mark Lowen:Nothing motivates an Italian like threatening to bar them from their favouritetrattoriaand when compulsory passes were announced there was a sudden spike in vaccination appointments. Italy has some of the highest vaccination rates in Europe, with around 82% having received both doses, but that rate has slowed slightly and 40% of the workers at Trieste port still haven't been vaccinated, while far-right parties have courted the anti-vax and anti-Green Pass movement. Guy Delauney:Slovenia has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the EU, and its efforts to implement a Covid pass system initially helped boost take-up. That was until the constitutional court suspended a mandatory pass for public sector workers. Shops and restaurants all display notices reminding customers they need a valid PCT certificate, as it is known. But enforcement is patchy and official inspectors are thin on the ground. Mark Lowen:They'll certainly stay in Italy until the end of the year, but possibly in a nod to the protest movement the deputy health minister has said they could be ""reassessed"" next year if the data continues to show manageable infection numbers, low hospitalisations, and rising vaccine rates. The government says the alternative to compulsory passes is new restrictions, and most Italians will do whatever they can to avoid another lockdown. Adrienne Murray:The passes in Denmark may have gone but Covid is still here. Cases have recently risen back above 1,000 a day and are expected to go up further. However, there is little trace of the pandemic in everyday life, just the hand gel at the entrance to the supermarket. There's no social distancing, it's rare to see anyone in a face mask and guidance to work from home lifted in early August. Bethany Bell:As of 1 November, Austrians will have to show 3G passes to go to work. And this winter they will also have to show the certificates if they want to go skiing. Passes will be checked when people buy tickets for the ski lifts. And there are even stricter plans for aprÃ¨s-ski, where antigen tests will no longer be accepted - only a vaccination certificate, proof of recovery or negative PCR test result will do. Hugh Schofield:The initial hope was that thepasse sanitairecould be phased out in France from mid-November. That is not going to happen. The government is warning that though the Covid situation is vastly improved from two months ago, there are still risks of a winter resurgence. Last week a new health bill passed its first reading in parliament, which would make possible an extension of the passe until July 2022. Guy Delauney:Coronavirus case numbers have been surging across the Western Balkans, so despite the poor response to Covid passes, governments are likely to try again.

Kuenssberg: Is there harmony?,"After weeks of rattled nerves, and inflamed rhetoric, is sweetness and light about to break out between the UK and the EU over, you guessed it, the Northern Irish Protocol - that thorniest of problems that's come round again, and again, (and yes, again) as the two sides have grappled with life after Brexit? Talking to the Irish leader, the Taoiseach, who was in Cardiff for a meeting to promote harmony on both sides you might just wonder. MicheÃ¡l Martinsaid the ""mood music had changed"",urged the UK to believe that the EU's desire for a deal was real. And he hoped that Boris Johnson would not ""let the perfect be the enemy of the good"". Without wanting to remind you of all the angst oflast year's Christmas Eve trade deal, he also pleaded with the prime minister not to run things down to Christmas. Mr Martin is an affable kind of politician. UK ministers talk well of him in private. And clearly, like many leaders around the continent, and indeed like Downing Street, he would rather that a deal was done. It seems that he himself, having warned only a couple of weeks ago that the UK's threatened course of action would be ""reckless"" and ""unwise"", has concluded that it's wiser in contrast, to play down the tensions, to talk up the chances of a deal. UK looks likely to trigger Article 16 - then what? What is Article 16 and why does it matter? EU warns of consequences if UK triggers Article 16 But there's still a rub. Among the whispers about fixes that could be in the offing, possible budges on the EU side, suggestions that talks could, after all stretch beyond Christmas, there is a fundamental disagreement. The Irish leader disputed the UK and the Northern Irish Unionists' claim that the way the protocol works is too onerous, over zealous - simply, over the top. He told me that's been ""overstated"", ""there is no abundance of checks"". That is a total contradiction of the problem the UK identifies and wants to fix. For as long as the two sides disagree about what reality looks like it's hard to be sure of any real progress. Whatever the perceived shift in political rhetoric, the UK has long been clear unless there is a change in the EU's concrete offer, they are on the way to move into a legal dispute, article 16, part of the process that exists to solve problems, but that could tip into something serious. And for all the Taoiseach's friendlier tone, for all the speculation, UK ministers and insiders privately maintain that if there isn't a budge, then there will be a bigger bust up. For a reminder of what all that's about you canread more here. Lord Frost, Boris Johnsons' Brexit negotiator heads back to Brussels later for another bout of talks.

Why Brexit still has a NI problem,"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

Article 16 and why it matters,"Goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control There is growing speculation that the UK could use Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol after legal advice that overriding some parts of the post-Brexit treaty would be lawful. Theadvice given to Attorney General Suella Bravermancould allow the UK to follow through on threats to scrap contentious parts of the deal, which is designed to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. With the dispute between the UK and EU continuing to escalate, here's a look at exactly what Article 16 is and how it could come into play. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem In October 2019, the UK and EU agreed a special Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, known as the protocol. Goods can flow freely across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic It leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. That means that goods can flow freely between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, removing the threat of a ""hard border"". However, goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control - amounting to what is being referred to as an ""Irish Sea border"". Article 16 of the protocol sets out the process for taking unilateral ""safeguard"" measures if either the EU or UK concludes that the deal is leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade. Those safeguards would amount to suspending parts of the deal. Safeguard measures can be taken if the protocol is leading to serious ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"" that are liable to persist. So, while it is not intended to be used for temporary or minor problems there is no specific guidance on what qualifies as a ""serious"" difficulty. Additionally, it can be used if the protocol is leading to ""diversion of trade"", but again there is no guidance on how exactly that should be interpreted. In July the UK government said that, in its opinion, the threshold has been reached for using safeguards, but it is choosing not to use them for now. A month's formal notice is supposed to be given before any action is taken, although immediate action is allowed in ""exceptional circumstances"". That is not the intention. Article 16 of the protocol sets out the process for taking unilateral ""safeguard"" measures if either the EU or UK concludes that the deal is leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade. Additionally, it says that priority shall be given to measures that will ""least disturb"" the functioning of the protocol. After safeguarding measures are implemented, negotiations should continue, with the measures being jointly reviewed every three months with a view to their abolition or limitation. However, this would still seem to give the UK government quite wide discretion on what action to take. If it believes the rules for getting goods into NI from GB are irredeemably complicated it could move to entirely suspend articles 5, 7, 8 and 10 of the protocol which deal with customs, products standards, VAT and state aid. That would effectively end the Irish Sea border and from the EU's perspective create a backdoor into its single market. Is the UK hoping the EU will accept an ultra-light touch approach to protect the single market? Such a move would be close to the approach to the Protocol laid out in the UK ""command paper"" in July The paper described an arrangement where there would be ""no need for certificates and checks for individual items that are only ever intended to be consumed in Northern Ireland"". Checks and controls would still be carried out on goods destined for Ireland with these largely identified by the traders involved - a sort of ""honesty box border"". Raoul Ruparel, who was a senior Brexit advisor to Theresa May, says he thinks this sort of maximalist approach to Article 16 is likely. ""What the UK wants to do is quite clear. It will likely suspend parts of the protocol around the (Irish Sea) border - customs and agrifood especially,"" he tweeted. ""It will move to implement its approach as set out in the command paper."" The UK calculation may be that after a period of conflict the EU will ultimately reverse the entire thrust of its Northern Ireland policy since 2017 and accept that an ultra-light touch approach is sufficient to protect the single market. If the EU concludes that the UK's actions create an ""imbalance"" between its rights and obligations under the protocol, then it can take ""proportionate rebalancing measures"". These are not defined and would largely be determined by what the UK does. Sam Lowe, an analyst at the Centre for European Reform, says if, for example, the UK were to suspend the entire protocol, and ""in effect dare the EU to either enforce a border between Ireland and Northern Ireland or between Ireland and the rest of the EU, we should expect the EU's response to be explosive"". However, he thinks if the UK still enforces some controls on goods entering Northern Ireland from great Britain, the EU's response will probably be ""more measured"". ""In terms of immediate response, any EU rebalancing measures would need to be proportionate, and 'strictly necessary to remedy the imbalance'. ""These caveats limit the scope of the EU's immediate (legal) response,"" he added. The EU is also understood to be preparing legal measures which, for example, could challenge the scope of the UK's Article 16 actions. Ultimately, the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods but that would only be possible after a lengthy arbitration process. The arbitrators would first have to find that the UK is in breach of the protocol. Then the UK would have to refuse to remedy that breach, at which point the EU could retaliate under the terms of the wider Brexit deal, the TCA. It could require another arbitration process to rule whether the use of tariffs is proportionate retaliation. There is a potentially faster legal track known as infringement proceedings which could lead to the UK being fined. The UK could be blocked from accessing the Horizon Europe research programme The EU could also take more informal political measures. Anton Spisak, policy lead at the Tony Blair Institute, tweeted that the EU's response to ""an expansive use of Article 16 will have to be robust enough to have a deterrent effect"". He suggests that would mean ""quick, unilateral and asymmetrical actions that can be passed easily through the European Council"". These measures could include blocking UK accession to Horizon Europe research programme. If the EU thinks arbitration and legal action would take too long to have an effect it could reach for the nuclear option. A clause in the TCA allows either side to terminate the whole deal with a year's notice. Nine months notice is required if it is just the trade elements of the deal which are to be terminated. If that happened it would effectively set a course for a no-deal Brexit, with tariffs on a broad range of goods and other significant barriers to EU-UK trade. Mujtaba Rahman, analyst at the Eurasia Group consultancy, says this is figuring in EU considerations. ""I expect no intermediate step such as tariffs. Just an immediate, emergency EU Council & political decision to suspend the UK-EU trade deal,"" he tweeted. He added that would mean next year would see ""a re-run of Brexit... with renegotiation of Irish border issue, with threat of no-deal tariffs looming in the background"".

"Serious EU intent to fix NI border row - Irish PMBut MicheÃ¡l Martin says he is ""frustrated"" post-Brexit talks are hindering UK-EU relationships.UK Politics","This video can not be played What's the Irish PM's message to the UK? There is ""serious intent"" in the EU to solve post-Brexit difficulties over the Northern Ireland border, Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin has said. Speaking to the BBC, he said the ""mood music"" surrounding EU-UK negotiations had improved in recent weeks. The Northern Ireland Protocol in the Brexit deal aims to avoid implementing border checks on the island of Ireland. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But the protocol also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, meaning some goods such as meat and eggs are subject to checks when they enter Northern Ireland from Great Britain. This has angered some Northern Irish politicians, including DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson who said the protocol was disrupting businesses and harming trade. Laura Kuenssberg: Is harmony about to break out? Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem UK looks likely to trigger Article 16 - then what? What is Article 16 and why does it matter? In aninterview with the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg,Mr Martin admitted feeling ""frustrated"" that the issue had hindered the ""full flowering"" of the two sides' alliance. And he warned the UK against acting unilaterally, saying it would ""undermine"" relationships. The Taoiseach's comments come ahead of a meeting between the UK's Brexit Minister Lord Frost and the EU Commission Vice-President Maros Å efÄoviÄ in Brussels on Friday aimed at resolving problems arising from the protocol. Speaking immediately before his meeting with Lord Frost, Mr Å efÄoviÄ warned the post-Brexit trade deal was ""intrinsically linked"" to settling the protocol, adding: ""One cannot exist without the other"". He ruled out a renegotiation of the protocol, insisting solutions were available within its framework, which could ""become reality if the UK plays its part"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ welcomed what he said was a ""change in tone"" from the UK during the negotiations, adding that he hoped ""actions will follow the words"". Ahead of the meeting, Lord Frost told reporters there were still ""significant gaps"" between the two sides Arriving for the talks, Lord Frost told reporters he was ""very much"" looking forward to seeing if progress could be made, adding that his preference was for a ""negotiated"" way through the problem, but if not, Article 16 of the protocol remained on the table. The article allows either side to suspend any part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement that causes ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". If the UK did trigger Article 16, the EU could respond by imposing tariffs on trade between the two sides. Lord Frost warned there were still ""quite significant gaps"" between the two sides but welcomed the Taoiseach's comment about the EU's ""serious intent"" to resolve the difficulties. Loyalist demonstrators protesting against the Northern Ireland protocol in Belfast earlier this year In his BBC interview, Mr Martin insisted there was ""not an abundance of checks"" on the border and that Northern Ireland benefitted from having access to both the European and UK markets. However, he added that the EU ""sincerely"" wanted to engage with the problems, which he said could be ""resolved with goodwill on all sides"". He acknowledged that ""there have been periods during these talks when they've dragged on with very little happening"" but added that ""now there's a bit of engagement, of serious intent"". Mr Martin said the protocol was ""never going to be perfect"", adding: ""It's important that we don't allow perfect become the enemy of the good."" He also urged the prime minister to believe that Brussels' offer of compromise was genuine and urged him not to take too long to move towards a deal saying ""don't leave it to Christmas Eve this year"" - a reference to last year's Brexit deal which was agreed on 24 December. Mr Martin is an affable kind of politician. UK ministers talk well of him in private. And clearly, like many leaders around the continent, and indeed like Downing Street, he would rather that a deal was done. It seems that he himself, having warned only a couple of weeks ago that the UK's threatened course of action would be ""reckless"" and ""unwise"", has concluded that it's wiser in contrast, to play down the tensions, to talk up the chances of a deal. But there's still a rub. Read more from Laura Earlier this month, Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney warned that the whole post-Brexit deal between the UK and the EU could collapse over the Northern Ireland Protocol. But, Mr Martin suggested the ""mood music"" had since changed. ""A number of weeks ago there was a different atmosphere governing the situation and there was all sorts of rumours and vibes... since then, that has calmed down somewhat,"" he said. But he still warned the UK against acting ""unilaterally"", arguing it could ""undermine"" the two countries' relationship.

"Austria to go into full lockdown as Covid surgesDays after it imposed a lockdown on the unvaccinated, it announces a full lockdown from Monday.Europe","One in three Austrians is not yet vaccinated, one of the lowest rates in Western Europe Days after Austria imposed a lockdown on the unvaccinated, it has announced a full national Covid-19 lockdown starting on Monday. Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg said it would last a maximum of 20 days and there would be a legal requirement to get vaccinated from 1 February 2022. He was responding to record case numbers and one of the lowest vaccination levels in Western Europe. Many other European countries are imposing restrictions as cases rise. ""We don't want a fifth wave,"" said Mr Schallenberg after meeting the governors of Austria's nine provinces at a resort in the west of the country. For a long time, there had been a consensus over avoiding mandatory vaccinations, the chancellor said. However, too many people had been incited not to get the jab, because of ""too many political forces, flimsy vaccination opponents and fake news"", he added. The measures are yet to be finalised. Latest figures show the incidence rate has risen to 1,049.9 cases per 100,000 people in the past week,external, and Health Minister Wolfgang MÃ¼ckstein said imposing a lockdown was a ""last resort"". A record 15,809 cases were reported in the past 24 hours, in a population of under nine million. Under the measures, Austrians will be asked to work from home, non-essential shops will close, and schools will remain open for children who require face-to-face learning. They will continue until 12 December, but will be reassessed after 10 days. NeighbouringGermanyhas seen several days of record infections this week, and Health Minister Jens Spahn has spoken of ""a national emergency that requires a combined national effort"". German leaders have already agreed to introduce restrictions for unvaccinated people in areas with high hospital admissions. And parliament has backed requirements for people to show Covid passes on buses and trains, and in workplaces. But now inBavaria, which borders Austria, state premier Markus SÃ¶der has gone further, declaring  a ""de facto lockdown for the unvaccinated"". Bars and clubs will close for three weeks and all Christmas markets have been cancelled. Where weekly incidence rates top 1,000 per 100,000 people - restaurants, hotels, sport and culture will also close. SlovakPrime Minister Eduard Heger has already announced that a ""lockdown for the unvaccinated"" will start on Monday, and theCzechgovernment is also limiting access to a variety of services. TheNetherlandsintroduced a partial lockdown last weekend. In theUK- where there is currently no lockdown,although masks have to be worn in some parts of the country- the incidence rate per 100,000 is 395.4 cases,officials figures show,external. Austria's is the first full lockdown imposed by an EU country this winter. The Europe regional director of the World Health Organization,Hans Kluge, has warned of a hard winter ahead. He blamed insufficient vaccination coverage along with ""the easing of preventive measures and the spread of the more transmissible Delta variant"". Russiaon Friday declared a record number of 1,254 Covid deaths in the past 24 hours, for the third day in a row. Hungaryreported its highest level of infections - with 11,289 new cases in a population of 10 million. A third booster jab will be made mandatory for health workers from Saturday, along with masks in most enclosed spaces. Tighter restrictions also come into force inBelgiumon Saturday, requiring working from home for four days a week. There are only two ways for countries to slow the spread of Covid - build up enough immunity or limit contact between other people. That wall of immunity - from a year of vaccination - is facing its first real test as winter rolls in across Europe. It is already clear some countries - Austria being the most notable - have not vaccinated enough and feel the ""need"" to go back to restrictions that nobody ""wants"". But it does not mean that every country is doomed to a winter lockdown. Those that have vaccinated more, given boosters to more and protected more of the vulnerable and elderly (who are the most likely to need hospital care) have the best shot at a manageable winter. The impact of the UK having high levels of Covid through autumn, which will have topped up immunity levels, will be closely watched too. However, it is still only November. There are many dark months to get through before the weather improves and makes it harder for Covid to spread.

Amazon sees worst deforestation in 15 yearsThe figures come after Brazil promised to end the practice by 2030 during the COP climate summit.Latin America & Caribbean,"Deforestation increased in the Amazon by 22% during the 2020-21 period Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest has hit its highest level in over 15 years, official data shows. A report by Brazil's space research agency (Inpe) found that deforestation increased by 22% in a year. Brazil was among a number of nations whopromised to end and reverse deforestationby 2030 during the COP26 climate summit. The Amazon is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. It is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. According to the latest data, some 13,235 sq km (5110 sq miles) was lost during the 2020-21 period, the highest amount since 2006. Environment Minister Joaquim Leite said the data represents a ""challenge"" and said: ""We have to be more forceful in relation to these crimes."" He added that the data ""does not exactly reflect the situation in the last few months"". How many trees has the world been cutting down? How your chicken burger is linked to deforestation Illegal miners fire on indigenous group in Amazon Deforestation of the Amazon has increased under President Jair Bolsonaro. who has encouraged agriculture and mining activities in the rainforest. He has also clashed with Inpe in the past over its deforestation, accusing the agency in 2019 of smearing Brazil's reputation. But at November's climate conference in Glasgow, Brazil was among a number of nations who signed a major deal to end and reverse the practice. The pledge included almost Â£14bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds. Some of that will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfires and support indigenous communities. Close links have previously been uncovered between the deforestation of the Amazon and international supply chains. Last year, aGreenpeace investigation discovered linksbetween the mass deforestation of the region and food sold in British supermarkets and restaurants. The investigation found that Tesco, Asda, Lidl, Nando's and McDonalds were selling meat, sourced from a UK supplier, which had been fed on soy grown on farms built in deforested areas. Just this week, Jair Bolsonaro, on tour in Dubai, told investors that attacks towards Brazil on deforestation were ""unfair"". ""We want people to know the real Brazil,"" he said, adding that 90% of the forest is still preserved. Well, these latest figures reveal the real Brazil - a country whose government has from the very beginning talked up the opportunities in developing the Amazon and at the same time, belittled environmental concerns. Not only that, these figures were actually dated 27 October - it appears they were held until after COP26. Jair Bolsonaro didn't turn up to COP26, but his delegation wanted to go to Glasgow and convince the world that people were wrong about Brazil - it even said it would move forward its commitment to ending deforestation by 2028.

Schools in England told to limit uniform costs,"The education secretary says uniforms ""should be a real source of pride"" and not ""a burden for parents or a barrier to pupils accessing education"" Parents in England must be allowed to buy some uniform from High Street shops as well as school suppliers, according to new government rules. Second-hand items should be made available and the cost of anything branded must be kept to a minimum. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said the legally binding guidelines would make uniforms ""far more affordable"". The move has been welcomed by education unions - but child poverty campaigners say more action is needed. Research by the government, in 2015, suggested parents could save almost Â£50 on average, if they bought all uniform items from High Street shops instead of designated suppliers. Many schools have already tried to reduce costs, in line with voluntary guidelines, but this new statutory advice strengthens that obligation. Affordable uniforms law will miss new school year Watch: The rapper giving away school uniforms to kids From next autumn, items with logos should be kept to a minimum and more uniform from any shop, such as supermarkets, should be allowed. Schools are also being asked to make sure second-hand uniforms are available as an affordable and sustainable option. Mr Zahawi said school uniforms ""should be a real source of pride"" and not ""a burden for parents or a barrier to pupils accessing education"". ""This new binding guidance will help to make uniforms far more affordable for families by driving costs down as we work hard to level up the country,"" he said. John Adams, an Open University student and parenting blogger in Kent, says it has cost him Â£100 to kit out just one of his daughters for school this term. That was for two shirts, two skirts and a pair of school shoes. He says branded items are the most expensive and uniform in general is becoming more costly now his eldest is nearly in adult sizes. And he even encouraged his daughters to wear their PE kit at home during Covid lockdowns. ""Why not? It had been paid for and they were at home so much they weren't getting worn at school,"" he says. ""Kids do also get a lot of use out of uniform and there's no question that school uniform endures a lot of abuse. ""That said, it never ceases to amaze me how much I spend on uniform."" Mr Adams, who runs Dad Blog UK, adds the new rules' emphasis on the environmental benefits of second-hand uniforms will help remove the ""ridiculous stigma"" around reused items. Matt Easter, who co-chairs the Schoolwear Association industry body, welcomed the statutory guidance, which he said would help ensure ""parents get good value for money"" without placing ""unreasonable burdens on schools or uniform suppliers"". ""Importantly, it reinforces that the majority of schools are already doing the right thing and, in most cases, will already be fully, or almost, compliant,"" he said. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton also welcomed the statutory guidance but added: ""Schools already follow the government's non-statutory guidance on school uniform. ""Schools are acutely aware of the need to keep uniform costs to a minimum, particularly as they often have many students who come from disadvantaged homes. ""They deal on a daily basis with the impact of the high level of child poverty the government has failed to address."" Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said the guidance was ""just the first step"", schools needed to ""develop approaches that support all families"" and the government should fund local authorities in England to provide clothing grants for parents on low incomes. In Scotland,external, parents can apply for school-clothing grants of Â£150 for secondary-school pupils and Â£120 for primary In Northern Ireland,external, these grants are Â£50 and Â£30 respectively In Wales,external, parents of children eligible for free school meals can apply for grants of Â£125 per pupil and Â£200 for new Year 7 pupils ""We know that parents struggle with the cost of school uniform and that kids are excluded from activities for not having the right kit,"" Ms Garnham said. ""No parent should have to go into debt to buy school uniform. ""No child should be priced out of participation at school."" BANISH YOUR BRAIN FOG:Quick tips to boost energy this winter!

LiveLiveUK accused of lacking detailed plan for a pandemic11 minutes ago,"Austria has announced it will enter a full lockdown from Monday, lasting at least 10 days, in a bid to avoid a ""fifth wave"" of Covid Covid vaccinations will become mandatory in the country from 1 February Several European countries, including Germany and Greece, are imposing tighter controls on the unvaccinated One in 65 people in the UK are estimated to have had Covid in the week ending 13 November, down from one in 60 the previous week A further 44,242 Covid cases and 157 deaths have been recorded in the UK, official figures show A report finds the UK government was not fully prepared for the wide-ranging impacts of Covid-19 on society In Northern Ireland, those who worked from home during the first wave of the pandemic are told they should do so again Edited by Hamish Mackay That's the end of our live Covid coverage for today. These updates were written by Alex Therrien, Douglas Faulkner, and Jennifer Meierhans. The page was edited by Hamish Mackay and Lauren Turner. From all of us, have a good evening We're going to be pausing our live coverage of the pandemic shortly. Here's a recap of what's been happening in the UK and around the world today: We've been reporting rising coronavirus cases in many European countries today but Italy's daily figures show a slight drop in new infections and deaths. Italy reported 48 coronavirus-related deaths today, against 69 yesterday, while the daily tally of new infections has fallen to 10,544 from 10,638. Italy has registered 133,082 deaths linked to Covid-19 since its outbreak emerged in February last year, the second-highest toll in Europe after the UK, and the ninth-highest in the world. The country has reported 4.9 million cases to date. Children aged five to 11 in Canada will be able to receive a coronavirus vaccine after the countryauthorised the use of the Pfizer jab for the age group. Trials of the vaccine among children show similar safety and efficacy results to those recorded in trials among people 16 to 25, according to Pfizer. Health Canada previously said it would only approve the vaccine for children if its analysis demonstrated benefits outweighed any possible risks. It is the first Covid-19 vaccine approved for this age group in Canada. Dr Supriya Sharma, a senior medical advisor with Health Canada, says  the move is good news for adults and children alike. ""It provides another tool to protect Canadians, and to the relief of many parents, will help bring back a degree of normality to children's lives."" Nearly 75% of all Canadians are fully vaccinated, according to Health Canada's most recent data, including 84% of those 12 and older. The widow of a Scottish government official who died after contracting Covid iscalling on the first minister to take immediate action against the hospital where he was being treated. Andrew Slorance, 49, went into Glasgow's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital for cancer treatment a year ago but died nearly six weeks into his stay - with the cause of death listed as Covid pneumonia. His wife Louise believes he caught Covid and another infection there but that the details were concealed. She says she does not accept that the health board has been honest with her and has called on First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to step in to ""stop these type of events happening in the future"". Father-of-five Andrew was head of the Scottish government's response and communication unit, which was responsible for its handling of the Covid pandemic. After requesting a copy of his medical notes, Louise discovered her husband had also been treated for an infection caused by a fungus called aspergillus, which had not been discussed with either of them during his hospital stay. On Thursday, the first minister paid tribute to Andrew Slorance in the Scottish parliament and pledged to ensure his family would get the answers they are seeking. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde says infection control procedures at QEUH are ""rigorous and of the highest standard"" and they are providing support to the Scottish hospitals public inquiry. In the world of football, Manchester City playmaker Kevin de Bruyne will miss two gamesafter testing positive for Covid-19on his return from international duty. The 30-year-old will isolate for 10 days, meaning he will miss Sunday's Premier League match at home to Everton and Wednesday's Champions League game against Paris St-Germain. De Bruyne, who is vaccinated, scored for Belgium in their World Cup qualifying draw with Wales on Tuesday. ""The symptoms will be minor hopefully,"" says City manager Pep Guardiola. ""As soon as possible, he can come back. We do not worry about what we are going to miss. The person is more important. We have to help him and hope it goes well while he's isolated."" The UK has given a total of111,082,929Covid vaccinations, according to the latest government data. That's50,707,953first doses,46,108,608second doses and14,266,368booster or third doses. That means88.2%of the popualtion aged over 12 have had their first jab,80.2%have had their second and24.8%their third. There have been a further 44,242 coronavirus cases reported in the UK,the latest government figures show.,external There have also been another 157 deaths reported within 28 days of a positive test.

Anna Redfern, who owns Cinema & Co in Swansea, tells the BBC the law went against her principles. âIf Iâm going to die, that is the hill Iâm going to die on,"" Redfern says. Notices have since been pinned outside the premises, stating the business had not carried out a Covid risk assessment. The Welsh government says the use of Covid passes is required by law and not optional. Northern Ireland's chief medical officer has said he does not think the country is facing the prospect of another coronavirus lockdown. Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster, Sir Michael Bride says Northern Ireland is facing a very serious situation and some further restrictions may be required if efforts to suppress the current Covid-19 wave fail. He says it is unlikely a lockdown will be required because of the protection provided to the population by vaccinations. But he warns: ""If we don't act now and if we don't act decisively, unfortunately we may well be back advising the executive [Northern Ireland's devolved government] that further interventions are needed to prevent our health service being overwhelmed."" It comes as a number of countries in mainland Europe begin re-imposing restrictions in an attempt to curb a surge in cases. Earlier today, Austria announced it was going into a national lockdown. The rate at which coronavirus spreads - as measured by the R number - varies across the UK. In England, the latest R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sageis between 0.8 and 1,external. That means, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between eight and 10 others. In Northern Ireland it is estimated to be between 1.1 and 1.3 - meaning every 10 people with Covid will pass it on to between 11 and 13 others. An R value of 1 means that the total number of infections is stable. Here's how the R number looks across the UK and English regions. Czech Republic Prime Minister Andrej Babis has said his country will not be introducing a national lockdown or mandatory vaccines The Czech Republic will not be following the approach of its neighbour, Austria, in imposing a national lockdown and making vaccines mandatory, the country's Prime Minister Andrej Babis has said. The government has approved higher compensation for those in quarantine and a new round of testing in schools and firms. On Monday, new regulations will come into force in the country that target unvaccinated Czechs. A negative PCR test will no longer be sufficient to enter pubs or restaurants, use services or attend events. Proof of vaccination or previous infection will be the only way to access such facilities. There were more than 13,000 new recorded cases on Thursday. There are now 4,750 in hospital, with almost 700 in intensive care, and some rural facilities saying they are running low on intensive care unit capacity. An intensive care consultant says NHS staff are ""cracked but not broken"" ina moving open letter. Dr Matt Morgan, who works at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff, read his letter onBBC Radio 4's Todaythis morning. Colleagues took to social media to thank him for having ""captured our mood"". In his letter he tells staff: ""You may be cracked, but not broken. ""You are still there. You still care. But now the helpers need help."" Describing the ""scaffold smiles"" to hide the pain of another long day at work, he advises worn-out NHS workers to ""fill the cracks with life outside work, your family, your hobbies, with things that make you feel more like you"".

Jenny HillBBC Berlin correspondent All bars, clubs and discos in Bavaria are to close for the next three weeks and there will be no Christmas markets in the German state this year, the regionâs prime minister has announced. Cultural and sporting events will restrict spectators to 25% of a venueâs capacity and those attending must be vaccinated or have recovered from an infection â but will also have to show a negative test. ""The situation is very, very serious and difficult,"" state premier Markus Soeder tells a news conference. Bavaria recorded a weekly incidence rate of 625.3 recorded infections per 100,000 people today, according to the Robert Koch Institute, up on the nationwide figure of 340.7. The famous Christmas market at Munich, Bavaria's state capital, had already been cancelled due to the resurgence of coronavirus. It normally attracts three million visitors a year. Waning immunity in adults could mean Covid cases ""really take off"" and extend the strain on the NHS, a scientist who advises the government on coronavirus says. Prof John Edmunds, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) tells BBC Radio 4's The World At One it is really important to boost immunity in older individuals so ""we might be able to avoid any significant fourth wave"". He says the UK is ahead of other parts of Europe - where the Covid-19 situation is worsening - due to the rollout of boosters and the level of infection, but warns over the length of pressure being heaped on the NHS. ""It has been [under strain] for months and months, and that's not going to ease up any time soon because this very high level of infection that we have now and we've had for months isn't going to decline significantly,"" he says. If you want to read more on this our health correspondent James Gallagher has taken a look at the issue of waning immunityhere. France is sending police reinforcements to its overseas territory of Guadeloupe in an effort to quell days of violent protests against coronavirus measures. The government says 200 officers will be deployed to the Caribbean island to restore order. Protests broke out on Monday when unions called for a general strike against France's Covid health pass and compulsory vaccinations for healthcare workers. Police clashed with demonstrators who blocked roads and set cars alight. A joint statement from the French interior and overseas ministers strongly condemned the violence. Anna Redfern, who manages the cinema in Swansea, says she will not be implementing passes for customers A cinema has been told to shut downafter its owner refused to ask for Covid passes. Earlier this week, Anna Redfern, owner of Cinema & Co in Swansea,said she would not be complying with the Welsh government rules. Notices were pinned outside the premises, stating the business had not carried out a Covid risk assessment. The owner confirmed to the BBC she has been told to close by Swansea council, but would not comment further. The Welsh government says the scheme, which requires proof of being fully vaccinated or having had a negative lateral flow test within 48 hours, played a key role in keeping people safe from the virus. The Covid pass scheme, which applies to anyone over the age of 18, has been in place since 11 October fornightclubs and large-scale events, but now also applies to theatres, concert halls and cinemas. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Austria will go into a national lockdown on Monday It wasnât supposed to be like this. There are only two ways for countries to slow the spread of
Covid - build up enough immunity or limit contact between other people. That wall of immunity â from a year of vaccination â is
facing its first real test as winter rolls in across Europe. It is already clear some countries â Austria being the most
notable - have not vaccinated enough and feel the âneedâ to go back to
restrictions that nobody âwantsâ. But it does not mean that every country is doomed to a
winter lockdown. Those that have vaccinated more, given boosters to more and
protected more of the vulnerable and elderly (who are the most likely to need
hospital care) have the best shot at a manageable winter. The impact of the UK having high levels of Covid through
autumn, which will have topped up immunity levels, will be closely watched
too. However, it is still only November. There are many dark
months to get through before the weather improves and makes it harder for Covid
to spread. The Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan The world's first known Covid-19 case was woman working at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan - not an accountant with no links to the place, according to a US study. The 41-year-old man was widely thought to be the first case because symptoms from dental work he had were confused with those from the virus he caught days later. A joint study by China and the World Health Organization (WHO) this yearall but ruled out the theory that Covid-19 originated in a laboratory. The report says the most likely hypothesis is that it infected humans naturally, and was probably transmitted from bats to humans through another animal but that further research was needed. Now a new study published in the journal Science says the seafood vendor is the earliest known case, as her symptoms started on 11 December 2019. When interviewed, the accountant reported that his Covid-19 symptoms started with a fever on 16 December. His illness reported on 8 December was a dental problem related to baby teeth retained into adulthood,the report says.,external Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent An international warrant has reportedly been issued for a group of 14 Dutch holidaymakers, who allegedly ran off after some of them tested positive for Covid-19. The local mayor of the Spanish village where they were staying has described their apparent flight as a ""surreal crime"". The Dutch tourists were supposed to quarantine in their accommodation, after five of them contracted the virus. The day after they were diagnosed, the Spanish health authorities reportedly discovered they had left isolation and vanished from the country house they'd been renting in the village of Navas del Madrono. The local authorities are understood to have issued an international warrant for their detainment. The Dutch ministry of foreign affairs is aware of the media reports, but a representative tells the BBC they have not been contacted for consular assistance. Â© 2025 BBC.

Amazon sees worst deforestation in 15 yearsThe figures come after Brazil promised to end the practice by 2030 during the COP climate summit.,"Deforestation increased in the Amazon by 22% during the 2020-21 period Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon rainforest has hit its highest level in over 15 years, official data shows. A report by Brazil's space research agency (Inpe) found that deforestation increased by 22% in a year. Brazil was among a number of nations whopromised to end and reverse deforestationby 2030 during the COP26 climate summit. The Amazon is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. It is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. According to the latest data, some 13,235 sq km (5110 sq miles) was lost during the 2020-21 period, the highest amount since 2006. Environment Minister Joaquim Leite said the data represents a ""challenge"" and said: ""We have to be more forceful in relation to these crimes."" He added that the data ""does not exactly reflect the situation in the last few months"". How many trees has the world been cutting down? How your chicken burger is linked to deforestation Illegal miners fire on indigenous group in Amazon Deforestation of the Amazon has increased under President Jair Bolsonaro. who has encouraged agriculture and mining activities in the rainforest. He has also clashed with Inpe in the past over its deforestation, accusing the agency in 2019 of smearing Brazil's reputation. But at November's climate conference in Glasgow, Brazil was among a number of nations who signed a major deal to end and reverse the practice. The pledge included almost Â£14bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds. Some of that will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfires and support indigenous communities. Close links have previously been uncovered between the deforestation of the Amazon and international supply chains. Last year, aGreenpeace investigation discovered linksbetween the mass deforestation of the region and food sold in British supermarkets and restaurants. The investigation found that Tesco, Asda, Lidl, Nando's and McDonalds were selling meat, sourced from a UK supplier, which had been fed on soy grown on farms built in deforested areas. Just this week, Jair Bolsonaro, on tour in Dubai, told investors that attacks towards Brazil on deforestation were ""unfair"". ""We want people to know the real Brazil,"" he said, adding that 90% of the forest is still preserved. Well, these latest figures reveal the real Brazil - a country whose government has from the very beginning talked up the opportunities in developing the Amazon and at the same time, belittled environmental concerns. Not only that, these figures were actually dated 27 October - it appears they were held until after COP26. Jair Bolsonaro didn't turn up to COP26, but his delegation wanted to go to Glasgow and convince the world that people were wrong about Brazil - it even said it would move forward its commitment to ending deforestation by 2028. But with numbers like these, who can believe Jair Bolsonaro now?

Uni looks to insects to feed world's population,"Insects such as this witchetty grub have been eaten on I'm A Celebrity - but those used on the show are no longer alive When you hear about people eating insects, the chances are you think of the bushtucker trial on I'm a Celebrity, which starts this weekend. But food ingredients made from insects could be coming to a menu near you. This is the focus of research being carried out at Aberystwyth University. Scientists at the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences (IBERS) are looking at insects as a potentially valuable source of animal feed and food for people. The work is part of ValuSect - which stands for valuable insects - an international project aiming to improve the sustainable production and processing of insect-based products. Insects are a common feature of people's everyday diets in countries including Mexico, China and Ghana. Can seaweed end pollution problem? Oranges 'a luxury' in bid to cut carbon They offer a more environmentally-friendly source of protein than many other foods and could help feed the world's growing population. The research has implications for what we will have on our dinner plates in future Chatting over a tray of 20,000 live mealworms, Dr Tiffany Lau, a postdoctoral research associate at IBERS, said insect ingredients could form part of a range of foods. ""They could be made into protein shakes, protein smoothies, they could be insect burgers, falafels, muffins anything you could think of really,"" she said. ""I would eat them - maybe not when they're looking like this though. ""They would be dried and ground into powder before you make them into food anyway, so you wouldn't look at it like worms hanging out of your burger, it would be made into a sort of patty."" Eating insects is just one task facing those taking part in I'm A Celebrity this year The scientists at Aberystwyth are studying the nutritional value of processed insects, which Prof Alison Kingston-Smith said could be an important source of sustainable protein. ""They're full of protein and polyunsaturated fatty acids which is really good for us,"" she said. ""What we want to do is understand how we can feed the insects to make them the best quality they can be to deliver the nutritional quality that we need for feed and food. ""The most usual incorporation is into something like an energy bar."" Could mealworms one day be a meal in their own right? ValuSect, a consortium of partners coordinated by Thomas More University in Belgium, has been studying crickets, grasshoppers and yellow mealworms as human food. A new grant will see the black soldier fly added to the research menu and extend the work to look at using insect products in animal feed. Findings will be shared with food and agriculture businesses across northern Europe. Research indicates that approximately 30% of EU consumers are willing to eat insect-based food. ValuSect aims to increase this number by improving the quality of insect production and processing, carrying out consumer tests, and reducing its environmental impact. Some insect-based ingredients are already available and Prof Kingston-Smith believes the choice of insect food products is likely to increase in the coming years. She added: ""You wouldn't hide the fact that (food) contains insect protein - but I think it's the idea of eating an intact locust is less appealing than something that's in a product where that textural connotation is different. ""If we look at the way that food consumption has changed over the last few decades, we're far more accepting of different types of food, different flavours. We want to embrace all different cultures in our food tastes, and I think insects is just the next the next step in that. ""In another 20 years it will be commonplace to go and find your insects on the a la carte menu."" Can seaweed help end plastic pollution?

Schools in England told to limit uniform costsParents must be allowed to buy some items from High Street shops and second-hand from next year.Family & Education,"The education secretary says uniforms ""should be a real source of pride"" and not ""a burden for parents or a barrier to pupils accessing education"" Parents in England must be allowed to buy some uniform from High Street shops as well as school suppliers, according to new government rules. Second-hand items should be made available and the cost of anything branded must be kept to a minimum. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said the legally binding guidelines would make uniforms ""far more affordable"". The move has been welcomed by education unions - but child poverty campaigners say more action is needed. Research by the government, in 2015, suggested parents could save almost Â£50 on average, if they bought all uniform items from High Street shops instead of designated suppliers. Many schools have already tried to reduce costs, in line with voluntary guidelines, but this new statutory advice strengthens that obligation. Affordable uniforms law will miss new school year Watch: The rapper giving away school uniforms to kids From next autumn, items with logos should be kept to a minimum and more uniform from any shop, such as supermarkets, should be allowed. Schools are also being asked to make sure second-hand uniforms are available as an affordable and sustainable option. Mr Zahawi said school uniforms ""should be a real source of pride"" and not ""a burden for parents or a barrier to pupils accessing education"". ""This new binding guidance will help to make uniforms far more affordable for families by driving costs down as we work hard to level up the country,"" he said. John Adams, an Open University student and parenting blogger in Kent, says it has cost him Â£100 to kit out just one of his daughters for school this term. That was for two shirts, two skirts and a pair of school shoes. He says branded items are the most expensive and uniform in general is becoming more costly now his eldest is nearly in adult sizes. And he even encouraged his daughters to wear their PE kit at home during Covid lockdowns. ""Why not? It had been paid for and they were at home so much they weren't getting worn at school,"" he says. ""Kids do also get a lot of use out of uniform and there's no question that school uniform endures a lot of abuse. ""That said, it never ceases to amaze me how much I spend on uniform."" Mr Adams, who runs Dad Blog UK, adds the new rules' emphasis on the environmental benefits of second-hand uniforms will help remove the ""ridiculous stigma"" around reused items. Matt Easter, who co-chairs the Schoolwear Association industry body, welcomed the statutory guidance, which he said would help ensure ""parents get good value for money"" without placing ""unreasonable burdens on schools or uniform suppliers"". ""Importantly, it reinforces that the majority of schools are already doing the right thing and, in most cases, will already be fully, or almost, compliant,"" he said. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton also welcomed the statutory guidance but added: ""Schools already follow the government's non-statutory guidance on school uniform. ""Schools are acutely aware of the need to keep uniform costs to a minimum, particularly as they often have many students who come from disadvantaged homes. ""They deal on a daily basis with the impact of the high level of child poverty the government has failed to address."" Child Poverty Action Group chief executive Alison Garnham said the guidance was ""just the first step"", schools needed to ""develop approaches that support all families"" and the government should fund local authorities in England to provide clothing grants for parents on low incomes. In Scotland,external, parents can apply for school-clothing grants of Â£150 for secondary-school pupils and Â£120 for primary In Northern Ireland,external, these grants are Â£50 and Â£30 respectively In Wales,external, parents of children eligible for free school meals can apply for grants of Â£125 per pupil and Â£200 for new Year 7 pupils ""We know that parents struggle with the cost of school uniform and that kids are excluded from activities for not having the right kit,"" Ms Garnham said.

Kuenssberg: Is there now harmony?,"After weeks of rattled nerves, and inflamed rhetoric, is sweetness and light about to break out between the UK and the EU over, you guessed it, the Northern Irish Protocol - that thorniest of problems that's come round again, and again, (and yes, again) as the two sides have grappled with life after Brexit? Talking to the Irish leader, the Taoiseach, who was in Cardiff for a meeting to promote harmony on both sides you might just wonder. MicheÃ¡l Martinsaid the ""mood music had changed"",urged the UK to believe that the EU's desire for a deal was real. And he hoped that Boris Johnson would not ""let the perfect be the enemy of the good"". Without wanting to remind you of all the angst oflast year's Christmas Eve trade deal, he also pleaded with the prime minister not to run things down to Christmas. Mr Martin is an affable kind of politician. UK ministers talk well of him in private. And clearly, like many leaders around the continent, and indeed like Downing Street, he would rather that a deal was done. It seems that he himself, having warned only a couple of weeks ago that the UK's threatened course of action would be ""reckless"" and ""unwise"", has concluded that it's wiser in contrast, to play down the tensions, to talk up the chances of a deal. UK looks likely to trigger Article 16 - then what? What is Article 16 and why does it matter? EU warns of consequences if UK triggers Article 16 But there's still a rub. Among the whispers about fixes that could be in the offing, possible budges on the EU side, suggestions that talks could, after all stretch beyond Christmas, there is a fundamental disagreement. The Irish leader disputed the UK and the Northern Irish Unionists' claim that the way the protocol works is too onerous, over zealous - simply, over the top. He told me that's been ""overstated"", ""there is no abundance of checks"". That is a total contradiction of the problem the UK identifies and wants to fix. For as long as the two sides disagree about what reality looks like it's hard to be sure of any real progress. Whatever the perceived shift in political rhetoric, the UK has long been clear unless there is a change in the EU's concrete offer, they are on the way to move into a legal dispute, article 16, part of the process that exists to solve problems, but that could tip into something serious. And for all the Taoiseach's friendlier tone, for all the speculation, UK ministers and insiders privately maintain that if there isn't a budge, then there will be a bigger bust up. For a reminder of what all that's about you canread more here. Lord Frost, Boris Johnsons' Brexit negotiator heads back to Brussels later for another bout of talks. Talking means legal fighting is on hold, but it doesn't mean it isn't on the way.

UK looks likely to trigger Article 16 - then what?,"This has not been a good week for Boris Johnson. The Conservative Party has been battered by allegations that some of its MPs are on the take. The way the prime minister has reacted to the situation has been publicly criticised, and privately slammed by many on his own side. Even some of Boris Johnson's most stalwart backers in parts of the Conservative press have called foul. But if you think this has been bumpy, it's not impossible that the government might find itself in a much more dramatic and risky situation with much further-reaching consequences for us all. What is Article 16 and why does it matter? Triggering Article 16 'would provoke instability' EU warns of consequences if UK triggers Article 16 It sounds harmless enough: Article 16, an obscure set of three paragraphs agreed as part of the Brexit withdrawal deal between the UK and EU. So first off, it's important to understand it is part and parcel of the agreement that both sides grappled to achieve, and then signed up to in October 2019. You might remember that the Brexit arrangements left Northern Ireland, of course part of the UK, essentially in the EU's huge trading bloc for goods. This meant that goods could go backwards and forwards over the land border on the island of Ireland without hassle. That sorted out one aspect of the geographic reality - but it also meant that there would be checks and controls on goods going into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. From the off, that created an inbuilt difference between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Both sides were perfectly aware that these arrangements might be tricky in practice, so the deal included Article 16. The Article gives either side the ability to cry foul and take their own ""safeguard measures"" if it's all going wrong - if trade is going haywire, or the deal is causing real suffering. Either the UK or the EU has the right to take its own action, after giving a month's notice. Boris Johnson celebrates his Brexit trade deal with the cabinet in December 2020 That could mean, for example, the UK stopping checks on goods that are being sent across the Irish Sea, intended only for use in Northern Ireland. In other words, if something's made in Bolton, but sold in Belfast, it wouldn't go through customs checks. But the actions could be more dramatic, suspending more of the deal the two sides agreed, whether that's product standards, customs checks, or VAT rules. Working out how far to go, and what is justified, is a hard first step. As one cabinet minister told me: ""The mechanics aren't controversial, the difficult decision is how far you want to go."" Article 16 could be used to carry out a few tweaks, or to tear through the existing agreements. In turn, that would also have an impact on how the EU reacts. Why though would the UK want to go down that road in any case, whether using it as a big bazooka or just trying to fiddle around with a few elements? Some in the Nationalist community had a message for the PM on a 2019 visit One diplomat told me that triggering Article 16 would be ""lose, lose, lose"", and could cause a ""total breakdown of trust, and a deep freeze in relations"" between the EU and the UK. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major, who it's fair to say is no fan of the current occupant of Downing Street, has said it would be ""absurd"". The main opposition parties would likely condemn the move. But for months, the UK government has been saying the impact of the arrangements and how they are being implemented can't last, even though, as things stand, the part of the deal relating to Northern Ireland - known as the protocol - is certainly not being implemented in full. But its effects have already caused lots of different concerns - whether that would be, as one source describes it, companies being ""buried under mountains of new paperwork"", warnings over shortages of medicines, difficulties moving pets around, or the issue that's taken up most column inches, the so-called ""sausage wars"" over the sale of chilled meats. The UK believes the EU adopted an overly vigorous approach to pursuing the rules, when a lighter touch would do. In turn of course, the EU says the UK signed up to the deal, why are they surprised when Brussels insists its followed in full? Dominic Cummings claims the government always intended to ditch the parts they didn't like As ever in high-tension diplomatic spats like this, the situation is not binary, and both sides have reasons for frustration. Of course, intense politics are at play here too. Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland largely can't stand the protocol, and have deep concerns about being able to keep a lid on tensions. One source warns ""if the government doesn't move and show a bit of teeth, things could implode"". The DUP leader has even said if there isn't movement he could pull his support. With an election due by May 2022, they are pushing for action as soon as possible. There's political mistrust between the UK and the EU side too over Boris Johnson's original attitude to the deal, and whether he ever intended to stick to the legal promises he made. That was stoked by his controversial former adviser, Dominic Cummings, who said publicly the government had always intended to ""ditch"" the bits they didn't like. Another source familiar with the negotiations told me ""Article 16 was the route we thought we would go down from the beginning"", adding: ""it was always clear that unless the EU was willing to back down, we wouldn't be able to stick with it long term"". Now it is not exactly unusual for political deals to leave ambiguities, and some issues unresolved. Given that the European Court did retain a role in supervising the protocol, that source suggests it was never likely to be ""compatible with the autonomy of the UK"". But the admission that Boris Johnson's team believed there was something seriously up with the deal to start with has not exactly put the EU in the mood for compromise. And what Brussels has been willing to budge on so far has not been nearly enough to satisfy No 10. For political and practical reasons therefore, it seems almost inevitable that unless the European Union changes its position in a significant way, and soon, that the UK will trigger Article 16. Lord Frost is still in talks with EU counterpart MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ Talks are continuing, and while one source says, ""it's not definite"", they acknowledge that ""optimism has been waning"". In fact, the UK has said publicly since July that the conditions for the trigger to be pulled have indeed been met. Since then, the UK view is clearly that ""the EU solution is just not good enough"". But on the other side, there's sceptism over the UK's desire even to find a way out. Lord Frost, the PM's Brexit lieutenant, is ""in problem-finding, not problem- solving mode"", one source said. I'm told that diplomats were reassured by government that the action wouldn't be taken this week, after the talks between that will take place between the two sides on Friday. But I'm told there have been discussions about starting the process, even early next week. Don't panic, this does not seem to have yet been resolved. Some in government are arguing for more explanation of the case to the public before drastic action is taken. One insider described a ""reasonableness test"". Another said that the UK government wanted to build an ""evidence base"" to demonstrate why they felt the action had to be taken, before going public. Some of the smart money is on the bust-up not coming until December, with one government source suggesting on Thursday: ""We're going to see a bit more time pass before it happens."" The border at the centre of the dispute Whatever the moment, unless something very unexpected happens, or the negotiators and politicians on both sides have personality transplants, it seems like Article 16 will be introduced before too long. The likely impact of the move seems less certain than whether Boris Johnson and Lord Frost take the decision. It hasn't happened before, so there is no real precedent. And there are different schools of thought. First, it's important to understand that triggering Article 16 is starting a dispute process. It's not one moment, but the start of many. One source says some Brexiteer MPs ""think you trigger it and everyone starts singing Rule Britannia - no one is asking themselves what happens after you trigger"". Theoretically, the process begins with a month of intense technical talks to try to resolve the dispute. If that doesn't work, there would probably then be an emergency meeting of EU leaders, to take the decision up to prime ministers, not just the EU Commission. There could be different forms of restrictions on trade, specific sanctions, or they could give notice that they would tear up the whole trade agreement, which Ireland warned might happen this week. Without getting too technical, the trigger could end up with grumpy talks dragging on over many months with lots of politicking but not much changing practically. Both sides could, in a genuine way, join together to try to work things out. Or the trigger could, as one observer warned, boil over into a ""full scale trade war that undermines the UK and the EU's post-Covid economic recovery"". The economic consequences of that could be profound for us all, if the argument really went that far. And what would Number 10 do in the end, if the UK didn't get what it wanted? If, as another source suggests, Boris Johnson ""triggers the process, it finds against the UKâ¦.and ultimately the European Court says you must comply - he's snookered"". As explained here, the UK may well want to strip the European Court of Justice of its role overseeing the Protocol. Technically, the Article 16 process itself does not come directly under the European Court. But if, as some fear is likely, the argument tips into a wider dispute about the application of EU law then the European Court would end up as the final arbiter. At the risk of hammering the point, the UK could try to reduce the European Court's influence on Northern Ireland by starting a huge legal argument, but actually end up with its influence being confirmed. Mid-November has been pencilled in for several months, as the moment when an actual decision was going to have to be made. That final conclusion has not yet been reached. And given what could be at stake, both sides would still, in theory, like the negotiations to work. But we are approaching a moment where Downing Street may decide that the huge political and economic risks of triggering Article 16 are worth it, that the downsides of the protocol are no longer tolerable, and efforts to find a compromise have run their course. Yet the potential outcomes might make the last stormy seven days look like a moment of deep calm.

Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem,"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

What is Article 16 and why does it matter?,"Goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control There is growing speculation that the UK could use Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol after legal advice that overriding some parts of the post-Brexit treaty would be lawful. Theadvice given to Attorney General Suella Bravermancould allow the UK to follow through on threats to scrap contentious parts of the deal, which is designed to avoid a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. With the dispute between the UK and EU continuing to escalate, here's a look at exactly what Article 16 is and how it could come into play. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem In October 2019, the UK and EU agreed a special Brexit deal for Northern Ireland, known as the protocol. Goods can flow freely across the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic It leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. That means that goods can flow freely between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, removing the threat of a ""hard border"". However, goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control - amounting to what is being referred to as an ""Irish Sea border"". Article 16 of the protocol sets out the process for taking unilateral ""safeguard"" measures if either the EU or UK concludes that the deal is leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade. Those safeguards would amount to suspending parts of the deal. Safeguard measures can be taken if the protocol is leading to serious ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"" that are liable to persist. So, while it is not intended to be used for temporary or minor problems there is no specific guidance on what qualifies as a ""serious"" difficulty. Additionally, it can be used if the protocol is leading to ""diversion of trade"", but again there is no guidance on how exactly that should be interpreted. In July the UK government said that, in its opinion, the threshold has been reached for using safeguards, but it is choosing not to use them for now. A month's formal notice is supposed to be given before any action is taken, although immediate action is allowed in ""exceptional circumstances"". That is not the intention. Article 16 of the protocol sets out the process for taking unilateral ""safeguard"" measures if either the EU or UK concludes that the deal is leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade. Additionally, it says that priority shall be given to measures that will ""least disturb"" the functioning of the protocol. After safeguarding measures are implemented, negotiations should continue, with the measures being jointly reviewed every three months with a view to their abolition or limitation. However, this would still seem to give the UK government quite wide discretion on what action to take. If it believes the rules for getting goods into NI from GB are irredeemably complicated it could move to entirely suspend articles 5, 7, 8 and 10 of the protocol which deal with customs, products standards, VAT and state aid. That would effectively end the Irish Sea border and from the EU's perspective create a backdoor into its single market. Is the UK hoping the EU will accept an ultra-light touch approach to protect the single market? Such a move would be close to the approach to the Protocol laid out in the UK ""command paper"" in July The paper described an arrangement where there would be ""no need for certificates and checks for individual items that are only ever intended to be consumed in Northern Ireland"". Checks and controls would still be carried out on goods destined for Ireland with these largely identified by the traders involved - a sort of ""honesty box border"". Raoul Ruparel, who was a senior Brexit advisor to Theresa May, says he thinks this sort of maximalist approach to Article 16 is likely. ""What the UK wants to do is quite clear. It will likely suspend parts of the protocol around the (Irish Sea) border - customs and agrifood especially,"" he tweeted. ""It will move to implement its approach as set out in the command paper."" The UK calculation may be that after a period of conflict the EU will ultimately reverse the entire thrust of its Northern Ireland policy since 2017 and accept that an ultra-light touch approach is sufficient to protect the single market. If the EU concludes that the UK's actions create an ""imbalance"" between its rights and obligations under the protocol, then it can take ""proportionate rebalancing measures"". These are not defined and would largely be determined by what the UK does. Sam Lowe, an analyst at the Centre for European Reform, says if, for example, the UK were to suspend the entire protocol, and ""in effect dare the EU to either enforce a border between Ireland and Northern Ireland or between Ireland and the rest of the EU, we should expect the EU's response to be explosive"". However, he thinks if the UK still enforces some controls on goods entering Northern Ireland from great Britain, the EU's response will probably be ""more measured"". ""In terms of immediate response, any EU rebalancing measures would need to be proportionate, and 'strictly necessary to remedy the imbalance'. ""These caveats limit the scope of the EU's immediate (legal) response,"" he added. The EU is also understood to be preparing legal measures which, for example, could challenge the scope of the UK's Article 16 actions. Ultimately, the EU could impose tariffs on UK goods but that would only be possible after a lengthy arbitration process. The arbitrators would first have to find that the UK is in breach of the protocol. Then the UK would have to refuse to remedy that breach, at which point the EU could retaliate under the terms of the wider Brexit deal, the TCA. It could require another arbitration process to rule whether the use of tariffs is proportionate retaliation. There is a potentially faster legal track known as infringement proceedings which could lead to the UK being fined. The UK could be blocked from accessing the Horizon Europe research programme The EU could also take more informal political measures. Anton Spisak, policy lead at the Tony Blair Institute, tweeted that the EU's response to ""an expansive use of Article 16 will have to be robust enough to have a deterrent effect"". He suggests that would mean ""quick, unilateral and asymmetrical actions that can be passed easily through the European Council"". These measures could include blocking UK accession to Horizon Europe research programme. If the EU thinks arbitration and legal action would take too long to have an effect it could reach for the nuclear option. A clause in the TCA allows either side to terminate the whole deal with a year's notice. Nine months notice is required if it is just the trade elements of the deal which are to be terminated. If that happened it would effectively set a course for a no-deal Brexit, with tariffs on a broad range of goods and other significant barriers to EU-UK trade. Mujtaba Rahman, analyst at the Eurasia Group consultancy, says this is figuring in EU considerations. ""I expect no intermediate step such as tariffs. Just an immediate, emergency EU Council & political decision to suspend the UK-EU trade deal,"" he tweeted. He added that would mean next year would see ""a re-run of Brexit... with renegotiation of Irish border issue, with threat of no-deal tariffs looming in the background"".
