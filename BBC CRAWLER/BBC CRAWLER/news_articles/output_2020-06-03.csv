"UK quarantine plans and Â£1,000 penalties confirmed","This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: 'We are now more vulnerable to infections being brought in from abroad' Plans to force almost all arrivals to the UK to isolate for 14 days have been confirmed by the home secretary. Priti Patel told the Commons that Border Force will check that travellers fill out a form with their contact details and location for isolation. Leaving isolation prematurely in England could result in a fine of up to Â£1,000 or prosecution, she said. ""We will not allow a reckless minority to put our domestic recovery at risk,"" she said. Ms Patel told MPs that scientific advisers had said quarantine would not have been effective earlier in the coronavirus pandemic when infection rates in the UK were higher. But now, imported cases of the virus posed a more significant threat, she said, so it was now important to ""protect our hard-won progress as we move in the right direction"". It comes as the latest Department of Health figures show another 359 people have died after contracting coronavirus, bringing the UK total to 39,728. An additional 1,871 people tested positive in the last 24-hour period. 'Iâm ready to face quarantine just to get away' UK holidaymakers âwelcomeâ in Portugal No early return for UK tourists, says Spain Asked at the Downing Street briefing whether he would recommend people in the UK book foreign holidays, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the public to follow Foreign Office guidance against non-essential travel. ""We've got to knock this virus on the head,"" he said. And while he urged EU workers who had left the UK because their jobs had disappeared during lockdown to return, he ruled out any alternatives to quarantine for them, such as a medical certificate. ""Come back to London, or the UK - but you've got to quarantine. Everybody has been in lockdown for a long time, I know it's an imposition, but we really have got to beat this virus,"" he said. Ms Patel said in the Commons that the ""proportionate and time-limited measures"" would come into force on Monday, with ""limited exemptions"" intended to ensure supplies of essential items such as food and protective equipment were not disrupted. The regulations apply to England, and Ms Patel said devolved administrations would set out their own rules for enforcing the quarantine. Ms Patel said the measures would be reviewed after three weeks and the government would aim to ensure greater freedom in the long term, including establishing ""international travel corridors"" with countries deemed to be safe. Many MPs - including Conservatives - were in the Commons raising concerns about the government's approach to quarantine. Firstly, they argue this policy is being brought in too late. They believe it should have been introduced when the virus was spreading in Europe - and before it took hold here. Many now have concerns the government is overreacting as it tries to prevent a second spike. They told the home secretary they are worried a blanket quarantine will have a devastating impact on airlines, airports and the wider tourism industry. Very few MPs showed support for the government's approach. They want the government to take a more targeted approach - finding ways of allowing travel from certain countries where transmission levels are lower. Ryanair said the proposals were ""utterly ineffective"", with arrivals travelling from the airport before they isolate, potentially spreading infection, while the government would phone ""less than 1%"" of them to check they were complying. ""This 14-day UK quarantine is ineffective, completely useless, and will have no effect on British passengers who will largely ignore it,"" a spokeswoman said. The Confederation of British Industry said it needed more detail on how the policy would be reviewed, who would be exempt and how the international travel corridors with key trading partners could be created. ""Businesses and government urgently need to draw up an internationally coordinated plan to get people safely moving across borders as soon as possible,"" said CBI president John Allen. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Sources at the French and Italian foreign ministries told the BBC there had been no bilateral talks yet about lifting the quarantine plans and establishing travel corridors or ""air bridges"" with the UK. ""If the UK imposes a quarantine period, we will apply it too,"" a French official said. The plan has sparked concern among several Tory MPs, with former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers calling for it to be suspended while travel corridors are set up, to ""save jobs in aviation and let families go on their summer breaks in the sun"". Speaking at an earlier debate about the aviation industry, former prime minister Theresa May said quarantine would ""close Britain off from the rest of the world"". Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said people needed reassurance that this was not ""a three-week fudge to try to spare the government embarrassment for failing to grip this issue at the right time"". He said only 273 people had been quarantined in the early stages of the pandemic as 18 million visitors arrived in the UK, with the government's own advisers saying many cases came not from China but from places in Europe. Under the new rules, most arrivals to the UK will have to fill out a ""contact locator form"" with details of where they will isolate for two weeks and how they can be contacted. Anyone failing to remain in isolation will face a Â£1,000 fixed penalty in England, with prosecution and an unlimited fine potentially to follow, the Home Office said. Failure to fill in the form can also be punished with a Â£100 fine. Border Force can refuse entry to non-residents who do not comply, and the Home Office also said that deportation would be considered ""as a last resort"" for foreign nationals who fail to isolate.

'Half of UK struggling with sleep' during lockdown,"More than half the UK population has struggled with sleep during the lockdown, a survey suggests. King's College London researchers said sleep problems were more common in people facing financial hardship, while two in five reported having more vivid dreams than usual. Some people slept for longer than usual, but without feeling rested. The findings are based on online interviews in late May with 2,254 UK residents in the 16-75 age bracket. The study was carried out by market research company Ipsos MORI and King's College London. The researchers said lack of sleep may itself have had knock-on effects on people's capacity to be resilient during the pandemic, and there are signs of a disproportionate impact on particular groups: women, younger people and those facing financial difficulties. ""As with so much about Covid-19, the crisis is affecting people very differently depending on their circumstances, and that includes the most fundamental aspects of life, such as sleep,"" said Prof Bobby Duffy of King's College London. He said nearly two-thirds of the public reported some negative impact on their sleep, showing just how unsettling the pandemic and lockdown measures have been. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic Disturbed sleep is often caused by stress, and can itself increase stress levels, creating a cycle that is difficult to break, added Dr Ivana Rosenzweig, of Kings College. However, a quarter of participants reported they were sleeping more and feeling better for it, she said, highlighting that, ""as a society, we simply do not get the chance to sleep as much as we need, and that this pandemic is allowing some of us to rediscover the importance of sleep"". Previous research has shown that for many people lockdown has led to disturbed sleep, insomnia and vivid dreams. Experts have suggested keeping to a routine, not taking naps and trying to get some exercise outside.

Demands grow for 'green industrial revolution',"The document plans for a massive expansion in offshore wind Greenpeace has joined a growing list of organisations demanding that the UK government puts protecting the environment at the heart of any post-Covid-19 economic stimulus package. The campaign group has produced a detailed ""manifesto"" with measures to boost clean transport and smart power. The document follows a comparable call from some of Britain's most powerful business leaders earlier this week. Last week, the prime minister also expressed a similar ambition. Boris Johnson said he wanted to see a ""fairer, greener and more resilient global economy,external"" after Covid-19 and that ""we owe it to future generations to build back better"". Make Covid-19 recovery green, say business leaders How a green new deal really could go global The manifesto also contains measures to support the protection of nature, green buildings and the creation of an economy in which virtually everything is reused. Greenpeace says the crisis has given Britain a ""once in a lifetime"" opportunity to transform life, travel and work. It added that the plan would create hundreds of thousands of secure jobs. On Monday, more than 200 chief executives of some of the UK's top firms - including HSBC, National Grid, and Heathrow airport - signed a letter to the prime minister asking him to use the Covid-19 lockdown as a springboardto ""deliver a clean, just recovery"". Many people may be surprised how similar the recommendations of these two very different interest groups are. Both Greenpeace and the chief executives are asking the government to prioritise investments in low carbon technologies and calling for the decarbonisation of the British economy to be speeded up Both say they want to see a focus on sectors that best support the environment Both are demanding that financial support for ailing businesses must come with a requirement for them to commit to take action to reduce their impact on the environment. Greenpeace's manifesto is, however, considerably more detailed. It is a 62-page document with specific policy, spending and tax measures covering most of the British economy. It calls on the government to deliver its 2050 net zero emissions goal before 2045. The manifesto contains measures to encourage clean transport Many voters say theysupport tackling climate change when polled.,external However, lots of the policies Greenpeace proposes would prove very controversial. For example, motoristssay they are ready to change their behaviourto improve air quality, according to a recent AA survey. But many drivers may balk at Greenpeace's proposals to radically redesign the road network to favour walking and cycling, at the suggestion that petrol and diesel cars are banned by 2030 or that fuel duty is steadily increased. Many homeowners might be reluctant to spend money to upgrade their properties to meet tough energy efficiency standards. At the same time, many local communities are likely to resist the plan for a big increase in onshore wind and solar power to complement a proposed massive expansion of offshore wind farms - few things unite local communities like a proposal to put in an array of wind turbines. The manifesto proposes the creation of an economy in which virtually everything is reused But, says Greenpeace, tough policies like these are essential if the government is going to take meaningful action to tackle climate change. ""The choices our government makes now will defineâ¦ whether or not we succeed in the fight against the climate emergency"", says John Sauven, executive director of Greenpeace. ""If we fail to get this right, we may never get another chance. Now is the time for a green recovery, and for that we need action not words."" It says there would be huge dividends in terms of job creation, should its programme be adopted. Greenpeace calculates that its plans would create hundreds of thousands of new high-skilled jobs as well as helping to level up inequalities between communities in the UK. The UK government has already indicated that protecting the environment will feature heavily in any stimulus package. Back in April, Boris Johnson said a post-Covid-19 recovery plans should include efforts to ""turn the tide on climate change"". Meanwhile, the European Union has unveiled what it calledthe biggest ""green"" stimulus in history. Last week, it said it planned to commit a whopping â¬750bn (Â£667bn; $841bn) to its recovery package. Add in spending from future budgets and the total financial firepower the European Commission says it will be wielding is almost â¬2tn (Â£1.8tn; $2.2tn). Fighting climate change is at the heart of the bloc's recovery from the pandemic. There will be tens of billions of euros to make homes more energy efficient, to de-carbonise electricity and phase out petrol and diesel vehicles. The idea is to turbo-charge the European effort to reduce carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. ""If we do not do it, we will be taking much more risk,"" Teresa Ribera, deputy prime minister of Spain, told the BBC. ""The recovery should be green or it will not be a recovery, it will just be a shortcut into the kind of problems we are facing right now.""

Asymptomatic care workers unknowingly spread virus,"This video can not be played This special report looks at the timeline of the crisis in care and asks what could have been different Large numbers of staff could have been unknowingly spreading coronavirus through care homes, according to the UK's largest charitable care home provider. Data from MHA shows 42% of its staff members who recently tested positive  were not displaying symptoms. Nearly 45% of residents who had a positive test were also asymptomatic. MHA operates in England, Scotland and Wales and has fully tested staff and residents in 86 of its 90 homes so far. A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Our priority is to ensure care workers and those receiving care are protected, and the latest statistics show over 60% of care homes have had no outbreak at all. ""We've set out a comprehensive support package for residents and staff, including a Â£600m infection control fund, testing regardless of whether you have symptoms, and a named clinical lead to support every care home. ""We recognise more must continue to be done, and have made Â£3.2bn available to local authorities to address additional pressures from coronavirus."" In total, 7% of MHA staff and 13% of residents received a positive test result. Routine testing is not yet under way. MHA CEO Sam Monaghan told BBC Newsnight: ""It is not difficult to imagine that a lot of people may not have ended up dying if we'd had earlier testing and we'd been therefore better able to manage infection control in our homes."" Carers reunited with families after weeks apart Scottish care home deaths overtake hospital deaths 24-hour test results 'by end of June' In May, Professor John Newton from Public Health England said it would be ""premature"" to introduce weekly testing of care home staff and residents. Instead, the government promised one universal test for everyone in care homes in England by early June. Many social care providers have complained that hasn't happened. Mr Monaghan continued: ""I think it's very difficult not to see that the only real way that this can have come into our homes is through staff picking it up, just through the community contacts they would have had. ""I think that is what is so hard for all our staff, because they care. But if they don't know they've contracted the virus, how can you manage this? ""We lobbied right from the outset that routine testing was going to be absolutely vital in terms of us managing and doing effective infection control in our homes. The government still isn't offering that. ""What does it say to the valuable people who work and live in care settings that it's 'premature' to test them weekly when Premiership footballers are being offered a test, not once, but twice a week?"" The government promised one universal test for everyone in care homes in England by early June ONS figures show more than a quarter of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales have happened in care homes. MHA has shared with Newsnight its log of suspected and confirmed cases. It says 398 people have died in its care homes since the crisis began. Three MHA staff have also succumbed to the virus. So far 930 people have recovered from suspected or confirmed Covid-19. This data also shows less than half of the residents who died ever got a test. Heather Grange care home in Burnley lost 10 residents.  Only four were tested for coronavirus. Manager Mark Quarmby said: ""Once the virus took hold of some of our residents, it was relentless.  We'd see cases where people literally showed some symptoms on a Friday and by Tuesday they'd passed away. ""There was no testing. I actually had a conversation with Public Health England and asked for tests. I was categorically told there was no testing for care homes in the North West. We were on our own. ""The early warning, that testing, could have changed outcomes. People could have lived the next two, three, four, five years. It makes me very sad."" Public Health England said it ""worked with Heather Grange care home and local partners to provide appropriate guidance and support to minimise the spread of Covid-19.  Testing was arranged in line with policy at that time"". You can watchNewsnighton BBC Two at 22:30 on weekdays.

One in five with Covid could test negative,"The head of the Test and Trace programme has been challenged over the risks of false negative coronavirus results by a committee of MPs. Dido Harding was asked at the health select committee why people are not repeatedly tested to ensure they do not have coronavirus. MPs heard 20% of positive cases may be missed by the test. Earlier Boris Johnson told the Commons tests would be processed within 24 hours by the end of June. Questioned by Mr Hunt, the PM said the 24-hour target would need to take into account ""insuperable problems"" such as postal delays. He said ""I can undertake to him now to get all tests turned around in 24 hours by the end of June, except for difficulties with postal tests or insuperable problems like that."" Coronavirus contact tracer 'paid to watch Netflix' Coronavirus: How does contact tracing work in England? What tests are being done in the UK? The tests involve a nose and throat swab which is then used to look for the virus's genetic material. It detects active coronavirus infection, so cannot say if someone has recovered from Covid-19. Testing positive should allow contacts to be traced, and determine whether NHS staff can go back to work. But the swab tests carried out can deliver false negative results - suggesting someone does not have coronavirus when they are actually positive. That could be because of the quality of the swab, the timing of the test or issues in the lab. During the select committee hearing Mr Hunt citedevidence from the University of Bristol,externalas suggesting 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative, wrongly telling someone they are not infected. Baroness Harding said she understood estimates of the proportion of false negative results ranged between ""two and 20-odd per cent"". She added that the issue of why those with a negative result were not re-tested was ""a medical"" question for the scientists, and it was her job ""to take Sage and chief medical officers' guidance"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The test is reliable and effective. Like any diagnostic test however, there is always the small possibility of a false negative or a false positive result."" The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA), which represents hospital doctors, had earlier called for NHS staff to be tested more than once. Dr Claudia Paoloni, the union's president, said relying on a single negative result risked ""infecting patients and staff"". Prof Nicola Stonehouse, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said people needed to be aware that one test wasn't ""good enough"". It's necessary to have multiple tests, she said, and they needed to be separated by 72 hours. Currently, a negative test clears people to return to work provided they don't have symptoms, and means contact tracing isn't triggered. GP, and diagnostic tests researcher, Dr Jessica Watson toldBBC Radio 4's More or Lessprogramme the ""best guess"" was about 70 in every 100 people who have coronavirus would be picked up by the testing programme. Testing and tracing is clearly going to be crucial in allowing the UK to get back to some level of normality. For it to work successfully, two basic things are needed above all else. People need to trust it and it needs to work effectively. The two are, of course, interlinked. And, unfortunately, on both counts the jury is out. The service - as Baroness Harding points out - is only six days old. It deserves to be given a little time to bed in. But pretty quickly the public will need to be given information about how it is working and whether people are complying with the requests to isolate. This is something officials are reluctant to do at the moment until they have properly validated the numbers - understandable given the UK Statistics Authority has already criticised the way testing numbers have been presented. It also needs people to come forward for testing. Surveys suggest there are around 8,000 new infections a day in the community, but the testing system is picking up less than 2,000 of them - and that includes those diagnosed in care homes and hospitals. If enough people are not coming forward for a test in the first place, tracing contacts and containing future outbreaks is bound to fail. Factors affecting the outcome include at what point in their illness someone is tested, how good a sample is taken, along with any problems with processing tests, she said. Public Health England is expected to publish an evaluation of its tests, used for hospital patients and some staff, this week. Follow Rachelon Twitter,external RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Trump denies protests forced him into bunkerThe president also defends his race relations record as anger continues over George Floyd's death.US & Canada,"This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting US President Donald Trump has denied reports he was rushed to the White House bunker on Friday night during anti-racism protests. Mr Trump told Fox News radio he went down during the day for a ""tiny period of time"" for an ""inspection"". There have been protests near the White House, and across the US, for days over the death in custody of George Floyd. Although some have turned violent, the defence secretary has said he does not back deploying ""active duty forces"". This video can not be played White House compares Trump to Churchill in WW2 Mark Esper said on Wednesday he did not support invoking the Insurrection Act, which would enable the deployment of federal troops for domestic law enforcement. ""The option to use active duty forces should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations now,"" he said. This marks a break with President Trump, who has threatened to use the 1807 act and call up troops to quash demonstrations. During a White House briefing on Wednesday, Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said for now, Mr Esper is still in his role. This video can not be played Activist explains plea for peaceful protests ""As of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper and should the president lose faith we will all learn about that in the future,"" she said. Live: Read the latest on the Floyd protests The death of African-American George Floyd, whose neck was pinned down by the knee of a white policeman in Minneapolis, sparked widespread protests. Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated across the United States for eight days against racism and the police killings of black Americans, while also calling for an end to racism and discrimination. The vast majority have been peaceful but some have turned violent and curfews have been imposed in a number of cities. He was speaking on radio to Fox's Brian Kilmeade, as well as posting a number of new tweets amid continued criticism of his response to the unrest. A report in the New York Times quoted a source as saying Mr Trump was taken into the bunker on Friday night with bodyguards. ""It was a false report,"" Mr Trump said, adding: ""I was there for a tiny, little short period of time. And it was much for an inspection... maybe sometime you're going to need it."" This video can not be played Aleem Maqbool reports from peaceful protest in Washington's Lafayette Park On Monday, Mr Trump came in for criticism after police dispersed mostly peaceful protesters to clear a way for him to stand outside the nearby St John's Church clutching a Bible. Mr Trump denied telling police to disperse protesters. ""I didn't say, oh move them out, I didn't know who was there,"" he said, adding that ""most religious leaders loved"" his visit to the church. The presiding bishop of the the Episcopal Church, Michael Curry, accused Mr Trump of using the church for ""partisan political purposes"", while the Archbishop of Washington Wilton D Gregory said the president had ""manipulated"" the shrine. Trump's church visit shocks religious leaders When asked about law enforcement during the protests, Mr Trump admitted ""you have to get better than what they've been doing... we have to get the police departments, everybody has to do better"", without giving any details on new policy. In his tweets, Mr Trump, defended his record on race relations saying his presidency had done more for black Americans than presidential rival Joe Biden had done ""in 43 years"". Mr Biden has said Mr Trump's actions are trying to ""serving the passions of his base"" and has pledged not to ""traffic in fear and division"".

GEORGE FLOYD:An athlete, friend and father NEWS REPORTERS:A new target for police? DECEPTIVE FOOTAGE:Conspiracy theories spread online HOW IT HAPPENED:The last moments of his life Tuesday evening saw tens of thousands of mainly peaceful protests in the US, with levels of violence markedly down, although some demonstrators continued to defy curfews. One of the biggest protests, joined by Floyd's relatives, took place in his hometown of Houston, Texas. On Wednesday there was international support for Floyd's family, with marches taking place in Ireland, New Zealand, the UK, Australia and elsewhere. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support. Thousands chanted ""no justice, no peace, no racist police"" and ""black lives matter"" in central London. Some 20,000 in Paris remembered the death of black man, Adama Traore, in French police custody in 2016. Police asked several thousand protesters in the Dutch city of Rotterdam to go home as they were breaking coronavirus safe-distancing rules. The US protests began after a video showed Mr Floyd being arrested on 25 May in Minneapolis and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and will appear in court next week. Three other police officers have been fired but not yet charged. CNN reports that the state attorney-general will on Wednesday make a ""significant announcement"" on possible additional charges. This video can not be played The peaceful protests honouring George Floyd The Floyd case follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. For many, the outrage over Mr Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination. How has the unrest affected you?

Charles: I got away lightly with coronavirus,"The Prince of Wales has said he ""got away with it quite lightly"" when he contracted coronavirus at the beginning of the UK's epidemic in March. Prince Charles, 71, self-isolated after testing positive for the virus and only experienced mild symptoms. Speaking to Sky News, he said: ""I was lucky in my case... but I've had it, and I can so understand what other people have gone through."" He expressed sympathy with those who had lost family or friends. ""I feel particularly for those who have lost their loved ones and have been unable to be with them at the time. That, to me, is the most ghastly thing,"" the prince said. ""But in order to prevent this happening to so many more people, I'm so determined to find a way out of this."" Prince Charles issues warning on the arts Royal Family thanks world's nurses in video calls Prince Charles out of virus self-isolation Prince Charles, who is the heir to the throne, recovered from coronavirus after spending his seven days of quarantine at his Birkhall home on the royal Balmoral estate. The Duchess of Cornwall, 72, was tested and did not have the virus. He said: ""I can't tell you how much I sympathise with the way that everyone has had to endure with this unbelievably testing and challenging time."" The prince said the experience made him more determined to ""push and shout and prod"" as he called for nature to return to the ""centre of our economy"". ""Before this, nature has just been pushed to the peripheries, we've exploited and dug up and cut down everything as if there was no tomorrow, as if it doesn't matter."" Without learning from the pandemic, he said we may face a similar threat in future: ""The more we erode the natural world, the more we destroy biodiversity, the more we expose ourselves to this kind of danger. ""We've had these other disasters with Sars and Ebola and goodness knows what else, all of these things are related to the loss of biodiversity. So we have to find a way this time to put nature back at the centre."" He calls it - perhaps rather hopefully - ""the Great Reset"": a great opportunity to seize something good from this crisis. Prince Charles is not the only environmental voice out there; from those marvelling at the sound of birdsong these past few months, to those urging a shift to sustainable transport, there is a green wave that the prince is surfing. The prince is no mere follower of fashion; he has (as he once put it in a broadcast chat with his son Prince Harry) been ""banging on"" about the environment for more than four decades now. It means his words on the subject are often dismissed as same-old, same-old. But there is new urgency in this interview, and a bluntness; catastrophes, he says, concentrate the mind. The current generation and those that have come before have, he says, acted as if there is no tomorrow. And there is controversy. Not everyone sees the planet as a sick patient in need of care. Others, charged with the herculean task of restoring shattered economies, will have to grapple with trade-offs around environmental protection and quickly getting people back into jobs. Prince Charles has mellowed with age; no longer does he toss policy hand grenades into the public sphere. But on the future of the earth his passion still burns bright. And it is clear that he believes a moment has arrived when change is possible; he is determined to try and drive that change. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"UK quarantine plans and Â£1,000 penalties confirmedThe 14-day isolation for arrivals is needed to protect ""hard-won progress"", the home secretary says.UK","This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: 'We are now more vulnerable to infections being brought in from abroad' Plans to force almost all arrivals to the UK to isolate for 14 days have been confirmed by the home secretary. Priti Patel told the Commons that Border Force will check that travellers fill out a form with their contact details and location for isolation. Leaving isolation prematurely in England could result in a fine of up to Â£1,000 or prosecution, she said. ""We will not allow a reckless minority to put our domestic recovery at risk,"" she said. Ms Patel told MPs that scientific advisers had said quarantine would not have been effective earlier in the coronavirus pandemic when infection rates in the UK were higher. But now, imported cases of the virus posed a more significant threat, she said, so it was now important to ""protect our hard-won progress as we move in the right direction"". It comes as the latest Department of Health figures show another 359 people have died after contracting coronavirus, bringing the UK total to 39,728. An additional 1,871 people tested positive in the last 24-hour period. 'Iâm ready to face quarantine just to get away' UK holidaymakers âwelcomeâ in Portugal No early return for UK tourists, says Spain Asked at the Downing Street briefing whether he would recommend people in the UK book foreign holidays, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the public to follow Foreign Office guidance against non-essential travel. ""We've got to knock this virus on the head,"" he said. And while he urged EU workers who had left the UK because their jobs had disappeared during lockdown to return, he ruled out any alternatives to quarantine for them, such as a medical certificate. ""Come back to London, or the UK - but you've got to quarantine. Everybody has been in lockdown for a long time, I know it's an imposition, but we really have got to beat this virus,"" he said. Ms Patel said in the Commons that the ""proportionate and time-limited measures"" would come into force on Monday, with ""limited exemptions"" intended to ensure supplies of essential items such as food and protective equipment were not disrupted. The regulations apply to England, and Ms Patel said devolved administrations would set out their own rules for enforcing the quarantine. Ms Patel said the measures would be reviewed after three weeks and the government would aim to ensure greater freedom in the long term, including establishing ""international travel corridors"" with countries deemed to be safe. Many MPs - including Conservatives - were in the Commons raising concerns about the government's approach to quarantine. Firstly, they argue this policy is being brought in too late. They believe it should have been introduced when the virus was spreading in Europe - and before it took hold here. Many now have concerns the government is overreacting as it tries to prevent a second spike. They told the home secretary they are worried a blanket quarantine will have a devastating impact on airlines, airports and the wider tourism industry. Very few MPs showed support for the government's approach. They want the government to take a more targeted approach - finding ways of allowing travel from certain countries where transmission levels are lower. Ryanair said the proposals were ""utterly ineffective"", with arrivals travelling from the airport before they isolate, potentially spreading infection, while the government would phone ""less than 1%"" of them to check they were complying. ""This 14-day UK quarantine is ineffective, completely useless, and will have no effect on British passengers who will largely ignore it,"" a spokeswoman said. The Confederation of British Industry said it needed more detail on how the policy would be reviewed, who would be exempt and how the international travel corridors with key trading partners could be created. ""Businesses and government urgently need to draw up an internationally coordinated plan to get people safely moving across borders as soon as possible,"" said CBI president John Allen. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Sources at the French and Italian foreign ministries told the BBC there had been no bilateral talks yet about lifting the quarantine plans and establishing travel corridors or ""air bridges"" with the UK. ""If the UK imposes a quarantine period, we will apply it too,"" a French official said. The plan has sparked concern among several Tory MPs, with former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers calling for it to be suspended while travel corridors are set up, to ""save jobs in aviation and let families go on their summer breaks in the sun"". Speaking at an earlier debate about the aviation industry, former prime minister Theresa May said quarantine would ""close Britain off from the rest of the world"". Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said people needed reassurance that this was not ""a three-week fudge to try to spare the government embarrassment for failing to grip this issue at the right time"". He said only 273 people had been quarantined in the early stages of the pandemic as 18 million visitors arrived in the UK, with the government's own advisers saying many cases came not from China but from places in Europe. Under the new rules, most arrivals to the UK will have to fill out a ""contact locator form"" with details of where they will isolate for two weeks and how they can be contacted. Anyone failing to remain in isolation will face a Â£1,000 fixed penalty in England, with prosecution and an unlimited fine potentially to follow, the Home Office said. Failure to fill in the form can also be punished with a Â£100 fine. Border Force can refuse entry to non-residents who do not comply, and the Home Office also said that deportation would be considered ""as a last resort"" for foreign nationals who fail to isolate.

Schools in Wales to reopen later this monthParents who do not to send their children to school when they reopen on 29 June will not be fined.WalesComments,"This video can not be played A personalised experience will prepare pupils for September, said Kirsty Williams All schools in Wales will reopen on 29 June, the Welsh Government have said. They will be open to pupils from all year groups for limited periods during the week, with only a third of pupils in school at any one time, Education Minister Kirsty Williams confirmed. Schools and councils will make their own decisions over managing the return. The summer term has been extended by one week to 27 July, and the autumn half-term holiday will be stretched to two weeks. Parents who choose not to send their children to school will not be fined and pupils who fall into the shielding category will carry on with online learning. Q&A: How will schools in Wales reopen? What is life like now in school? Some children in England started backon Monday while schools inScotlandandNorthern Irelandwill begin to return in August. Some teaching unions have criticised the move in Wales, with the biggest union saying its members will be told they do not have to return to school if they feel the risk is too great. David Evans, from NEU Wales, said the measures were ""too much, too soon"" and there was ""little or no consultation"" over the additional week at the end of July. This video can not be played How will the reopening of Welsh schools work? Another union, the NASUWT, said the government did not have ""good enough reasons for risking lives."" ""The Welsh Government is well aware of the extreme difficulty of social distancing in schools, especially for younger children,"" said National Official Neil Butler. ""The minister has also admitted that this is for a 'check in' and 'catch up' so there is clearly no educational purpose behind this decision."" NAHT Cymru said that while the announced plan was the one its members preferred out of the options put forward by the Welsh Government, the intention to get ""all"" children in ""is more problematic"". It added it would have preferred to have prioritised specific year groups. Ms Williams said she was ""surprised"" by the unions' criticism and it was not helpful ""to have inflammatory language"". ""I would do nothing, and I have done nothing from this entire period when we closed schools for statutory purposes, to do anything to risk anybody's lives,"" she said. This video can not be played Chris Lawrence says there is too much uncertainty to send children back to the classroom Year groups will be split into smaller classes with staggered starts, lessons and breaks. It is expected this will mean, at most, a third of pupils present at any one time, though schools may need time to reach this level. All children will have the opportunity to ""check in, catch up, prepare for summer and September"", Ms Williams said. ""My announcement gives schools three-and-a-half weeks to continue preparing for the next phase,"" she added. Ms Williams said social distancing would be a challenge for the youngest children ""but we have experience of dealing with this in the hubs that have been operating to date"" and good practice had been learnt. She said the Welsh Government was ""moving very cautiously"" by limiting the number of children in classrooms at any one time and also the number that can be at school at the same time. Ms Williams said it was important to ensure ""equity"" by giving all children the chance to ""catch up"" and prepare with their teachers ahead of the summer holidays. She said she had been ""hugely heartened"" by headteachers ""coming forward with very practical plans"" on how they can ""move to the next phase of supporting children and families in their learning"". By doing this before September, she added, ""it gives us a natural firebreak to reflect on those experiences"" before the next term. The Welsh Government had been considering two options - to reopen this month or wait until after the summer holidays - aftersupposedly rejecting plans to bring forward the start of the autumnterm to August. So far, the only Welsh pupils who have seen the inside of a classroom since the coronavirus lockdown have been children deemed to be vulnerable or those of key workers, who have been attending school hubs to enable their parents to continue doing their vital jobs. The Welsh Government will issue further guidance for councils and schools next week. Ms Williams said the start date would mean one full month of thetest, trace and protect systembeing in place - which tracks people who have been exposed to the virus and asks them to self-isolate. Teachers will be a priority group for the new antibody testing programme, which tells people if they have previously had the virus and have developed antibodies. A maximum of a third of pupils will be in school at any one time ""As we continue to keep Wales safe, this approach will be critical,"" she said. ""The evolving science suggests that warm weather and sunlight gives us the best opportunity to ensure more time in school. ""Waiting until September would mean almost half a year without schooling. That would be to the detriment to the wellbeing, learning progress and mental health of our young people. Call for inquiry into Welsh coronavirus response MPs demand evidence for five-mile travel advice New lockdown measures 'may be needed in winter' ""This is and has been a worrying period for us all. I know that many will feel apprehensive. We have not rushed this work and this decision. ""I am also convinced that it is only by returning to their own school that we will see increased attendance from our more vulnerable and disadvantaged children."" Unison, the public services union, said all school staff must be included in antibody testing, not just teachers. ""This approach will not work and will risk the spread of Covid-19,"" schools lead Rosie Lewis said. The government will also issue guidance for further and higher education institutions next week, and for childcare providers to increase the number of children in attendance alongside schools. Further education colleges are preparing to reopen for face-to-face learning from 15 June. UK Government's key evidence on schools Has closing schools had an impact? Coronavirus risks for children Teachers are awaiting the finer detail and logistics of how they are to accommodate the children safely with social distancing in mind. ""I don't think we can ever be reassured it is perfectly safe,"" said Armando Di Finizio, head of Eastern High School in Cardiff. ""It'd be wrong not to have concerns but it is about mitigating any risks as far as we can but I think it is the right time to go back."" The profession think managing a safe return for pupils will be difficult in smaller primary schools where they ""don't have spare space"" so ""can't spread pupils out"". ""If we have different groups coming in, we're going to have to clean those rooms down completely in between each group,"" said a Cardiff primary school teacher, who would only give her first name, Carol. ""The children will also need their own set of stationary - but we suddenly don't have the finances to buy 500 sets of stationary because they would normally share. It's that kind of practical detail we need."" Parents who choose not to send their children back to school will not be fined But the teachers agree that not returning to school until September is ""perhaps too long"". ""We are there to help young people make sense of the world,"" added Mr Di Finizio. He said it would help give children ""reassurance, stability, rhythm of life and discipline"" as well as ""helping vulnerable"" and at risk students. Plaid Cymru criticised the decision, saying it was ""too early"", while the Welsh Conservatives broadly welcomed the move but said there were still questions to be answered, such as whether assistance with school transport, cleaning and school meals would be provided.

Here's the main points from today:  Today's live page was brought to you by Matthew Davis, Victoria Bisset, George Wright, Max Matza, Sean Fanning, Helier Cheung, Vicky Baker, Joshua Cheetham, Ritu Prasad and Boer Deng. ""Silence can be as deadly as violence,"" former Democratic President Jimmy Carter has warned in a statement on the George Floyd protests. The comments from Carter, the oldest living US president, follow those made by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama. Carter continued: ""People of power, privilege, and moral conscience must stand up and say 'no more' to a racially discriminatory police and justice system, immoral economic disparities between whites and blacks, and government actions that undermine our unified democracy."" ""Dehumanising people debases us all; humanity is beautifully and almost infinitely diverse,"" he adds. ""The bonds of our common humanity must overcome the divisiveness of our fears and prejudices."" ""We are responsible for creating a world of peace and equality for ourselves and future generations,"" he continued. ""We need a government as good as its people, and we are better than this."" For another day, protesters are out on the streets near the White House. In 90F (32C) heat, they lay down in the streets and chanted: ""I can't breathe."" The Washington DC mayor has pushed back the curfew time tonight to 23:00 local time, from 19:00 the past two nights. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The White House press secretary has likened President Donald Trump's ""resilience and determination"" during the #GeorgeFloyd protests to Winston Churchill inspecting bomb damage during World War Two. This video can not be played White House likens Trump to Churchill in WW2 Three alleged far-right activists in Las Vegas have been charged with trying to exploit peaceful protests and incite violence, according to prosecutors. According to the local prosecutor's office, the three men are alleged members of the âBoogalooâ movement, which prosecutors describe as ""a term used by extremists to signify a coming civil war and/or collapse of society"". âViolent instigators have hijacked peaceful protests and demonstrations across the country, including Nevada, exploiting the real and legitimate outrage over Mr Floydâs death for their own radical agendas,â US Attorney Nicholas Trutanich saidin a statement,external. âLaw enforcement is focused on keeping violence and destruction from interfering with free public expression and threatening lives.â The three men were apprehended late last month after attempting to use a molotov cocktail, officials say. As though in a direct rebuttal to Mattis, President Trump has released a video addressing the nationwide protests, with a final shot of the word âUniteâ superimposed over the stars of the US flag. The advert features the presidentâs voice over a contemplative piano soundtrack and footage of the demonstrations. Trump says he understands the pain people are feeling over the âgrave tragedyâ of George Floydâs death. He then argues Floydâs memory is being dishonoured by violence that he claims without evidence is being instigated by antifa, a loose affiliation of mainly far-left protesters. âNo one is more upset than fellow law enforcement officers,"" he says, ""by the small handful who fail to abide by their oath to serve and protect.â Images of police standing in solidarity with demonstrators play. âHealing not hatred, justice not chaos, are the mission at hand,â Trump adds. âWe are working towards a more just society, but that means building up, not tearing down, joining hands, not hurling fists.â Allow Twitter content?

A former winner of Miss Universe Malaysia is facing calls for her title to be stripped after comments she made about protests in the US. Samantha Katie James, who won the pageant in 2017, wrote a series of Instagram posts on Monday criticising the demonstrations and telling black people to ""relax"". ""You chose to be born as a 'coloured' person in America for a reason. To learn a certain lesson,"" she wrote. ""Accept it as it is."" The Brazilian-Chinese model added that ""it seems like the 'whites' won. Because if you're angry, you respond in rage and anguish. That means it has power over you. THEY HAVE POWER OVER YOU."" Her comments have drawn ire on social media, and more 120,000 people have signedan online petition calling for her title to be removed,external. The Miss Universe Malaysia Organisation has distanced itself from the remarks, calling them ""inappropriate, offensive, unacceptable and hurtful."" The beauty queen has since issued an apology on her Instagram, and said she has ""first hand experience"" of racism herself. ""I was insulted all my life for being white girl in local Malaysian school,"" she added. Former Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis, who resigned in 2018 in opposition to Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, has denounced the president's actions and blamed him for the current state of division in America. In an extraordinary critique,external, printed by the Atlantic magazine, Mattis writes that ""Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try. ""Instead, he tries to divide us."" Mattis continues: ""When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizensâmuch less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside."" The general urges the public to unite through ""the strengths inherent in our civil society"". ""This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.â Anatoly Antonov Russia's ambassador to the US has denied accusations that his country is helping to stir up unrest. On Sunday, White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien told ABC News that Russia could be using social media campaigns to stoke anger and confusion. Speaking with CNN, former national security advisor Susan Rice also said she ""would not be surprised"" if ""foreign actors"" like Russia were helping to encourage violence. But in a sharp rebuttal, Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov told state news channel Rossiya-1 that the claims were ""utterly wrong. ""It goes without saying that what is happening in the United States is fresh evidence of human rights violations and double standards,"" said Mr Antonov, according to state-run TASS news agency. ""I will say unequivocally that nobody is rejoicing. Everybody is watching with great regret what is happening,"" he added. ""We are very much worried over the situation in the host country. We wish to see its recovery."" A protester faces off with military police near the White House on Wednesday US Defence Secretary Mark Esper has abruptly reversed a plan for soldiers of the Army's 82nd Airborne division to leave Washington DC on Wednesday. The volte-face comes hours after Esper said he disagreed with Trump's threat to send active-duty soldiers into American states and cities. Active-duty troops should be deployed âonly in the most urgent and dire of situations,â he said earlier. âWe are not in one of those situations now.â Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told AP News that 200 of the 1,600 soldiers in the Washington DC region had been due to depart earlier on Wednesday. But, he said, Esper intervened to order them to remain. The White House today had refused to express confidence in Esper, with the president's spokeswoman telling reporters: ""As of right now Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper, and should the president lose faith we will all learn about that in the future."" Troops staged on the National Mall in Washington DC Virginia governor Ralph Northam will announce tomorrow that a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee will be removed from the state capital, Associated Press reports. A senior official told the news agency that the controversial statue will be removed from Richmond's Monument Avenue and put into storage until a new location is agreed upon. The monument has been vandalised during recent protests, and is the largest of five Confederate statues along the avenue. The expected announcement comes after authorities in Alexandria removed the so-called Appomattox statue honouring Confederate soldiers from the Virginian city. Memorials to the Confederacy, which fought for the legal right to keep black people as slaves, have long stirred controversy in the US. They have been criticised by black advocates as everyday symbols of white supremacy, but opponents of their removal say it is tantamount to erasing history. The Robert E Lee statue in Richmond - once the seat of the Confederate South - is one of the most well-known public landmarks in the Virginian capital. In his first on-camera remarks regarding the unrest of the past week, Democratic President Barack Obama praised protesters for making the ""kinds of epic changes and events in our country that are as profound as everything that Iâve seen in my lifetime"". The first black US president said that he saw reason for optimism despite the pain reflected in recent days and urged young people, especially, to vote for changes. ""Although all of us have been feeling pain uncertainty and disruption, some folks have been feeling it more than others,"" he said. Obama adds that the recent protests are the direct ""result of a long history of slavery and Jim Crow [laws] and red lining and institutionalised racism that have too often been the plague, the original sin, of our society"". He also called on US mayors and local officials to review police tactics. While in office, the former president also faced protests spurred by police brutality against Americans of colour, and was himself criticised for characterising demonstrators as ""criminals and thugs"". Former US president Barack Obama is hosting a video conference town hall, marking his first on-camera comments since anti-police brutality protests swept the US and world. He is expected to call for ""real change"" according to aides, and express his hope ""that we can turn protest into policyâ. He is starting to speak now. The call is being hosted on the Obama Foundation website. Thousands are expected to attend a protest in Melbourne on Saturday in response to the death of George Floyd, while also highlighting Aboriginal deaths in Australian police custody. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said people will not be fined for attending the protest, but police warned the demonstration could potentially spread Covid-19. ""What we've seen happen in the United States is a tragedy and it speaks to many of the differences between our society and the society in the United States,"" Andrews said. He added it was ""simply not feasible"" to impose fines or arrest demonstrators for breaching restrictions in place due to the pandemic. However, assistant commissioner Luke Cornelius said he would prefer the event be postponed until restrictions on large gathering are eased further. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Against the backdrop of the current US unrest, Russian activists have launched an online answer to the Black Lives Matter movement in response to a law enforcement shooting in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg. The hashtag RussianLivesMatter - in English - has gone viral in the last few days; it appears to have been started by Mikhail Svetov, of the Russian Libertarian Party, in a tweet about the 31 May shooting of a man suspected of stealing four rolls of wallpaper. The contents highlight cases of police brutality in Russia. A number of tweets have recalled the violent suppression of last summerâs protests held in support of free and fair elections in Moscow. Svetov has also tweeted calls for people to attend pickets at police headquarters in Moscow to protest abuses. However, he is a controversial character with links to the far-right. In March, Svetov posted a 70-minute interview with British far-right activist Tommy Robinson on his YouTube channel. Jessica LussenhopSenior staff writer, BBC News in Minneapolis Moments before it was announced that additional charges have been filed against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and three other former officers, the father of Michael Brown - the teenager killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 - arrived at the site of George Floydâs death. Michael Brown Sr has always asked that the officer in his sonâs case, former officer Darren Wilson, be fired, arrested and charged. None of that has yet come to pass. But standing in front of a mural to Floyd, he said the announcement of new charges gave him hope. âWe have a chance in St Louis. we have a chance to reopen our case,â he said. âThereâs no statute of limitations on murder.â Michael Brown Sr visits the site of George Floyd's death George Floyd's death in custody has sparked protests around the US - and also in countries around the world. On Wednesday, thousands protested in London, marching towards Parliament. It comes as UK chief constables said they stand alongside all those ""appalled and horrified"" by his death. A number of videos shared on social media showed protesters and police clashing outside Downing Street. Footage showed objects, including signs and a traffic cone, being thrown at police, while one protester was wrestled to the ground and restrained by officers. Read more on the London protesthere, and aboutdeaths in UK police custodyhere. Attorney General Ellison ends the press conference by promising to ""hold everyone accountable for
behaviour we can prove in court"". ""As the people who are legal professionals,
professional prosecutors â we are taking our duty seriously, and we are working
with the people who gather the facts, and we have done the work that we begin
is possible, ethical and right."" When asked about the lack of trust between the public and the authorities, he says: ""Our country has under-prosecuted these matters, in Minnesota
and throughout the country."" This, he says, is ""the origin of the trust problem"" - as ""people who have public guardians"" have not been held accountable in similar situations in the past. ""We canât control the past â all we can do is take the case we have in
front of us right now, and do our best to bring justice to the situation."" Ellison is asked about whether he is concerned the officers will be acquitted - with the reporter noting that no one has successfully prosecuted a second-degree murder charge for a policeman before - prompting more unrest, as happened during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. The 1992 riots broke out after white police officers were acquitted of police brutality for the beating of King, a black motorist. Ellison answers that the charges filed are based on the facts. ""We believe we have the ability to charge the charges that fit the facts in this case and we have done so,""  he says. ""So our concern is to put all the energy we can into putting forth the strongest case that we can, without fear or favor of anyone or anything. These charges are based on the facts that we have found and weâre gonna pursue them."" Drew Evans, the superintendant in Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, says authorities are in the process of taking the three police officers, who have just been charged, into custody. ""One is in custody, the other two we are in the process of taking into custody
and expect them to this afternoon,"" he says. Meanwhile, Attorney General Ellison tells reporters that public pressure did not influence his decision, saying he ""made the decision based on the lawâ. Â© 2025 BBC.

""Silence can be as deadly as violence,"" former Democratic President Jimmy Carter has warned in a statement on the George Floyd protests. The comments from Carter, the oldest living US president, follow those made by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama. Carter continued: ""People of power, privilege, and moral conscience must stand up and say 'no more' to a racially discriminatory police and justice system, immoral economic disparities between whites and blacks, and government actions that undermine our unified democracy."" ""Dehumanising people debases us all; humanity is beautifully and almost infinitely diverse,"" he adds. ""The bonds of our common humanity must overcome the divisiveness of our fears and prejudices."" ""We are responsible for creating a world of peace and equality for ourselves and future generations,"" he continued. ""We need a government as good as its people, and we are better than this."" For another day, protesters are out on the streets near the White House. In 90F (32C) heat, they lay down in the streets and chanted: ""I can't breathe."" The Washington DC mayor has pushed back the curfew time tonight to 23:00 local time, from 19:00 the past two nights. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The White House press secretary has likened President Donald Trump's ""resilience and determination"" during the #GeorgeFloyd protests to Winston Churchill inspecting bomb damage during World War Two. This video can not be played White House likens Trump to Churchill in WW2 Three alleged far-right activists in Las Vegas have been charged with trying to exploit peaceful protests and incite violence, according to prosecutors. According to the local prosecutor's office, the three men are alleged members of the âBoogalooâ movement, which prosecutors describe as ""a term used by extremists to signify a coming civil war and/or collapse of society"". âViolent instigators have hijacked peaceful protests and demonstrations across the country, including Nevada, exploiting the real and legitimate outrage over Mr Floydâs death for their own radical agendas,â US Attorney Nicholas Trutanich saidin a statement,external. âLaw enforcement is focused on keeping violence and destruction from interfering with free public expression and threatening lives.â The three men were apprehended late last month after attempting to use a molotov cocktail, officials say. As though in a direct rebuttal to Mattis, President Trump has released a video addressing the nationwide protests, with a final shot of the word âUniteâ superimposed over the stars of the US flag. The advert features the presidentâs voice over a contemplative piano soundtrack and footage of the demonstrations. Trump says he understands the pain people are feeling over the âgrave tragedyâ of George Floydâs death. He then argues Floydâs memory is being dishonoured by violence that he claims without evidence is being instigated by antifa, a loose affiliation of mainly far-left protesters. âNo one is more upset than fellow law enforcement officers,"" he says, ""by the small handful who fail to abide by their oath to serve and protect.â Images of police standing in solidarity with demonstrators play. âHealing not hatred, justice not chaos, are the mission at hand,â Trump adds. âWe are working towards a more just society, but that means building up, not tearing down, joining hands, not hurling fists.â Allow Twitter content?

A former winner of Miss Universe Malaysia is facing calls for her title to be stripped after comments she made about protests in the US.

""You chose to be born as a 'coloured' person in America for a reason. To learn a certain lesson,"" she wrote. ""Accept it as it is."" The Brazilian-Chinese model added that ""it seems like the 'whites' won. Because if you're angry, you respond in rage and anguish. That means it has power over you. THEY HAVE POWER OVER YOU.""

The Miss Universe Malaysia Organisation has distanced itself from the remarks, calling them ""inappropriate, offensive, unacceptable and hurtful."" The beauty queen has since issued an apology on her Instagram, and said she has ""first hand experience"" of racism herself. ""I was insulted all my life for being white girl in local Malaysian school,"" she added. Former Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis, who resigned in 2018 in opposition to Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, has denounced the president's actions and blamed him for the current state of division in America. In an extraordinary critique,external, printed by the Atlantic magazine, Mattis writes that ""Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try. ""Instead, he tries to divide us."" Mattis continues: ""When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizensâmuch less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside.""

The expected announcement comes after authorities in Alexandria removed the so-called Appomattox statue honouring Confederate soldiers from the Virginian city. Memorials to the Confederacy, which fought for the legal right to keep black people as slaves, have long stirred controversy in the US. They have been criticised by black advocates as everyday symbols of white supremacy, but opponents of their removal say it is tantamount to erasing history. The Robert E Lee statue in Richmond - once the seat of the Confederate South - is one of the most well-known public landmarks in the Virginian capital. In his first on-camera remarks regarding the unrest of the past week, Democratic President Barack Obama praised protesters for making the ""kinds of epic changes and events in our country that are as profound as everything that Iâve seen in my lifetime"". The first black US president said that he saw reason for optimism despite the pain reflected in recent days and urged young people, especially, to vote for changes. ""Although all of us have been feeling pain uncertainty and disruption, some folks have been feeling it more than others,"" he said. Obama adds that the recent protests are the direct ""result of a long history of slavery and Jim Crow [laws] and red lining and institutionalised racism that have too often been the plague, the original sin, of our society"". He also called on US mayors and local officials to review police tactics. While in office, the former president also faced protests spurred by police brutality against Americans of colour, and was himself criticised for characterising demonstrators as ""criminals and thugs"". Former US president Barack Obama is hosting a video conference town hall, marking his first on-camera comments since anti-police brutality protests swept the US and world. He is expected to call for ""real change"" according to aides, and express his hope ""that we can turn protest into policyâ. He is starting to speak now. The call is being hosted on the Obama Foundation website. Thousands are expected to attend a protest in Melbourne on Saturday in response to the death of George Floyd, while also highlighting Aboriginal deaths in Australian police custody. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said people will not be fined for attending the protest, but police warned the demonstration could potentially spread Covid-19. ""What we've seen happen in the United States is a tragedy and it speaks to many of the differences between our society and the society in the United States,"" Andrews said. He added it was ""simply not feasible"" to impose fines or arrest demonstrators for breaching restrictions in place due to the pandemic. However, assistant commissioner Luke Cornelius said he would prefer the event be postponed until restrictions on large gathering are eased further. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Against the backdrop of the current US unrest, Russian activists have launched an online answer to the Black Lives Matter movement in response to a law enforcement shooting in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg. The hashtag RussianLivesMatter - in English - has gone viral in the last few days; it appears to have been started by Mikhail Svetov, of the Russian Libertarian Party, in a tweet about the 31 May shooting of a man suspected of stealing four rolls of wallpaper. The contents highlight cases of police brutality in Russia. A number of tweets have recalled the violent suppression of last summerâs protests held in support of free and fair elections in Moscow. Svetov has also tweeted calls for people to attend pickets at police headquarters in Moscow to protest abuses. However, he is a controversial character with links to the far-right. In March, Svetov posted a 70-minute interview with British far-right activist Tommy Robinson on his YouTube channel. Jessica LussenhopSenior staff writer, BBC News in Minneapolis Moments before it was announced that additional charges have been filed against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and three other former officers, the father of Michael Brown - the teenager killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 - arrived at the site of George Floydâs death. Michael Brown Sr has always asked that the officer in his sonâs case, former officer Darren Wilson, be fired, arrested and charged. None of that has yet come to pass. But standing in front of a mural to Floyd, he said the announcement of new charges gave him hope. âWe have a chance in St Louis. we have a chance to reopen our case,â he said. âThereâs no statute of limitations on murder.â Michael Brown Sr visits the site of George Floyd's death George Floyd's death in custody has sparked protests around the US - and also in countries around the world. On Wednesday, thousands protested in London, marching towards Parliament. It comes as UK chief constables said they stand alongside all those ""appalled and horrified"" by his death. A number of videos shared on social media showed protesters and police clashing outside Downing Street. Footage showed objects, including signs and a traffic cone, being thrown at police, while one protester was wrestled to the ground and restrained by officers. Read more on the London protesthere, and aboutdeaths in UK police custodyhere. Attorney General Ellison ends the press conference by promising to ""hold everyone accountable for
behaviour we can prove in court"". ""As the people who are legal professionals,
professional prosecutors â we are taking our duty seriously, and we are working
with the people who gather the facts, and we have done the work that we begin
is possible, ethical and right."" When asked about the lack of trust between the public and the authorities, he says: ""Our country has under-prosecuted these matters, in Minnesota
and throughout the country."" This, he says, is ""the origin of the trust problem"" - as ""people who have public guardians"" have not been held accountable in similar situations in the past. ""We canât control the past â all we can do is take the case we have in
front of us right now, and do our best to bring justice to the situation."" Ellison is asked about whether he is concerned the officers will be acquitted - with the reporter noting that no one has successfully prosecuted a second-degree murder charge for a policeman before - prompting more unrest, as happened during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. The 1992 riots broke out after white police officers were acquitted of police brutality for the beating of King, a black motorist. Ellison answers that the charges filed are based on the facts. ""We believe we have the ability to charge the charges that fit the facts in this case and we have done so,""  he says. ""So our concern is to put all the energy we can into putting forth the strongest case that we can, without fear or favor of anyone or anything. These charges are based on the facts that we have found and weâre gonna pursue them."" Drew Evans, the superintendant in Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, says authorities are in the process of taking the three police officers, who have just been charged, into custody. ""One is in custody, the other two we are in the process of taking into custody
and expect them to this afternoon,"" he says. Meanwhile, Attorney General Ellison tells reporters that public pressure did not influence his decision, saying he ""made the decision based on the lawâ. Â© 2025 BBC.

The charge against Derek Chauvin has been elevated to second-degree murder, court documents show. The other three officers, previously uncharged, face counts of aiding and abetting murder. Floyd's death has sparked huge protests across the US against racism and the police killings of black Americans. The vast majority of demonstrations over the past eight days have been peaceful, but some have turned violent and curfews have been imposed in a number of cities. This video can not be played Activist explains plea for peaceful protests Announcing the new charges, Minnesota's Attorney General Keith Ellison said that they were in the interests of justice. Derek Chauvin had initially faced charges of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. These will stay on his charge sheet. The other three sacked officers are Thomas Lane, J Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao. They all face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder, and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter. Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar said on Twitter that the latest charges were ""another important step for justice"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Floyd family lawyer Benjamin Crump said in a statement: ""This is a significant step forward on the road to justice and we are gratified that this important action was brought before George Floyd's body was laid to rest."" But he later told CNN that the family believed the charge against Derek Chauvin should be first-degree murder and that they had been told that the investigation was ongoing and the charges could change further. At a press briefing, rights activist Rev Al Sharpton said that the Floyd case must lead to a national federal act. He said: ""If we come out of all this and do not have federal legislation where we can protect citizens from local policing... then all of this is drama to no end. Drama in the street must be geared to fundamental legal change."" This video can not be played George Floyd's ex partner: 'Gianna doesn't have a father' Mr Ellison said he was under no illusion that bringing a successful prosecution against the former police officers would be difficult. ""Winning a conviction will be hard. History does show there are clear challenges,"" he said. Only one officer in Minnesota has been convicted of killing a civilian while serving in the role. Attorney General Keith Ellison spells out the charges Mr Ellison said George Floyd was ""loved by his family, his life had value"" and that ""we will seek justice for you and we will find it"". He said bringing justice to society more generally would be slow and difficult work and that Americans did not have to wait for the end of the Floyd case to start that work. ""We need to rewrite the rules for a just society now,"" he said. First- and second-degree murder under Minnesota law require proof that the defendant intended to kill. First-degree in most cases requires premeditation, with second-degree more related to crimes of passion. Why did a US city go up in flames? A third-degree murder conviction would not require proof that the defendant wanted the victim to die, only that their actions were dangerous and were carried out without regard to human life. A second-degree murder conviction can carry a sentence of up to 40 years, 15 longer than for third-degree. CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African-Americans treated? GEORGE FLOYD:An athlete, friend and father NEWS REPORTERS:A new target for police? DECEPTIVE FOOTAGE:Conspiracy theories spread online HOW IT HAPPENED:The last moments of his life George Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis. A video showed Floyd being arrested and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally, with rallies on Wednesday in Australia, France, the Netherlands andin the UK, where thousands gathered in central London. This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting The Floyd case follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. For many, the outrage over Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church.

He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support.

Asymptomatic care workers unknowingly spread virusA care home provider says 42% of staff who recently tested positive were not displaying symptoms.Health,"This video can not be played This special report looks at the timeline of the crisis in care and asks what could have been different Large numbers of staff could have been unknowingly spreading coronavirus through care homes, according to the UK's largest charitable care home provider. Data from MHA shows 42% of its staff members who recently tested positive  were not displaying symptoms. Nearly 45% of residents who had a positive test were also asymptomatic. MHA operates in England, Scotland and Wales and has fully tested staff and residents in 86 of its 90 homes so far. A Department for Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Our priority is to ensure care workers and those receiving care are protected, and the latest statistics show over 60% of care homes have had no outbreak at all. ""We've set out a comprehensive support package for residents and staff, including a Â£600m infection control fund, testing regardless of whether you have symptoms, and a named clinical lead to support every care home. ""We recognise more must continue to be done, and have made Â£3.2bn available to local authorities to address additional pressures from coronavirus."" In total, 7% of MHA staff and 13% of residents received a positive test result. Routine testing is not yet under way. MHA CEO Sam Monaghan told BBC Newsnight: ""It is not difficult to imagine that a lot of people may not have ended up dying if we'd had earlier testing and we'd been therefore better able to manage infection control in our homes."" Carers reunited with families after weeks apart Scottish care home deaths overtake hospital deaths 24-hour test results 'by end of June' In May, Professor John Newton from Public Health England said it would be ""premature"" to introduce weekly testing of care home staff and residents. Instead, the government promised one universal test for everyone in care homes in England by early June. Many social care providers have complained that hasn't happened. Mr Monaghan continued: ""I think it's very difficult not to see that the only real way that this can have come into our homes is through staff picking it up, just through the community contacts they would have had. ""I think that is what is so hard for all our staff, because they care. But if they don't know they've contracted the virus, how can you manage this? ""We lobbied right from the outset that routine testing was going to be absolutely vital in terms of us managing and doing effective infection control in our homes. The government still isn't offering that. ""What does it say to the valuable people who work and live in care settings that it's 'premature' to test them weekly when Premiership footballers are being offered a test, not once, but twice a week?"" The government promised one universal test for everyone in care homes in England by early June ONS figures show more than a quarter of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales have happened in care homes. MHA has shared with Newsnight its log of suspected and confirmed cases. It says 398 people have died in its care homes since the crisis began. Three MHA staff have also succumbed to the virus. So far 930 people have recovered from suspected or confirmed Covid-19. This data also shows less than half of the residents who died ever got a test. Heather Grange care home in Burnley lost 10 residents.  Only four were tested for coronavirus. Manager Mark Quarmby said: ""Once the virus took hold of some of our residents, it was relentless.  We'd see cases where people literally showed some symptoms on a Friday and by Tuesday they'd passed away. ""There was no testing. I actually had a conversation with Public Health England and asked for tests. I was categorically told there was no testing for care homes in the North West. We were on our own. ""The early warning, that testing, could have changed outcomes. People could have lived the next two, three, four, five years. It makes me very sad."" Public Health England said it ""worked with Heather Grange care home and local partners to provide appropriate guidance and support to minimise the spread of Covid-19.  Testing was arranged in line with policy at that time"". You can watchNewsnighton BBC Two at 22:30 on weekdays.

Schools in Wales to reopen later this month,"This video can not be played A personalised experience will prepare pupils for September, said Kirsty Williams All schools in Wales will reopen on 29 June, the Welsh Government have said. They will be open to pupils from all year groups for limited periods during the week, with only a third of pupils in school at any one time, Education Minister Kirsty Williams confirmed. Schools and councils will make their own decisions over managing the return. The summer term has been extended by one week to 27 July, and the autumn half-term holiday will be stretched to two weeks. Parents who choose not to send their children to school will not be fined and pupils who fall into the shielding category will carry on with online learning. Q&A: How will schools in Wales reopen? What is life like now in school? Some children in England started backon Monday while schools inScotlandandNorthern Irelandwill begin to return in August. Some teaching unions have criticised the move in Wales, with the biggest union saying its members will be told they do not have to return to school if they feel the risk is too great. David Evans, from NEU Wales, said the measures were ""too much, too soon"" and there was ""little or no consultation"" over the additional week at the end of July. This video can not be played How will the reopening of Welsh schools work? Another union, the NASUWT, said the government did not have ""good enough reasons for risking lives."" ""The Welsh Government is well aware of the extreme difficulty of social distancing in schools, especially for younger children,"" said National Official Neil Butler. ""The minister has also admitted that this is for a 'check in' and 'catch up' so there is clearly no educational purpose behind this decision."" NAHT Cymru said that while the announced plan was the one its members preferred out of the options put forward by the Welsh Government, the intention to get ""all"" children in ""is more problematic"". It added it would have preferred to have prioritised specific year groups. Ms Williams said she was ""surprised"" by the unions' criticism and it was not helpful ""to have inflammatory language"". ""I would do nothing, and I have done nothing from this entire period when we closed schools for statutory purposes, to do anything to risk anybody's lives,"" she said. This video can not be played Chris Lawrence says there is too much uncertainty to send children back to the classroom Year groups will be split into smaller classes with staggered starts, lessons and breaks. It is expected this will mean, at most, a third of pupils present at any one time, though schools may need time to reach this level. All children will have the opportunity to ""check in, catch up, prepare for summer and September"", Ms Williams said. ""My announcement gives schools three-and-a-half weeks to continue preparing for the next phase,"" she added. Ms Williams said social distancing would be a challenge for the youngest children ""but we have experience of dealing with this in the hubs that have been operating to date"" and good practice had been learnt. She said the Welsh Government was ""moving very cautiously"" by limiting the number of children in classrooms at any one time and also the number that can be at school at the same time. Ms Williams said it was important to ensure ""equity"" by giving all children the chance to ""catch up"" and prepare with their teachers ahead of the summer holidays. She said she had been ""hugely heartened"" by headteachers ""coming forward with very practical plans"" on how they can ""move to the next phase of supporting children and families in their learning"". By doing this before September, she added, ""it gives us a natural firebreak to reflect on those experiences"" before the next term. The Welsh Government had been considering two options - to reopen this month or wait until after the summer holidays - aftersupposedly rejecting plans to bring forward the start of the autumnterm to August. So far, the only Welsh pupils who have seen the inside of a classroom since the coronavirus lockdown have been children deemed to be vulnerable or those of key workers, who have been attending school hubs to enable their parents to continue doing their vital jobs. The Welsh Government will issue further guidance for councils and schools next week. Ms Williams said the start date would mean one full month of thetest, trace and protect systembeing in place - which tracks people who have been exposed to the virus and asks them to self-isolate. Teachers will be a priority group for the new antibody testing programme, which tells people if they have previously had the virus and have developed antibodies. A maximum of a third of pupils will be in school at any one time ""As we continue to keep Wales safe, this approach will be critical,"" she said. ""The evolving science suggests that warm weather and sunlight gives us the best opportunity to ensure more time in school. ""Waiting until September would mean almost half a year without schooling. That would be to the detriment to the wellbeing, learning progress and mental health of our young people. Call for inquiry into Welsh coronavirus response MPs demand evidence for five-mile travel advice New lockdown measures 'may be needed in winter' ""This is and has been a worrying period for us all. I know that many will feel apprehensive. We have not rushed this work and this decision. ""I am also convinced that it is only by returning to their own school that we will see increased attendance from our more vulnerable and disadvantaged children."" Unison, the public services union, said all school staff must be included in antibody testing, not just teachers. ""This approach will not work and will risk the spread of Covid-19,"" schools lead Rosie Lewis said. The government will also issue guidance for further and higher education institutions next week, and for childcare providers to increase the number of children in attendance alongside schools. Further education colleges are preparing to reopen for face-to-face learning from 15 June. UK Government's key evidence on schools Has closing schools had an impact? Coronavirus risks for children Teachers are awaiting the finer detail and logistics of how they are to accommodate the children safely with social distancing in mind. ""I don't think we can ever be reassured it is perfectly safe,"" said Armando Di Finizio, head of Eastern High School in Cardiff. ""It'd be wrong not to have concerns but it is about mitigating any risks as far as we can but I think it is the right time to go back."" The profession think managing a safe return for pupils will be difficult in smaller primary schools where they ""don't have spare space"" so ""can't spread pupils out"". ""If we have different groups coming in, we're going to have to clean those rooms down completely in between each group,"" said a Cardiff primary school teacher, who would only give her first name, Carol. ""The children will also need their own set of stationary - but we suddenly don't have the finances to buy 500 sets of stationary because they would normally share. It's that kind of practical detail we need."" Parents who choose not to send their children back to school will not be fined But the teachers agree that not returning to school until September is ""perhaps too long"". ""We are there to help young people make sense of the world,"" added Mr Di Finizio. He said it would help give children ""reassurance, stability, rhythm of life and discipline"" as well as ""helping vulnerable"" and at risk students. Plaid Cymru criticised the decision, saying it was ""too early"", while the Welsh Conservatives broadly welcomed the move but said there were still questions to be answered, such as whether assistance with school transport, cleaning and school meals would be provided.

Could schools' phased return begin in June?,"Some schools have remained open for the families of key workers Schools would need about three weeks to prepare for a phased return, according to First Minister Mark Drakeford. In an interview onThe Andrew Marr Show, Mr Drakeford mentioned June as an example of when some children could go back to school. But this has caused confusion, according to a teaching union. NAHT Cymru said: ""At no point has June been mentioned in talks between Welsh Government and trade unions."" The Welsh Government also clarified that no decision had been made on when schools would partially reopen. Some schools have been closed for six weeks, although others have been open for the children of key workers and vulnerable pupils. On Tuesday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said there would be ""aphased approach in allowing more pupils to return to school"". A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Speaking on the Marr programme, the first minister gave more detail, saying: ""We are thinking about ways in which we can bring young people with special educational needs back in to education. ""We're thinking about particular year groups, Year 6 children in primary schools, children going up to secondary school this September."" ""We have a bilingual education system here in Wales. ""Children who are learning through the medium of Welsh and who may not have Welsh spoken at home, do we need to get those children back in to education sooner? ""Those are the sort of things we are working on at the moment,"" he added. 'Three years of GCSEs has come down to nothing' Laptops offered to school pupils during lockdown 'Phased' school reopening when lockdown lifts On the issue of when schools in Wales might partially reopen, Mr Drakeford said: ""Our advice from the trades unions and from the local education authorities is that we will need three weeks as a minimum from the point that we decide to do that to when schools can reopen, so we are talking about the beginning of June there."" Speaking to BBC Wales after the programme, Mr Drakeford said he was using June as an example: ""If we make the decision to return next week then the return to school will be in June."" But he stressed that no decision had been made. In an interview on the BBC'sPolitics Walesprogramme, Counsel General Jeremy Miles said: ""We're not saying it's the start of June. ""We're saying there needs to be a lead in time so that schools and local education authorities can adjust to that."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It went on to say that the ""profession must be at the heart of reopening decisions - the health and wellbeing of staff and pupils is paramount"". Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: ""We would caution against fixing a date in stone at this stage, and to make sure the conditions are right first of all. ""We are happy to plan towards a proposed date, but we would urge that it is clearly stated from the outset that it is moveable if more time is needed. ""We welcome the thought and care that the Welsh Government is putting into the reopening of schools. ""And we agree that the only realistic approach to doing this while sustaining social distancing is through a phased approach, in which certain groups of children are brought in first,"" she added.

Frankie & Benny's owner to close up to 120 sites,"Up to 3,000 jobs are at risk after one of the country's biggest restaurant operators decided as many as 120 outlets will not reopen after lockdown, the BBC has learned. The Restaurant Group, which owns Frankie & Benny's and Garfunkels, has about 600 outlets across the UK, with about 22,000 workers on furlough. It is understood that Frankie & Benny's will bear the brunt of the closures. The company, which declined to comment, was due to inform staff on Wednesday, In an email to managers seen by the BBC on Tuesday, the company said: ""Many sites are no longer viable to trade and will remain closed permanently. ""The Covid-19 crisis has significantly impacted our ability to trade profitably, so we've taken the tough decision to close these restaurants now."" The group appears to be speeding up previous plans to shut restaurantsas trade suffers due to the pandemic. The email was sent to managers in the group's Leisure Division, which includes more than 200 Frankie & Benny's outlets. It is not clear which outlets will be shut, or exactly how many, but BBC was told on Wednesday that up to 120 are at risk. 'Why couldn't they keep us furloughed?' When will shops open and what will the rules be? The group also owns the Wagamama chain and some pub units. Wagamama is not part of the division which received the email and the vast majority of its restaurants are expected to reopen. The Restaurant Group said in March that 61 out of 80 branches of its Tex-Mex dining chain Chiquito's would remain closed permanently as it fell into administration. It cited the Covid-19 outbreak as having had ""an immediate and significant impact on trading"". However, the group had already announced in February, prior to the introduction of lockdown measures, that it would speed up existing plans to close restaurants. Initially it had planned to make 150 closures - which were first signalled in 2019 - over a six-year period. It then said it would close 90 restaurants by the end of 2021. ""I feel completely overwhelmed and upset,"" says Georgia. She has been working as a part-time waitress at one Frankie & Benny's outlet since last April. ""I'm angry, as they feel as though staff are disposable,"" she says, adding that the lack of certainty around work amid lockdown has created mental stress. ""I just can't believe that they would send that kind of message to managers without any warning,"" she adds. The group had already seen sales falling across many outlets. That came despite stronger revenues across the wider group in its Wagamamas and pub units. It said in February that like-for-like sales - which strip out new restaurant openings - in the division that includes Frankie & Benny's and Chiquito, fell by 2.8% in 2019. Many casual dining chains had already been struggling in the face of rising overheads and falling consumer spending. But those in the hospitality sector have seen their problems worsen due to the coronavirus pandemic, as customers have been forced to stay at home amid lockdown. Carluccio's, for example,was bought out of administration by the owner of Giraffe restaurants. Despite its rescue, more than 1,000 jobs will be lost at the Italian restaurant chain, more than half of its total workforce. The administrators said the lockdown meant difficult decisions had to be taken. Restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19 forced most cafes and restaurants to close in March,but some have since reopened as takeaways only. When lockdown was initially announced in March, trade association UK Hospitality said it was ""catastrophic for businesses and jobs"". Its chief executive Kate Nicholls warned at the time that the measures could ""lead to thousands of businesses closing their doors for good, and hundreds of thousands of job losses"". Pubs, restaurants, hairdressers, hotels, cinemas and places of worship will be allowed to open from 4 July at the earliest in England, if they can meet social distancing measures.

Starmer accuses PM of ignoring virus help offer,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer clash on the government's steps to ease the lockdown Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has accused Boris Johnson of ignoring an offer to help build public support for getting children back to school. At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said he wrote to the PM privately two weeks ago but had not received a reply. Mr Johnson said he ""took the trouble to ring"" the Labour leader to brief him on lockdown easing measures. He said Sir Keir's ""endless attacks"" on the government were undermining ""public trust and confidence"". Downing Street said the two men had spoken on 28 May in a conference call with other opposition leaders. Labour sources said the call was for the PM to brief opposition leaders on what the government intended to do - and Sir Keir had not had a one-to-one conversation with Mr Johnson since the end of April. PMQs: Starmer challenges Johnson on virus response Johnson urged to 'get a grip' on virus strategy Sir Keir used PMQs to highlight what he said was a big fall in public confidence in the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis, at a time when that support was needed most to ease the country out of lockdown. From Monday, more than two million primary pupils in England were invited back to school, butheads reported ""highly variable"" levels of attendance, ranging from 40% to 70%. The Labour leader told the PM: ""I have supported the government openly and I've taken criticism for it, but, boy, he makes it difficult to support this government over the last two weeks."" Mr Johnson accused Sir Keir of going back on his promise to work constructively with the government. But Sir Keir said he had offered to help build consensus for the reopening of schools, in a letter, dated Monday 18 May, which the Labour Party has now published. Boris Johnson said he was surprised at the Labour leader's 'tone' In it, Sir Keir tells the PM he supported the government's ""gradual easing"" of lockdown but remained concerned about elements ""including transparency, pace and having an effective test, track and trace system"" and ""the wholly unjustified attacks that have been made on teachers"". The Labour leader tells the PM he supports the opening of schools ""as soon as is feasibly possible"". But he adds: ""I am sure as prime minister you will share my concern that without a stronger consensus of professionals and parents behind the wider opening of schools, some parents will choose not to comply and the issue will become even more socially divisive."" Sir Keir offered to meet Mr Johnson, along with Education Secretary Gavin Williamson and shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey to discuss how a ""consensus can be achieved in the shortest possible timeframe"" to get children back to school. At PMQs, he said he had not received a reply to the letter. The prime minister said he was surprised Sir Keir ""should take that tone"", because he had spoken to him by phone - and the Labour leader had ""endorsed"" the steps the government was taking. ""I think that he's on firmer ground when he stands with the overwhelming majority of the British people who understand the very, very difficult circumstances that we are in,"" he told Sir Keir. Sir Keir called for an exit strategy from the government at a time when some of his own MPs - and certainly grassroots members - wanted to see him clash with No 10 more robustly on issues of the day. He now feels vindicated as he believes the lack of a strategy - ""an exit without a strategy"", as he puts it - is becoming apparent. The Labour leader is determined to stay one step ahead of the government. So, by raising questions now over the easing of lockdown while doubts remain about the alert level and the efficacy of the track and trace system, he is positioning the party to distance itself further from the government's approach ifthe R numbergoes up. But it is true that his tone towards Boris Johnson himself is hardening. Read Iain's full analysis The Labour leader also asked at PMQs about the ""promise"" Mr Johnson made about having a ""world beating"" test, track and trace operation to be in place by 1 June, saying it was weeks away from being fully up and running. Mr Johnson accused the Labour leader of ""casting aspersions on the efforts of tens of thousands of people who set it up from a standing start"". The Labour leader also criticised what he said was the government's lack of transparency over the decision to ease the lockdown in England, asking the prime minister what the current Covid-19 alert level and R infection level was. Mr Johnson slapped the despatch box as he replied: ""He knows perfectly well that the alert level does allow it and he didn't raise that issue with me when we had a conversation on the telephone."" He said the alert level remained at four - but the government's five tests for easing the lockdown had been fulfilled. ""The question for him is whether he actually supports the progress we're making, because at the weekend he was backing it and now he is doing a U-turn, now he seems to be against the steps this country is taking,"" added the PM. Sir Keir also criticised Mr Johnson's use of statistics, after the UK Statistics Authority saidit had fallen ""well short of expectations""., saying it was undermining trust. Mr Johnson replied: ""I really do not see the purpose in his endless attacks on public trust and confidence.""

Schools in Wales to reopen this monthParents who choose not to send their children to school when they reopen will not be fined.WalesComments,"This video can not be played A personalised experience will prepare pupils for September, said Kirsty Williams All schools in Wales will reopen on 29 June, the Welsh Government have said. They will be open to pupils from all year groups for limited periods during the week, with only a third of pupils in school at any one time, Education Minister Kirsty Williams confirmed. Schools and councils will make their own decisions over managing the return. The summer term has been extended by one week to 27 July, and the autumn half-term holiday will be stretched to two weeks. Parents who choose not to send their children to school will not be fined and pupils who fall into the shielding category will carry on with online learning. Q&A: How will schools in Wales reopen? What is life like now in school? Some children in England started backon Monday while schools inScotlandandNorthern Irelandwill begin to return in August. Some teaching unions have criticised the move in Wales, with the biggest union saying its members will be told they do not have to return to school if they feel the risk is too great. David Evans, from NEU Wales, said the measures were ""too much, too soon"" and there was ""little or no consultation"" over the additional week at the end of July. This video can not be played How will the reopening of Welsh schools work? Another union, the NASUWT, said the government did not have ""good enough reasons for risking lives."" ""The Welsh Government is well aware of the extreme difficulty of social distancing in schools, especially for younger children,"" said National Official Neil Butler. ""The minister has also admitted that this is for a 'check in' and 'catch up' so there is clearly no educational purpose behind this decision."" NAHT Cymru said that while the announced plan was the one its members preferred out of the options put forward by the Welsh Government, the intention to get ""all"" children in ""is more problematic"". It added it would have preferred to have prioritised specific year groups. Ms Williams said she was ""surprised"" by the unions' criticism and it was not helpful ""to have inflammatory language"". ""I would do nothing, and I have done nothing from this entire period when we closed schools for statutory purposes, to do anything to risk anybody's lives,"" she said. This video can not be played Chris Lawrence says there is too much uncertainty to send children back to the classroom Year groups will be split into smaller classes with staggered starts, lessons and breaks. It is expected this will mean, at most, a third of pupils present at any one time, though schools may need time to reach this level. All children will have the opportunity to ""check in, catch up, prepare for summer and September"", Ms Williams said. ""My announcement gives schools three-and-a-half weeks to continue preparing for the next phase,"" she added. Ms Williams said social distancing would be a challenge for the youngest children ""but we have experience of dealing with this in the hubs that have been operating to date"" and good practice had been learnt. She said the Welsh Government was ""moving very cautiously"" by limiting the number of children in classrooms at any one time and also the number that can be at school at the same time. Ms Williams said it was important to ensure ""equity"" by giving all children the chance to ""catch up"" and prepare with their teachers ahead of the summer holidays. She said she had been ""hugely heartened"" by headteachers ""coming forward with very practical plans"" on how they can ""move to the next phase of supporting children and families in their learning"". By doing this before September, she added, ""it gives us a natural firebreak to reflect on those experiences"" before the next term. The Welsh Government had been considering two options - to reopen this month or wait until after the summer holidays - aftersupposedly rejecting plans to bring forward the start of the autumnterm to August. So far, the only Welsh pupils who have seen the inside of a classroom since the coronavirus lockdown have been children deemed to be vulnerable or those of key workers, who have been attending school hubs to enable their parents to continue doing their vital jobs. The Welsh Government will issue further guidance for councils and schools next week. Ms Williams said the start date would mean one full month of thetest, trace and protect systembeing in place - which tracks people who have been exposed to the virus and asks them to self-isolate. Teachers will be a priority group for the new antibody testing programme, which tells people if they have previously had the virus and have developed antibodies. A maximum of a third of pupils will be in school at any one time ""As we continue to keep Wales safe, this approach will be critical,"" she said. ""The evolving science suggests that warm weather and sunlight gives us the best opportunity to ensure more time in school. ""Waiting until September would mean almost half a year without schooling. That would be to the detriment to the wellbeing, learning progress and mental health of our young people. Call for inquiry into Welsh coronavirus response MPs demand evidence for five-mile travel advice New lockdown measures 'may be needed in winter' ""This is and has been a worrying period for us all. I know that many will feel apprehensive. We have not rushed this work and this decision. ""I am also convinced that it is only by returning to their own school that we will see increased attendance from our more vulnerable and disadvantaged children."" Unison, the public services union, said all school staff must be included in antibody testing, not just teachers. ""This approach will not work and will risk the spread of Covid-19,"" schools lead Rosie Lewis said. The government will also issue guidance for further and higher education institutions next week, and for childcare providers to increase the number of children in attendance alongside schools. Further education colleges are preparing to reopen for face-to-face learning from 15 June. UK Government's key evidence on schools Has closing schools had an impact? Coronavirus risks for children Teachers are awaiting the finer detail and logistics of how they are to accommodate the children safely with social distancing in mind. ""I don't think we can ever be reassured it is perfectly safe,"" said Armando Di Finizio, head of Eastern High School in Cardiff. ""It'd be wrong not to have concerns but it is about mitigating any risks as far as we can but I think it is the right time to go back."" The profession think managing a safe return for pupils will be difficult in smaller primary schools where they ""don't have spare space"" so ""can't spread pupils out"". ""If we have different groups coming in, we're going to have to clean those rooms down completely in between each group,"" said a Cardiff primary school teacher, who would only give her first name, Carol. ""The children will also need their own set of stationary - but we suddenly don't have the finances to buy 500 sets of stationary because they would normally share. It's that kind of practical detail we need."" Parents who choose not to send their children back to school will not be fined But the teachers agree that not returning to school until September is ""perhaps too long"". ""We are there to help young people make sense of the world,"" added Mr Di Finizio. He said it would help give children ""reassurance, stability, rhythm of life and discipline"" as well as ""helping vulnerable"" and at risk students. Plaid Cymru criticised the decision, saying it was ""too early"", while the Welsh Conservatives broadly welcomed the move but said there were still questions to be answered, such as whether assistance with school transport, cleaning and school meals would be provided.

One in five negative Covid tests may be wrong,"The head of the Test and Trace programme has been challenged over the risks of false negative coronavirus results by a committee of MPs. Dido Harding was asked at the health select committee why people are not repeatedly tested to ensure they do not have coronavirus. MPs heard 20% of positive cases may be missed by the test. Earlier Boris Johnson told the Commons tests would be processed within 24 hours by the end of June. Questioned by Mr Hunt, the PM said the 24-hour target would need to take into account ""insuperable problems"" such as postal delays. He said ""I can undertake to him now to get all tests turned around in 24 hours by the end of June, except for difficulties with postal tests or insuperable problems like that."" Coronavirus contact tracer 'paid to watch Netflix' Coronavirus: How does contact tracing work in England? What tests are being done in the UK? The tests involve a nose and throat swab which is then used to look for the virus's genetic material. It detects active coronavirus infection, so cannot say if someone has recovered from Covid-19. Testing positive should allow contacts to be traced, and determine whether NHS staff can go back to work. But the swab tests carried out can deliver false negative results - suggesting someone does not have coronavirus when they are actually positive. That could be because of the quality of the swab, the timing of the test or issues in the lab. During the select committee hearing Mr Hunt citedevidence from the University of Bristol,externalas suggesting 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative, wrongly telling someone they are not infected. Baroness Harding said she understood estimates of the proportion of false negative results ranged between ""two and 20-odd per cent"". She added that the issue of why those with a negative result were not re-tested was ""a medical"" question for the scientists, and it was her job ""to take Sage and chief medical officers' guidance"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The test is reliable and effective. Like any diagnostic test however, there is always the small possibility of a false negative or a false positive result."" The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA), which represents hospital doctors, had earlier called for NHS staff to be tested more than once. Dr Claudia Paoloni, the union's president, said relying on a single negative result risked ""infecting patients and staff"". Prof Nicola Stonehouse, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said people needed to be aware that one test wasn't ""good enough"". It's necessary to have multiple tests, she said, and they needed to be separated by 72 hours. Currently, a negative test clears people to return to work provided they don't have symptoms, and means contact tracing isn't triggered. GP, and diagnostic tests researcher, Dr Jessica Watson toldBBC Radio 4's More or Lessprogramme the ""best guess"" was about 70 in every 100 people who have coronavirus would be picked up by the testing programme. Testing and tracing is clearly going to be crucial in allowing the UK to get back to some level of normality. For it to work successfully, two basic things are needed above all else. People need to trust it and it needs to work effectively. The two are, of course, interlinked. And, unfortunately, on both counts the jury is out. The service - as Baroness Harding points out - is only six days old. It deserves to be given a little time to bed in. But pretty quickly the public will need to be given information about how it is working and whether people are complying with the requests to isolate. This is something officials are reluctant to do at the moment until they have properly validated the numbers - understandable given the UK Statistics Authority has already criticised the way testing numbers have been presented. It also needs people to come forward for testing. Surveys suggest there are around 8,000 new infections a day in the community, but the testing system is picking up less than 2,000 of them - and that includes those diagnosed in care homes and hospitals. If enough people are not coming forward for a test in the first place, tracing contacts and containing future outbreaks is bound to fail. Factors affecting the outcome include at what point in their illness someone is tested, how good a sample is taken, along with any problems with processing tests, she said. Public Health England is expected to publish an evaluation of its tests, used for hospital patients and some staff, this week. Follow Rachelon Twitter,external RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

'Iâm ready to face quarantine just to get away',"HR professional Angela Russell and her partner Steve have decided that despite coronavirus, they will be flying to Montenegro on 5 July. They're only going for a week's holiday, but the prospect of having to spend two weeks in quarantine on their return doesn't bother them. ""I have become totally fed up with all the bad news and how the government is dealing with issues,"" she told the BBC. ""I'm prepared to put up with quarantine just to get away from here for a bit."" The couple will be holidaying with a friend of Angela's who has terminal cancer, accompanied by her husband. ""She had planned to do a lot of travelling this year and until now, all her plans have been kiboshed."" The four have booked to fly with Jet2, which plans to resume its flight programme on 1 July. A number of other airlines and tour operators have announced similar plans. Ryanair and Tui are also due to restart services from the beginning of July, while EasyJet is taking to the skies again from 15 June. British Airways has said it will launch ""a meaningful return to service"" in July, while Virgin Atlantic has said flights will not resume until August. What are the UK travel quarantine rules? UK holidaymakers 'welcome' in Portugal No early return for UK tourists, says Spain UK must agree 'air bridges', warn business groups However, at the moment, the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is still advising against all non-essential foreign travel, with no indication of when the policy might change. A spokesperson for Jet2 said the firm always followed FCO guidelines and was ""reviewing the situation on a daily basis"". Jet2 declined to give any details of the level of bookings over the next few months, describing it as ""commercially sensitive information"". The BBC has approached other airlines and holiday firms for comment. One airline that does seem to be confident about the future is budget carrier Wizz Air, which said on Wednesday that it was still planning to take delivery of new aircraft. ""Whatever we can fly, we're going to be flying, because we've seen that there is actually demand out there,"" said the airline's chief executive, Jozsef Varadi. Angela, who lives in Wales, is semi-retired and now works just one day a week, which she can easily do from home if forced to self-isolate. She points out that Montenegro is ""pretty much coronavirus-free"" . ""I've spent my life assessing risk, either in work or in my daily life,"" she says. ""The only risk is that we might pick it up at the airport."" She adds: ""My fear is that Montenegro will say, 'We don't want to let people in from the UK, because you don't seem to manage it very well.' ""But I feel it's imperative now that we support the travel industry. We have to take a pragmatic approach to how we do things."" Another hopeful holidaymaker is Robert Jenkins, of Bedwas in south Wales, who usually goes abroad four or five times a year with his wife Barbara. ""We're retired and travelling is very important to us,"" he told the BBC. Robert Jenkins hopes to fly to Greece later this year Robert and Barbara are hedging their bets, with not one, but two trips booked between now and the end of the year. The couple are due to fly with EasyJet to Malaga in Spain on 1 July and to the Greek island of Kos on 12 September. But Robert says he is poised to cancel the Spanish trip, because ""the FCO still hasn't given the go-ahead and I don't know if I'll be insured"". He is also worried by the Spanish tourism minister's remarks this week thatBritish coronavirus figures ""still have to improve""before Spain can receive tourists from the UK. ""I'm really hoping Greece will go ahead. We've gone to the same resort for 20 years and we are on first-name terms with the people in the village we stay at,"" he says. ""But it's all up in the air. Things are changing day by day."" Anyone considering booking an overseas holiday needs to find their balance on a financial tightrope. As always, if you book on a flight which is subsequently cancelled, you should be refunded, although millions of people have already found that can be a slow, and still unresolved process. Booking a package holiday also offers financial protection if it is later cancelled owing to a second wave of the virus or current restrictions being extended. Insurance is more complex. Travelling against Foreign Office advice, which is still that anything but essential travel should be avoided, would invalidate existing insurance. That has implications for claiming the cost of accommodation, car hire and so on, but also medical care. We still do not know when that advice will be lifted. It is under review.

UK holidaymakers âwelcomeâ in Portugal,"Portugal's foreign minister has said anyone in the UK thinking of going to Portugal this summer will be ""most welcome"" amid coronavirus. Augusto Santos Silva said he hoped an air bridge between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June. The UK is set to give more details of its plan to force arrivals into quarantine for 14 days later. UK Home Secretary Priti Patel will say air bridges to countries with low virus infection rates are possible in future. This would mean that people arriving from certain places will not have to self-isolate. However, that will only apply to countries with low Covid-19 infection rates, she is expected to tell MPs. She will also say that the planned quarantine for arrivals is necessary ""to prevent a second wave of the virus"". Meanwhile, Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye has told BBC Breakfast that travellers will have to fill out details of where they will be staying to quarantine, when they book their flight. He said there will then be ""spot checks"" within the immigration area, where the Border Force officers will check if people have filled out their form. ""All of the form-filling will take place before you get on a plane, and will be done online. The government will be able to check information before people get onto a plane,"" he said. Some countries have already started to ease travel restrictions.  The German foreign minister Heiko Maas said the country would lift a travel ban for EU countries, as well as the UK and a handful of others - as long as they do not have large-scale lockdowns in place. However, Germany will advise against travel to Britain for as long as the UK government demands a 14-day quarantine for new arrivals. Portugal's Mr Santos Silva told the BBC that an agreement between the UK and Portugal could be in place by the end of June, meaning that holidaymakers returning to the UK from Portugal would escape the quarantine rules. He said any travel quarantine ""was an enemy of tourism"", but that he respected the UK government's decision to enforce one on almost all arrivals to the UK from next Monday. Mr Santos Silva said ""rules"" would ensure that people would be able to holiday safely. The minister suggested that nightlife in Portuguese resorts this summer would be very limited and people would not be allowed to congregate in groups at night. He said hotels and apartments which comply with standards set by the tourism board would be labelled as ""clean and safe"". What are the UK travel quarantine rules? No early return for UK tourists, says Spain UK must agree 'air bridges', warn business groups Portugal's foreign minister confirmed talks on the matter were continuing with the UK. But he insisted that Portugal would not impose any type of quarantine for people arriving in his country. Instead, he said Portugal would rely on temperature checks at airports and that Portugal was, in coordination with other EU countries, considering carrying out ""random testing"" on passengers. Mr Santos Silva said tourists would be warned how full beaches are, so that they could avoid crowded spots. UK aviation bosses hope that a large number of air bridge agreements will be in place by 29 June, when the travel quarantine is set to be reviewed. More tourists from the UK head to the Algarve each summer than from any other country. But Spain, another country whose tourism sector relies heavily on British holidaymakers, is taking a different approach. The Spanish government has saidit will only allow UK tourists in this summer if the infection rate in the UK falls more significantly. The UK travel quarantine will apply to people arriving from any country, apart from the Republic of Ireland, and will also apply to UK nationals. People will be required to self-isolate in a private residence for two weeks. The government says people ""could be contacted regularly during this period to ensure compliance"". People who break the rules could be fined Â£1,000. UK travel companies say the travel quarantine already means people are not booking holidays. They warn that more businesses in the sector now face financial ruin. The measure will be reviewed every three weeks. When deciding whether to keep the quarantine in place, the government will consider several factors. They include: the rate of infection internationally prevention measures in other countries the extent to which other countries with more relaxed border arrangements have seen imported cases the effectiveness of testing methods at minimising the risk of new cases of the virus entering the country. A growing list of Conservative MPs have spoken out against the blanket travel quarantine. However, a YouGov poll of 1,565 adults in Great Britain suggests that there is public support. 63% of those surveyed thought people should be quarantined as per the government's plan. About one quarter thought that the quarantine should only apply to people arriving from countries with a ""high number of coronavirus cases"". Only 4% thought that there should be no quarantine at all. Labour has questioned why a travel quarantine was not introduced some weeks ago. New figures show that between the beginning of January and the end of April, 14,225 flights arrived into UK airports. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?

"UK quarantine plans and Â£1,000 penalties confirmedThe 14-day isolation for arrivals is needed to protect ""hard-won progress"", the home secretary says.","This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: 'We are now more vulnerable to infections being brought in from abroad' Plans to force almost all arrivals to the UK to isolate for 14 days have been confirmed by the home secretary. Priti Patel told the Commons that Border Force will check that travellers fill out a form with their contact details and location for isolation. Leaving isolation prematurely in England could result in a fine of up to Â£1,000 or prosecution, she said. ""We will not allow a reckless minority to put our domestic recovery at risk,"" she said. Ms Patel told MPs that scientific advisers had said quarantine would not have been effective earlier in the coronavirus pandemic when infection rates in the UK were higher. But now, imported cases of the virus posed a more significant threat, she said, so it was now important to ""protect our hard-won progress as we move in the right direction"". It comes as the latest Department of Health figures show another 359 people have died after contracting coronavirus, bringing the UK total to 39,728. An additional 1,871 people tested positive in the last 24-hour period. 'Iâm ready to face quarantine just to get away' UK holidaymakers âwelcomeâ in Portugal No early return for UK tourists, says Spain Asked at the Downing Street briefing whether he would recommend people in the UK book foreign holidays, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the public to follow Foreign Office guidance against non-essential travel. ""We've got to knock this virus on the head,"" he said. And while he urged EU workers who had left the UK because their jobs had disappeared during lockdown to return, he ruled out any alternatives to quarantine for them, such as a medical certificate. ""Come back to London, or the UK - but you've got to quarantine. Everybody has been in lockdown for a long time, I know it's an imposition, but we really have got to beat this virus,"" he said. Ms Patel said in the Commons that the ""proportionate and time-limited measures"" would come into force on Monday, with ""limited exemptions"" intended to ensure supplies of essential items such as food and protective equipment were not disrupted. The regulations apply to England, and Ms Patel said devolved administrations would set out their own rules for enforcing the quarantine. Ms Patel said the measures would be reviewed after three weeks and the government would aim to ensure greater freedom in the long term, including establishing ""international travel corridors"" with countries deemed to be safe. Many MPs - including Conservatives - were in the Commons raising concerns about the government's approach to quarantine. Firstly, they argue this policy is being brought in too late. They believe it should have been introduced when the virus was spreading in Europe - and before it took hold here. Many now have concerns the government is overreacting as it tries to prevent a second spike. They told the home secretary they are worried a blanket quarantine will have a devastating impact on airlines, airports and the wider tourism industry. Very few MPs showed support for the government's approach. They want the government to take a more targeted approach - finding ways of allowing travel from certain countries where transmission levels are lower. Ryanair said the proposals were ""utterly ineffective"", with arrivals travelling from the airport before they isolate, potentially spreading infection, while the government would phone ""less than 1%"" of them to check they were complying. ""This 14-day UK quarantine is ineffective, completely useless, and will have no effect on British passengers who will largely ignore it,"" a spokeswoman said. The Confederation of British Industry said it needed more detail on how the policy would be reviewed, who would be exempt and how the international travel corridors with key trading partners could be created. ""Businesses and government urgently need to draw up an internationally coordinated plan to get people safely moving across borders as soon as possible,"" said CBI president John Allen. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Sources at the French and Italian foreign ministries told the BBC there had been no bilateral talks yet about lifting the quarantine plans and establishing travel corridors or ""air bridges"" with the UK. ""If the UK imposes a quarantine period, we will apply it too,"" a French official said. The plan has sparked concern among several Tory MPs, with former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers calling for it to be suspended while travel corridors are set up, to ""save jobs in aviation and let families go on their summer breaks in the sun"". Speaking at an earlier debate about the aviation industry, former prime minister Theresa May said quarantine would ""close Britain off from the rest of the world"". Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said people needed reassurance that this was not ""a three-week fudge to try to spare the government embarrassment for failing to grip this issue at the right time"". He said only 273 people had been quarantined in the early stages of the pandemic as 18 million visitors arrived in the UK, with the government's own advisers saying many cases came not from China but from places in Europe. Under the new rules, most arrivals to the UK will have to fill out a ""contact locator form"" with details of where they will isolate for two weeks and how they can be contacted. Anyone failing to remain in isolation will face a Â£1,000 fixed penalty in England, with prosecution and an unlimited fine potentially to follow, the Home Office said. Failure to fill in the form can also be punished with a Â£100 fine. Border Force can refuse entry to non-residents who do not comply, and the Home Office also said that deportation would be considered ""as a last resort"" for foreign nationals who fail to isolate.

Schools in Wales to reopen this month,"This video can not be played A personalised experience will prepare pupils for September, said Kirsty Williams All schools in Wales will reopen on 29 June, the Welsh Government have said. They will be open to pupils from all year groups for limited periods during the week, with only a third of pupils in school at any one time, Education Minister Kirsty Williams confirmed. Schools and councils will make their own decisions over managing the return. The summer term has been extended by one week to 27 July, and the autumn half-term holiday will be stretched to two weeks. Parents who choose not to send their children to school will not be fined and pupils who fall into the shielding category will carry on with online learning. Q&A: How will schools in Wales reopen? What is life like now in school? Some children in England started backon Monday while schools inScotlandandNorthern Irelandwill begin to return in August. Some teaching unions have criticised the move in Wales, with the biggest union saying its members will be told they do not have to return to school if they feel the risk is too great. David Evans, from NEU Wales, said the measures were ""too much, too soon"" and there was ""little or no consultation"" over the additional week at the end of July. This video can not be played How will the reopening of Welsh schools work? Another union, the NASUWT, said the government did not have ""good enough reasons for risking lives."" ""The Welsh Government is well aware of the extreme difficulty of social distancing in schools, especially for younger children,"" said National Official Neil Butler. ""The minister has also admitted that this is for a 'check in' and 'catch up' so there is clearly no educational purpose behind this decision."" NAHT Cymru said that while the announced plan was the one its members preferred out of the options put forward by the Welsh Government, the intention to get ""all"" children in ""is more problematic"". It added it would have preferred to have prioritised specific year groups. Ms Williams said she was ""surprised"" by the unions' criticism and it was not helpful ""to have inflammatory language"". ""I would do nothing, and I have done nothing from this entire period when we closed schools for statutory purposes, to do anything to risk anybody's lives,"" she said. This video can not be played Chris Lawrence says there is too much uncertainty to send children back to the classroom Year groups will be split into smaller classes with staggered starts, lessons and breaks. It is expected this will mean, at most, a third of pupils present at any one time, though schools may need time to reach this level. All children will have the opportunity to ""check in, catch up, prepare for summer and September"", Ms Williams said. ""My announcement gives schools three-and-a-half weeks to continue preparing for the next phase,"" she added. Ms Williams said social distancing would be a challenge for the youngest children ""but we have experience of dealing with this in the hubs that have been operating to date"" and good practice had been learnt. She said the Welsh Government was ""moving very cautiously"" by limiting the number of children in classrooms at any one time and also the number that can be at school at the same time. Ms Williams said it was important to ensure ""equity"" by giving all children the chance to ""catch up"" and prepare with their teachers ahead of the summer holidays. She said she had been ""hugely heartened"" by headteachers ""coming forward with very practical plans"" on how they can ""move to the next phase of supporting children and families in their learning"". By doing this before September, she added, ""it gives us a natural firebreak to reflect on those experiences"" before the next term. The Welsh Government had been considering two options - to reopen this month or wait until after the summer holidays - aftersupposedly rejecting plans to bring forward the start of the autumnterm to August. So far, the only Welsh pupils who have seen the inside of a classroom since the coronavirus lockdown have been children deemed to be vulnerable or those of key workers, who have been attending school hubs to enable their parents to continue doing their vital jobs. The Welsh Government will issue further guidance for councils and schools next week. Ms Williams said the start date would mean one full month of thetest, trace and protect systembeing in place - which tracks people who have been exposed to the virus and asks them to self-isolate. Teachers will be a priority group for the new antibody testing programme, which tells people if they have previously had the virus and have developed antibodies. A maximum of a third of pupils will be in school at any one time ""As we continue to keep Wales safe, this approach will be critical,"" she said. ""The evolving science suggests that warm weather and sunlight gives us the best opportunity to ensure more time in school. ""Waiting until September would mean almost half a year without schooling. That would be to the detriment to the wellbeing, learning progress and mental health of our young people. Call for inquiry into Welsh coronavirus response MPs demand evidence for five-mile travel advice New lockdown measures 'may be needed in winter' ""This is and has been a worrying period for us all. I know that many will feel apprehensive. We have not rushed this work and this decision. ""I am also convinced that it is only by returning to their own school that we will see increased attendance from our more vulnerable and disadvantaged children."" Unison, the public services union, said all school staff must be included in antibody testing, not just teachers. ""This approach will not work and will risk the spread of Covid-19,"" schools lead Rosie Lewis said. The government will also issue guidance for further and higher education institutions next week, and for childcare providers to increase the number of children in attendance alongside schools. Further education colleges are preparing to reopen for face-to-face learning from 15 June. UK Government's key evidence on schools Has closing schools had an impact? Coronavirus risks for children Teachers are awaiting the finer detail and logistics of how they are to accommodate the children safely with social distancing in mind. ""I don't think we can ever be reassured it is perfectly safe,"" said Armando Di Finizio, head of Eastern High School in Cardiff. ""It'd be wrong not to have concerns but it is about mitigating any risks as far as we can but I think it is the right time to go back."" The profession think managing a safe return for pupils will be difficult in smaller primary schools where they ""don't have spare space"" so ""can't spread pupils out"". ""If we have different groups coming in, we're going to have to clean those rooms down completely in between each group,"" said a Cardiff primary school teacher, who would only give her first name, Carol. ""The children will also need their own set of stationary - but we suddenly don't have the finances to buy 500 sets of stationary because they would normally share. It's that kind of practical detail we need."" Parents who choose not to send their children back to school will not be fined But the teachers agree that not returning to school until September is ""perhaps too long"". ""We are there to help young people make sense of the world,"" added Mr Di Finizio. He said it would help give children ""reassurance, stability, rhythm of life and discipline"" as well as ""helping vulnerable"" and at risk students. Plaid Cymru criticised the decision, saying it was ""too early"", while the Welsh Conservatives broadly welcomed the move but said there were still questions to be answered, such as whether assistance with school transport, cleaning and school meals would be provided.

"Man charged with murdering wife and daughterNikoleta Zdun, 18, and Aneta Zdun, 40, died at a house in Salisbury on Monday.Wiltshire","Nikoleta Zdun, 18, and Aneta Zdun, 40, died at a home in Wessex Road on Monday A man has appeared in court charged with murdering his wife and daughter. Aneta Zdun, 40, and Nikoleta Zdun, 18, died at a house in Wessex Road, Salisbury, on Monday afternoon. Marcin Zdun, 39, of Wessex Road, is due to appear before Winchester Crown Court on 5 June, following the hearing at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court. Aneta worked for Wessex Care, which described her as a ""warm, kind individual"" and a ""well-loved and well-known"" member of its team. Police were called to the house at 14:45 BST on Monday, by neighbours who described hearing loud screams and helped detain a man near the scene. Officers went to the property and found the body of one of the women. The other woman was found seriously injured and died a short time later at the scene. Floral tributes have been laid at the scene Salisbury-based Wessex Care, which provides community and residential care, said in a statement that it was with ""great sadness and shock that we have lost a member of the Wessex Care family and also her beloved eldest daughter"". ""Those of you who knew Aneta personally and professionally will know what a warm, kind and caring individual she was. ""She cared immensely for many vulnerable people throughout her career as a physiotherapist and healthcare assistant. She will be greatly missed and mourned by all who knew her. ""You'll be forever in our thoughts Aneta and thank you for the care and dedication you provided."" Neighbours said the house was lived in by a supermarket worker and his family. Det Ch Insp Darren Hannant from Wiltshire Police said there was likely to be ""a significant police presence"" in the area.

"France's virus-tracing app 'off to a good start'France's digital minister says 600,000 people installed the app in its first hours of release.TechnologyComments","Digital Minister Cedric O said the app had got off to a ""very good start"" France's digital minister has said its coronavirus contact-tracing app has been downloaded 600,000 times since it became available on Tuesday afternoon. StopCovid France is designed to prevent a second wave of infections by using smartphone logs to warn users if they have been near someone who later tested positive for the virus. But a last-minute launch delay led some citizens to download the wrong product. England has yet to confirm when its own app will roll out nationwide. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had originally said it would be by 1 June, and then later suggested it would be around the middle of next week. But the BBC has learned that it is now unlikely to be before 15 June and could be as late as the start of July. That is in part because of delays in releasing a second version of the software to the Isle of Wight, where it is being trialled. The update will add symptoms including the loss of taste and smell to a self-diagnosis questionnaire next week, or soon after. It will also start giving at-risk users a code to enter into a separate website when they book a medical test. This will allow the result, saying whether they tested positive or negative, to be delivered back to them via the app. Both the UK and France have created apps of their own based on a ""centralised"" design. By contrast, Latvia, Italy and Switzerland have released apps based on a ""decentralised"" technology developed by Apple and Google. Advocates of the centralised approach says it gives epidemiologists more data to analyse, helping them better target the contagion alerts. They are also not limited by rules imposed by the two tech companies, such as a ban on being able to gather location data. Supporters of the decentralised model say it better protects users' anonymity and privacy. StopCovid France's rollout has caused controversy. Hundreds of academics signed a letter in April raising concerns that gathered data could be repurposed for mass surveillance purposes. There was then a row over the government's refusal to give MPs a vote on the matter, which was only resolved after ministers gave the Senate and National Assembly non-binding votes. They both ultimately gave the app the green light. And the country's data privacy watchdog also approved the rollout after carrying out its own review, although it did ask for some changes to the app's wording. This video can not be played WATCH: What is contact tracing and how does it work? But questions remain about how many people will voluntarily install it - the more that do so, the better it should work. Digital Minister Cedric O indicated that he was pleased with the initial uptake. ""As of this morning, 600,000 people managed to download the app, so it's a very very good start,"" he told the TV channel France 2. ""We are very happy with his start, but obviously several million French people need to have it."" He declined to give an exact target.But he had previously said a publicity campaign would initially focus on city-dwellers,external- particularly those using public transport, restaurants and supermarkets at peak times - as they were among those most likely to spread Covid-19. The French government had said the app would be released at midday on Tuesday. But StopCovid France did not appear on Google Play until late on Tuesday afternoon, and then a few hours later on Apple's App Store. One consequence of this was that a Catalan health information app with a similar name - Stop Covid19 CAT - was mistakenly downloaded by many in the interim, causing it to briefly top France's download charts. A Catalan Covid-19 app was mistakenly downloaded by many after a last-minute delay The only explanation given for the delay was that last-minute ""technical adjustments"" had to be made. France set to roll out contact-tracing app before UK First Google/Apple-based contact-tracing app launched Government criticised over use of testing data Contact tracing apps are supposed to complement work done by humans quizzing those diagnosed with the disease. It remains unclear whether the limitations of relying on Bluetooth can be overcome to avoid capturing too many false flags. Baroness Dido Harding, who heads up the government's Test and Trace programme, said little new about the app when she appeared before the House of Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, beyond saying it was a ""high priority"" to link it to medical test results. But Prof Christophe Fraser, who advises the NHS on the project, told MPs there was a ""need for speed"". An app, he explained, could still be used to serve users amber warnings - perhaps advising them not to visit an elderly relative or a friend in a vulnerable group - while their contact awaited a result. ""The app provides the best early warning system by enabling us to record close physical contact with people we know, but also those we don't know or can't remember,"" the Oxford Big Data Institute academic told the BBC. ""Our latest analyses suggest that even at low levels of uptake, the app will have a protective effect across a localised network of contacts - if you, your friends, colleagues and family download the app, you're creating a local alert network within your community."" But it is still not clear whether other parts of the UK will adopt it. Earlier, Northern Ireland's chief scientific advisor told the Stormont Health Committee that he planned to focus on manual contact tracing, saying he thought the app's usefulness had been overstated. ""At best, it is an adjunct,"" Prof Ian Young said. The Health Minister Robin Swann added that he had concerns that the app would be unattractive to users because of concerns about it draining battery life, and that people at the end of a phone were already proving effective.

"France's virus-tracing app 'off to a good start'France's digital minister says 600,000 people installed the app in its first hours of release.","Digital Minister Cedric O said the app had got off to a ""very good start"" France's digital minister has said its coronavirus contact-tracing app has been downloaded 600,000 times since it became available on Tuesday afternoon. StopCovid France is designed to prevent a second wave of infections by using smartphone logs to warn users if they have been near someone who later tested positive for the virus. But a last-minute launch delay led some citizens to download the wrong product. England has yet to confirm when its own app will roll out nationwide. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had originally said it would be by 1 June, and then later suggested it would be around the middle of next week. But the BBC has learned that it is now unlikely to be before 15 June and could be as late as the start of July. That is in part because of delays in releasing a second version of the software to the Isle of Wight, where it is being trialled. The update will add symptoms including the loss of taste and smell to a self-diagnosis questionnaire next week, or soon after. It will also start giving at-risk users a code to enter into a separate website when they book a medical test. This will allow the result, saying whether they tested positive or negative, to be delivered back to them via the app. Both the UK and France have created apps of their own based on a ""centralised"" design. By contrast, Latvia, Italy and Switzerland have released apps based on a ""decentralised"" technology developed by Apple and Google. Advocates of the centralised approach says it gives epidemiologists more data to analyse, helping them better target the contagion alerts. They are also not limited by rules imposed by the two tech companies, such as a ban on being able to gather location data. Supporters of the decentralised model say it better protects users' anonymity and privacy. StopCovid France's rollout has caused controversy. Hundreds of academics signed a letter in April raising concerns that gathered data could be repurposed for mass surveillance purposes. There was then a row over the government's refusal to give MPs a vote on the matter, which was only resolved after ministers gave the Senate and National Assembly non-binding votes. They both ultimately gave the app the green light. And the country's data privacy watchdog also approved the rollout after carrying out its own review, although it did ask for some changes to the app's wording. This video can not be played WATCH: What is contact tracing and how does it work? But questions remain about how many people will voluntarily install it - the more that do so, the better it should work. Digital Minister Cedric O indicated that he was pleased with the initial uptake. ""As of this morning, 600,000 people managed to download the app, so it's a very very good start,"" he told the TV channel France 2. ""We are very happy with his start, but obviously several million French people need to have it."" He declined to give an exact target.But he had previously said a publicity campaign would initially focus on city-dwellers,external- particularly those using public transport, restaurants and supermarkets at peak times - as they were among those most likely to spread Covid-19. The French government had said the app would be released at midday on Tuesday. But StopCovid France did not appear on Google Play until late on Tuesday afternoon, and then a few hours later on Apple's App Store. One consequence of this was that a Catalan health information app with a similar name - Stop Covid19 CAT - was mistakenly downloaded by many in the interim, causing it to briefly top France's download charts. A Catalan Covid-19 app was mistakenly downloaded by many after a last-minute delay The only explanation given for the delay was that last-minute ""technical adjustments"" had to be made. France set to roll out contact-tracing app before UK First Google/Apple-based contact-tracing app launched Government criticised over use of testing data Contact tracing apps are supposed to complement work done by humans quizzing those diagnosed with the disease. It remains unclear whether the limitations of relying on Bluetooth can be overcome to avoid capturing too many false flags. Baroness Dido Harding, who heads up the government's Test and Trace programme, said little new about the app when she appeared before the House of Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, beyond saying it was a ""high priority"" to link it to medical test results. But Prof Christophe Fraser, who advises the NHS on the project, told MPs there was a ""need for speed"". An app, he explained, could still be used to serve users amber warnings - perhaps advising them not to visit an elderly relative or a friend in a vulnerable group - while their contact awaited a result. ""The app provides the best early warning system by enabling us to record close physical contact with people we know, but also those we don't know or can't remember,"" the Oxford Big Data Institute academic told the BBC. ""Our latest analyses suggest that even at low levels of uptake, the app will have a protective effect across a localised network of contacts - if you, your friends, colleagues and family download the app, you're creating a local alert network within your community."" But it is still not clear whether other parts of the UK will adopt it. Earlier, Northern Ireland's chief scientific advisor told the Stormont Health Committee that he planned to focus on manual contact tracing, saying he thought the app's usefulness had been overstated. ""At best, it is an adjunct,"" Prof Ian Young said. The Health Minister Robin Swann added that he had concerns that the app would be unattractive to users because of concerns about it draining battery life, and that people at the end of a phone were already proving effective.

PM : Covid tests back in 24 hours 'by end of June',"The head of the Test and Trace programme has been challenged over the risks of false negative coronavirus results by a committee of MPs. Dido Harding was asked at the health select committee why people are not repeatedly tested to ensure they do not have coronavirus. MPs heard 20% of positive cases may be missed by the test. Earlier Boris Johnson told the Commons tests would be processed within 24 hours by the end of June. Questioned by Mr Hunt, the PM said the 24-hour target would need to take into account ""insuperable problems"" such as postal delays. He said ""I can undertake to him now to get all tests turned around in 24 hours by the end of June, except for difficulties with postal tests or insuperable problems like that."" Coronavirus contact tracer 'paid to watch Netflix' Coronavirus: How does contact tracing work in England? What tests are being done in the UK? The tests involve a nose and throat swab which is then used to look for the virus's genetic material. It detects active coronavirus infection, so cannot say if someone has recovered from Covid-19. Testing positive should allow contacts to be traced, and determine whether NHS staff can go back to work. But the swab tests carried out can deliver false negative results - suggesting someone does not have coronavirus when they are actually positive. That could be because of the quality of the swab, the timing of the test or issues in the lab. During the select committee hearing Mr Hunt citedevidence from the University of Bristol,externalas suggesting 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative, wrongly telling someone they are not infected. Baroness Harding said she understood estimates of the proportion of false negative results ranged between ""two and 20-odd per cent"". She added that the issue of why those with a negative result were not re-tested was ""a medical"" question for the scientists, and it was her job ""to take Sage and chief medical officers' guidance"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The test is reliable and effective. Like any diagnostic test however, there is always the small possibility of a false negative or a false positive result."" The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA), which represents hospital doctors, had earlier called for NHS staff to be tested more than once. Dr Claudia Paoloni, the union's president, said relying on a single negative result risked ""infecting patients and staff"". Prof Nicola Stonehouse, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said people needed to be aware that one test wasn't ""good enough"". It's necessary to have multiple tests, she said, and they needed to be separated by 72 hours. Currently, a negative test clears people to return to work provided they don't have symptoms, and means contact tracing isn't triggered. GP, and diagnostic tests researcher, Dr Jessica Watson toldBBC Radio 4's More or Lessprogramme the ""best guess"" was about 70 in every 100 people who have coronavirus would be picked up by the testing programme. Testing and tracing is clearly going to be crucial in allowing the UK to get back to some level of normality. For it to work successfully, two basic things are needed above all else. People need to trust it and it needs to work effectively. The two are, of course, interlinked. And, unfortunately, on both counts the jury is out. The service - as Baroness Harding points out - is only six days old. It deserves to be given a little time to bed in. But pretty quickly the public will need to be given information about how it is working and whether people are complying with the requests to isolate. This is something officials are reluctant to do at the moment until they have properly validated the numbers - understandable given the UK Statistics Authority has already criticised the way testing numbers have been presented. It also needs people to come forward for testing. Surveys suggest there are around 8,000 new infections a day in the community, but the testing system is picking up less than 2,000 of them - and that includes those diagnosed in care homes and hospitals. If enough people are not coming forward for a test in the first place, tracing contacts and containing future outbreaks is bound to fail. Factors affecting the outcome include at what point in their illness someone is tested, how good a sample is taken, along with any problems with processing tests, she said. Public Health England is expected to publish an evaluation of its tests, used for hospital patients and some staff, this week. Follow Rachelon Twitter,external RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Hundreds join UK protests over George Floyd death,"This video can not be played Protesters chanted ""black lives matter"" Thousands of people have joined a protest in London over the death of African-American George Floyd in US police custody nine days ago. It comes as UK chief constables said they stand alongside all those ""appalled and horrified"" by his death. In a joint statement, they said the right to lawful protest was a ""key part of any democracy"". But they stressed coronavirus restrictions, including not gathering in groups of more than six, remained. Protests began in the US after a video showed Mr Floyd, 46, being arrested on 25 May in Minneapolis and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. This video can not be played John Boyega gives emotional protest speech: ""Black men, it starts with you"" The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with second-degree murder, according to court documents. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that Mr Floyd's death had been ""appalling"" and ""inexcusable"", but was criticised for failing to comment on the killing before now. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the UK government had ""shuttered itself in the hope no-one would notice"". Why the US protests resonate in the UK The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life Buildings lit purple in memory of George Floyd Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called on the PM to convey to US President Donald Trump the UK's ""abhorrence about his response to the events"". Speaking later when asked about it at Wednesday's coronavirus briefing, Mr Johnson said: ""My message to President Trump, to everybody in the United States from the UK is thatâ¦ racism, racist violence has no place in our society."" He said people had the right to protest but ""I would urge people to protest peacefully, and in accordance with the rules on social distancing"". Protesters in Hyde Park chanted ""black lives matter"" and ""we will not be silent"" Thousands of people marched through Westminster in central London Demonstrators gathered in London's Hyde Park for the protest organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter, before marching south through the city. It followed days of protests in US cities including Washington DC, Los Angeles, Houston and Seattle, after the Floyd case reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. Tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets there - not only to express their outrage at the treatment of Mr Floyd - but to condemn police brutality against black Americans more widely. In the UK protesters marched to Victoria Station, where they hung a sign reading ""Justice for Belly Mujinga"" - referring to a railway workerwho died with Covid-19.Initially it was thought this may have been because she was spat at by a man claiming to have coronavirus. However, police concluded that her death was not linked to the attack. The protestors then continued towards Westminster, where they blocked the roads outside Parliament. A number of videos shared on social media showed protesters and police clashing outside Downing Street. Footage showed objects, including signs and a traffic cone, being thrown at police, while one protester was wrestled to the ground and restrained by officers. Some protesters clashed with police outside Downing Street By BBC reporter Chi Chi Izundu There was anger in the crowd, as they sat, as they listened to speeches, as they took the knee. This is yet another generation who have painted placards and taken to the streets to march against racism. As they started to fill Hyde Park, organisers shouted at them to spread out their arms to maintain the two-metre social distancing rule. But so many gathered, it became impossible. Friends and families together, different ages, different races. At the start, organisers told me they were expecting about 1,000 people. But the protesters came out in their thousands. They chanted ""Black Lives Matter"", they shouted ""say his name"". They said the ""UK is not different"" when it comes to racism. They want change. Earlier, Star Wars actor John Boyega made an emotional speech to fellow protesters in which he said the crowds were ""a physical representation of our support"" for Mr Floyd along with two other black Americans who controversially died in the US, andStephen Lawrencewho was killed in a racist attack in London in 1993. He said he was speaking from his heart and did not know whether he would still have a career after speaking out. ""Today is about innocent people who were halfway through their process - we don't know what George Floyd could have achieved, we don't know whatSandra Blandcould have achieved, but today we're going to make sure that won't be an alien thought to our young ones,"" he said. ""I need you to understand how painful it is to be reminded every day that your race means nothing."" Actor John Boyega with family members of railway worker Belly Mujinga The crowds marched from Hyde Park towards Victoria station Protesters in Whitehall took the knee to show solidarity with George Floyd Firefighters in uniform knelt in Windrush Square, Brixton, in south London Police clashes with protestors on Downing St carried on into the evening One activist attending the protest, Brogan Baptiste, told the BBC: ""It's imperative that all of us, whether you're black, white, that you're involved in this because we need change and we need it now."" Filippa, a 20-year-old student who also joined the protest, said: ""I know that I'm healthy. So this felt more important than to stay inside when I have the opportunity."" Protests also took place in other UK cities, includingBelfastand Northampton. In their joint statement, the National Police Chiefs Council said: ""We stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horrified by the way George Floyd lost his life. Justice and accountability should follow."" They said officers in the UK were ""trained to use force proportionately, lawfully and only when absolutely necessary"". However, they added: ""We strive to continuously learn and improve. We will tackle bias, racism or discrimination wherever we find it."" A police officer knelt in support outside Downing Street Thousands of protesters gathered in London's Hyde Park on Wednesday They said UK police ""uphold and facilitate"" the right to lawful protest and ""we know people want to make their voices heard"". But amid the coronavirus pandemic they stressed restrictions on gatherings were still in place and urged people to ""continue to work with officers at this challenging time."" This latest protest follows another on Sunday,which saw thousands gather in Trafalgar Square, in central London. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support.

Contact tracer 'paid to watch Netflix',"This video can not be played ""Becky"" - a contract tracer in England - speaks to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire A contact tracer working on the NHS Test and Trace coronavirus scheme says she has not been asked to speak to anyone since beginning work last week. The clinician told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire she had worked 38 hours but had yet to make a single phone call and spent the time watching Netflix. ""It's frustrating to know that I'm sat idle when there's people that need contacting,"" they said. The government said this does not reflect the amount of work under way. ""Becky"" spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, and said she has watched nearly three series of comedy The Good Place, despite being available to help isolate people. ""I'm yet to make a single phone call or be assigned a case,""  the nurse said. ""I've had no contact from anyone. I've had no contact from supervisors. I've literally been on the system, refreshed the system, and entertained myself during that watching Netflix. ""I've just watched it alongside going back to the system, refreshing it, occasionally having to log back in because it's timed out. I have yet to have contact with anybody regarding contact tracing."" What if NHS coronavirus tracers contact me? What are the self-isolation rules? My new skill as a contact tracer It came as Channel 4 News reported data showing 4,456 confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported to the Test and Trace scheme between 28 May, when it launched, and 31 May. The data - described by the government as ""outdated"" - showed those confirmed cases passed on 4,634 contacts, but Channel 4 reported just 1,749 of these have been contacted by tracers. Latest daily figures showed 1,613 people tested positive for coronavirus up to 09:00 BST on Tuesday. ""Becky"" told Victoria Derbyshire there seemed to be a lack of work for contact tracers Anthony Costello is a professor of global health at University College London who formerly worked at the World Health Organization (WHO). He told Victoria Derbyshire the Test and Trace system was unlikely to be picking up more than 30% of coronavirus cases and may be missing at least two-thirds of contacts. ""That's why your nurse has not had any calls. It is not fit for purpose yet. The worrying thing is can it ever be fit for purpose? Why was it set up like this? You need speed and you need trust,"" he said. He added that the system should instead revolve around local GPs and that the current system risked giving people a false sense of security. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson pledgeda new 24-hour target for test results, except for tests delivered by post. The pledge followed comments by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt who said the quick turnaround of test results was crucial for the Test and Trace scheme to be effective. The NHS Test and Trace scheme in England is intended to map a person's networks and close contacts once they have received a positive coronavirus diagnosis. It is being run in part by the private outsourcing company Serco and is led by the chair of NHS Improvement and former TalkTalk chief executive Baroness Dido Harding. One NHS job advert for a clinical contact tracer stated the role paid up to Â£27.15 per hour and described suitable applicants as nurses, dentists or vets, among others. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Other non-clinical and administrative roles on the scheme are reportedly paid less than Â£10 per hour. Scotland's systemis called NHS Test and Protectwhile in Wales it is""test, trace, protect"". Northern Ireland alsohas its own system. Becky - who said nursing was a vocation - described her experience with Test and Trace as ""frustrating"". ""I think it's appalling, I think it's dishonest,"" she said. ""We're trying to build a very large system that's trying to keep people in England safe and try and prevent a second spike. ""I understand it's complex and I understand there's going to be challenges."" This video can not be played WATCH: What is contact tracing and how does it work? ""It's not ready yet. Hold fire. The released aspects of lockdown - which without track and trace - are not safe to do so,"" Becky added. ""Not having a system up and running is obviously frustrating but it's about people's lives."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The new NHS Test and Trace service is up and running and will help save lives. These claims do not reflect the huge amount of work already under way. ""Anyone in this country can book a test and we have over 25,000 contact tracers in place to undertake this vital work.

Currently, a negative test clears people to return to work provided they don't have symptoms, and means contact tracing isn't triggered. GP, and diagnostic tests researcher, Dr Jessica Watson toldBBC Radio 4's More or Lessprogramme the ""best guess"" was about 70 in every 100 people who have coronavirus would be picked up by the testing programme. Testing and tracing is clearly going to be crucial in allowing the UK to get back to some level of normality. For it to work successfully, two basic things are needed above all else. People need to trust it and it needs to work effectively. The two are, of course, interlinked. And, unfortunately, on both counts the jury is out. The service - as Baroness Harding points out - is only six days old. It deserves to be given a little time to bed in. But pretty quickly the public will need to be given information about how it is working and whether people are complying with the requests to isolate. This is something officials are reluctant to do at the moment until they have properly validated the numbers - understandable given the UK Statistics Authority has already criticised the way testing numbers have been presented. It also needs people to come forward for testing. Surveys suggest there are around 8,000 new infections a day in the community, but the testing system is picking up less than 2,000 of them - and that includes those diagnosed in care homes and hospitals. If enough people are not coming forward for a test in the first place, tracing contacts and containing future outbreaks is bound to fail. Factors affecting the outcome include at what point in their illness someone is tested, how good a sample is taken, along with any problems with processing tests, she said. Public Health England is expected to publish an evaluation of its tests, used for hospital patients and some staff, this week. Follow Rachelon Twitter,external RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Zoom sees sales boom,"Zoom has become the app many are using to stay in touch with friends, family and work colleagues When it comes to its growth rate, video conference company Zoom has lived up to its name. Use of the firm's software jumped 30-fold in April, as the coronavirus pandemic forced millions to work, learn and socialise remotely. At its peak, the firm counted more than 300 million daily participants in virtual meetings, while paying customers have more than tripled. The dramatic uptake has the potential to change the firm's path. Zoom said it expects sales as high as $1.8bn (Â£1.4bn) this year - roughly double what it forecast in March. ""It's a huge opportunity,"" chief executive Eric Yuan told investors on Tuesday. Mr Yuan didn't intend to create Zoom for the masses. Zoom has made Eric Yuan, whose visa application to the US was denied eight times, a billionaire A Chinese-born software engineer, Mr Yuan started the company in 2011, after years rising through the ranks at WebEx, one of the first US video conference companies, which was purchased by Cisco in 2007 for $3.2bn. At the time, he faced doubts from many investors, who did not see the need for another option in a market already dominated by big players such as Microsoft and Cisco. But Mr Yuan - who has credited his interest in video conferencing to the long distances he had to travel to meet up with his now-wife in their youth - was frustrated at Cisco and believed there was demand in the business world for software that would work on mobile phones and be easier to use. Zoom under increased scrutiny as popularity soars Racist zoombombing at virtual synagogue Zoom is in all our living rooms but is it safe? When the firm sold its first shares to the public last year, it was valued at $15.9bn. That shot to more than $58bn on Tuesday. ""What Zoom has done is kind of democratised video conferencing for all kinds of businesses and made it very simple for everyone from yoga instructors through to board room executives to deploy video,"" says Alex Smith, senior director at Canalys. When the lockdowns started, Zoom lifted the limits for the free version of its software in China and for educators in many countries, including the UK, helping to drive its popularity. But the firm's bread and butter customers are corporate clients, who pay for subscriptions and enhanced features. Zoom said on Tuesday that sales jumped 169% year-on-year in the three months to 30 April to $328.2m, as it added more than 180,000 customers with more than 10 employees since January - far more than it had expected. It also turned a profit of $27m in the quarter - more than it made in all of the prior financial year. The massive uptake has also strained the firm, forcing it to invest to expand capacity to meet the needs of new users, many of whom are not paying customers. Its reputation also took a hit, as the new attention prompted hackers to hijack meetings and exposed a host of security flaws, revealing that the firm had sent user data to Facebook, had wrongly claimed the app had end-to-end encryption, and was allowing meeting hosts to track attendees. It has also faced political scrutiny for its ties to China - where it has more than 700 staff, including most of its product development team - which have prompted warnings that it is not fit for government use. In April, Mr Yuan, who is a US citizen, apologised for the security lapses and the firm started rolling out a number of changes intended to fix the problems. Zoom has also announced a number of new appointments familiar with Washington politics, including H R McMaster, a retired Army general and former national security adviser to Donald Trump. ""Navigating this process has been a humbling learning experience,"" Mr Yuan said on an investor call on Tuesday. Analysts said they expected the company would overcome these reputational blows. ""It's had that mishap and the fact that its name is still very much used as verbatim with video technology still gives it a lot of momentum and opportunity to continue,"" Mr Smith said. Analysts say they expect Zoom to maintain its focus on business customers, since that's how it makes money. But the pandemic is likely to create more challenges for Zoom in that market, as increased demand for remote work prompts competitors such as Microsoft and Cisco to pour resources into the field. ""The stakes are higher and the competition's getting tougher, so we'll see,"" says Ryan Koontz, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities. ""They were on a very strong trajectory before... and happened to be in the right place at the right time as the whole world decided we needed to communicate well on video,"" he says. ""They have this amazing brand... now they have to leverage that brand and figure out which markets they're going to go after.""

"UK quarantine plans and Â£1,000 penalties set outThe 14-day isolation for arrivals is needed to protect ""hard-won progress"", the home secretary says.","This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: 'We are now more vulnerable to infections being brought in from abroad' Plans to force almost all arrivals to the UK to isolate for 14 days have been confirmed by the home secretary. Priti Patel told the Commons that Border Force will check that travellers fill out a form with their contact details and location for isolation. Leaving isolation prematurely in England could result in a fine of up to Â£1,000 or prosecution, she said. ""We will not allow a reckless minority to put our domestic recovery at risk,"" she said. Ms Patel told MPs that scientific advisers had said quarantine would not have been effective earlier in the coronavirus pandemic when infection rates in the UK were higher. But now, imported cases of the virus posed a more significant threat, she said, so it was now important to ""protect our hard-won progress as we move in the right direction"". It comes as the latest Department of Health figures show another 359 people have died after contracting coronavirus, bringing the UK total to 39,728. An additional 1,871 people tested positive in the last 24-hour period. 'Iâm ready to face quarantine just to get away' UK holidaymakers âwelcomeâ in Portugal No early return for UK tourists, says Spain Asked at the Downing Street briefing whether he would recommend people in the UK book foreign holidays, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the public to follow Foreign Office guidance against non-essential travel. ""We've got to knock this virus on the head,"" he said. And while he urged EU workers who had left the UK because their jobs had disappeared during lockdown to return, he ruled out any alternatives to quarantine for them, such as a medical certificate. ""Come back to London, or the UK - but you've got to quarantine. Everybody has been in lockdown for a long time, I know it's an imposition, but we really have got to beat this virus,"" he said. Ms Patel said in the Commons that the ""proportionate and time-limited measures"" would come into force on Monday, with ""limited exemptions"" intended to ensure supplies of essential items such as food and protective equipment were not disrupted. The regulations apply to England, and Ms Patel said devolved administrations would set out their own rules for enforcing the quarantine. Ms Patel said the measures would be reviewed after three weeks and the government would aim to ensure greater freedom in the long term, including establishing ""international travel corridors"" with countries deemed to be safe. Many MPs - including Conservatives - were in the Commons raising concerns about the government's approach to quarantine. Firstly, they argue this policy is being brought in too late. They believe it should have been introduced when the virus was spreading in Europe - and before it took hold here. Many now have concerns the government is overreacting as it tries to prevent a second spike. They told the home secretary they are worried a blanket quarantine will have a devastating impact on airlines, airports and the wider tourism industry. Very few MPs showed support for the government's approach. They want the government to take a more targeted approach - finding ways of allowing travel from certain countries where transmission levels are lower. Ryanair said the proposals were ""utterly ineffective"", with arrivals travelling from the airport before they isolate, potentially spreading infection, while the government would phone ""less than 1%"" of them to check they were complying. ""This 14-day UK quarantine is ineffective, completely useless, and will have no effect on British passengers who will largely ignore it,"" a spokeswoman said. The Confederation of British Industry said it needed more detail on how the policy would be reviewed, who would be exempt and how the international travel corridors with key trading partners could be created. ""Businesses and government urgently need to draw up an internationally coordinated plan to get people safely moving across borders as soon as possible,"" said CBI president John Allen. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Sources at the French and Italian foreign ministries told the BBC there had been no bilateral talks yet about lifting the quarantine plans and establishing travel corridors or ""air bridges"" with the UK. ""If the UK imposes a quarantine period, we will apply it too,"" a French official said. The plan has sparked concern among several Tory MPs, with former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers calling for it to be suspended while travel corridors are set up, to ""save jobs in aviation and let families go on their summer breaks in the sun"". Speaking at an earlier debate about the aviation industry, former prime minister Theresa May said quarantine would ""close Britain off from the rest of the world"". Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said people needed reassurance that this was not ""a three-week fudge to try to spare the government embarrassment for failing to grip this issue at the right time"". He said only 273 people had been quarantined in the early stages of the pandemic as 18 million visitors arrived in the UK, with the government's own advisers saying many cases came not from China but from places in Europe. Under the new rules, most arrivals to the UK will have to fill out a ""contact locator form"" with details of where they will isolate for two weeks and how they can be contacted. Anyone failing to remain in isolation will face a Â£1,000 fixed penalty in England, with prosecution and an unlimited fine potentially to follow, the Home Office said. Failure to fill in the form can also be punished with a Â£100 fine. Border Force can refuse entry to non-residents who do not comply, and the Home Office also said that deportation would be considered ""as a last resort"" for foreign nationals who fail to isolate.

Further widespread US protests but violence fallsMany defied curfews but the violence was not on the scale of Monday night.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Aleem Maqbool reports from peaceful protest in Washington's Lafayette Park Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated, mainly peacefully, across the United States for an eighth night following the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody. One of the biggest protests, joined by Floyd's relatives, took place in his hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defied curfews in several cities, imposed after violence and looting in some districts on Monday night. The Pope has issued a call for racism not to be ignored. ""We cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism,"" he said. But he also condemned the violence: ""Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost."" Live: Read the latest on the Floyd protests The Floyd case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. Demonstrators have taken to the streets - not only to express their outrage at the treatment of Mr Floyd - but to condemn police brutality against black Americans more widely. There have been calls, and a proposal from a US lawmaker, to end the qualified immunity of police which prevents civil legal action against them. More generally protesters have called for an end to racism and discrimination. CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African-Americans treated? GEORGE FLOYD:An athlete, friend and father NEWS REPORTERS:A new target for police? DECEPTIVE FOOTAGE:Conspiracy theories spread online HOW IT HAPPENED:The last moments of his life In central Washington DC police fired tear gas after darkness. The military were again on the streets of the capital and helicopters hovered above protesters marching towards the White House. Traffic was blocked in New York's Manhattan district as protesters ignored a night-time curfew, which had been extended for a week. Video footage showed them surrounding a police van. This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting In Houston, where Floyd is due to be buried, Mayor Sylvester Turner, told the crowds people should know that he ""did not die in vain"". Big rallies were also held in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Seattle. Minneapolis, where 46-year-old Floyd died, was reported to be relatively calm. But in Seattle, Portland and Atlanta there were reports of tear gas being fired. Sixteen members of George Floyd's family joined the 60,000 protesters for the Houston rally. They included sister La Tonya and brother Philonese. A nephew told the crowd: ""Don't stop until we get justice for my uncle,"" the Houston Chronicle reports. Brother Philonese Floyd with other members of his family at the Houston rally At an emotional news conference in Minneapolis, Roxie Washington, the mother of George Floyd's six-year-old daughter Gianna, said he was a good man. Standing with Gianna, she said: ""I'm here for my baby and I'm here for George because I want justice for him."" George Floyd's funeral is due to take place on 9 June in Houston. The president on Wednesday again defended his record on race relations while condemning both ""killers, terrorists, arsonists, anarchists, thugs, hoodlums, looters"" and the coverage in much of the media. He posted tweets saying his presidency had done more for black Americans than presidential rival Joe Biden had done ""in 43 years"". 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support. An earlier tweet had cited a number of measures, along with the ""lowest black unemployment, poverty, and crime rates in history"". Unemployment levels did hit a low last year but have soared in the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Biden has said Mr Trump's actions are trying to ""serving the passions of his base"" and has pledged not to ""traffic in fear and division"" or ""fan the flames of hate"". Trump's church visit shocks religious leaders President Trump earlier defended his controversial decision to pose with a Bible outside a historic church in Washington, whose basement was set on fire at the weekend. Mr Trump posed in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse protesters nearby Taking to Twitter, he wrote: ""You got it wrong! If the protesters were so peaceful, why did they light the Church on fire the night before? People liked my walk."" On Monday, police used rubber bullets and smoke grenades ahead of the curfew to clear a peaceful protest near the White House, before Mr Trump stood for the cameras outside St John's Church. Michael Curry, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church diocese in Washington, accused him of using the Church for ""partisan political purposes"". Criticism also came from Washington's Catholic archbishop, who condemned Mr Trump's visit to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine on Tuesday.  It ""manipulated"" the shrine, Archbishop Wilton D Gregory said. Why do some protests turn violent? Monday night saw some of the worst unrest with widespread looting and arson as previously peaceful protests saw a minority resort to violence.  In Las Vegas, a police officer was described on Tuesday as being in a grave condition after being shot. Separately, an armed man was shot dead by police in the same city. Four police were also shot in St Louis, though their injuries were not described as life-threatening. But a retired officer was shot and killed outside a looted store. The protests began after a video showed Mr Floyd being arrested on 25 May in Minneapolis and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Philando Castile death: 'I lost my best friend in a police shooting' The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and will appear in court next week. Three other police officers have been fired. This video can not be played The peaceful protests honouring George Floyd The Floyd case follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. Garner was placed in a police chokehold in New York in 2014 and could be heard crying out ""I can't breathe"" as officers restrained him. His words, which were also shouted by Mr Floyd in his final moments, have become a rallying cry for Black Lives Matter protesters. African-Americans are more likely to get fatally shot by police than other ethnic groups. They are also arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans, although surveys show drug use is at similar levels. Viewpoint: Why racism in US is worse than in Europe The white Southerners who fought US segregation The moment Americans heard MLK had died For many, the outrage over Mr Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination. But the protests also echo those of the Civil Rights movement more than 50 years ago. This action was led by Martin Luther King Jr and sought to challenge white supremacy and the segregationist policies that were commonplace at the time. The ongoing unrest is the most widespread racial turbulence the US has experienced since Dr King, known to most Americans as MLK, was gunned down by a sniper in 1968.

Man charged with murdering wife and daughter,"Nikoleta Zdun, 18, and Aneta Zdun, 40, died at a home in Wessex Road on Monday A man has appeared in court charged with murdering his wife and daughter. Aneta Zdun, 40, and Nikoleta Zdun, 18, died at a house in Wessex Road, Salisbury, on Monday afternoon. Marcin Zdun, 39, of Wessex Road, is due to appear before Winchester Crown Court on 5 June, following the hearing at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court. Aneta worked for Wessex Care, which described her as a ""warm, kind individual"" and a ""well-loved and well-known"" member of its team. Police were called to the house at 14:45 BST on Monday, by neighbours who described hearing loud screams and helped detain a man near the scene. Officers went to the property and found the body of one of the women. The other woman was found seriously injured and died a short time later at the scene. Floral tributes have been laid at the scene Salisbury-based Wessex Care, which provides community and residential care, said in a statement that it was with ""great sadness and shock that we have lost a member of the Wessex Care family and also her beloved eldest daughter"". ""Those of you who knew Aneta personally and professionally will know what a warm, kind and caring individual she was. ""She cared immensely for many vulnerable people throughout her career as a physiotherapist and healthcare assistant. She will be greatly missed and mourned by all who knew her. ""You'll be forever in our thoughts Aneta and thank you for the care and dedication you provided."" Neighbours said the house was lived in by a supermarket worker and his family. Det Ch Insp Darren Hannant from Wiltshire Police said there was likely to be ""a significant police presence"" in the area.

Traffic was blocked in New York's Manhattan district as protesters ignored a night-time curfew, which had been extended for a week. Video footage showed them surrounding a police van. This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting In Houston, where Floyd is due to be buried, Mayor Sylvester Turner, told the crowds people should know that he ""did not die in vain"". Big rallies were also held in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Seattle. Minneapolis, where 46-year-old Floyd died, was reported to be relatively calm. But in Seattle, Portland and Atlanta there were reports of tear gas being fired. Sixteen members of George Floyd's family joined the 60,000 protesters for the Houston rally. They included sister La Tonya and brother Philonese. A nephew told the crowd: ""Don't stop until we get justice for my uncle,"" the Houston Chronicle reports. Brother Philonese Floyd with other members of his family at the Houston rally At an emotional news conference in Minneapolis, Roxie Washington, the mother of George Floyd's six-year-old daughter Gianna, said he was a good man. Standing with Gianna, she said: ""I'm here for my baby and I'm here for George because I want justice for him."" George Floyd's funeral is due to take place on 9 June in Houston. The president on Wednesday again defended his record on race relations while condemning both ""killers, terrorists, arsonists, anarchists, thugs, hoodlums, looters"" and the coverage in much of the media. He posted tweets saying his presidency had done more for black Americans than presidential rival Joe Biden had done ""in 43 years"". 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support. An earlier tweet had cited a number of measures, along with the ""lowest black unemployment, poverty, and crime rates in history"". Unemployment levels did hit a low last year but have soared in the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Biden has said Mr Trump's actions are trying to ""serving the passions of his base"" and has pledged not to ""traffic in fear and division"" or ""fan the flames of hate"". Trump's church visit shocks religious leaders President Trump earlier defended his controversial decision to pose with a Bible outside a historic church in Washington, whose basement was set on fire at the weekend. Mr Trump posed in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse protesters nearby Taking to Twitter, he wrote: ""You got it wrong! If the protesters were so peaceful, why did they light the Church on fire the night before? People liked my walk."" On Monday, police used rubber bullets and smoke grenades ahead of the curfew to clear a peaceful protest near the White House, before Mr Trump stood for the cameras outside St John's Church. Michael Curry, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church diocese in Washington, accused him of using the Church for ""partisan political purposes"". Criticism also came from Washington's Catholic archbishop, who condemned Mr Trump's visit to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine on Tuesday.  It ""manipulated"" the shrine, Archbishop Wilton D Gregory said. Why do some protests turn violent? Monday night saw some of the worst unrest with widespread looting and arson as previously peaceful protests saw a minority resort to violence.  In Las Vegas, a police officer was described on Tuesday as being in a grave condition after being shot. Separately, an armed man was shot dead by police in the same city. Four police were also shot in St Louis, though their injuries were not described as life-threatening. But a retired officer was shot and killed outside a looted store. The protests began after a video showed Mr Floyd being arrested on 25 May in Minneapolis and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Philando Castile death: 'I lost my best friend in a police shooting' The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and will appear in court next week. Three other police officers have been fired. This video can not be played The peaceful protests honouring George Floyd The Floyd case follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. Garner was placed in a police chokehold in New York in 2014 and could be heard crying out ""I can't breathe"" as officers restrained him. His words, which were also shouted by Mr Floyd in his final moments, have become a rallying cry for Black Lives Matter protesters. African-Americans are more likely to get fatally shot by police than other ethnic groups. They are also arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans, although surveys show drug use is at similar levels. Viewpoint: Why racism in US is worse than in Europe The white Southerners who fought US segregation The moment Americans heard MLK had died For many, the outrage over Mr Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination. But the protests also echo those of the Civil Rights movement more than 50 years ago. This action was led by Martin Luther King Jr and sought to challenge white supremacy and the segregationist policies that were commonplace at the time. The ongoing unrest is the most widespread racial turbulence the US has experienced since Dr King, known to most Americans as MLK, was gunned down by a sniper in 1968.

"Hundreds join UK protests over George Floyd deathIt comes as UK police chiefs say they stand alongside all those ""appalled and horrified"" by the death.","This video can not be played Protesters chanted ""black lives matter"" Thousands of people have joined a protest in London over the death of African-American George Floyd in US police custody nine days ago. It comes as UK chief constables said they stand alongside all those ""appalled and horrified"" by his death. In a joint statement, they said the right to lawful protest was a ""key part of any democracy"". But they stressed coronavirus restrictions, including not gathering in groups of more than six, remained. Protests began in the US after a video showed Mr Floyd, 46, being arrested on 25 May in Minneapolis and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. This video can not be played John Boyega gives emotional protest speech: ""Black men, it starts with you"" The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with second-degree murder, according to court documents. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that Mr Floyd's death had been ""appalling"" and ""inexcusable"", but was criticised for failing to comment on the killing before now. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the UK government had ""shuttered itself in the hope no-one would notice"". Why the US protests resonate in the UK The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life Buildings lit purple in memory of George Floyd Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called on the PM to convey to US President Donald Trump the UK's ""abhorrence about his response to the events"". Speaking later when asked about it at Wednesday's coronavirus briefing, Mr Johnson said: ""My message to President Trump, to everybody in the United States from the UK is thatâ¦ racism, racist violence has no place in our society."" He said people had the right to protest but ""I would urge people to protest peacefully, and in accordance with the rules on social distancing"". Protesters in Hyde Park chanted ""black lives matter"" and ""we will not be silent"" Thousands of people marched through Westminster in central London Demonstrators gathered in London's Hyde Park for the protest organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter, before marching south through the city. It followed days of protests in US cities including Washington DC, Los Angeles, Houston and Seattle, after the Floyd case reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. Tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets there - not only to express their outrage at the treatment of Mr Floyd - but to condemn police brutality against black Americans more widely. In the UK protesters marched to Victoria Station, where they hung a sign reading ""Justice for Belly Mujinga"" - referring to a railway workerwho died with Covid-19.Initially it was thought this may have been because she was spat at by a man claiming to have coronavirus. However, police concluded that her death was not linked to the attack. The protestors then continued towards Westminster, where they blocked the roads outside Parliament. A number of videos shared on social media showed protesters and police clashing outside Downing Street. Footage showed objects, including signs and a traffic cone, being thrown at police, while one protester was wrestled to the ground and restrained by officers. Some protesters clashed with police outside Downing Street By BBC reporter Chi Chi Izundu There was anger in the crowd, as they sat, as they listened to speeches, as they took the knee. This is yet another generation who have painted placards and taken to the streets to march against racism. As they started to fill Hyde Park, organisers shouted at them to spread out their arms to maintain the two-metre social distancing rule. But so many gathered, it became impossible. Friends and families together, different ages, different races. At the start, organisers told me they were expecting about 1,000 people. But the protesters came out in their thousands. They chanted ""Black Lives Matter"", they shouted ""say his name"". They said the ""UK is not different"" when it comes to racism. They want change. Earlier, Star Wars actor John Boyega made an emotional speech to fellow protesters in which he said the crowds were ""a physical representation of our support"" for Mr Floyd along with two other black Americans who controversially died in the US, andStephen Lawrencewho was killed in a racist attack in London in 1993. He said he was speaking from his heart and did not know whether he would still have a career after speaking out. ""Today is about innocent people who were halfway through their process - we don't know what George Floyd could have achieved, we don't know whatSandra Blandcould have achieved, but today we're going to make sure that won't be an alien thought to our young ones,"" he said. ""I need you to understand how painful it is to be reminded every day that your race means nothing."" Actor John Boyega with family members of railway worker Belly Mujinga The crowds marched from Hyde Park towards Victoria station Protesters in Whitehall took the knee to show solidarity with George Floyd Firefighters in uniform knelt in Windrush Square, Brixton, in south London Police clashes with protestors on Downing St carried on into the evening One activist attending the protest, Brogan Baptiste, told the BBC: ""It's imperative that all of us, whether you're black, white, that you're involved in this because we need change and we need it now."" Filippa, a 20-year-old student who also joined the protest, said: ""I know that I'm healthy. So this felt more important than to stay inside when I have the opportunity."" Protests also took place in other UK cities, includingBelfastand Northampton. In their joint statement, the National Police Chiefs Council said: ""We stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horrified by the way George Floyd lost his life. Justice and accountability should follow."" They said officers in the UK were ""trained to use force proportionately, lawfully and only when absolutely necessary"". However, they added: ""We strive to continuously learn and improve. We will tackle bias, racism or discrimination wherever we find it."" A police officer knelt in support outside Downing Street Thousands of protesters gathered in London's Hyde Park on Wednesday They said UK police ""uphold and facilitate"" the right to lawful protest and ""we know people want to make their voices heard"". But amid the coronavirus pandemic they stressed restrictions on gatherings were still in place and urged people to ""continue to work with officers at this challenging time."" This latest protest follows another on Sunday,which saw thousands gather in Trafalgar Square, in central London. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

France's virus-tracing app 'off to a good start',"Digital Minister Cedric O said the app had got off to a ""very good start"" France's digital minister has said its coronavirus contact-tracing app has been downloaded 600,000 times since it became available on Tuesday afternoon. StopCovid France is designed to prevent a second wave of infections by using smartphone logs to warn users if they have been near someone who later tested positive for the virus. But a last-minute launch delay led some citizens to download the wrong product. England has yet to confirm when its own app will roll out nationwide. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had originally said it would be by 1 June, and then later suggested it would be around the middle of next week. But the BBC has learned that it is now unlikely to be before 15 June and could be as late as the start of July. That is in part because of delays in releasing a second version of the software to the Isle of Wight, where it is being trialled. The update will add symptoms including the loss of taste and smell to a self-diagnosis questionnaire next week, or soon after. It will also start giving at-risk users a code to enter into a separate website when they book a medical test. This will allow the result, saying whether they tested positive or negative, to be delivered back to them via the app. Both the UK and France have created apps of their own based on a ""centralised"" design. By contrast, Latvia, Italy and Switzerland have released apps based on a ""decentralised"" technology developed by Apple and Google. Advocates of the centralised approach says it gives epidemiologists more data to analyse, helping them better target the contagion alerts. They are also not limited by rules imposed by the two tech companies, such as a ban on being able to gather location data. Supporters of the decentralised model say it better protects users' anonymity and privacy. StopCovid France's rollout has caused controversy. Hundreds of academics signed a letter in April raising concerns that gathered data could be repurposed for mass surveillance purposes. There was then a row over the government's refusal to give MPs a vote on the matter, which was only resolved after ministers gave the Senate and National Assembly non-binding votes. They both ultimately gave the app the green light. And the country's data privacy watchdog also approved the rollout after carrying out its own review, although it did ask for some changes to the app's wording. This video can not be played WATCH: What is contact tracing and how does it work? But questions remain about how many people will voluntarily install it - the more that do so, the better it should work. Digital Minister Cedric O indicated that he was pleased with the initial uptake. ""As of this morning, 600,000 people managed to download the app, so it's a very very good start,"" he told the TV channel France 2. ""We are very happy with his start, but obviously several million French people need to have it."" He declined to give an exact target.But he had previously said a publicity campaign would initially focus on city-dwellers,external- particularly those using public transport, restaurants and supermarkets at peak times - as they were among those most likely to spread Covid-19. The French government had said the app would be released at midday on Tuesday. But StopCovid France did not appear on Google Play until late on Tuesday afternoon, and then a few hours later on Apple's App Store. One consequence of this was that a Catalan health information app with a similar name - Stop Covid19 CAT - was mistakenly downloaded by many in the interim, causing it to briefly top France's download charts. A Catalan Covid-19 app was mistakenly downloaded by many after a last-minute delay The only explanation given for the delay was that last-minute ""technical adjustments"" had to be made. France set to roll out contact-tracing app before UK First Google/Apple-based contact-tracing app launched Government criticised over use of testing data Contact tracing apps are supposed to complement work done by humans quizzing those diagnosed with the disease. It remains unclear whether the limitations of relying on Bluetooth can be overcome to avoid capturing too many false flags. Baroness Dido Harding, who heads up the government's Test and Trace programme, said little new about the app when she appeared before the House of Commons' Health and Social Care Committee, beyond saying it was a ""high priority"" to link it to medical test results. But Prof Christophe Fraser, who advises the NHS on the project, told MPs there was a ""need for speed"". An app, he explained, could still be used to serve users amber warnings - perhaps advising them not to visit an elderly relative or a friend in a vulnerable group - while their contact awaited a result. ""The app provides the best early warning system by enabling us to record close physical contact with people we know, but also those we don't know or can't remember,"" the Oxford Big Data Institute academic told the BBC. ""Our latest analyses suggest that even at low levels of uptake, the app will have a protective effect across a localised network of contacts - if you, your friends, colleagues and family download the app, you're creating a local alert network within your community."" But it is still not clear whether other parts of the UK will adopt it. Earlier, Northern Ireland's chief scientific advisor told the Stormont Health Committee that he planned to focus on manual contact tracing, saying he thought the app's usefulness had been overstated. ""At best, it is an adjunct,"" Prof Ian Young said. The Health Minister Robin Swann added that he had concerns that the app would be unattractive to users because of concerns about it draining battery life, and that people at the end of a phone were already proving effective.

"UK quarantine plans and Â£1,000 penalties set outThe 14-day isolation for arrivals is needed to protect ""hard-won progress"", the home secretary says.UK","This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel: 'We are now more vulnerable to infections being brought in from abroad' Plans to force almost all arrivals to the UK to isolate for 14 days have been confirmed by the home secretary. Priti Patel told the Commons that Border Force will check that travellers fill out a form with their contact details and location for isolation. Leaving isolation prematurely in England could result in a fine of up to Â£1,000 or prosecution, she said. ""We will not allow a reckless minority to put our domestic recovery at risk,"" she said. Ms Patel told MPs that scientific advisers had said quarantine would not have been effective earlier in the coronavirus pandemic when infection rates in the UK were higher. But now, imported cases of the virus posed a more significant threat, she said, so it was now important to ""protect our hard-won progress as we move in the right direction"". It comes as the latest Department of Health figures show another 359 people have died after contracting coronavirus, bringing the UK total to 39,728. An additional 1,871 people tested positive in the last 24-hour period. 'Iâm ready to face quarantine just to get away' UK holidaymakers âwelcomeâ in Portugal No early return for UK tourists, says Spain Asked at the Downing Street briefing whether he would recommend people in the UK book foreign holidays, Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the public to follow Foreign Office guidance against non-essential travel. ""We've got to knock this virus on the head,"" he said. And while he urged EU workers who had left the UK because their jobs had disappeared during lockdown to return, he ruled out any alternatives to quarantine for them, such as a medical certificate. ""Come back to London, or the UK - but you've got to quarantine. Everybody has been in lockdown for a long time, I know it's an imposition, but we really have got to beat this virus,"" he said. Ms Patel said in the Commons that the ""proportionate and time-limited measures"" would come into force on Monday, with ""limited exemptions"" intended to ensure supplies of essential items such as food and protective equipment were not disrupted. The regulations apply to England, and Ms Patel said devolved administrations would set out their own rules for enforcing the quarantine. Ms Patel said the measures would be reviewed after three weeks and the government would aim to ensure greater freedom in the long term, including establishing ""international travel corridors"" with countries deemed to be safe. Many MPs - including Conservatives - were in the Commons raising concerns about the government's approach to quarantine. Firstly, they argue this policy is being brought in too late. They believe it should have been introduced when the virus was spreading in Europe - and before it took hold here. Many now have concerns the government is overreacting as it tries to prevent a second spike. They told the home secretary they are worried a blanket quarantine will have a devastating impact on airlines, airports and the wider tourism industry. Very few MPs showed support for the government's approach. They want the government to take a more targeted approach - finding ways of allowing travel from certain countries where transmission levels are lower. Ryanair said the proposals were ""utterly ineffective"", with arrivals travelling from the airport before they isolate, potentially spreading infection, while the government would phone ""less than 1%"" of them to check they were complying. ""This 14-day UK quarantine is ineffective, completely useless, and will have no effect on British passengers who will largely ignore it,"" a spokeswoman said. The Confederation of British Industry said it needed more detail on how the policy would be reviewed, who would be exempt and how the international travel corridors with key trading partners could be created. ""Businesses and government urgently need to draw up an internationally coordinated plan to get people safely moving across borders as soon as possible,"" said CBI president John Allen. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Sources at the French and Italian foreign ministries told the BBC there had been no bilateral talks yet about lifting the quarantine plans and establishing travel corridors or ""air bridges"" with the UK. ""If the UK imposes a quarantine period, we will apply it too,"" a French official said. The plan has sparked concern among several Tory MPs, with former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers calling for it to be suspended while travel corridors are set up, to ""save jobs in aviation and let families go on their summer breaks in the sun"". Speaking at an earlier debate about the aviation industry, former prime minister Theresa May said quarantine would ""close Britain off from the rest of the world"". Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said people needed reassurance that this was not ""a three-week fudge to try to spare the government embarrassment for failing to grip this issue at the right time"". He said only 273 people had been quarantined in the early stages of the pandemic as 18 million visitors arrived in the UK, with the government's own advisers saying many cases came not from China but from places in Europe. Under the new rules, most arrivals to the UK will have to fill out a ""contact locator form"" with details of where they will isolate for two weeks and how they can be contacted. Anyone failing to remain in isolation will face a Â£1,000 fixed penalty in England, with prosecution and an unlimited fine potentially to follow, the Home Office said. Failure to fill in the form can also be punished with a Â£100 fine. Border Force can refuse entry to non-residents who do not comply, and the Home Office also said that deportation would be considered ""as a last resort"" for foreign nationals who fail to isolate.

UK police chiefs 'appalled' by George Floyd deathIt comes as hundreds gather in London to protest against his death in custody and racial injustice.UK,"This video can not be played Protesters chanted ""black lives matter"" Thousands of people have joined a protest in London over the death of African-American George Floyd in US police custody nine days ago. It comes as UK chief constables said they stand alongside all those ""appalled and horrified"" by his death. In a joint statement, they said the right to lawful protest was a ""key part of any democracy"". But they stressed coronavirus restrictions, including not gathering in groups of more than six, remained. Protests began in the US after a video showed Mr Floyd, 46, being arrested on 25 May in Minneapolis and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. This video can not be played John Boyega gives emotional protest speech: ""Black men, it starts with you"" The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with second-degree murder, according to court documents. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday that Mr Floyd's death had been ""appalling"" and ""inexcusable"", but was criticised for failing to comment on the killing before now. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the UK government had ""shuttered itself in the hope no-one would notice"". Why the US protests resonate in the UK The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life Buildings lit purple in memory of George Floyd Meanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called on the PM to convey to US President Donald Trump the UK's ""abhorrence about his response to the events"". Speaking later when asked about it at Wednesday's coronavirus briefing, Mr Johnson said: ""My message to President Trump, to everybody in the United States from the UK is thatâ¦ racism, racist violence has no place in our society."" He said people had the right to protest but ""I would urge people to protest peacefully, and in accordance with the rules on social distancing"". Protesters in Hyde Park chanted ""black lives matter"" and ""we will not be silent"" Thousands of people marched through Westminster in central London Demonstrators gathered in London's Hyde Park for the protest organised by campaign group Black Lives Matter, before marching south through the city. It followed days of protests in US cities including Washington DC, Los Angeles, Houston and Seattle, after the Floyd case reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. Tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets there - not only to express their outrage at the treatment of Mr Floyd - but to condemn police brutality against black Americans more widely. In the UK protesters marched to Victoria Station, where they hung a sign reading ""Justice for Belly Mujinga"" - referring to a railway workerwho died with Covid-19.Initially it was thought this may have been because she was spat at by a man claiming to have coronavirus. However, police concluded that her death was not linked to the attack. The protestors then continued towards Westminster, where they blocked the roads outside Parliament. A number of videos shared on social media showed protesters and police clashing outside Downing Street. Footage showed objects, including signs and a traffic cone, being thrown at police, while one protester was wrestled to the ground and restrained by officers. Some protesters clashed with police outside Downing Street By BBC reporter Chi Chi Izundu There was anger in the crowd, as they sat, as they listened to speeches, as they took the knee. This is yet another generation who have painted placards and taken to the streets to march against racism. As they started to fill Hyde Park, organisers shouted at them to spread out their arms to maintain the two-metre social distancing rule. But so many gathered, it became impossible. Friends and families together, different ages, different races. At the start, organisers told me they were expecting about 1,000 people. But the protesters came out in their thousands. They chanted ""Black Lives Matter"", they shouted ""say his name"". They said the ""UK is not different"" when it comes to racism. They want change. Earlier, Star Wars actor John Boyega made an emotional speech to fellow protesters in which he said the crowds were ""a physical representation of our support"" for Mr Floyd along with two other black Americans who controversially died in the US, andStephen Lawrencewho was killed in a racist attack in London in 1993. He said he was speaking from his heart and did not know whether he would still have a career after speaking out. ""Today is about innocent people who were halfway through their process - we don't know what George Floyd could have achieved, we don't know whatSandra Blandcould have achieved, but today we're going to make sure that won't be an alien thought to our young ones,"" he said. ""I need you to understand how painful it is to be reminded every day that your race means nothing."" Actor John Boyega with family members of railway worker Belly Mujinga The crowds marched from Hyde Park towards Victoria station Protesters in Whitehall took the knee to show solidarity with George Floyd Firefighters in uniform knelt in Windrush Square, Brixton, in south London Police clashes with protestors on Downing St carried on into the evening One activist attending the protest, Brogan Baptiste, told the BBC: ""It's imperative that all of us, whether you're black, white, that you're involved in this because we need change and we need it now."" Filippa, a 20-year-old student who also joined the protest, said: ""I know that I'm healthy. So this felt more important than to stay inside when I have the opportunity."" Protests also took place in other UK cities, includingBelfastand Northampton. In their joint statement, the National Police Chiefs Council said: ""We stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and horrified by the way George Floyd lost his life. Justice and accountability should follow."" They said officers in the UK were ""trained to use force proportionately, lawfully and only when absolutely necessary"". However, they added: ""We strive to continuously learn and improve. We will tackle bias, racism or discrimination wherever we find it."" A police officer knelt in support outside Downing Street Thousands of protesters gathered in London's Hyde Park on Wednesday They said UK police ""uphold and facilitate"" the right to lawful protest and ""we know people want to make their voices heard"". But amid the coronavirus pandemic they stressed restrictions on gatherings were still in place and urged people to ""continue to work with officers at this challenging time."" This latest protest follows another on Sunday,which saw thousands gather in Trafalgar Square, in central London. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support.

PM pledges coronavirus test results in 24 hoursBut Boris Johnson told MPs difficulties turning around postal tests would have to be considered.HealthComments,"The head of the Test and Trace programme has been challenged over the risks of false negative coronavirus results by a committee of MPs. Dido Harding was asked at the health select committee why people are not repeatedly tested to ensure they do not have coronavirus. MPs heard 20% of positive cases may be missed by the test. Earlier Boris Johnson told the Commons tests would be processed within 24 hours by the end of June. Questioned by Mr Hunt, the PM said the 24-hour target would need to take into account ""insuperable problems"" such as postal delays. He said ""I can undertake to him now to get all tests turned around in 24 hours by the end of June, except for difficulties with postal tests or insuperable problems like that."" Coronavirus contact tracer 'paid to watch Netflix' Coronavirus: How does contact tracing work in England? What tests are being done in the UK? The tests involve a nose and throat swab which is then used to look for the virus's genetic material. It detects active coronavirus infection, so cannot say if someone has recovered from Covid-19. Testing positive should allow contacts to be traced, and determine whether NHS staff can go back to work. But the swab tests carried out can deliver false negative results - suggesting someone does not have coronavirus when they are actually positive. That could be because of the quality of the swab, the timing of the test or issues in the lab. During the select committee hearing Mr Hunt citedevidence from the University of Bristol,externalas suggesting 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative, wrongly telling someone they are not infected. Baroness Harding said she understood estimates of the proportion of false negative results ranged between ""two and 20-odd per cent"". She added that the issue of why those with a negative result were not re-tested was ""a medical"" question for the scientists, and it was her job ""to take Sage and chief medical officers' guidance"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The test is reliable and effective. Like any diagnostic test however, there is always the small possibility of a false negative or a false positive result."" The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA), which represents hospital doctors, had earlier called for NHS staff to be tested more than once. Dr Claudia Paoloni, the union's president, said relying on a single negative result risked ""infecting patients and staff"". Prof Nicola Stonehouse, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said people needed to be aware that one test wasn't ""good enough"". It's necessary to have multiple tests, she said, and they needed to be separated by 72 hours. Currently, a negative test clears people to return to work provided they don't have symptoms, and means contact tracing isn't triggered. GP, and diagnostic tests researcher, Dr Jessica Watson toldBBC Radio 4's More or Lessprogramme the ""best guess"" was about 70 in every 100 people who have coronavirus would be picked up by the testing programme. Testing and tracing is clearly going to be crucial in allowing the UK to get back to some level of normality. For it to work successfully, two basic things are needed above all else. People need to trust it and it needs to work effectively. The two are, of course, interlinked. And, unfortunately, on both counts the jury is out. The service - as Baroness Harding points out - is only six days old. It deserves to be given a little time to bed in. But pretty quickly the public will need to be given information about how it is working and whether people are complying with the requests to isolate. This is something officials are reluctant to do at the moment until they have properly validated the numbers - understandable given the UK Statistics Authority has already criticised the way testing numbers have been presented. It also needs people to come forward for testing. Surveys suggest there are around 8,000 new infections a day in the community, but the testing system is picking up less than 2,000 of them - and that includes those diagnosed in care homes and hospitals. If enough people are not coming forward for a test in the first place, tracing contacts and containing future outbreaks is bound to fail. Factors affecting the outcome include at what point in their illness someone is tested, how good a sample is taken, along with any problems with processing tests, she said. Public Health England is expected to publish an evaluation of its tests, used for hospital patients and some staff, this week. Follow Rachelon Twitter,external RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Further widespread US protests but violence fallsMany defied curfews but the violence was not on the scale of Monday night.,"This video can not be played Aleem Maqbool reports from peaceful protest in Washington's Lafayette Park Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated, mainly peacefully, across the United States for an eighth night following the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody. One of the biggest protests, joined by Floyd's relatives, took place in his hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defied curfews in several cities, imposed after violence and looting in some districts on Monday night. The Pope has issued a call for racism not to be ignored. ""We cannot tolerate or turn a blind eye to racism,"" he said. But he also condemned the violence: ""Nothing is gained by violence and so much is lost."" Live: Read the latest on the Floyd protests The Floyd case has reignited deep-seated anger over police killings of black Americans and racism. Demonstrators have taken to the streets - not only to express their outrage at the treatment of Mr Floyd - but to condemn police brutality against black Americans more widely. There have been calls, and a proposal from a US lawmaker, to end the qualified immunity of police which prevents civil legal action against them. More generally protesters have called for an end to racism and discrimination. CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African-Americans treated? GEORGE FLOYD:An athlete, friend and father NEWS REPORTERS:A new target for police? DECEPTIVE FOOTAGE:Conspiracy theories spread online HOW IT HAPPENED:The last moments of his life In central Washington DC police fired tear gas after darkness. The military were again on the streets of the capital and helicopters hovered above protesters marching towards the White House. Traffic was blocked in New York's Manhattan district as protesters ignored a night-time curfew, which had been extended for a week. Video footage showed them surrounding a police van. This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting In Houston, where Floyd is due to be buried, Mayor Sylvester Turner, told the crowds people should know that he ""did not die in vain"". Big rallies were also held in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Atlanta and Seattle. Minneapolis, where 46-year-old Floyd died, was reported to be relatively calm. But in Seattle, Portland and Atlanta there were reports of tear gas being fired. Sixteen members of George Floyd's family joined the 60,000 protesters for the Houston rally. They included sister La Tonya and brother Philonese. A nephew told the crowd: ""Don't stop until we get justice for my uncle,"" the Houston Chronicle reports. Brother Philonese Floyd with other members of his family at the Houston rally At an emotional news conference in Minneapolis, Roxie Washington, the mother of George Floyd's six-year-old daughter Gianna, said he was a good man. Standing with Gianna, she said: ""I'm here for my baby and I'm here for George because I want justice for him."" George Floyd's funeral is due to take place on 9 June in Houston. The president on Wednesday again defended his record on race relations while condemning both ""killers, terrorists, arsonists, anarchists, thugs, hoodlums, looters"" and the coverage in much of the media. He posted tweets saying his presidency had done more for black Americans than presidential rival Joe Biden had done ""in 43 years"". 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support. An earlier tweet had cited a number of measures, along with the ""lowest black unemployment, poverty, and crime rates in history"". Unemployment levels did hit a low last year but have soared in the coronavirus outbreak. Mr Biden has said Mr Trump's actions are trying to ""serving the passions of his base"" and has pledged not to ""traffic in fear and division"" or ""fan the flames of hate"". Trump's church visit shocks religious leaders President Trump earlier defended his controversial decision to pose with a Bible outside a historic church in Washington, whose basement was set on fire at the weekend. Mr Trump posed in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse protesters nearby Taking to Twitter, he wrote: ""You got it wrong! If the protesters were so peaceful, why did they light the Church on fire the night before? People liked my walk."" On Monday, police used rubber bullets and smoke grenades ahead of the curfew to clear a peaceful protest near the White House, before Mr Trump stood for the cameras outside St John's Church. Michael Curry, the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church diocese in Washington, accused him of using the Church for ""partisan political purposes"". Criticism also came from Washington's Catholic archbishop, who condemned Mr Trump's visit to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine on Tuesday.  It ""manipulated"" the shrine, Archbishop Wilton D Gregory said. Why do some protests turn violent? Monday night saw some of the worst unrest with widespread looting and arson as previously peaceful protests saw a minority resort to violence.  In Las Vegas, a police officer was described on Tuesday as being in a grave condition after being shot. Separately, an armed man was shot dead by police in the same city. Four police were also shot in St Louis, though their injuries were not described as life-threatening. But a retired officer was shot and killed outside a looted store. The protests began after a video showed Mr Floyd being arrested on 25 May in Minneapolis and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Philando Castile death: 'I lost my best friend in a police shooting' The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder and will appear in court next week. Three other police officers have been fired. This video can not be played The peaceful protests honouring George Floyd The Floyd case follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. Garner was placed in a police chokehold in New York in 2014 and could be heard crying out ""I can't breathe"" as officers restrained him. His words, which were also shouted by Mr Floyd in his final moments, have become a rallying cry for Black Lives Matter protesters. African-Americans are more likely to get fatally shot by police than other ethnic groups. They are also arrested for drug abuse at a much higher rate than white Americans, although surveys show drug use is at similar levels. Viewpoint: Why racism in US is worse than in Europe The white Southerners who fought US segregation The moment Americans heard MLK had died For many, the outrage over Mr Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination. But the protests also echo those of the Civil Rights movement more than 50 years ago. This action was led by Martin Luther King Jr and sought to challenge white supremacy and the segregationist policies that were commonplace at the time. The ongoing unrest is the most widespread racial turbulence the US has experienced since Dr King, known to most Americans as MLK, was gunned down by a sniper in 1968.

Pope plea on racism amid US protests,"Minnesota's attorney general told reporters securing a conviction ""will not be an easy thing"" Keith Ellison warned the investigation ""could take months"" to complete Former Democratic President Barack Obama told protesters ""your lives matter"" US defence secretary opposed sending troops to quell unrest over the death of George Floyd President Donald Trump said the army will ""quickly solve the problem"" Protests over Floyd's death in Minneapolis have been recorded in 140 US cities George Floyd died as a policeman knelt on his neck for eight minutes The mother of Floyd's young daughter pleads for justice Edited by Jude Sheerin That's it from us for now. We'll be monitoring protests as curfew hour draws nigh across the US. Here's the main points from today:  Today's live page was brought to you by Matthew Davis, Victoria Bisset, George Wright, Max Matza, Sean Fanning, Helier Cheung, Vicky Baker, Joshua Cheetham, Ritu Prasad and Boer Deng. ""Silence can be as deadly as violence,"" former Democratic President Jimmy Carter has warned in a statement on the George Floyd protests. The comments from Carter, the oldest living US president, follow those made by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama. Carter continued: ""People of power, privilege, and moral conscience must stand up and say 'no more' to a racially discriminatory police and justice system, immoral economic disparities between whites and blacks, and government actions that undermine our unified democracy."" ""Dehumanising people debases us all; humanity is beautifully and almost infinitely diverse,"" he adds. ""The bonds of our common humanity must overcome the divisiveness of our fears and prejudices."" ""We are responsible for creating a world of peace and equality for ourselves and future generations,"" he continued. ""We need a government as good as its people, and we are better than this."" For another day, protesters are out on the streets near the White House. In 90F (32C) heat, they lay down in the streets and chanted: ""I can't breathe."" The Washington DC mayor has pushed back the curfew time tonight to 23:00 local time, from 19:00 the past two nights. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The White House press secretary has likened President Donald Trump's ""resilience and determination"" during the #GeorgeFloyd protests to Winston Churchill inspecting bomb damage during World War Two. This video can not be played White House likens Trump to Churchill in WW2 Three alleged far-right activists in Las Vegas have been charged with trying to exploit peaceful protests and incite violence, according to prosecutors. According to the local prosecutor's office, the three men are alleged members of the âBoogalooâ movement, which prosecutors describe as ""a term used by extremists to signify a coming civil war and/or collapse of society"". âViolent instigators have hijacked peaceful protests and demonstrations across the country, including Nevada, exploiting the real and legitimate outrage over Mr Floydâs death for their own radical agendas,â US Attorney Nicholas Trutanich saidin a statement,external. âLaw enforcement is focused on keeping violence and destruction from interfering with free public expression and threatening lives.â The three men were apprehended late last month after attempting to use a molotov cocktail, officials say. As though in a direct rebuttal to Mattis, President Trump has released a video addressing the nationwide protests, with a final shot of the word âUniteâ superimposed over the stars of the US flag. The advert features the presidentâs voice over a contemplative piano soundtrack and footage of the demonstrations. Trump says he understands the pain people are feeling over the âgrave tragedyâ of George Floydâs death. He then argues Floydâs memory is being dishonoured by violence that he claims without evidence is being instigated by antifa, a loose affiliation of mainly far-left protesters. âNo one is more upset than fellow law enforcement officers,"" he says, ""by the small handful who fail to abide by their oath to serve and protect.â Images of police standing in solidarity with demonstrators play. âHealing not hatred, justice not chaos, are the mission at hand,â Trump adds. âWe are working towards a more just society, but that means building up, not tearing down, joining hands, not hurling fists.â Allow Twitter content?

A former winner of Miss Universe Malaysia is facing calls for her title to be stripped after comments she made about protests in the US. Samantha Katie James, who won the pageant in 2017, wrote a series of Instagram posts on Monday criticising the demonstrations and telling black people to ""relax"". ""You chose to be born as a 'coloured' person in America for a reason. To learn a certain lesson,"" she wrote. ""Accept it as it is."" The Brazilian-Chinese model added that ""it seems like the 'whites' won. Because if you're angry, you respond in rage and anguish. That means it has power over you. THEY HAVE POWER OVER YOU."" Her comments have drawn ire on social media, and more 120,000 people have signedan online petition calling for her title to be removed,external. The Miss Universe Malaysia Organisation has distanced itself from the remarks, calling them ""inappropriate, offensive, unacceptable and hurtful."" The beauty queen has since issued an apology on her Instagram, and said she has ""first hand experience"" of racism herself. ""I was insulted all my life for being white girl in local Malaysian school,"" she added. Former Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis, who resigned in 2018 in opposition to Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, has denounced the president's actions and blamed him for the current state of division in America. In an extraordinary critique,external, printed by the Atlantic magazine, Mattis writes that ""Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try. ""Instead, he tries to divide us."" Mattis continues: ""When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizensâmuch less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside."" The general urges the public to unite through ""the strengths inherent in our civil society"". ""This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.â Anatoly Antonov Russia's ambassador to the US has denied accusations that his country is helping to stir up unrest. On Sunday, White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien told ABC News that Russia could be using social media campaigns to stoke anger and confusion. Speaking with CNN, former national security advisor Susan Rice also said she ""would not be surprised"" if ""foreign actors"" like Russia were helping to encourage violence. But in a sharp rebuttal, Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov told state news channel Rossiya-1 that the claims were ""utterly wrong. ""It goes without saying that what is happening in the United States is fresh evidence of human rights violations and double standards,"" said Mr Antonov, according to state-run TASS news agency. ""I will say unequivocally that nobody is rejoicing. Everybody is watching with great regret what is happening,"" he added. ""We are very much worried over the situation in the host country. We wish to see its recovery."" A protester faces off with military police near the White House on Wednesday US Defence Secretary Mark Esper has abruptly reversed a plan for soldiers of the Army's 82nd Airborne division to leave Washington DC on Wednesday. The volte-face comes hours after Esper said he disagreed with Trump's threat to send active-duty soldiers into American states and cities. Active-duty troops should be deployed âonly in the most urgent and dire of situations,â he said earlier. âWe are not in one of those situations now.â Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told AP News that 200 of the 1,600 soldiers in the Washington DC region had been due to depart earlier on Wednesday. But, he said, Esper intervened to order them to remain. The White House today had refused to express confidence in Esper, with the president's spokeswoman telling reporters: ""As of right now Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper, and should the president lose faith we will all learn about that in the future."" Troops staged on the National Mall in Washington DC Virginia governor Ralph Northam will announce tomorrow that a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee will be removed from the state capital, Associated Press reports. A senior official told the news agency that the controversial statue will be removed from Richmond's Monument Avenue and put into storage until a new location is agreed upon. The monument has been vandalised during recent protests, and is the largest of five Confederate statues along the avenue. The expected announcement comes after authorities in Alexandria removed the so-called Appomattox statue honouring Confederate soldiers from the Virginian city. Memorials to the Confederacy, which fought for the legal right to keep black people as slaves, have long stirred controversy in the US. They have been criticised by black advocates as everyday symbols of white supremacy, but opponents of their removal say it is tantamount to erasing history. The Robert E Lee statue in Richmond - once the seat of the Confederate South - is one of the most well-known public landmarks in the Virginian capital. In his first on-camera remarks regarding the unrest of the past week, Democratic President Barack Obama praised protesters for making the ""kinds of epic changes and events in our country that are as profound as everything that Iâve seen in my lifetime"". The first black US president said that he saw reason for optimism despite the pain reflected in recent days and urged young people, especially, to vote for changes. ""Although all of us have been feeling pain uncertainty and disruption, some folks have been feeling it more than others,"" he said. Obama adds that the recent protests are the direct ""result of a long history of slavery and Jim Crow [laws] and red lining and institutionalised racism that have too often been the plague, the original sin, of our society"". He also called on US mayors and local officials to review police tactics. While in office, the former president also faced protests spurred by police brutality against Americans of colour, and was himself criticised for characterising demonstrators as ""criminals and thugs"". Former US president Barack Obama is hosting a video conference town hall, marking his first on-camera comments since anti-police brutality protests swept the US and world. He is expected to call for ""real change"" according to aides, and express his hope ""that we can turn protest into policyâ. He is starting to speak now. The call is being hosted on the Obama Foundation website. Thousands are expected to attend a protest in Melbourne on Saturday in response to the death of George Floyd, while also highlighting Aboriginal deaths in Australian police custody. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said people will not be fined for attending the protest, but police warned the demonstration could potentially spread Covid-19. ""What we've seen happen in the United States is a tragedy and it speaks to many of the differences between our society and the society in the United States,"" Andrews said. He added it was ""simply not feasible"" to impose fines or arrest demonstrators for breaching restrictions in place due to the pandemic. However, assistant commissioner Luke Cornelius said he would prefer the event be postponed until restrictions on large gathering are eased further. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Against the backdrop of the current US unrest, Russian activists have launched an online answer to the Black Lives Matter movement in response to a law enforcement shooting in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg. The hashtag RussianLivesMatter - in English - has gone viral in the last few days; it appears to have been started by Mikhail Svetov, of the Russian Libertarian Party, in a tweet about the 31 May shooting of a man suspected of stealing four rolls of wallpaper. The contents highlight cases of police brutality in Russia. A number of tweets have recalled the violent suppression of last summerâs protests held in support of free and fair elections in Moscow. Svetov has also tweeted calls for people to attend pickets at police headquarters in Moscow to protest abuses. However, he is a controversial character with links to the far-right. In March, Svetov posted a 70-minute interview with British far-right activist Tommy Robinson on his YouTube channel. Jessica LussenhopSenior staff writer, BBC News in Minneapolis Moments before it was announced that additional charges have been filed against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and three other former officers, the father of Michael Brown - the teenager killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 - arrived at the site of George Floydâs death. Michael Brown Sr has always asked that the officer in his sonâs case, former officer Darren Wilson, be fired, arrested and charged. None of that has yet come to pass. But standing in front of a mural to Floyd, he said the announcement of new charges gave him hope. âWe have a chance in St Louis. we have a chance to reopen our case,â he said. âThereâs no statute of limitations on murder.â Michael Brown Sr visits the site of George Floyd's death George Floyd's death in custody has sparked protests around the US - and also in countries around the world. On Wednesday, thousands protested in London, marching towards Parliament. It comes as UK chief constables said they stand alongside all those ""appalled and horrified"" by his death. A number of videos shared on social media showed protesters and police clashing outside Downing Street. Footage showed objects, including signs and a traffic cone, being thrown at police, while one protester was wrestled to the ground and restrained by officers. Read more on the London protesthere, and aboutdeaths in UK police custodyhere. Attorney General Ellison ends the press conference by promising to ""hold everyone accountable for
behaviour we can prove in court"". ""As the people who are legal professionals,
professional prosecutors â we are taking our duty seriously, and we are working

and throughout the country."" This, he says, is ""the origin of the trust problem"" - as ""people who have public guardians"" have not been held accountable in similar situations in the past. ""We canât control the past â all we can do is take the case we have in
front of us right now, and do our best to bring justice to the situation."" Ellison is asked about whether he is concerned the officers will be acquitted - with the reporter noting that no one has successfully prosecuted a second-degree murder charge for a policeman before - prompting more unrest, as happened during the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles. The 1992 riots broke out after white police officers were acquitted of police brutality for the beating of King, a black motorist. Ellison answers that the charges filed are based on the facts. ""We believe we have the ability to charge the charges that fit the facts in this case and we have done so,""  he says. ""So our concern is to put all the energy we can into putting forth the strongest case that we can, without fear or favor of anyone or anything. These charges are based on the facts that we have found and weâre gonna pursue them."" Drew Evans, the superintendant in Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, says authorities are in the process of taking the three police officers, who have just been charged, into custody. ""One is in custody, the other two we are in the process of taking into custody
and expect them to this afternoon,"" he says. Meanwhile, Attorney General Ellison tells reporters that public pressure did not influence his decision, saying he ""made the decision based on the lawâ. Â© 2025 BBC.

PM pledges coronavirus test results in 24 hoursBut Boris Johnson told MPs difficulties turning around postal tests would have to be considered.Health,"The head of the Test and Trace programme has been challenged over the risks of false negative coronavirus results by a committee of MPs. Dido Harding was asked at the health select committee why people are not repeatedly tested to ensure they do not have coronavirus. MPs heard 20% of positive cases may be missed by the test. Earlier Boris Johnson told the Commons tests would be processed within 24 hours by the end of June. Questioned by Mr Hunt, the PM said the 24-hour target would need to take into account ""insuperable problems"" such as postal delays. He said ""I can undertake to him now to get all tests turned around in 24 hours by the end of June, except for difficulties with postal tests or insuperable problems like that."" Coronavirus contact tracer 'paid to watch Netflix' Coronavirus: How does contact tracing work in England? What tests are being done in the UK? The tests involve a nose and throat swab which is then used to look for the virus's genetic material. It detects active coronavirus infection, so cannot say if someone has recovered from Covid-19. Testing positive should allow contacts to be traced, and determine whether NHS staff can go back to work. But the swab tests carried out can deliver false negative results - suggesting someone does not have coronavirus when they are actually positive. That could be because of the quality of the swab, the timing of the test or issues in the lab. During the select committee hearing Mr Hunt citedevidence from the University of Bristol,externalas suggesting 20% of positive cases could falsely appear as negative, wrongly telling someone they are not infected. Baroness Harding said she understood estimates of the proportion of false negative results ranged between ""two and 20-odd per cent"". She added that the issue of why those with a negative result were not re-tested was ""a medical"" question for the scientists, and it was her job ""to take Sage and chief medical officers' guidance"". A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The test is reliable and effective. Like any diagnostic test however, there is always the small possibility of a false negative or a false positive result."" The Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association (HCSA), which represents hospital doctors, had earlier called for NHS staff to be tested more than once. Dr Claudia Paoloni, the union's president, said relying on a single negative result risked ""infecting patients and staff"". Prof Nicola Stonehouse, a virologist at the University of Leeds, said people needed to be aware that one test wasn't ""good enough"". It's necessary to have multiple tests, she said, and they needed to be separated by 72 hours. Currently, a negative test clears people to return to work provided they don't have symptoms, and means contact tracing isn't triggered. GP, and diagnostic tests researcher, Dr Jessica Watson toldBBC Radio 4's More or Lessprogramme the ""best guess"" was about 70 in every 100 people who have coronavirus would be picked up by the testing programme. Testing and tracing is clearly going to be crucial in allowing the UK to get back to some level of normality. For it to work successfully, two basic things are needed above all else. People need to trust it and it needs to work effectively. The two are, of course, interlinked. And, unfortunately, on both counts the jury is out. The service - as Baroness Harding points out - is only six days old. It deserves to be given a little time to bed in. But pretty quickly the public will need to be given information about how it is working and whether people are complying with the requests to isolate. This is something officials are reluctant to do at the moment until they have properly validated the numbers - understandable given the UK Statistics Authority has already criticised the way testing numbers have been presented. It also needs people to come forward for testing. Surveys suggest there are around 8,000 new infections a day in the community, but the testing system is picking up less than 2,000 of them - and that includes those diagnosed in care homes and hospitals. If enough people are not coming forward for a test in the first place, tracing contacts and containing future outbreaks is bound to fail. Factors affecting the outcome include at what point in their illness someone is tested, how good a sample is taken, along with any problems with processing tests, she said. Public Health England is expected to publish an evaluation of its tests, used for hospital patients and some staff, this week. Follow Rachelon Twitter,external RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job?

Cyclone set to hit Mumbai,"Strong winds and rain began lashing Mumbai on Tuesday Authorities in India's financial capital Mumbai are bracing for a severe storm which could hit its coast early on Wednesday. Cyclone Nisarga is set to make landfall on India's west coast, near the city in Maharashtra state. Neighbouring Gujarat state is also likely to be impacted. The National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) has deployed to both states. The storm comes barely two weeks after Cyclone Amphan hit India's east coast. More than 85 people were killed by Amphan in both eastern India and Bangladesh. Mumbai bracing for the 'first cyclone in 129 years' Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? How Covid-19 has ravaged India's richest city Mumbai is already experiencing heavy rains, strong winds and heavy tides. Although the exact path of the storm will take some hours to become clear, weather officials say that there is a chance it could hit the city directly. If that were to happen, it would make it the first cyclone to impact Mumbai in centuries. Authorities have begun evacuating people from low-lying areas in and around the city, the state Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said. Fishermen have also been called back in from the sea and told not to venture out. The area has been put on ""red alert"" until Thursday, with storm surges expected. NDRF officials told local media that they were working on a ""zero casualties"" approach, which means they are hoping that there will be no deaths. ""Since the cyclone is in the severe category, the damage it can cause is considerable. We are working for the best but preparing for the worst,"" Director General SM Pradhan said. Boats are being moved ahead of the storm hitting However, the onset of the storm is likely to worry officials in Mumbai. With more than 50,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, the city is already India's worst-impacted in terms of infections. Its healthcare system is at breaking point, with videos from state emergency wards showing patients being forced to share beds and even oxygen cylinders. With more than 20 million people, it is also the country's most populous city. The onset of rains in coming months is expected to bring about other illness like malaria, typhoid, gastric infection and leptospirosis. Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference?

We'll be monitoring protests as curfew hour draws nigh across the US. Here's the main points from today:  Today's live page was brought to you by Matthew Davis, Victoria Bisset, George Wright, Max Matza, Sean Fanning, Helier Cheung, Vicky Baker, Joshua Cheetham, Ritu Prasad and Boer Deng. ""Silence can be as deadly as violence,"" former Democratic President Jimmy Carter has warned in a statement on the George Floyd protests. The comments from Carter, the oldest living US president, follow those made by former Presidents Bill Clinton, George W Bush and Barack Obama. Carter continued: ""People of power, privilege, and moral conscience must stand up and say 'no more' to a racially discriminatory police and justice system, immoral economic disparities between whites and blacks, and government actions that undermine our unified democracy."" ""Dehumanising people debases us all; humanity is beautifully and almost infinitely diverse,"" he adds. ""The bonds of our common humanity must overcome the divisiveness of our fears and prejudices."" ""We are responsible for creating a world of peace and equality for ourselves and future generations,"" he continued. ""We need a government as good as its people, and we are better than this."" For another day, protesters are out on the streets near the White House. In 90F (32C) heat, they lay down in the streets and chanted: ""I can't breathe."" The Washington DC mayor has pushed back the curfew time tonight to 23:00 local time, from 19:00 the past two nights. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The White House press secretary has likened President Donald Trump's ""resilience and determination"" during the #GeorgeFloyd protests to Winston Churchill inspecting bomb damage during World War Two. This video can not be played White House likens Trump to Churchill in WW2 Three alleged far-right activists in Las Vegas have been charged with trying to exploit peaceful protests and incite violence, according to prosecutors. According to the local prosecutor's office, the three men are alleged members of the âBoogalooâ movement, which prosecutors describe as ""a term used by extremists to signify a coming civil war and/or collapse of society"". âViolent instigators have hijacked peaceful protests and demonstrations across the country, including Nevada, exploiting the real and legitimate outrage over Mr Floydâs death for their own radical agendas,â US Attorney Nicholas Trutanich saidin a statement,external. âLaw enforcement is focused on keeping violence and destruction from interfering with free public expression and threatening lives.â The three men were apprehended late last month after attempting to use a molotov cocktail, officials say. As though in a direct rebuttal to Mattis, President Trump has released a video addressing the nationwide protests, with a final shot of the word âUniteâ superimposed over the stars of the US flag. The advert features the presidentâs voice over a contemplative piano soundtrack and footage of the demonstrations. Trump says he understands the pain people are feeling over the âgrave tragedyâ of George Floydâs death. He then argues Floydâs memory is being dishonoured by violence that he claims without evidence is being instigated by antifa, a loose affiliation of mainly far-left protesters. âNo one is more upset than fellow law enforcement officers,"" he says, ""by the small handful who fail to abide by their oath to serve and protect.â Images of police standing in solidarity with demonstrators play. âHealing not hatred, justice not chaos, are the mission at hand,â Trump adds. âWe are working towards a more just society, but that means building up, not tearing down, joining hands, not hurling fists.â Allow Twitter content?

A former winner of Miss Universe Malaysia is facing calls for her title to be stripped after comments she made about protests in the US. Samantha Katie James, who won the pageant in 2017, wrote a series of Instagram posts on Monday criticising the demonstrations and telling black people to ""relax"". ""You chose to be born as a 'coloured' person in America for a reason. To learn a certain lesson,"" she wrote. ""Accept it as it is."" The Brazilian-Chinese model added that ""it seems like the 'whites' won. Because if you're angry, you respond in rage and anguish. That means it has power over you. THEY HAVE POWER OVER YOU."" Her comments have drawn ire on social media, and more 120,000 people have signedan online petition calling for her title to be removed,external. The Miss Universe Malaysia Organisation has distanced itself from the remarks, calling them ""inappropriate, offensive, unacceptable and hurtful."" The beauty queen has since issued an apology on her Instagram, and said she has ""first hand experience"" of racism herself. ""I was insulted all my life for being white girl in local Malaysian school,"" she added. Former Secretary of Defence Jim Mattis, who resigned in 2018 in opposition to Trump's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria, has denounced the president's actions and blamed him for the current state of division in America. In an extraordinary critique,external, printed by the Atlantic magazine, Mattis writes that ""Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try. ""Instead, he tries to divide us."" Mattis continues: ""When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizensâmuch less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside."" The general urges the public to unite through ""the strengths inherent in our civil society"". ""This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.â Anatoly Antonov Russia's ambassador to the US has denied accusations that his country is helping to stir up unrest. On Sunday, White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien told ABC News that Russia could be using social media campaigns to stoke anger and confusion. Speaking with CNN, former national security advisor Susan Rice also said she ""would not be surprised"" if ""foreign actors"" like Russia were helping to encourage violence. But in a sharp rebuttal, Russian ambassador Anatoly Antonov told state news channel Rossiya-1 that the claims were ""utterly wrong. ""It goes without saying that what is happening in the United States is fresh evidence of human rights violations and double standards,"" said Mr Antonov, according to state-run TASS news agency. ""I will say unequivocally that nobody is rejoicing. Everybody is watching with great regret what is happening,"" he added. ""We are very much worried over the situation in the host country. We wish to see its recovery."" A protester faces off with military police near the White House on Wednesday US Defence Secretary Mark Esper has abruptly reversed a plan for soldiers of the Army's 82nd Airborne division to leave Washington DC on Wednesday. The volte-face comes hours after Esper said he disagreed with Trump's threat to send active-duty soldiers into American states and cities. Active-duty troops should be deployed âonly in the most urgent and dire of situations,â he said earlier. âWe are not in one of those situations now.â Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told AP News that 200 of the 1,600 soldiers in the Washington DC region had been due to depart earlier on Wednesday. But, he said, Esper intervened to order them to remain. The White House today had refused to express confidence in Esper, with the president's spokeswoman telling reporters: ""As of right now Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper, and should the president lose faith we will all learn about that in the future."" Troops staged on the National Mall in Washington DC Virginia governor Ralph Northam will announce tomorrow that a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee will be removed from the state capital, Associated Press reports. A senior official told the news agency that the controversial statue will be removed from Richmond's Monument Avenue and put into storage until a new location is agreed upon. The monument has been vandalised during recent protests, and is the largest of five Confederate statues along the avenue. The expected announcement comes after authorities in Alexandria removed the so-called Appomattox statue honouring Confederate soldiers from the Virginian city. Memorials to the Confederacy, which fought for the legal right to keep black people as slaves, have long stirred controversy in the US. They have been criticised by black advocates as everyday symbols of white supremacy, but opponents of their removal say it is tantamount to erasing history. The Robert E Lee statue in Richmond - once the seat of the Confederate South - is one of the most well-known public landmarks in the Virginian capital. In his first on-camera remarks regarding the unrest of the past week, Democratic President Barack Obama praised protesters for making the ""kinds of epic changes and events in our country that are as profound as everything that Iâve seen in my lifetime"". The first black US president said that he saw reason for optimism despite the pain reflected in recent days and urged young people, especially, to vote for changes. ""Although all of us have been feeling pain uncertainty and disruption, some folks have been feeling it more than others,"" he said. Obama adds that the recent protests are the direct ""result of a long history of slavery and Jim Crow [laws] and red lining and institutionalised racism that have too often been the plague, the original sin, of our society"". He also called on US mayors and local officials to review police tactics. While in office, the former president also faced protests spurred by police brutality against Americans of colour, and was himself criticised for characterising demonstrators as ""criminals and thugs"". Former US president Barack Obama is hosting a video conference town hall, marking his first on-camera comments since anti-police brutality protests swept the US and world. He is expected to call for ""real change"" according to aides, and express his hope ""that we can turn protest into policyâ. He is starting to speak now. The call is being hosted on the Obama Foundation website. Thousands are expected to attend a protest in Melbourne on Saturday in response to the death of George Floyd, while also highlighting Aboriginal deaths in Australian police custody. Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said people will not be fined for attending the protest, but police warned the demonstration could potentially spread Covid-19. ""What we've seen happen in the United States is a tragedy and it speaks to many of the differences between our society and the society in the United States,"" Andrews said. He added it was ""simply not feasible"" to impose fines or arrest demonstrators for breaching restrictions in place due to the pandemic. However, assistant commissioner Luke Cornelius said he would prefer the event be postponed until restrictions on large gathering are eased further. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media Against the backdrop of the current US unrest, Russian activists have launched an online answer to the Black Lives Matter movement in response to a law enforcement shooting in the Urals city of Yekaterinburg. The hashtag RussianLivesMatter - in English - has gone viral in the last few days; it appears to have been started by Mikhail Svetov, of the Russian Libertarian Party, in a tweet about the 31 May shooting of a man suspected of stealing four rolls of wallpaper. The contents highlight cases of police brutality in Russia. A number of tweets have recalled the violent suppression of last summerâs protests held in support of free and fair elections in Moscow. Svetov has also tweeted calls for people to attend pickets at police headquarters in Moscow to protest abuses. However, he is a controversial character with links to the far-right. In March, Svetov posted a 70-minute interview with British far-right activist Tommy Robinson on his YouTube channel. Jessica LussenhopSenior staff writer, BBC News in Minneapolis Moments before it was announced that additional charges have been filed against former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and three other former officers, the father of Michael Brown - the teenager killed by police in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014 - arrived at the site of George Floydâs death. Michael Brown Sr has always asked that the officer in his sonâs case, former officer Darren Wilson, be fired, arrested and charged. None of that has yet come to pass. But standing in front of a mural to Floyd, he said the announcement of new charges gave him hope. âWe have a chance in St Louis. we have a chance to reopen our case,â he said. âThereâs no statute of limitations on murder.â Michael Brown Sr visits the site of George Floyd's death George Floyd's death in custody has sparked protests around the US - and also in countries around the world. On Wednesday, thousands protested in London, marching towards Parliament. It comes as UK chief constables said they stand alongside all those ""appalled and horrified"" by his death. A number of videos shared on social media showed protesters and police clashing outside Downing Street. Footage showed objects, including signs and a traffic cone, being thrown at police, while one protester was wrestled to the ground and restrained by officers. Read more on the London protesthere, and aboutdeaths in UK police custodyhere. Attorney General Ellison ends the press conference by promising to ""hold everyone accountable for

"Man charged with murdering wife and daughterNikoletta Zdun, 18, and Aneta Zdun, 40, died at a home in Salisbury on Monday.Wiltshire","Nikoleta Zdun, 18, and Aneta Zdun, 40, died at a home in Wessex Road on Monday A man has appeared in court charged with murdering his wife and daughter. Aneta Zdun, 40, and Nikoleta Zdun, 18, died at a house in Wessex Road, Salisbury, on Monday afternoon. Marcin Zdun, 39, of Wessex Road, is due to appear before Winchester Crown Court on 5 June, following the hearing at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court. Aneta worked for Wessex Care, which described her as a ""warm, kind individual"" and a ""well-loved and well-known"" member of its team. Police were called to the house at 14:45 BST on Monday, by neighbours who described hearing loud screams and helped detain a man near the scene. Officers went to the property and found the body of one of the women. The other woman was found seriously injured and died a short time later at the scene. Floral tributes have been laid at the scene Salisbury-based Wessex Care, which provides community and residential care, said in a statement that it was with ""great sadness and shock that we have lost a member of the Wessex Care family and also her beloved eldest daughter"". ""Those of you who knew Aneta personally and professionally will know what a warm, kind and caring individual she was. ""She cared immensely for many vulnerable people throughout her career as a physiotherapist and healthcare assistant. She will be greatly missed and mourned by all who knew her. ""You'll be forever in our thoughts Aneta and thank you for the care and dedication you provided."" Neighbours said the house was lived in by a supermarket worker and his family. Det Ch Insp Darren Hannant from Wiltshire Police said there was likely to be ""a significant police presence"" in the area.

"UK holidaymakers âwelcomeâ in PortugalPortugal's foreign minister tells the BBC that an ""air bridge"" agreement could be in place soon.Business","Portugal's foreign minister has said anyone in the UK thinking of going to Portugal this summer will be ""most welcome"" amid coronavirus. Augusto Santos Silva said he hoped an air bridge between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June. The UK is set to give more details of its plan to force arrivals into quarantine for 14 days later. UK Home Secretary Priti Patel will say air bridges to countries with low virus infection rates are possible in future. This would mean that people arriving from certain places will not have to self-isolate. However, that will only apply to countries with low Covid-19 infection rates, she is expected to tell MPs. She will also say that the planned quarantine for arrivals is necessary ""to prevent a second wave of the virus"". Meanwhile, Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye has told BBC Breakfast that travellers will have to fill out details of where they will be staying to quarantine, when they book their flight. He said there will then be ""spot checks"" within the immigration area, where the Border Force officers will check if people have filled out their form. ""All of the form-filling will take place before you get on a plane, and will be done online. The government will be able to check information before people get onto a plane,"" he said. Some countries have already started to ease travel restrictions.  The German foreign minister Heiko Maas said the country would lift a travel ban for EU countries, as well as the UK and a handful of others - as long as they do not have large-scale lockdowns in place. However, Germany will advise against travel to Britain for as long as the UK government demands a 14-day quarantine for new arrivals. Portugal's Mr Santos Silva told the BBC that an agreement between the UK and Portugal could be in place by the end of June, meaning that holidaymakers returning to the UK from Portugal would escape the quarantine rules. He said any travel quarantine ""was an enemy of tourism"", but that he respected the UK government's decision to enforce one on almost all arrivals to the UK from next Monday. Mr Santos Silva said ""rules"" would ensure that people would be able to holiday safely. The minister suggested that nightlife in Portuguese resorts this summer would be very limited and people would not be allowed to congregate in groups at night. He said hotels and apartments which comply with standards set by the tourism board would be labelled as ""clean and safe"". What are the UK travel quarantine rules? No early return for UK tourists, says Spain UK must agree 'air bridges', warn business groups Portugal's foreign minister confirmed talks on the matter were continuing with the UK. But he insisted that Portugal would not impose any type of quarantine for people arriving in his country. Instead, he said Portugal would rely on temperature checks at airports and that Portugal was, in coordination with other EU countries, considering carrying out ""random testing"" on passengers. Mr Santos Silva said tourists would be warned how full beaches are, so that they could avoid crowded spots. UK aviation bosses hope that a large number of air bridge agreements will be in place by 29 June, when the travel quarantine is set to be reviewed. More tourists from the UK head to the Algarve each summer than from any other country. But Spain, another country whose tourism sector relies heavily on British holidaymakers, is taking a different approach. The Spanish government has saidit will only allow UK tourists in this summer if the infection rate in the UK falls more significantly. The UK travel quarantine will apply to people arriving from any country, apart from the Republic of Ireland, and will also apply to UK nationals. People will be required to self-isolate in a private residence for two weeks. The government says people ""could be contacted regularly during this period to ensure compliance"". People who break the rules could be fined Â£1,000. UK travel companies say the travel quarantine already means people are not booking holidays. They warn that more businesses in the sector now face financial ruin. The measure will be reviewed every three weeks. When deciding whether to keep the quarantine in place, the government will consider several factors. They include: the rate of infection internationally prevention measures in other countries the extent to which other countries with more relaxed border arrangements have seen imported cases the effectiveness of testing methods at minimising the risk of new cases of the virus entering the country. A growing list of Conservative MPs have spoken out against the blanket travel quarantine. However, a YouGov poll of 1,565 adults in Great Britain suggests that there is public support. 63% of those surveyed thought people should be quarantined as per the government's plan. About one quarter thought that the quarantine should only apply to people arriving from countries with a ""high number of coronavirus cases"". Only 4% thought that there should be no quarantine at all. Labour has questioned why a travel quarantine was not introduced some weeks ago. New figures show that between the beginning of January and the end of April, 14,225 flights arrived into UK airports. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?

Contact tracer 'paid to watch Netflix'A clinician on the NHS Test and Trace scheme tells the BBC of her frustration at not receiving work.UK,"This video can not be played ""Becky"" - a contract tracer in England - speaks to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire A contact tracer working on the NHS Test and Trace coronavirus scheme says she has not been asked to speak to anyone since beginning work last week. The clinician told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire she had worked 38 hours but had yet to make a single phone call and spent the time watching Netflix. ""It's frustrating to know that I'm sat idle when there's people that need contacting,"" they said. The government said this does not reflect the amount of work under way. ""Becky"" spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, and said she has watched nearly three series of comedy The Good Place, despite being available to help isolate people. ""I'm yet to make a single phone call or be assigned a case,""  the nurse said. ""I've had no contact from anyone. I've had no contact from supervisors. I've literally been on the system, refreshed the system, and entertained myself during that watching Netflix. ""I've just watched it alongside going back to the system, refreshing it, occasionally having to log back in because it's timed out. I have yet to have contact with anybody regarding contact tracing."" What if NHS coronavirus tracers contact me? What are the self-isolation rules? My new skill as a contact tracer It came as Channel 4 News reported data showing 4,456 confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported to the Test and Trace scheme between 28 May, when it launched, and 31 May. The data - described by the government as ""outdated"" - showed those confirmed cases passed on 4,634 contacts, but Channel 4 reported just 1,749 of these have been contacted by tracers. Latest daily figures showed 1,613 people tested positive for coronavirus up to 09:00 BST on Tuesday. ""Becky"" told Victoria Derbyshire there seemed to be a lack of work for contact tracers Anthony Costello is a professor of global health at University College London who formerly worked at the World Health Organization (WHO). He told Victoria Derbyshire the Test and Trace system was unlikely to be picking up more than 30% of coronavirus cases and may be missing at least two-thirds of contacts. ""That's why your nurse has not had any calls. It is not fit for purpose yet. The worrying thing is can it ever be fit for purpose? Why was it set up like this? You need speed and you need trust,"" he said. He added that the system should instead revolve around local GPs and that the current system risked giving people a false sense of security. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson pledgeda new 24-hour target for test results, except for tests delivered by post. The pledge followed comments by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt who said the quick turnaround of test results was crucial for the Test and Trace scheme to be effective. The NHS Test and Trace scheme in England is intended to map a person's networks and close contacts once they have received a positive coronavirus diagnosis. It is being run in part by the private outsourcing company Serco and is led by the chair of NHS Improvement and former TalkTalk chief executive Baroness Dido Harding. One NHS job advert for a clinical contact tracer stated the role paid up to Â£27.15 per hour and described suitable applicants as nurses, dentists or vets, among others. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Other non-clinical and administrative roles on the scheme are reportedly paid less than Â£10 per hour. Scotland's systemis called NHS Test and Protectwhile in Wales it is""test, trace, protect"". Northern Ireland alsohas its own system. Becky - who said nursing was a vocation - described her experience with Test and Trace as ""frustrating"". ""I think it's appalling, I think it's dishonest,"" she said. ""We're trying to build a very large system that's trying to keep people in England safe and try and prevent a second spike. ""I understand it's complex and I understand there's going to be challenges."" This video can not be played WATCH: What is contact tracing and how does it work? ""It's not ready yet. Hold fire. The released aspects of lockdown - which without track and trace - are not safe to do so,"" Becky added. ""Not having a system up and running is obviously frustrating but it's about people's lives."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The new NHS Test and Trace service is up and running and will help save lives. These claims do not reflect the huge amount of work already under way. ""Anyone in this country can book a test and we have over 25,000 contact tracers in place to undertake this vital work. ""All staff have been trained and are fully supported in their work following procedures designed by public health experts.""

Schools in Wales to reopen this monthParents who choose not to send their children to school when they reopen will not be fined.,"This video can not be played A personalised experience will prepare pupils for September, said Kirsty Williams All schools in Wales will reopen on 29 June, the Welsh Government have said. They will be open to pupils from all year groups for limited periods during the week, with only a third of pupils in school at any one time, Education Minister Kirsty Williams confirmed. Schools and councils will make their own decisions over managing the return. The summer term has been extended by one week to 27 July, and the autumn half-term holiday will be stretched to two weeks. Parents who choose not to send their children to school will not be fined and pupils who fall into the shielding category will carry on with online learning. Q&A: How will schools in Wales reopen? What is life like now in school? Some children in England started backon Monday while schools inScotlandandNorthern Irelandwill begin to return in August. Some teaching unions have criticised the move in Wales, with the biggest union saying its members will be told they do not have to return to school if they feel the risk is too great. David Evans, from NEU Wales, said the measures were ""too much, too soon"" and there was ""little or no consultation"" over the additional week at the end of July. This video can not be played How will the reopening of Welsh schools work? Another union, the NASUWT, said the government did not have ""good enough reasons for risking lives."" ""The Welsh Government is well aware of the extreme difficulty of social distancing in schools, especially for younger children,"" said National Official Neil Butler. ""The minister has also admitted that this is for a 'check in' and 'catch up' so there is clearly no educational purpose behind this decision."" NAHT Cymru said that while the announced plan was the one its members preferred out of the options put forward by the Welsh Government, the intention to get ""all"" children in ""is more problematic"". It added it would have preferred to have prioritised specific year groups. Ms Williams said she was ""surprised"" by the unions' criticism and it was not helpful ""to have inflammatory language"". ""I would do nothing, and I have done nothing from this entire period when we closed schools for statutory purposes, to do anything to risk anybody's lives,"" she said. This video can not be played Chris Lawrence says there is too much uncertainty to send children back to the classroom Year groups will be split into smaller classes with staggered starts, lessons and breaks. It is expected this will mean, at most, a third of pupils present at any one time, though schools may need time to reach this level. All children will have the opportunity to ""check in, catch up, prepare for summer and September"", Ms Williams said. ""My announcement gives schools three-and-a-half weeks to continue preparing for the next phase,"" she added. Ms Williams said social distancing would be a challenge for the youngest children ""but we have experience of dealing with this in the hubs that have been operating to date"" and good practice had been learnt. She said the Welsh Government was ""moving very cautiously"" by limiting the number of children in classrooms at any one time and also the number that can be at school at the same time. Ms Williams said it was important to ensure ""equity"" by giving all children the chance to ""catch up"" and prepare with their teachers ahead of the summer holidays. She said she had been ""hugely heartened"" by headteachers ""coming forward with very practical plans"" on how they can ""move to the next phase of supporting children and families in their learning"". By doing this before September, she added, ""it gives us a natural firebreak to reflect on those experiences"" before the next term. The Welsh Government had been considering two options - to reopen this month or wait until after the summer holidays - aftersupposedly rejecting plans to bring forward the start of the autumnterm to August. So far, the only Welsh pupils who have seen the inside of a classroom since the coronavirus lockdown have been children deemed to be vulnerable or those of key workers, who have been attending school hubs to enable their parents to continue doing their vital jobs. The Welsh Government will issue further guidance for councils and schools next week. Ms Williams said the start date would mean one full month of thetest, trace and protect systembeing in place - which tracks people who have been exposed to the virus and asks them to self-isolate. Teachers will be a priority group for the new antibody testing programme, which tells people if they have previously had the virus and have developed antibodies. A maximum of a third of pupils will be in school at any one time ""As we continue to keep Wales safe, this approach will be critical,"" she said. ""The evolving science suggests that warm weather and sunlight gives us the best opportunity to ensure more time in school. ""Waiting until September would mean almost half a year without schooling. That would be to the detriment to the wellbeing, learning progress and mental health of our young people. Call for inquiry into Welsh coronavirus response MPs demand evidence for five-mile travel advice New lockdown measures 'may be needed in winter' ""This is and has been a worrying period for us all. I know that many will feel apprehensive. We have not rushed this work and this decision. ""I am also convinced that it is only by returning to their own school that we will see increased attendance from our more vulnerable and disadvantaged children."" Unison, the public services union, said all school staff must be included in antibody testing, not just teachers. ""This approach will not work and will risk the spread of Covid-19,"" schools lead Rosie Lewis said. The government will also issue guidance for further and higher education institutions next week, and for childcare providers to increase the number of children in attendance alongside schools. Further education colleges are preparing to reopen for face-to-face learning from 15 June. UK Government's key evidence on schools Has closing schools had an impact? Coronavirus risks for children Teachers are awaiting the finer detail and logistics of how they are to accommodate the children safely with social distancing in mind. ""I don't think we can ever be reassured it is perfectly safe,"" said Armando Di Finizio, head of Eastern High School in Cardiff. ""It'd be wrong not to have concerns but it is about mitigating any risks as far as we can but I think it is the right time to go back."" The profession think managing a safe return for pupils will be difficult in smaller primary schools where they ""don't have spare space"" so ""can't spread pupils out"". ""If we have different groups coming in, we're going to have to clean those rooms down completely in between each group,"" said a Cardiff primary school teacher, who would only give her first name, Carol. ""The children will also need their own set of stationary - but we suddenly don't have the finances to buy 500 sets of stationary because they would normally share. It's that kind of practical detail we need."" Parents who choose not to send their children back to school will not be fined But the teachers agree that not returning to school until September is ""perhaps too long"". ""We are there to help young people make sense of the world,"" added Mr Di Finizio. He said it would help give children ""reassurance, stability, rhythm of life and discipline"" as well as ""helping vulnerable"" and at risk students. Plaid Cymru criticised the decision, saying it was ""too early"", while the Welsh Conservatives broadly welcomed the move but said there were still questions to be answered, such as whether assistance with school transport, cleaning and school meals would be provided.

""I don't think we can ever be reassured it is perfectly safe,"" said Armando Di Finizio, head of Eastern High School in Cardiff. ""It'd be wrong not to have concerns but it is about mitigating any risks as far as we can but I think it is the right time to go back."" The profession think managing a safe return for pupils will be difficult in smaller primary schools where they ""don't have spare space"" so ""can't spread pupils out"". ""If we have different groups coming in, we're going to have to clean those rooms down completely in between each group,"" said a Cardiff primary school teacher, who would only give her first name, Carol. ""The children will also need their own set of stationary - but we suddenly don't have the finances to buy 500 sets of stationary because they would normally share. It's that kind of practical detail we need."" Parents who choose not to send their children back to school will not be fined But the teachers agree that not returning to school until September is ""perhaps too long"". ""We are there to help young people make sense of the world,"" added Mr Di Finizio. He said it would help give children ""reassurance, stability, rhythm of life and discipline"" as well as ""helping vulnerable"" and at risk students. Plaid Cymru criticised the decision, saying it was ""too early"", while the Welsh Conservatives broadly welcomed the move but said there were still questions to be answered, such as whether assistance with school transport, cleaning and school meals would be provided.

Students might have to stay in 'protective bubble'When university campuses open students might have to live and study in small groups to limit mixing.,"Lectures might have to shift from lecture halls to online lessons Students might have to stay in a ""protective bubble"" of the same small group, when the UK's university campuses reopen in the autumn. University leaders suggested students would live and study with the same group to minimise mixing. They were setting out safety measures for a socially-distanced student life - including a virtual freshers' week. A survey suggested 71% of students would prefer to start the term later, if they got more in-person teaching. University campuses have been closed since the coronavirus lockdown, with teaching switching online, and their representative body, Universities UK has been setting out how they might bring students back for the autumn term. To prevent the risk of infection, the Universities UK briefing suggested students could be kept in small groups, sharing accommodation with people taking the same course, using the ""protective bubble"" approach used in primary schools in England. 'University will definitely not be the same' 'A very, very different university experience' Watchdog says students must be told how they will be taught Online students face full tuition fees Liz Barnes, vice-chancellor of Staffordshire University, said she had been discussing the idea of protective bubbles with other universities - with her university expecting to have eight people per bubble. By housing students in groups taking the same subjects, with timetables that bring them on campus at the same time, it would minimise contact with other students. ""The more that we can keep them into a small group of regular interaction the better in current circumstances,"" said Prof Barnes. Applicants to university have to be told how they will be taught Students could see others outside, but there would be controls on who could go inside accommodation. This would also assume that university accommodation would have a big reduction in capacity, so that social distancing could be possible and facilities such as kitchens and bathrooms could be safely shared. If lectures are delivered online, there would also be fewer people on campus. The first week of university life - or freshers' week - is where students get a chance to socialise together. But University of Nottingham vice-chancellor, Shearer West, said it might not be ""all singing, all dancing"" this year. This could be the case literally as well as metaphorically, if welcome events are online or restricted to small numbers. ""We're certainly planning to have people join things and get involved in societies, but we may just have to run freshers' fair in a different kind of way,"" said Prof West. These could be ""virtual events,"" said Universities UK president Julia Buckingham. But in a way that ""we can guarantee students have social interaction with one another"". Most likely a bit of both. The term being used is ""blended"", where students get a mix of online lectures and then in-person teaching for smaller groups. But individual students will want to know the balance for their chosen subject - how much will they be studying on campus and how much by distance learning? Will the freshers' week parties be online this year? Prof Buckingham, vice-chancellor of Brunel University, said she wanted to ""dispel the image"" that learning online was not the same quality. And even if courses are entirely online, Universities Minister Michelle Donelan has said universities in England can charge full tuition fees. According to a survey from the University and College Union, 71% of students would prefer to push back the start of term, if it meant they had more in-person and less online teaching. The survey of 516 people applying to university this year also found 23% were worried that their preferred university could go bust because of the coronavirus outbreak. Prof Buckingham suggested there would be flexibility for overseas students to start in January, if they were unable to travel for the autumn. Some students might want to defer a year entirely to get a better experience. But with the prospect of no travel, few jobs and a socially-distanced social life, it's also been described as being the world's worst gap year. ""Students need clarity as to what they can expect from the next academic year in order for them to make informed choices,"" says the National Union of Students. The deadline for making a firm choice of university is 18 June - and the higher education watchdog, the Office for Students, says applicants have to be told with ""absolute clarity"" how they will be taught. And if a university subsequently changes what it offers then students should be released from their choices. While the guidance from Universities UK sets out ideas and broad principles, students will want to know about their individual options. Will accommodation be available? How many hours of in-person teaching will there be? What campus facilities will be open? Will freshers' week be a laptop in their bedroom? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

"Man charged with murdering wife and daughterNikoletta Zdun, 18, and Aneta Zdun, 40, died at a home in Salisbury on Monday.","Nikoleta Zdun, 18, and Aneta Zdun, 40, died at a home in Wessex Road on Monday A man has appeared in court charged with murdering his wife and daughter. Aneta Zdun, 40, and Nikoleta Zdun, 18, died at a house in Wessex Road, Salisbury, on Monday afternoon. Marcin Zdun, 39, of Wessex Road, is due to appear before Winchester Crown Court on 5 June, following the hearing at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court. Aneta worked for Wessex Care, which described her as a ""warm, kind individual"" and a ""well-loved and well-known"" member of its team. Police were called to the house at 14:45 BST on Monday, by neighbours who described hearing loud screams and helped detain a man near the scene. Officers went to the property and found the body of one of the women. The other woman was found seriously injured and died a short time later at the scene. Floral tributes have been laid at the scene Salisbury-based Wessex Care, which provides community and residential care, said in a statement that it was with ""great sadness and shock that we have lost a member of the Wessex Care family and also her beloved eldest daughter"". ""Those of you who knew Aneta personally and professionally will know what a warm, kind and caring individual she was. ""She cared immensely for many vulnerable people throughout her career as a physiotherapist and healthcare assistant. She will be greatly missed and mourned by all who knew her. ""You'll be forever in our thoughts Aneta and thank you for the care and dedication you provided."" Neighbours said the house was lived in by a supermarket worker and his family. Det Ch Insp Darren Hannant from Wiltshire Police said there was likely to be ""a significant police presence"" in the area.

Contact tracer 'paid to watch Netflix'A clinician on the NHS Test and Trace scheme tells the BBC of her frustration at not receiving work.,"This video can not be played ""Becky"" - a contract tracer in England - speaks to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire A contact tracer working on the NHS Test and Trace coronavirus scheme says she has not been asked to speak to anyone since beginning work last week. The clinician told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire she had worked 38 hours but had yet to make a single phone call and spent the time watching Netflix. ""It's frustrating to know that I'm sat idle when there's people that need contacting,"" they said. The government said this does not reflect the amount of work under way. ""Becky"" spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, and said she has watched nearly three series of comedy The Good Place, despite being available to help isolate people. ""I'm yet to make a single phone call or be assigned a case,""  the nurse said. ""I've had no contact from anyone. I've had no contact from supervisors. I've literally been on the system, refreshed the system, and entertained myself during that watching Netflix. ""I've just watched it alongside going back to the system, refreshing it, occasionally having to log back in because it's timed out. I have yet to have contact with anybody regarding contact tracing."" What if NHS coronavirus tracers contact me? What are the self-isolation rules? My new skill as a contact tracer It came as Channel 4 News reported data showing 4,456 confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported to the Test and Trace scheme between 28 May, when it launched, and 31 May. The data - described by the government as ""outdated"" - showed those confirmed cases passed on 4,634 contacts, but Channel 4 reported just 1,749 of these have been contacted by tracers. Latest daily figures showed 1,613 people tested positive for coronavirus up to 09:00 BST on Tuesday. ""Becky"" told Victoria Derbyshire there seemed to be a lack of work for contact tracers Anthony Costello is a professor of global health at University College London who formerly worked at the World Health Organization (WHO). He told Victoria Derbyshire the Test and Trace system was unlikely to be picking up more than 30% of coronavirus cases and may be missing at least two-thirds of contacts. ""That's why your nurse has not had any calls. It is not fit for purpose yet. The worrying thing is can it ever be fit for purpose? Why was it set up like this? You need speed and you need trust,"" he said. He added that the system should instead revolve around local GPs and that the current system risked giving people a false sense of security. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson pledgeda new 24-hour target for test results, except for tests delivered by post. The pledge followed comments by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt who said the quick turnaround of test results was crucial for the Test and Trace scheme to be effective. The NHS Test and Trace scheme in England is intended to map a person's networks and close contacts once they have received a positive coronavirus diagnosis. It is being run in part by the private outsourcing company Serco and is led by the chair of NHS Improvement and former TalkTalk chief executive Baroness Dido Harding. One NHS job advert for a clinical contact tracer stated the role paid up to Â£27.15 per hour and described suitable applicants as nurses, dentists or vets, among others. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Other non-clinical and administrative roles on the scheme are reportedly paid less than Â£10 per hour. Scotland's systemis called NHS Test and Protectwhile in Wales it is""test, trace, protect"". Northern Ireland alsohas its own system. Becky - who said nursing was a vocation - described her experience with Test and Trace as ""frustrating"". ""I think it's appalling, I think it's dishonest,"" she said. ""We're trying to build a very large system that's trying to keep people in England safe and try and prevent a second spike.

A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The new NHS Test and Trace service is up and running and will help save lives. These claims do not reflect the huge amount of work already under way. ""Anyone in this country can book a test and we have over 25,000 contact tracers in place to undertake this vital work.

My new skill as a contact tracer It came as Channel 4 News reported data showing 4,456 confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported to the Test and Trace scheme between 28 May, when it launched, and 31 May. The data - described by the government as ""outdated"" - showed those confirmed cases passed on 4,634 contacts, but Channel 4 reported just 1,749 of these have been contacted by tracers. Latest daily figures showed 1,613 people tested positive for coronavirus up to 09:00 BST on Tuesday. ""Becky"" told Victoria Derbyshire there seemed to be a lack of work for contact tracers Anthony Costello is a professor of global health at University College London who formerly worked at the World Health Organization (WHO). He told Victoria Derbyshire the Test and Trace system was unlikely to be picking up more than 30% of coronavirus cases and may be missing at least two-thirds of contacts. ""That's why your nurse has not had any calls. It is not fit for purpose yet. The worrying thing is can it ever be fit for purpose? Why was it set up like this? You need speed and you need trust,"" he said. He added that the system should instead revolve around local GPs and that the current system risked giving people a false sense of security. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Boris Johnson pledgeda new 24-hour target for test results, except for tests delivered by post. The pledge followed comments by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt who said the quick turnaround of test results was crucial for the Test and Trace scheme to be effective. The NHS Test and Trace scheme in England is intended to map a person's networks and close contacts once they have received a positive coronavirus diagnosis. It is being run in part by the private outsourcing company Serco and is led by the chair of NHS Improvement and former TalkTalk chief executive Baroness Dido Harding. One NHS job advert for a clinical contact tracer stated the role paid up to Â£27.15 per hour and described suitable applicants as nurses, dentists or vets, among others. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Other non-clinical and administrative roles on the scheme are reportedly paid less than Â£10 per hour. Scotland's systemis called NHS Test and Protectwhile in Wales it is""test, trace, protect"". Northern Ireland alsohas its own system. Becky - who said nursing was a vocation - described her experience with Test and Trace as ""frustrating"". ""I think it's appalling, I think it's dishonest,"" she said. ""We're trying to build a very large system that's trying to keep people in England safe and try and prevent a second spike. ""I understand it's complex and I understand there's going to be challenges."" This video can not be played WATCH: What is contact tracing and how does it work? ""It's not ready yet. Hold fire. The released aspects of lockdown - which without track and trace - are not safe to do so,"" Becky added. ""Not having a system up and running is obviously frustrating but it's about people's lives."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""The new NHS Test and Trace service is up and running and will help save lives. These claims do not reflect the huge amount of work already under way. ""Anyone in this country can book a test and we have over 25,000 contact tracers in place to undertake this vital work. ""All staff have been trained and are fully supported in their work following procedures designed by public health experts.""

Zoom sees sales boom amid pandemicThe pandemic has opened up new opportunities for the video conference company.BusinessComments,"Zoom has become the app many are using to stay in touch with friends, family and work colleagues When it comes to its growth rate, video conference company Zoom has lived up to its name. Use of the firm's software jumped 30-fold in April, as the coronavirus pandemic forced millions to work, learn and socialise remotely. At its peak, the firm counted more than 300 million daily participants in virtual meetings, while paying customers have more than tripled. The dramatic uptake has the potential to change the firm's path. Zoom said it expects sales as high as $1.8bn (Â£1.4bn) this year - roughly double what it forecast in March. ""It's a huge opportunity,"" chief executive Eric Yuan told investors on Tuesday. Mr Yuan didn't intend to create Zoom for the masses. Zoom has made Eric Yuan, whose visa application to the US was denied eight times, a billionaire A Chinese-born software engineer, Mr Yuan started the company in 2011, after years rising through the ranks at WebEx, one of the first US video conference companies, which was purchased by Cisco in 2007 for $3.2bn. At the time, he faced doubts from many investors, who did not see the need for another option in a market already dominated by big players such as Microsoft and Cisco. But Mr Yuan - who has credited his interest in video conferencing to the long distances he had to travel to meet up with his now-wife in their youth - was frustrated at Cisco and believed there was demand in the business world for software that would work on mobile phones and be easier to use. Zoom under increased scrutiny as popularity soars Racist zoombombing at virtual synagogue Zoom is in all our living rooms but is it safe? When the firm sold its first shares to the public last year, it was valued at $15.9bn. That shot to more than $58bn on Tuesday. ""What Zoom has done is kind of democratised video conferencing for all kinds of businesses and made it very simple for everyone from yoga instructors through to board room executives to deploy video,"" says Alex Smith, senior director at Canalys. When the lockdowns started, Zoom lifted the limits for the free version of its software in China and for educators in many countries, including the UK, helping to drive its popularity. But the firm's bread and butter customers are corporate clients, who pay for subscriptions and enhanced features. Zoom said on Tuesday that sales jumped 169% year-on-year in the three months to 30 April to $328.2m, as it added more than 180,000 customers with more than 10 employees since January - far more than it had expected. It also turned a profit of $27m in the quarter - more than it made in all of the prior financial year. The massive uptake has also strained the firm, forcing it to invest to expand capacity to meet the needs of new users, many of whom are not paying customers. Its reputation also took a hit, as the new attention prompted hackers to hijack meetings and exposed a host of security flaws, revealing that the firm had sent user data to Facebook, had wrongly claimed the app had end-to-end encryption, and was allowing meeting hosts to track attendees. It has also faced political scrutiny for its ties to China - where it has more than 700 staff, including most of its product development team - which have prompted warnings that it is not fit for government use. In April, Mr Yuan, who is a US citizen, apologised for the security lapses and the firm started rolling out a number of changes intended to fix the problems. Zoom has also announced a number of new appointments familiar with Washington politics, including H R McMaster, a retired Army general and former national security adviser to Donald Trump. ""Navigating this process has been a humbling learning experience,"" Mr Yuan said on an investor call on Tuesday. Analysts said they expected the company would overcome these reputational blows. ""It's had that mishap and the fact that its name is still very much used as verbatim with video technology still gives it a lot of momentum and opportunity to continue,"" Mr Smith said. Analysts say they expect Zoom to maintain its focus on business customers, since that's how it makes money. But the pandemic is likely to create more challenges for Zoom in that market, as increased demand for remote work prompts competitors such as Microsoft and Cisco to pour resources into the field. ""The stakes are higher and the competition's getting tougher, so we'll see,"" says Ryan Koontz, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities. ""They were on a very strong trajectory before... and happened to be in the right place at the right time as the whole world decided we needed to communicate well on video,"" he says. ""They have this amazing brand... now they have to leverage that brand and figure out which markets they're going to go after.""

"Man charged with murdering wife and daughterNikoletta Zdun, 18, and Aneta Zdun, 40, died at a home in Wessex Road, Salisbury, on Monday.Wiltshire","Nikoleta Zdun, 18, and Aneta Zdun, 40, died at a home in Wessex Road on Monday A man has appeared in court charged with murdering his wife and daughter. Aneta Zdun, 40, and Nikoleta Zdun, 18, died at a house in Wessex Road, Salisbury, on Monday afternoon. Marcin Zdun, 39, of Wessex Road, is due to appear before Winchester Crown Court on 5 June, following the hearing at Basingstoke Magistrates' Court. Aneta worked for Wessex Care, which described her as a ""warm, kind individual"" and a ""well-loved and well-known"" member of its team. Police were called to the house at 14:45 BST on Monday, by neighbours who described hearing loud screams and helped detain a man near the scene. Officers went to the property and found the body of one of the women. The other woman was found seriously injured and died a short time later at the scene. Floral tributes have been laid at the scene Salisbury-based Wessex Care, which provides community and residential care, said in a statement that it was with ""great sadness and shock that we have lost a member of the Wessex Care family and also her beloved eldest daughter"". ""Those of you who knew Aneta personally and professionally will know what a warm, kind and caring individual she was. ""She cared immensely for many vulnerable people throughout her career as a physiotherapist and healthcare assistant. She will be greatly missed and mourned by all who knew her. ""You'll be forever in our thoughts Aneta and thank you for the care and dedication you provided."" Neighbours said the house was lived in by a supermarket worker and his family. Det Ch Insp Darren Hannant from Wiltshire Police said there was likely to be ""a significant police presence"" in the area.

Google in $5bn lawsuit for tracking in 'private' modeThe search engine giant says it is upfront about what data is collected when users browse incognito.,"Google has been sued in the US over claims it illegally invades the privacy of users by tracking people even when they are browsing in ""private mode"". The class action wants at least $5bn (Â£4bn) from Google and owner Alphabet. Many internet users assume their search history isn't being tracked when they view in private mode, but Google says this isn't the case. The search engine denies this is illegal and says it is upfront about the data it collects in this mode. The proposed class action likely includes ""millions"" of Google users who since 1 June 2016 browsed the internet in private mode according to law firm Boies Schiller Flexner who filed the claim on Tuesday in federal court in San Jose, California. US challenges 'unfair' tech taxes in the UK and EU Indian app hunts out Chinese software on phones Senator tells MPs Huawei puts US troops at risk Incognito mode within Google's Chrome browser gives users the choice to search the internet without their activity being saved to the browser or device. But the websites visited can use tools such as Google Analytics to track usage. The complaint says that Google ""cannot continue to engage in the covert and unauthorized data collection from virtually every American with a computer or phone"". Vigorously denying the claims Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said: ""As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity"". The search engine says the collection of search history, even in private viewing mode, helps site owners ""better evaluate the performance of their content, products, marketing and more."" While private browsing has been available from Google for some time, Boies Schiller Flexner said it recently decided to represent three plaintiffs based in the US. ""People everywhere are becoming more aware (and concerned) that their personal communications are being intercepted, collected, recorded, or exploited for gain by technology companies they have come to depend on,"" it said in the filing. One option is for visitors to install Google Analytics browser opt-out extension to disable measurement by Google Analytics, it says.

TV and film 'need government help' to restart,"Production on the next series of His Dark Materials halted when lockdown began Independent drama production in Wales will be unable to restart after the pandemic without UK government support, industry leaders have said. Bad Wolf Studios in Cardiff, which producedHis Dark Materials, said resuming would be expensive, with questions over the affordability of insurance. The firm said ""it's going to be tough"". The UK government said it was ""working closely"" with the film and TV industry to address concerns about insurance. The Welsh Government said it was ""committed to doing everything possible"" to support the sector. Bad Wolf was in the middle of filming the last episode of the second series of His Dark Materials when lockdown struck. ""It was a real shock. It got to a situation where due to social distancing we couldn't carry on filming,"" said Natasha Hale, Bad Wolf's chief operating officer. ""We were kind of forced into that decision we had to keep our crew safe, and our cast safe. We had to stop filming, which was hugely, hugely disappointing for everybody, and extremely costly."" Natasha Hale outside Bad Wolf studios in Cardiff She said the company were able to furlough half of the 150 freelancers working on the show, but the other half were given their notice. ""It was a huge blow,"" she said. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales What do the latest lockdown rules mean? Why are we looking at the 'R number' in Wales? Bad Wolf is aiming to restart filming with series three of A Discovery of Witches in September, with health and safety being the top priority, but accommodating social distancing will not come cheap. However, the biggest concern for Bad Wolf and other independent companies is insurance to protect them from another lockdown. His Dark Materials, starring Ruth Wilson, was filmed inside the Welsh Government's headquarters in Cathays Park Ms Hale added: ""If we have to stop production or if we have to leave the production totally, there is no insurance and who is going to take responsibility for that? We don't know yet. ""I think really the government are going to have to do something because I'm not sure how productions are really going to get back on their feet without some kind of support on the lack of insurance."" Teledwyr Annibynnol Cymru (TAC), a body which represents independent television companies in Wales, said the extra cost of implementing safety procedures would fall on small, independent companies.

On the set of Pobol y Cwm, the BBC's longest-running TV soap, discussions are ongoing about how to return to filming. The series' producer, Nest Gwenllian Roberts, wants production to restart as quickly as restrictions allow, but accepts recreating the intimacy of drama will be challenging. ""A soap is births, deaths and marriages and we're still striving to achieve all that within the Covid restrictions and by keeping social distance,"" she said. Nest Gwenllian Roberts says distancing measures will make creating intimacy challenging A set of guidelines have been drawn up by broadcasters and Pact, the media trade association, in order to help production companies get back on set. These include keeping everyone two metres apart, cast members applying their own make-up, equipment being sanitised between uses and reducing the number of people on set. Mr Curtis said for some production companies, particularly in Wales, the cost of putting these measures in place may be prohibitive. ""It's an area that the [Welsh] government has already heavily invested in, but it does bring a huge amount of return to Wales. ""So, a relatively small amount of investment now will see return in the futureâ¦ I think that's the argument we have to make"", he said.

It has an annual turnover of more than Â£2.2bn and employs more than 56,000 people - an increase of 40% from 10 years ago. The Welsh Government said its Creative Wales unit had been working with the film and TV sector during these ""uncertain times"".

However, these numbers only include people who have been tested, and the total number of deaths relating to coronavirus is likely to be higher. The UK has the highest official death toll in Europe and the second highest in the world. However, the government and many experts say it is too soonto make international comparisons. Although daily deaths have decreased, the downwards trend appears to have stalled in recent days. The majority of the UK's deaths have been in England, with more than 35,000 so far - about 90% of the total for the UK. You can get more details and statistics by clicking here.

Students might have to stay in 'protective bubble'When university campuses open students might have to live and study in small groups to limit mixing.Family & Education,"Lectures might have to shift from lecture halls to online lessons Students might have to stay in a ""protective bubble"" of the same small group, when the UK's university campuses reopen in the autumn. University leaders suggested students would live and study with the same group to minimise mixing. They were setting out safety measures for a socially-distanced student life - including a virtual freshers' week. A survey suggested 71% of students would prefer to start the term later, if they got more in-person teaching. University campuses have been closed since the coronavirus lockdown, with teaching switching online, and their representative body, Universities UK has been setting out how they might bring students back for the autumn term. To prevent the risk of infection, the Universities UK briefing suggested students could be kept in small groups, sharing accommodation with people taking the same course, using the ""protective bubble"" approach used in primary schools in England. 'University will definitely not be the same' 'A very, very different university experience' Watchdog says students must be told how they will be taught Online students face full tuition fees Liz Barnes, vice-chancellor of Staffordshire University, said she had been discussing the idea of protective bubbles with other universities - with her university expecting to have eight people per bubble. By housing students in groups taking the same subjects, with timetables that bring them on campus at the same time, it would minimise contact with other students. ""The more that we can keep them into a small group of regular interaction the better in current circumstances,"" said Prof Barnes. Applicants to university have to be told how they will be taught Students could see others outside, but there would be controls on who could go inside accommodation. This would also assume that university accommodation would have a big reduction in capacity, so that social distancing could be possible and facilities such as kitchens and bathrooms could be safely shared. If lectures are delivered online, there would also be fewer people on campus. The first week of university life - or freshers' week - is where students get a chance to socialise together. But University of Nottingham vice-chancellor, Shearer West, said it might not be ""all singing, all dancing"" this year. This could be the case literally as well as metaphorically, if welcome events are online or restricted to small numbers. ""We're certainly planning to have people join things and get involved in societies, but we may just have to run freshers' fair in a different kind of way,"" said Prof West. These could be ""virtual events,"" said Universities UK president Julia Buckingham. But in a way that ""we can guarantee students have social interaction with one another"". Most likely a bit of both. The term being used is ""blended"", where students get a mix of online lectures and then in-person teaching for smaller groups. But individual students will want to know the balance for their chosen subject - how much will they be studying on campus and how much by distance learning? Will the freshers' week parties be online this year? Prof Buckingham, vice-chancellor of Brunel University, said she wanted to ""dispel the image"" that learning online was not the same quality. And even if courses are entirely online, Universities Minister Michelle Donelan has said universities in England can charge full tuition fees. According to a survey from the University and College Union, 71% of students would prefer to push back the start of term, if it meant they had more in-person and less online teaching. The survey of 516 people applying to university this year also found 23% were worried that their preferred university could go bust because of the coronavirus outbreak. Prof Buckingham suggested there would be flexibility for overseas students to start in January, if they were unable to travel for the autumn. Some students might want to defer a year entirely to get a better experience. But with the prospect of no travel, few jobs and a socially-distanced social life, it's also been described as being the world's worst gap year. ""Students need clarity as to what they can expect from the next academic year in order for them to make informed choices,"" says the National Union of Students. The deadline for making a firm choice of university is 18 June - and the higher education watchdog, the Office for Students, says applicants have to be told with ""absolute clarity"" how they will be taught. And if a university subsequently changes what it offers then students should be released from their choices. While the guidance from Universities UK sets out ideas and broad principles, students will want to know about their individual options. Will accommodation be available? How many hours of in-person teaching will there be? What campus facilities will be open? Will freshers' week be a laptop in their bedroom? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

""The reality is that 76% of Covid-19 deaths in the UK have been aged over 75 with most of those entirely avoidable - and that's a tragedy,"" says Linda Bauld, Professor of Public Health at the University of Edinburgh. ""But the risk for young people is minimal and I think we need to recognise that. ""Social distancing is something we all need to try and maintain because we don't want more preventable cases rising in the future. ""But we have to balance the need to restart society - to not seriously disadvantage the young in the longer term. I'd like to see a gradual, phased approach, but try to get education and the economy up and running as quickly and as competently as we can."" Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland Outdoor nurseries and childminders have today been able to get back to work. But one nursery owner has warned safety restrictions in place will make businesses not viable without financial support to cover the shortfall. Zoey Sills, who runs the Earthtime Forest Nursery in Elgin, said normal worker ratios require two staff for up to 16 children. With group sizes limited to eight, this essentially doubles staff costs, she said. She urged government to trust nurseries to make safety decisions, because the outdoor setting and the fact nurseries already care for small groups means they are well equipped on safety. Scottish Childminding Association lead Graeme McAlister said there has been an increase in demand for services in recent weeks. He said childminders were now focused on five key safety points: enhanced hygiene, keeping groups small, minimising contact between different groups, utilising outdoor space and physical distancing between adults when they come to collect children. Scotland's transport secretary says there was a significant rise in traffic last weekend. Data shows car traffic levels rose by 70% over the weekend, and by 110% on some tourist routes. Traffic at cross-border sites was also up by 35% These volumes go beyond what would be expected to be generated by local residents.

Dr Macaskill believes rapid reporting systems and provision of PPE were handled well but says overall social care was not sufficiently prioritised.

Google in $5bn lawsuit for tracking in 'private' mode,"Google has been sued in the US over claims it illegally invades the privacy of users by tracking people even when they are browsing in ""private mode"". The class action wants at least $5bn (Â£4bn) from Google and owner Alphabet. Many internet users assume their search history isn't being tracked when they view in private mode, but Google says this isn't the case. The search engine denies this is illegal and says it is upfront about the data it collects in this mode. The proposed class action likely includes ""millions"" of Google users who since 1 June 2016 browsed the internet in private mode according to law firm Boies Schiller Flexner who filed the claim on Tuesday in federal court in San Jose, California. US challenges 'unfair' tech taxes in the UK and EU Indian app hunts out Chinese software on phones Senator tells MPs Huawei puts US troops at risk Incognito mode within Google's Chrome browser gives users the choice to search the internet without their activity being saved to the browser or device. But the websites visited can use tools such as Google Analytics to track usage. The complaint says that Google ""cannot continue to engage in the covert and unauthorized data collection from virtually every American with a computer or phone"". Vigorously denying the claims Google spokesman Jose Castaneda said: ""As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity"". The search engine says the collection of search history, even in private viewing mode, helps site owners ""better evaluate the performance of their content, products, marketing and more."" While private browsing has been available from Google for some time, Boies Schiller Flexner said it recently decided to represent three plaintiffs based in the US. ""People everywhere are becoming more aware (and concerned) that their personal communications are being intercepted, collected, recorded, or exploited for gain by technology companies they have come to depend on,"" it said in the filing.

Separating protest fact from fiction online,"Protests sparked by the death in police custody of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis have spread across the US and to other countries. They've been documented in videos, images and posts on social media. But some of these aren't what they claim to be. The BBC's anti-disinformation team has been tracking misleading videos and conspiracy theories about the protests, which have been circulating online. So, here's what to look out for - and avoid - on your social media feeds. Rumours that the protests have been set up with potential projectiles handed out to agitators have gained traction, with thousands of posts referencing ""bricks"" on social media. Several videos that show piles of bricks along with claims that they were planted by police or the government have been watched by millions of people. Other posts pin the blame on Antifa - the left-wing group President Trump has accused of promoting the disturbances. However, there's no evidence so far to suggest foul play, nor that the protests have been somehow pre-planned. Most of the videos and images we've seen don't look particularly suspicious - it's not uncommon to see piles of bricks near building sites. Responding to a video suggesting bricks had been deliberately placed to escalate protests,San Francisco police said on Twitter,external""pallets are affiliated with a construction site and (we) have contacted the contractor to have them removed."" One police department in Boston hit back at misleading claims about a viral video of its officers unloading bricks from a van. Suggestions had been made on social media that the officers were unloading bricks from a vehicle ""to use them as an excuse"" against protesters. However, Boston's Northeastern University Police Department has tweeted that the officers had collected them ""from a damaged brick sidewalk,external"" and taken them back to the station as they were posing a safety hazard to pedestrians. Another viral video from Fayetteville, North Carolina that has racked up over a million views shows a pile of bricks in the vicinity of protests as a man says there is ""no construction"" site in the area. We've been able to geolocate the video and found images from 24 May with the same pile of bricks in the same place, long before any protests took place. In other cases, old images of piles of bricks have been re-shared of previous demonstrations elsewhere, such as from the protests in Hong Kong last year. We've seen lots of examples of old video surfacing in recent days. Among many genuine videos of brutal arrests, one that went viral yesterday was not what it seemed. The dramatic video shows a man being arrested then released by police once they'd checked his ID. A post claiming the man in the video is an ""FBI agent"" has been viewed over 4 million times on Twitter. This claim was repeated on Facebook and Instagram by others sharing the video, where it racked up millions more views. In response, Rochester Minnesota Police Department put outa statement,externalclarifying that the man is not a Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) agent. The incident took place in June last year, when he was mistaken for a wanted man. The original post of the video on Instagram includes a caption which stated the video was from the year before, and contains no mention of the FBI. A video of a teenager being violently arrested by a US police officer has generated almost 10 million views in the last few days. But the incident happened back in April - in Rancho Cordova, a city in Northern California. This wasn't made clear in the latest post that has been retweeted more than 100,000 times. It also wrongly identifies the teenager as female. The clip attracted widespread criticism at the time. Meanwhile, there is footage from the current protests which has led to allegations of police brutality. Video from the US shows police using batons and tear gas on protesters and journalists seemingly unprovoked. The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life In pictures: Protests turn violent Why has a US city gone up in flames? This video claims to show a US police building on fire and was posted on 28 May. It's not only old - it's from 2015 - it was filmed in another country. It shows an explosion in theChinese city of Tianjin. So, why are people sharing old videos? ""The videos may be compounding the anger they are feeling and could be driven by attempts to sow division or get clicks,"" says Marianna Spring, BBC Specialist Disinformation and Social Media reporter. Speculation about who's behind the protests have been circulating online. Some claims are unsubstantiated, others totally false. First up, posts that have gone viral about George Soros. Some influential right-wing figures have made unfounded claims that the Hungarian-American billionaire is ""funding"" the demonstrations. Supporters of QAnon - a conspiracy theory about a ""deep state"" secret coup against Donald Trump - have shared similar claims. More than a million posts and memes online have repeated allegations about Mr Soros paying agitators. Mr Soros, whose Open Society Foundations provide financial support to a number of civil society groups and progressive projects around the world,has been a bogeyman of some on the right for a long time. His organisation has responded to the latest posts, tweeting that ""Mr. Soros and the Open Society Foundations oppose all violence and do not pay people to protest"". Claims have circulated online about Russia's involvement in the protests. Viral tweets with thousands of shares suggest that Russia was involved in George Floyd's death - as part of a military operation or an elaborate plot. There is no evidence to support these claims. This isn't to rule out the idea that Russia or other countries - either through state media outlets or networks of fake accounts - could be involved in stoking tensions online. Investigations into Russian interference during the 2016 US Presidential election revealed thatRussia was involved in a misinformation campaign, infiltrating groups and pages run by US activists - and that included Black Lives Matter groups.

Zoom sees sales boom amid pandemicThe pandemic has opened up new opportunities for the video conference company.,"Zoom has become the app many are using to stay in touch with friends, family and work colleagues When it comes to its growth rate, video conference company Zoom has lived up to its name. Use of the firm's software jumped 30-fold in April, as the coronavirus pandemic forced millions to work, learn and socialise remotely. At its peak, the firm counted more than 300 million daily participants in virtual meetings, while paying customers have more than tripled. The dramatic uptake has the potential to change the firm's path. Zoom said it expects sales as high as $1.8bn (Â£1.4bn) this year - roughly double what it forecast in March. ""It's a huge opportunity,"" chief executive Eric Yuan told investors on Tuesday. Mr Yuan didn't intend to create Zoom for the masses. Zoom has made Eric Yuan, whose visa application to the US was denied eight times, a billionaire A Chinese-born software engineer, Mr Yuan started the company in 2011, after years rising through the ranks at WebEx, one of the first US video conference companies, which was purchased by Cisco in 2007 for $3.2bn. At the time, he faced doubts from many investors, who did not see the need for another option in a market already dominated by big players such as Microsoft and Cisco. But Mr Yuan - who has credited his interest in video conferencing to the long distances he had to travel to meet up with his now-wife in their youth - was frustrated at Cisco and believed there was demand in the business world for software that would work on mobile phones and be easier to use. Zoom under increased scrutiny as popularity soars Racist zoombombing at virtual synagogue Zoom is in all our living rooms but is it safe? When the firm sold its first shares to the public last year, it was valued at $15.9bn. That shot to more than $58bn on Tuesday. ""What Zoom has done is kind of democratised video conferencing for all kinds of businesses and made it very simple for everyone from yoga instructors through to board room executives to deploy video,"" says Alex Smith, senior director at Canalys. When the lockdowns started, Zoom lifted the limits for the free version of its software in China and for educators in many countries, including the UK, helping to drive its popularity. But the firm's bread and butter customers are corporate clients, who pay for subscriptions and enhanced features. Zoom said on Tuesday that sales jumped 169% year-on-year in the three months to 30 April to $328.2m, as it added more than 180,000 customers with more than 10 employees since January - far more than it had expected. It also turned a profit of $27m in the quarter - more than it made in all of the prior financial year. The massive uptake has also strained the firm, forcing it to invest to expand capacity to meet the needs of new users, many of whom are not paying customers. Its reputation also took a hit, as the new attention prompted hackers to hijack meetings and exposed a host of security flaws, revealing that the firm had sent user data to Facebook, had wrongly claimed the app had end-to-end encryption, and was allowing meeting hosts to track attendees. It has also faced political scrutiny for its ties to China - where it has more than 700 staff, including most of its product development team - which have prompted warnings that it is not fit for government use. In April, Mr Yuan, who is a US citizen, apologised for the security lapses and the firm started rolling out a number of changes intended to fix the problems. Zoom has also announced a number of new appointments familiar with Washington politics, including H R McMaster, a retired Army general and former national security adviser to Donald Trump. ""Navigating this process has been a humbling learning experience,"" Mr Yuan said on an investor call on Tuesday. Analysts said they expected the company would overcome these reputational blows. ""It's had that mishap and the fact that its name is still very much used as verbatim with video technology still gives it a lot of momentum and opportunity to continue,"" Mr Smith said. Analysts say they expect Zoom to maintain its focus on business customers, since that's how it makes money. But the pandemic is likely to create more challenges for Zoom in that market, as increased demand for remote work prompts competitors such as Microsoft and Cisco to pour resources into the field. ""The stakes are higher and the competition's getting tougher, so we'll see,"" says Ryan Koontz, managing director at Rosenblatt Securities. ""They were on a very strong trajectory before... and happened to be in the right place at the right time as the whole world decided we needed to communicate well on video,"" he says. ""They have this amazing brand... now they have to leverage that brand and figure out which markets they're going to go after.""

"UK holidaymakers âwelcomeâ in PortugalPortugal's foreign minister told the BBC that an ""air bridge"" agreement could be in place soon.Business","Portugal's foreign minister has said anyone in the UK thinking of going to Portugal this summer will be ""most welcome"" amid coronavirus. Augusto Santos Silva said he hoped an air bridge between the UK and Portugal could be secured by the end of June. The UK is set to give more details of its plan to force arrivals into quarantine for 14 days later. UK Home Secretary Priti Patel will say air bridges to countries with low virus infection rates are possible in future. This would mean that people arriving from certain places will not have to self-isolate. However, that will only apply to countries with low Covid-19 infection rates, she is expected to tell MPs. She will also say that the planned quarantine for arrivals is necessary ""to prevent a second wave of the virus"". Meanwhile, Heathrow boss John Holland-Kaye has told BBC Breakfast that travellers will have to fill out details of where they will be staying to quarantine, when they book their flight. He said there will then be ""spot checks"" within the immigration area, where the Border Force officers will check if people have filled out their form. ""All of the form-filling will take place before you get on a plane, and will be done online. The government will be able to check information before people get onto a plane,"" he said. Some countries have already started to ease travel restrictions.  The German foreign minister Heiko Maas said the country would lift a travel ban for EU countries, as well as the UK and a handful of others - as long as they do not have large-scale lockdowns in place. However, Germany will advise against travel to Britain for as long as the UK government demands a 14-day quarantine for new arrivals. Portugal's Mr Santos Silva told the BBC that an agreement between the UK and Portugal could be in place by the end of June, meaning that holidaymakers returning to the UK from Portugal would escape the quarantine rules. He said any travel quarantine ""was an enemy of tourism"", but that he respected the UK government's decision to enforce one on almost all arrivals to the UK from next Monday. Mr Santos Silva said ""rules"" would ensure that people would be able to holiday safely. The minister suggested that nightlife in Portuguese resorts this summer would be very limited and people would not be allowed to congregate in groups at night. He said hotels and apartments which comply with standards set by the tourism board would be labelled as ""clean and safe"". What are the UK travel quarantine rules? No early return for UK tourists, says Spain UK must agree 'air bridges', warn business groups Portugal's foreign minister confirmed talks on the matter were continuing with the UK. But he insisted that Portugal would not impose any type of quarantine for people arriving in his country. Instead, he said Portugal would rely on temperature checks at airports and that Portugal was, in coordination with other EU countries, considering carrying out ""random testing"" on passengers. Mr Santos Silva said tourists would be warned how full beaches are, so that they could avoid crowded spots. UK aviation bosses hope that a large number of air bridge agreements will be in place by 29 June, when the travel quarantine is set to be reviewed. More tourists from the UK head to the Algarve each summer than from any other country. But Spain, another country whose tourism sector relies heavily on British holidaymakers, is taking a different approach. The Spanish government has saidit will only allow UK tourists in this summer if the infection rate in the UK falls more significantly. The UK travel quarantine will apply to people arriving from any country, apart from the Republic of Ireland, and will also apply to UK nationals. People will be required to self-isolate in a private residence for two weeks. The government says people ""could be contacted regularly during this period to ensure compliance"". People who break the rules could be fined Â£1,000. UK travel companies say the travel quarantine already means people are not booking holidays. They warn that more businesses in the sector now face financial ruin. The measure will be reviewed every three weeks. When deciding whether to keep the quarantine in place, the government will consider several factors. They include: the rate of infection internationally prevention measures in other countries the extent to which other countries with more relaxed border arrangements have seen imported cases the effectiveness of testing methods at minimising the risk of new cases of the virus entering the country. A growing list of Conservative MPs have spoken out against the blanket travel quarantine. However, a YouGov poll of 1,565 adults in Great Britain suggests that there is public support. 63% of those surveyed thought people should be quarantined as per the government's plan. About one quarter thought that the quarantine should only apply to people arriving from countries with a ""high number of coronavirus cases"". Only 4% thought that there should be no quarantine at all. Labour has questioned why a travel quarantine was not introduced some weeks ago. New figures show that between the beginning of January and the end of April, 14,225 flights arrived into UK airports. LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?
