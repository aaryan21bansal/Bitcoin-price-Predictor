Free Covid tests for those who cannot work at home,"Rapid lateral flow test kits can give a result on Covid-19 in about 30 minutes Anyone who cannot work from home in Wales will be able to get free rapid Covid home testing kits, the Welsh government said. The lateral flow tests will be available to be picked up from local Covid-19 test sites from Friday. Officials said they were also looking at making other locations available to collect self-test kits, as well as posting them out to individual homes. Testing in schools will also be extended for all pupils from Year 7. WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage The Welsh government said the latest measures were a step forward in the fight against the virus, especially for those unable to carry out their jobs at home. ""It is hoped that improving the availability of lateral flow tests will make regular asymptomatic testing for coronavirus more convenient and accessible for people not covered under existing schemes at workplaces, childcare settings, schools, colleges and universities,"" an official said. It follows an announcement by the UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier this month thattwo lateral flow kits a week would be offered to everyone in England. How to do a home lateral flow test What is a lateral flow test - and how do they work? Q&A: How do I get a lateral flow test in Wales? At each testing site people will be able to collect the rapid lateral flow tests between 08:00 and 13:00. They will not need to make an appointment before collection. The sites will close for a deep clean and reopen for symptomatic PCR testing between 14:00 and 20:00 each day. Each person will routinely be able to collect two packs of seven lateral flow self-test kits for home use. It is recommended tests are undertaken twice a week with the results recorded on the UK government portal. The tests take about 30 minutes to give a result. In addition to the new testing kits for workers in Wales, the Welsh government said it was extending rapid testing to all secondary school pupils from Monday. At the moment, only those in Year 10 and above, as well as staff, are eligible for two free lateral tests a week. The tests remain voluntary and will be taken at home, with results registered online. Health Minister Vaughan Gething said it was important testing was made ""as convenient and accessible as possible"". ""We are especially keen for self-test kits to be used by people who cannot work from home so they can undertake regular testing,"" he said. ""This will help to keep them and their families safe. ""We know that up to one in three people who have coronavirus have no symptoms at all and can therefore spread it unknowingly. As we continue to ease restrictions, the routine testing of asymptomatic people will be imperative in our battle against the virus."" A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said: ""The wider rollout of fast turnaround lateral flow tests, whilst a positive step, has to work in tandem with financial support for those self-isolating. ""The Covid-19 Rapid Survey of Adherence to Interventions and Responses study found that only 52% in the UK have self-isolated when required. ""Plaid Cymru have called on both the Welsh and UK government to increase the level of support provided through the self-isolation grant and Statutory Sick Pay alongside designated self-isolation facilities to increase levels of self-isolation following a positive test."" Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds said the free tests were a ""welcome development"" for those working in shops, restaurants and schools and would ""help us safely reopen our country and economy"". ""These tests will help keep key workers safe and reassure the public in the process. I would encourage everyone who qualifies to take up this offer,"" she said. A Welsh Conservative spokesperson said: ""We must explore all avenues to get the Welsh economy on the road to recovery, and we are pleased Labour ministers have followed the action taken by the UK Conservative government and increased the scope for testing. ""Welsh Conservatives have a comprehensive and cautious roadmap out of lockdown and our priority is delivering our economic plan to ensure Welsh employees and businesses can recover from the difficulties of the past 12 months.""

Liverpool knocked out of Champions League by Real Madrid,"Liverpool are sixth in the Premier League, three points off the top four Liverpool's Champions League campaign ended in disappointment as Real Madrid set up a semi-final meeting with Chelsea by keeping Jurgen Klopp's side at bay in a goalless draw at Anfield. Real arrived at Anfield protecting a 3-1 lead from the first leg and while they eventually went through in relative comfort Liverpool will curse themselves for missing several glorious first-half chances. Mohamed Salah shot straight at Real keeper Thibaut Courtois, who also saved well from James Milner, in the opening moments and shot over when he should have hit the target while Georginio Wijnaldum was also guilty of squandering an opportunity to at least apply pressure to Zinedine Zidane's side. Real's best chance saw Benzema drive in a shot that was deflected on to the post, while Courtois was in action again to block Roberto Firmino's angled shot after the break. Liverpool ran out of steam and ideas as the second half wore on, and Real defended with defiance and resilience to seal the win and set up a meeting with another Premier League side in Thomas Tuchel's Chelsea. Best action and reaction from Liverpool v Real Madrid in the Champions League Listen to BBC Radio 5 Live's Football Daily podcast Liverpool were always fighting the odds as they trailed from the first leg but Klopp knew an early goal would have revived memories of previous Anfield comebacks in Europe - albeit they were in front of full houses rather than a deserted stadium. And Liverpool have only themselves to blame because they certainly created those chances in the first half, the surprise being it was the normally reliable Salah who was guilty of two bad misses that could have rattled Real's nerves. Around 400 home fans gathered outside in an attempt to fashion some of the old atmosphere but sadly the only impact they made was to create more negative headlines with adisgraceful attack on the Real Madrid team coachthat left the bus damaged. The Spanish giants received an apology from their opponents and Merseyside Police announced an investigation to find those responsible. Mohamed Salah's early miss was among multiple chances Liverpool were unable to take Liverpool gave it everything for the 90 minutes but it was the lack of cutting edge that has characterised so many of their Anfield displays this season that removed any hopes they had of turning this tie around and proved their undoing. As time went on, Real grew more confident and comfortable, and the introduction of the likes of Diogo Jota and Thiago Alcantara, who was disappointing, could not shift the tie the hosts' way. Klopp and his players must now lift themselves to chase a place in the Premier League's top four to ensure they return to this competition next season. This video can not be played It's clear we lost the quarter-final tie in Madrid - Klopp The latest incarnation of Real Madrid under Zinedine Zidane is hardly a vintage version. Indeed for large portions of this Champions League quarter-final second leg they were careless and scrappy. However, they got the job done over two legs by showing their quality and threat at home then discipline and organisation at Anfield. And this is the warning Chelsea must heed in the last four. Real do not resemble their great predecessors but they still managed to overcome Liverpool - an injury-hit Liverpool it must be said - despite missing the twin defensive rocks Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane, who they will hope to have back against Chelsea. And as Liverpool became increasingly desperate, so Real's street-wisdom came to the fore to ensure a low-key and comfortable last 20 minutes with barely any serious alarms. Chelsea will be well aware of the class of their former keeper Courtois, who excelled here, the enduring quality of Luka Modric and the battle-hardened, relentless striking ability of veteran Karim Benzema. Thomas Tuchel has no reason to fear Real but they will command his full respect and Zidane's trademark has been finding a way to win the Champions League. Liverpool are winless in their past five games against Real Madrid in the Champions League (D1 L4). Real Madrid have qualified for the semi-finals of the European Cup/Champions League for the 30th time, at least 10 more than any other team. This was Liverpool's ninth two-legged knockout tie in the Champions League under Jurgen Klopp, and only the second time they have failed to win either game in the tie (also versus Atletico Madrid in the last 16 in 2019-20). Real Madrid have progressed from 11 of their 12 two-legged knockout ties in the Champions League under Zinedine Zidane, with their only elimination coming against Manchester City in last season's last 16. Liverpool have only won one of their past 11 games against Spanish opponents in the Champions League (D3 L7). This was Real Madrid's first goalless draw in a Champions League game since April 2016, when they drew 0-0 against Manchester City in the semi-final first leg. Liverpool attempted 13 shots from inside the box against Real Madrid - their most in a Champions League game at Anfield without scoring since March 2006 v Benfica (20). Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp talking to BT Sport:""You always need the key moments. We didn't lose the tie tonight, we lost in Madrid. It was uncomfortable for Madrid. We were good, aggressive, had chances. We didn't score and then the experience of Real Madrid played the tie down. That is ourselves this year with the finishing. ""We know how often Mo Salah finishes these things with closed eyes. Not here. Tonight it was absolutely OK, but we are out. ""We love this competition and for other reasons it is very important we are back in it. We can now concentrate on the Premier League and we will. We have to work our socks off."" Real Madrid boss Zinedine Zidane:""We were up against it and we knew we had to suffer tonight, but in the end we got what we wanted, which was to go through. I think we handled the game well, we rode the storm and can be proud of our display. ""We knew they'd start fast and they were really good in the opening 15 minutes, but that's normal. In the quarter-finals of the Champions League you have to dig in and we did that and got through.""

Office manager begged terrorist not to stab her,"Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were killed during a conference on rehabilitating offenders A charity office manager has described being repeatedly stabbed during the terror attack at Fishmongers' Hall. Isobel Rowbotham told the inquest jury that she pleaded with convicted terrorist Usman Khan as he approached her on 29 November, 2019. She had just seen Jack Merritt moments after he had been fatally wounded by Khan in the toilets. ""He was shouting that he'd been stabbed,"" she told the inquest at London's Guildhall. ""He was holding his stomach. Obviously he'd been injured. There was a lot of blood."" Ms Rowbotham described Khan as moving towards her ""quite fast"" and ""purposively"". She said: ""I was obviously saying 'no Usman, please.' It was quite obvious he wasn't going to stop."" Charity office manager Isobel Rowbotham pleaded with Usman Khan not to attack her as he approached with two knives Ms Rowbotham said she hunched down to try to protect herself but was stabbed multiple times. ""It felt more like punches, I guess,"" she continued. ""His final stabs were in my neck. ""It felt like he thought they were the final stabs, as if they were intended to finish me."" The court heard she lay on the floor and ""decided to play dead in case he came back again...I tried to slow down my breathing."" Usman Khan (left) sat at the same table as Saskia Jones (right) Ms Rowbotham said she wanted to call the police on her mobile but ""there was too much blood to press the screen."" Saskia Jones, 23, and 25-year-old Mr Merritt both died after being stabbed by Khan at the prisoner rehabilitation conference being held in Fishmongers' Hall. The inquest also heard that Mr Merritt had rebooked a rail ticket for his killer after Khan's train to London was cancelled. Simon Larmour, a Learning Together research associate, said he received a panicked phone call from Khan on the day of the attack saying his train from Stafford had been cancelled. Jurors heard that one of Khan's knives had a crudely etched Arabic symbol for Allah on it The court previously heard that during the journey, Khan strapped a fake suicide bomb to his waist whilst in the train toilet. Khan was met at Euston station by Mr Larmour and John Crilly - who would later help with attempts to subdue Khan on London Bridge. ""I saw Usman coming towards Issy (Isobel Rowbotham) and me with two knives,"" Mr Lamour said. ""He was yelling but I didn't really understand what he was saying."" Jurors were told that Mr Merritt had had some professional dealings with Khan before the Learning Together event Mr Larmour said he leapt over the table and ran to the reception area where he gave first aid to Mr Merritt. ""I couldn't see all the places he had been stabbed. I was stunned at that point. I tried to find the nearest material I could to put pressure on the wounds. ""He passed out quite quickly. He was moaning a little bit. His eyes were glazed over. He was pale."" The inquest also heard from retired judge John Samuels, who saw Ms Jones lying at the foot of a staircase with a ""chalk-white"" face. He was attending the conference, having previously run a training course for prisoner rehabilitation organisation Learning Together in 2018 He told the inquest how he was on the balcony of the building's grand entrance hall as the attack unfolded. ''I heard shouts and screams coming from downstairs and I could not understand what was happening,"" he said. ""The first sounds were male shouts, the shouts were angry and confused."" Fishmongers' Hall, below London Bridge Mr Samuels described how he then saw Ms Jones lying on the floor. ""I noted particularly her face was chalk-white, she appeared unconscious to me or perhaps even dead,"" he said. Terror offender monitoring rules lawful 'I quickly realised something bad had happened' Terror attack victim's life 'was a triumph' Mr Samuels then saw one of the organisers of the event, Dr Amy Ludlow, shouting ''police, ambulance, now'' into her mobile phone. Having been told to evacuate, Mr Samuels said he then heard an ''authoritative voice'' outside saying that there was a bomb and he should find shelter. Usman Khan was jailed in 2012 over a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange Mr Samuels said he now assumed the voice had been that of a police officer. The inquest is scheduled to last nine weeks and is expected to be followed by a separate jury inquest into the death of Khan.

"Asda to axe 1,200 bakers as shoppers shun loavesThe supermarket giant says customers have swapped traditional loaves for speciality breads and wraps.","Asda is to axe up to 1,200 jobs at its in-store bakeries as customers shun the traditional loaf in favour of speciality breads, bagels and pancakes. The chain currently employs bakers who make bread in store from scratch. But now it has said it plans to move to a central bakery and deliver pre-baked breads to its supermarkets. ""The current in-store bakery model has restricted our ability to respond to changing customer demands,"" said Derek Lawlor, Asda's head of merchandising. As a result, he said, the supermarket chain had not been able to offer shoppers ""speciality products and freshly baked goods they want to buy throughout the day"". Asda considering up to 2,500 job cuts Asda workers win key appeal in equal pay fight Asda said the change would mean it was able to bake fresh products several times a day, rather than once a day in store. It will begin a formal consultation with its bakers and bakery managers. ""If the proposals are enacted, the priority will be to move as many colleagues as possible into alternative roles within Asda, with redundancy the last option,"" the supermarket chain said in a statement. The move by Asda follows a similar decision by Tesco last year. Up to 1,800 were faced with the prospect of redundancy when Tesco said it would do less baking in store, citing a similar shift away from traditional loaves and bread. Until last year, Asda was owned by US supermarket giant Walmart, but in December,it was soldto billionaire brothers Mohsin and Zuber Issa, who bought it for Â£6.8bn. However, the decision to scrap in-store bread ovens was taken independently of the Issa brothers, who are not allowed to exercise influence over the chain until the deal has been examined by the Competition and Markets Authority.

UK confirms 'drawdown' of Afghan troops,"The UK is to ""drawdown"" the number of troops in Afghanistan from next month, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said. Confirming the planned departure of forces, Mr Wallace also warned any attacks on existing troops would be ""met with a forceful response"". The UK military has been in Afghanistan since 2001, with more than 450 British troops dying during the conflict with the Taliban and fighters from al-Qaeda. The US has said it will withdraw all forces by 11 September. And Nato confirmed allies would begin withdrawing troops from 1 May. The last UK combat troops left in 2014, but about 750 remain as part of the Nato mission to train Afghan forces. In a statement, Mr Wallace said: ""The people of Afghanistan deserve a peaceful and stable future. ""As we drawdown, the security of our people currently serving in Afghanistan remains our priority and we have been clear that attacks on Allied troops will be met with a forceful response. ""The British public and our Armed Forces community, both serving and veterans, will have lasting memories of our time in Afghanistan. ""Most importantly we must remember those who paid the ultimate sacrifice, who will never be forgotten."" US troops to leave Afghanistan by 11 September Timeline: UK troops in Afghanistan Afghans face pivotal moment as US 'closes the book' US President Joe Biden has announced that American troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September,saying it was ""time to end America's longest war"". That would coincide with the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the US in 2001. Mr Biden said while the US ""will not stay involved in Afghanistan militarily"", its ""diplomatic and humanitarian work"" would continue. ""We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create the ideal conditions for our withdrawal, expecting a different result,"" he said. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, speaking to Nato allies in Brussels, said: ""I am here to work closely with our allies, with the (Nato) secretary general, on the principle that we have established from the start: In together, adapt together and out together."" He added that they would work closely in the coming months ""on a safe, deliberate and co-ordinated withdrawal of our forces from Afghanistan"". The new deadline is four months later than the Trump administration previously agreed in a deal with the Taliban. Our defence correspondent Jonathan Beale says the UK, like most Nato allies, relies on the US's infrastructure, logistics and support in Afghanistan. The US has some 2,500 troops in the country as part of a 9,600-strong Nato mission. At the height of the war, Nato had more than 130,000 troops from 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had 9,500 personnel and 137 bases in Helmand province alone. US troops training the Afghan security forces in Helmand The speaker of the Afghan parliament, Mir Rahman Rahmani, has warned the withdrawal of foreign forces in the current circumstances will lead to civil war. In February 2020,the US and the Taliban agreed a dealthat would see the US and Nato allies withdraw all troops within 14 months if the Taliban upheld its promises, including not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks. The Afghan war: The short and long story Who are the Taliban? A year of violence on the road to peace Although the group stopped attacks on international forces as part of the agreement, it has continued to fight the Afghan government. Last month, the Taliban threatened to resume hostilities against foreign troops still in the country on 1 May. Why are more troops going to Afghanistan?

Disgraced financier Bernie Madoff dies in prisonBernie Madoff admitted he had conned investors out of billions of dollars in a Ponzi scheme.Business,"Bernie Madoff, a Wall Street financier disgraced after he admitted to one of the biggest frauds in US financial history, has died in prison at age 82. His death was announced by the Bureau of Prisons. Mr Madoff had been serving a 150-year sentence after he pleaded guilty in 2009 to running a Ponzi scheme, which paid investors with money from new clients rather than actual profits. It collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis. ""Bernie, up until his death, lived with guilt and remorse for his crimes,"" his lawyer Brandon Sample said in a statement. ""Although the crimes Bernie was convicted of have come to define who he was - he was also a father and a husband. He was soft spoken and an intellectual. Bernie was by no means perfect. But no man is."" Mr Madoff,the son of European immigrants who grew up in New York,set up his eponymous firm Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities in 1960. The company became one of the largest market-makers - matching buyers and sellers of stocks - and Mr Madoff served as chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange. The firm was investigated eight times by the US Securities and Exchange Commission because it made exceptional returns. But it was the global recession which effectively prompted Mr Madoff's demise as investors, hit by the downturn, tried to withdraw about $7bn from his funds and he could not find the money to cover it. Victims of Mr Madoff's fraud included celebrities and everyday people He confessed the problem to his sons, who went to the authorities. The list of those scammed included actor Kevin Bacon, Hall of Fame baseball player Sandy Koufax and film director Steven Spielberg's charitable foundation, Wunderkinder. UK banks were also among those who lost money, with HSBC Holdings saying it had exposure of around $1bn. Other corporate victims were Royal Bank of Scotland and Man Group and Japan's Nomura Holdings. But it was not just the elite and large firms who were victims of the fraud. School teachers, farmers, mechanics and many others also lost money. ""We thought he was God. We trusted everything in his hands,"" Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, whose foundation lost $15.2 million, said in 2009. In court, Mr Madoff said that when he started the scheme in the 1990s, he hoped it would only be for a limited time. ""I cannot adequately express how sorry I am for what I have done,"" he said in March 2009, when he pleaded guilty. ""I realised that my arrest and this day would inevitably come."" The scam involved an estimated $65bn, a figure that included gains Mr Madoff's clients believed they had made due to fake account statements. Of the more than $17bn in cash losses, more than $14bn has been recovered. Last year, Mr Madoff requested early release from prison citing health problems, including kidney disease. In an interview with The Washington Post he said he had ""made a terrible mistake."" ""I'm terminally ill,"" he said. ""There's no cure for my type of disease. So, you know, I've served. I've served 11 years already, and, quite frankly, I've suffered through it."" Judge Denny Chin denied Mr Madoff's request, noting many victims were still suffering due to their financial losses. ""I also believe that Mr. Madoff was never truly remorseful, and that he was only sorry that his life as he knew it was collapsing around him,"" he wrote. At least two investors with Mr Madoff took their own lives after their losses. His son Mark also killed himself on the second anniversary of his father's arrest. His other son, Andrew, died of cancer in 2014. Mr Madoff is survived by his wife, Ruth Madoff, who maintained she was unaware of the scheme and was never charged. Prosecutors let her keep $2.5m from the the $825m fortune the couple once possessed.

Ellie, from Bourne in Lincolnshire, works at weekends at Yew Tree Residential Care Home, making drinks and playing games with residents. Despite only being 16, her part-time job at the home means she was eligible. When offered the jab, she said it was important to take it to help protect the care home residents from the virus. The teenager, who is studying for her GCSEs, also helps look after her grandma, who lives with the family and is vulnerable due to a health condition. ""Being protected just helps me feel a lot safer around everyone,"" Ellie says. ""I don't have to worry about going into school, picking it up, and bringing it back home.""

But a shocking aspect of Covid-19 in Brazil is the number of babies dying. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 1,300 babies under the age of one have died from the virus. With exclusive access to one childrenâs ICU in the northeast of the country, BBC Brazilâs Nathalia Passarinho speaks to staff about caring for these critically ill children. Vaccinations are ""successful"" at reducing hospital admissions, the head of the NHS in England says. Sir Simon Stevens has been speaking as a new study shows a 75% reduced risk of emergency hospital admission among people who have received the Pfizer vaccine. The study by the NHS and the University of Manchester has found older people who have received the jab are less likely to be admitted to hospital, and less likely to have a positive test, compared with those who have not been vaccinated. Researchers examined data on more than 170,000 people aged 80 to 83 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine between 15 and 20 December last year. They compared this information with ""matched controls"" aged 76 to 79 who had not yet received the jab. Sir Simon says: ""Vaccines are successfully reducing hospitalisations and deaths amongst the cohorts that have had the vaccine. ""Data that we have analysed shows a 75% reduction in emergency Covid hospitalisations for the vaccination cohorts and, as more and more people are vaccinated, that effect will widen."" Residents in some areas of Smethwick in the West Midlands are being urged to get tested for coronavirus after a case of the South Africa variant was detected. It comes as the ""largest surge testing operation to date"" is being carried out in London after cases were identified there. Sandwell Council haspublished a list of postcodes,externalin Smethwick and Cape Hill where people should get tested. The authority is urging all residents in those areas to get tested, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated. Read more here.

""I've written a lot of songs and finished records,"" he tellsBBC 6 Music's Matt Everitt. ""Obviously, it's not as good as being together in the same room with a group of musicians. I mean, there's really no substitute for that. ""But one of the things that kept me going through the lockdown [has been] being able to play music and set up little studios, wherever."" He says he feels lucky to have ""a couple of places"" and a ""nice garden"". ""I'm very lucky. I don't have the problems of living, say in a small flat in London or New York, which some of my friends have had,"" Sir Mick tells the radio host. ""Two kids in a two room flat in Manhattan? I honestly don't know how I would have done that."" Read more here.  A couple have been reunited in a care home after medical treatment meant they had to spend months apart. Gordon and Mary Davis, both 89, had been separated after he fell ill, but when a room became available at Baily House Care Home in Mansfield they were finally brought back together.

Prince Philip,who died on Friday aged 99, will be remembered in a service at St George's Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle on Saturday. Members of the public have been asked to stay away from the castle due to the virus, with the ceremony to take place behind its walls, and anonline book of condolence,externalhas been opened.

Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows 88,000 people died from drug overdoses in the 12 month period ending in August 2020 - an increase of 27% on the previous year. The US authorities say the increase has been driven by illegally manufactured synthetic opioids. Peter Canning, a paramedic in Connecticut, has just released a book, Killing Season, about the crisis. He tells BBC World News the problem is being made worse by the isolation many people have had to endure during the coronavirus pandemic.

Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent This video can not be played 'I saw them more than my own family' A year on from the peak in coronavirus deaths among care home residents in England and Wales, there are increasing calls for a public inquiry. Many in the sector believe the government ignored their plight until the death toll made that impossible to do. Twelve months ago, nursing associate Damian Mann was desperately trying to save the lives of people he spends more time with than his relatives, every day. He works at Wren Hall Nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where 13 residents died with Covid-19 between the end of March and mid-April 2020. ""Some of the people have lived here for five, six years. I see them more than my own family,"" he says. ""And then they're not here any more."" Damian was working on a hastily set-up isolation unit. He was one of just a few staff who didn't contract the virus, so saw resident after resident pass away. ""We would always make sure someone was with them,"" he says. Read more here.

Soutik BiswasIndia Correspondent ""Will a lockdown happen again?"" Over a grainy video call last week from a grotty little room in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the Sethi brothers repeatedly asked me this question, their voices trembling in nervousness. More than a decade ago, Santosh and Tunna Sethi left their families and homes in the eastern state of Orissa, also called Odisha, in search of work. They arrived in Mumbai, more than 1,600km (994 miles) away. Here, the brothers toiled in the shadows of the city's imposing skyscrapers that migrant workers build for the affluent. Ferrying cement, sand, bricks and stones, they earned 450 rupees ($6; Â£4.35) every day for eight hours of work. They lived, ate and slept in unfinished buildings, and sent most of their savings home to support their families. With more than three million reported Covid-19 infections, the state of Maharashtra, which has Mumbai as its capital, is the stubborn epicentre of India's second wave of infections. The government has beenwarning of a full lockdownunless cases begin to fall. Fear has gripped the Sethi brothers again. ""Will we have to return home? Do you have any information?"" they ask.

Tories reject Labour plan for MP-led lobbying probe,"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: Boris Johnson is 'blocking a proper inquiry' The government has defeated Labour plans for a parliamentary inquiry into lobbying, amid a row over contacts with finance firm Greensill Capital. Sir Keir Starmer had wanted a ""full"" probe, including public hearings by a cross-party panel of MPs. Boris Johnson has insisted the lawyer he appointed this week to carry out a review of the affair will lead a ""proper"" inquiry. And he said the Tories had been ""consistently tough on lobbying"". Earlier, Sir Keir said the Greensill affair demonstrated ""sleaze and cronyism"" at the ""heart"" of the Conservative Party. A row about lobbying has centred on attempts by Greensill Capital, a specialist bank whichcollapsed in March, to influence government ministers and top civil servants. On Wednesday, the Commons Treasury select committee said it planned to launch an inquiry into the ""lessons"" from the firm's demise. David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting' Kuenssberg: Labour's long-term strategy to attack cronyism The government has appointed lawyer Nigel Boardman to look into the matter and report back by the end of June. Labour said a cross-party Commons committee should investigate instead, with a wider remit to recommend changes to lobbying rules. But speaking earlier at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said Labour's proposals would involve MPs ""marking their own homework"". He ordered Tory MPs to vote against the plan, which was defeated by 357 votes to 262. Sleaze - amid stiff competition, it's perhaps the dirtiest word in politics. It's used as shorthand for behaviour that's immoral, inappropriate, corrupt or just plain wrong. And Labour's choice to attach it to the current government's actions is no accident. Sir Keir Starmer is seeking to evoke the scandals of the past which have led to the downfall of Conservative ministers. In the latter years of John Major's government in the 1990s accusations of sleaze were so commonplace it was arguably a factor in them losing power. But while Boris Johnson and his ministers will be keen to avoid accusations of improper behaviour in office, there are dangers for the opposition here too. Labour governments have seen their fair share of scandal in the past and it's a brave politician of any colour who claims to be beyond reproach. Calls to examine lobbying and the relationship between civil servants, politicians and and private firms have intensified in the past week. These have followed revelations about former Prime Minister David Cameron's efforts to influence ministers on behalf of Greensill, where he started working as an adviser in August 2018, two years after he left Downing Street. These involvedtexting Chancellor Rishi Sunakand contacting other ministers about a government-backed Covid loan scheme on behalf of the company. Along with the company's founder Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron also met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" in 2019 todiscuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff. It's another word for trying to persuade the government to change its policies It can be done by individuals, companies, organisations and charities who contact ministers, backbench MPs and other politicians Some organisations and companies employ professional lobbyists to make their case for them Former MPs and civil servants often work as lobbyists Speaking earlier, Sir Keir suggested there was a ""revolving door"" between the government and the private sector. He told MPs: ""I know the prime minister is launching an inquiry. That inquiry isn't even looking at the lobbying rules. ""I'm not sure it's looking at very much at all, because every day there's further evidence of the sleaze that's now at the heart of this Conservative government."" But the prime minster said Mr Boardman would be leading a ""proper independent review,"" and Labour's committee idea would ""not do a blind bit of good"". Mr Cameron has insisted he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying, although he has acknowledged that he should have communicated with the government ""through only the most formal of channels"". Conservative MP William Wragg, who chairs a Commons committee currently looking into business appointments, said the Greensill affair was a ""tasteless, slap-dash and unbecoming episode for any former prime minister"". But, speaking ahead of Wednesday's vote, he suggested Mr Cameron's involvement was a ""red herring"" compared with the wider issues - such as why companies were interested in employing ""de-skilled"" former ministers at all. Mr Greensill, who worked as an unpaid government adviser during Mr Cameron's early years in Downing Street, has not commented on the row. Mr Cameron has said the idea of him working at Greensill Capital ""was never raised, or considered by me, until well after I left office"". What's the David Cameron lobbying row about?

What is lobbying? A brief guide,"Tory MP Owen Paterson resigned his seat after being embroiled in a row around lobbying Westminster has been bursting with rebellions, U-turns and resignations this week after the Tory MP Owen Paterson was found to have broken parliamentary rules on lobbying. But what does the term mean? Lobbying is when individuals, businesses, trade unions, groups or charities try to get a government to change its policies. ""Political persuasion"" might be a better term. Lobbyists make their case to ministers, MPs or officials. They can write, email, text, phone, video call or turn up in person in Parliament to do it, although the latter hasn't happened much over the past two years due to Covid-19 restrictions. Paterson quits as MP over lobbying row 'nightmare' What did Owen Paterson do? Owen Paterson row: A quick but damaging U-turn Not always. Changing politicians' minds can take a long time. That's why organisations and firms often hire professional lobbyists to make arguments on their behalf. Some of these are former politicians themselves and ""know the game"" - that is, who's who and where to find them. But it's important to re-emphasise that individual citizens - unpaid - can also lobby politicians about issues that are important to them. Anyone can be a lobbyist, in other words. Supporters say professional lobbying is a vital and valid part of democracy - that it stimulates debate and keeps politicians in touch with the latest developments in areas like science and business. But critics argue that the current system is open to corruption and that wealthy interests - the ones who can afford professionals to make their case - have an unfair advantage. Ministers and top civil servants are effectively banned from lobbying their former colleagues for two years after leaving government. Lobbyists also have to join a register, which was set up by David Cameron as prime minister. But Mr Cameron, who left Downing Street in 2016, became the centre of a row about lobbying earlier in 2021over his work for Greensill Captial. In Mr Paterson's case, he wasfound to have broken the rulesby approaching and meeting officials at the Food Standards Agency and ministers at the Department for International Development a number of times over issues involving two firms he was a consultant for. The Commons Standards Committee also said he used his parliamentary office and stationery for his consultancy work and failed to declare his interests in some meetings. The commissioner decided that the contact with officials and ministers were ""serious breaches"" of the rules. Following the disclosures about Mr Cameron's work, the governmentset up a review of lobbying, led by lawyer Chris Boardman. He said some of the accusations that the government's processes for managing lobbying were ""insufficiently transparent"", had ""loopholes"" and allowed ""a privileged to few have a disproportionate level of access to decision makers in government"" were ""justified"". But he said Mr Cameron did not break any of the rules. After the incident involving Mr Paterson, the focus from the government was not on his lobbying but in the need for an overhaul of the system policing MPs' conduct instead - giving members more chances to appeal findings against them. Initially,Downing Street backed an amendmentto shake-up the watchdog and blocked Mr Paterson's suspension too. But within 24 hours, and after a furious backlash from opposition MPs,No 10 U-turned, and now government is appealing to other parties to hold cross-party talks about any chances. These would not be retrospectively applied to Mr Paterson's case though, and soon after the announcement,the MP resigned his seat. It started long ago when members of the public turned up in Parliament's lobby areas to let MPs know what needed to change. It's harder to get into that part of the building than it used to be because of tougher security, so meetings are just as likely to take place elsewhere, such as over dinner, in MPs' constituencies or via the phone.

Civil servants ordered to declare second jobs,"Government departments have been ordered to find out by the end of the week whether senior officials have rule-breaking second jobs. Cabinet Secretary Simon Case has asked colleagues to declare paid roles or outside interests that ""might conflict"" with Civil Service rules. The move comes after it emerged a top official joined a financial firm while still working for the government. Bill Crothers says his recruitment by Greensill Capital was ""transparent"". Letters to an appointments watchdogpublished on Tuesday,externalrevealed his part-time role as an adviser at the firm had been signed off by the Cabinet Office. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs on Wednesday it was ""not clear"" that ""boundaries have been properly understood"". Labour has described Mr Crothers' dual employment, which happened in 2015, as ""extraordinary and shocking"". Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting' What's the Greensill lobbying row about? Tories reject Labour plan for MP-led lobbying probe Mr Crothers had been the government's chief procurement officer prior to being taken on by Greensill, which has since collapsed. Revelations about the firm's attempts to influence government have led to Mr Johnson launching a lawyer-led review into its access to ministers and civil servants. Labour argues a special House of Commons committee should investigate instead - but the government rejects this, andvoted down the planon Wednesday. In a letter to senior officials, seen by the BBC, Mr Case - the UK's top civil servant - said there were issues of ""acute concern"" over recruitment. He said the need to give civil servants the chance to gain experience life outside Whitehall has been ""recognised for many decades by successive governments"". ""But this must only be done in a way which can maintain the integrity and impartiality of the Civil Service,"" he wrote. He added: ""In particular, there needs to be transparency and full and proper management of any outside interests."" Mr Case ordered colleagues to declare by the end of the week if they ""come across"" instances of senior civil servants with second jobs or outside interests ""which might conflict with their obligations under the [Civil Service] Code"". This sets outs the rules on ""honesty"", ""integrity"", ""objectivity"" and ""impartiality"". Simon Case became head of the civil service in September 2020 Mr Crothers joined Greensill as an adviser to its board in September 2015, while he remained a Civil Service employee. Letters to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba) watchdog published on Tuesday show the move was approved by the Cabinet Office under its internal conflicts of interest policy. Mr Crothers later went on to join the company as a director in late 2016, after leaving government in November 2015. In a letter to Acoba's chairman, Lord Pickles, Mr Crothers wrote: ""I am concerned that there may be a view that I did not follow proper process regarding my role with Greensill Capital. ""I assure you that I completely respect the required process and your office, took steps to comply, and believe that I did so."" He adds: ""I was transparent about the move to Greensill Capital, and it was well known at the time."" But in a letter to the current head of the Cabinet Office, Lord Pickles said there had been a ""lack of transparency"" about the process - and called for more details. Concerns about Greensill's access to government were sparked by revelations last month that former Prime Minister David Cameron had lobbied on behalf of the company after leaving office. His efforts involvedtexting Chancellor Rishi Sunakand contacting other ministers about a government-backed Covid loan scheme on behalf of the firm. Along with the company's founder, Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron also met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" in 2019 todiscuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff. The former prime minister began working as an adviser to the company in August 2018, two years after leaving Downing Street in July 2016. Mr Cameron has said he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying, and welcomes the government's review. On Wednesday, the Commons Treasury select committee said it planned to launch an inquiry into the ""lessons"" from Greensill Capital's demise. Other parliamentary committees are reportedly considering bids to invite the former prime minister to give evidence. A spokesman for Mr Cameron said he would ""respond positively"" to such requests ""when the terms of reference of each inquiry are clear"". What's the David Cameron lobbying row about?

Greensill: What's it all about?,"Former Prime Minister David Cameron made about Â£3.3m from shares in the collapsed finance company Greensill Capital, documents obtained by BBC Panorama suggest. Last month an MPs' report accused Mr Cameron of ""a significant lack of judgement"" in lobbying the government on behalf of the company, although it said he did not break any rules. In 2020, Mr Cameron tried to persuade ministers to allow Greensill - who employed him as an adviser - to join a scheme called the Corporate Covid Financing Facility (CCFF). This would have allowed the company to issue loans, insured by the government, to help firms through the pandemic. However, Mr Cameron - and the company's founder, Lex Greensill - were unsuccessful in their attempts. Greensill Capital collapsed this year, with the loss of 440 jobs, and possible billion-pound losses for investors. Mr Cameron has consistently declined to say how much he was being paid by Greensill, except that it was ""far more"" than his salary as PM. However, BBC's Panorama has obtained a letter from Greensill Capital to the former PM which suggests that he made Â£3.29m after selling a tranche of Greensill shares in 2019. David Cameron 'made $10m' before company's collapse As well as the shares, Mr Cameron is reported to have received a salary of $1m (Â£720,000) a year as a part-time adviser. The programme also understands that the former prime minister was paid a bonus of $700,000 (Â£504,000) in 2019 on top of his salary. In total, it looks like he made around $10m before tax for two-and-a-half years' part-time work. Mr Cameron's spokesman said his remuneration was a private matter. Australian banker Lex Greensill originally worked for David Cameron at No 10 in the early 2010s Mr Cameron has been accused of trying to exploit private contacts with former government colleagues, for his own benefit. The former PM used private channels,externalto lobby ministers and former colleagues. He and his staff sent45 emails, texts and WhatsApp messagesconcerning Greensill between 5 March and 26 June 2020. Among these were nine WhatsApp messages to Chancellor Rishi Sunak and 12 text messages to Sir Tom Scholar, the Treasury's top civil servant. The Bank of England haspublished correspondence,externalshowing that Mr Cameron had contacted senior officials several times, in an unsuccessful attempt to win their support. Along with Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" in 2019to discuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff. A report last month by the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee said that while no lobbying rules were broken, Mr Cameron's actions showed there was a ""good case for strengthening them"", with the current ones offering ""insufficient strength"". It also said that the Treasury was right to reject the former PM's proposals, but it ""should have encouraged"" him into ""more formal lines of communication as soon as it had identified his personal financial incentives"". ACabinet Office reviewcommissioned by Boris Johnson also criticised Mr Cameron, and said he had understated his relationship with Greensill when lobbying the Treasury. However, it said that ""his actions were not unlawful"". Several other reviews are investigating matters related to lobbying and Greensill. Responding to the Treasury Committee report, Mr Cameron admitted that he should have used more formal channels, but said he had worked for Greensill primarily because he thought the firm could help small businesses during an economic crisis. However, Deputy Labour Leader Angela Rayner said the fact that Mr Cameron had been cleared of breaking rules proved ""that the rules that are supposed to regulate lobbying are completely unfit for purpose"". Current rules,externalstate that ""on leaving office, ministers will be prohibited from lobbying government for two years"". Before accepting new jobs, former ministers are supposed to inform a body called the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments (Acoba). Acoba advises civil servants and politicians on what they can and can't do after leaving public service. However, although former ministers are required to contact Acoba, they are not obliged to act on its advice. Acoba's head, Lord Pickles, has called for ex-ministers who work as lobbyiststo go on a register for up to 10 years to ensure ""transparency"", The company's collapse earlier this year was triggered after its insurer refused to renew cover for the loans Greensill was making. Greensill was theprincipal financial backer of Liberty Steel, which employs 3,000 people in England, Scotland and Wales. Talks are now underwayto try to secure Liberty's future.

Disgraced financier Bernie Madoff dies in prison,"Bernie Madoff, a Wall Street financier disgraced after he admitted to one of the biggest frauds in US financial history, has died in prison at age 82. His death was announced by the Bureau of Prisons. Mr Madoff had been serving a 150-year sentence after he pleaded guilty in 2009 to running a Ponzi scheme, which paid investors with money from new clients rather than actual profits. It collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis. ""Bernie, up until his death, lived with guilt and remorse for his crimes,"" his lawyer Brandon Sample said in a statement. ""Although the crimes Bernie was convicted of have come to define who he was - he was also a father and a husband. He was soft spoken and an intellectual. Bernie was by no means perfect. But no man is."" Mr Madoff,the son of European immigrants who grew up in New York,set up his eponymous firm Bernard L Madoff Investment Securities in 1960. The company became one of the largest market-makers - matching buyers and sellers of stocks - and Mr Madoff served as chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange. The firm was investigated eight times by the US Securities and Exchange Commission because it made exceptional returns. But it was the global recession which effectively prompted Mr Madoff's demise as investors, hit by the downturn, tried to withdraw about $7bn from his funds and he could not find the money to cover it. Victims of Mr Madoff's fraud included celebrities and everyday people He confessed the problem to his sons, who went to the authorities. The list of those scammed included actor Kevin Bacon, Hall of Fame baseball player Sandy Koufax and film director Steven Spielberg's charitable foundation, Wunderkinder. UK banks were also among those who lost money, with HSBC Holdings saying it had exposure of around $1bn. Other corporate victims were Royal Bank of Scotland and Man Group and Japan's Nomura Holdings. But it was not just the elite and large firms who were victims of the fraud. School teachers, farmers, mechanics and many others also lost money. ""We thought he was God. We trusted everything in his hands,"" Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, whose foundation lost $15.2 million, said in 2009. In court, Mr Madoff said that when he started the scheme in the 1990s, he hoped it would only be for a limited time. ""I cannot adequately express how sorry I am for what I have done,"" he said in March 2009, when he pleaded guilty. ""I realised that my arrest and this day would inevitably come."" The scam involved an estimated $65bn, a figure that included gains Mr Madoff's clients believed they had made due to fake account statements. Of the more than $17bn in cash losses, more than $14bn has been recovered. Last year, Mr Madoff requested early release from prison citing health problems, including kidney disease. In an interview with The Washington Post he said he had ""made a terrible mistake."" ""I'm terminally ill,"" he said. ""There's no cure for my type of disease. So, you know, I've served. I've served 11 years already, and, quite frankly, I've suffered through it."" Judge Denny Chin denied Mr Madoff's request, noting many victims were still suffering due to their financial losses. ""I also believe that Mr. Madoff was never truly remorseful, and that he was only sorry that his life as he knew it was collapsing around him,"" he wrote. At least two investors with Mr Madoff took their own lives after their losses. His son Mark also killed himself on the second anniversary of his father's arrest. His other son, Andrew, died of cancer in 2014. Mr Madoff is survived by his wife, Ruth Madoff, who maintained she was unaware of the scheme and was never charged. Prosecutors let her keep $2.5m from the the $825m fortune the couple once possessed.

Gang jailed for Â£160k supermarket thefts,"The gang primarily targeted Asda in their crime spree Six men who stole more than Â£160,000 worth of items from supermarkets, by setting off alarms to distract security guards, have been jailed. The gang, based in Oldham, Greater Manchester, mainly targeted Asda stores for high-value items including perfume, alcohol, cosmetics and thousands of nappies. They committed 81 separate offences across the UK to avoid being caught, Cheshire Police said. The men were each jailed for 42 months. Nicolae Ilie, 37, Alin Mihai, 28, Florin Costea, 52, Stefan Florin, 31, Marius Meirosu, 25, and Gabriel Mocanu, 36, who were originally from Romania, all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal at Chester Crown Court. They set off security alarms as a distraction technique that enabled them to escape with the stolen items unseen, police said. Left to right clockwise: Stefan Florin, Nicolae Ilie, Marius Meirosu, Gabriel Mocanu, Florin Costea and Alin Mihai They would then sell on the items, such as printer cartridges, razor blades and alcohol. Between April and September 2019 they targeted stores across Scotland, Wales and England. Cheshire Police began investigating after Asda reported a Â£1,000 theft at its Barons Quay store in Northwich. Detectives examined CCTV footage, number plate recognition and credit card data which led them to a house in Oldham. Thousands of nappies and more than 50 razors, perfume and alcohol were found. Det Con Paul Matchett said it was clear the men ""travelled to the UK with the sole intention of committing crime"". He said they ""set up their base in Oldham"" and believed they could ""evade justice by spreading their crimes across the country in a bid to keep a low profile.""

Sir Simon Stevens has been speaking as a new study shows a 75% reduced risk of emergency hospital admission among people who have received the Pfizer vaccine. The study by the NHS and the University of Manchester has found older people who have received the jab are less likely to be admitted to hospital, and less likely to have a positive test, compared with those who have not been vaccinated. Researchers examined data on more than 170,000 people aged 80 to 83 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine between 15 and 20 December last year. They compared this information with ""matched controls"" aged 76 to 79 who had not yet received the jab. Sir Simon says: ""Vaccines are successfully reducing hospitalisations and deaths amongst the cohorts that have had the vaccine. ""Data that we have analysed shows a 75% reduction in emergency Covid hospitalisations for the vaccination cohorts and, as more and more people are vaccinated, that effect will widen.""

I mean, there's really no substitute for that. ""But one of the things that kept me going through the lockdown [has been] being able to play music and set up little studios, wherever."" He says he feels lucky to have ""a couple of places"" and a ""nice garden"". ""I'm very lucky.

Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent This video can not be played 'I saw them more than my own family' A year on from the peak in coronavirus deaths among care home residents in England and Wales, there are increasing calls for a public inquiry. Many in the sector believe the government ignored their plight until the death toll made that impossible to do. Twelve months ago, nursing associate Damian Mann was desperately trying to save the lives of people he spends more time with than his relatives, every day. He works at Wren Hall Nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where 13 residents died with Covid-19 between the end of March and mid-April 2020. ""Some of the people have lived here for five, six years. I see them more than my own family,"" he says. ""And then they're not here any more."" Damian was working on a hastily set-up isolation unit. He was one of just a few staff who didn't contract the virus, so saw resident after resident pass away. ""We would always make sure someone was with them,"" he says. Read more here.

Over a grainy video call last week from a grotty little room in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the Sethi brothers repeatedly asked me this question, their voices trembling in nervousness. More than a decade ago, Santosh and Tunna Sethi left their families and homes in the eastern state of Orissa, also called Odisha, in search of work.

Ellie, from Bourne in Lincolnshire, works at weekends at Yew Tree Residential Care Home, making drinks and playing games with residents. Despite only being 16, her part-time job at the home means she was eligible. When offered the jab, she said it was important to take it to help protect the care home residents from the virus. The teenager, who is studying for her GCSEs, also helps look after her grandma, who lives with the family and is vulnerable due to a health condition. ""Being protected just helps me feel a lot safer around everyone,"" Ellie says. ""I don't have to worry about going into school, picking it up, and bringing it back home.""

But a shocking aspect of Covid-19 in Brazil is the number of babies dying. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 1,300 babies under the age of one have died from the virus. With exclusive access to one childrenâs ICU in the northeast of the country, BBC Brazilâs Nathalia Passarinho speaks to staff about caring for these critically ill children. Vaccinations are ""successful"" at reducing hospital admissions, the head of the NHS in England says. Sir Simon Stevens has been speaking as a new study shows a 75% reduced risk of emergency hospital admission among people who have received the Pfizer vaccine. The study by the NHS and the University of Manchester has found older people who have received the jab are less likely to be admitted to hospital, and less likely to have a positive test, compared with those who have not been vaccinated. Researchers examined data on more than 170,000 people aged 80 to 83 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine between 15 and 20 December last year. They compared this information with ""matched controls"" aged 76 to 79 who had not yet received the jab. Sir Simon says: ""Vaccines are successfully reducing hospitalisations and deaths amongst the cohorts that have had the vaccine. ""Data that we have analysed shows a 75% reduction in emergency Covid hospitalisations for the vaccination cohorts and, as more and more people are vaccinated, that effect will widen."" Residents in some areas of Smethwick in the West Midlands are being urged to get tested for coronavirus after a case of the South Africa variant was detected. It comes as the ""largest surge testing operation to date"" is being carried out in London after cases were identified there. Sandwell Council haspublished a list of postcodes,externalin Smethwick and Cape Hill where people should get tested. The authority is urging all residents in those areas to get tested, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated. Read more here.

""I've written a lot of songs and finished records,"" he tellsBBC 6 Music's Matt Everitt. ""Obviously, it's not as good as being together in the same room with a group of musicians. I mean, there's really no substitute for that. ""But one of the things that kept me going through the lockdown [has been] being able to play music and set up little studios, wherever."" He says he feels lucky to have ""a couple of places"" and a ""nice garden"". ""I'm very lucky. I don't have the problems of living, say in a small flat in London or New York, which some of my friends have had,"" Sir Mick tells the radio host. ""Two kids in a two room flat in Manhattan?

The US authorities say the increase has been driven by illegally manufactured synthetic opioids. Peter Canning, a paramedic in Connecticut, has just released a book, Killing Season, about the crisis. He tells BBC World News the problem is being made worse by the isolation many people have had to endure during the coronavirus pandemic.

Office manager begged terrorist not to stab herIsobel Rowbotham describes seeing Jack Merritt moments after he had been fatally wounded.,"Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were killed during a conference on rehabilitating offenders A charity office manager has described being repeatedly stabbed during the terror attack at Fishmongers' Hall. Isobel Rowbotham told the inquest jury that she pleaded with convicted terrorist Usman Khan as he approached her on 29 November, 2019. She had just seen Jack Merritt moments after he had been fatally wounded by Khan in the toilets. ""He was shouting that he'd been stabbed,"" she told the inquest at London's Guildhall. ""He was holding his stomach. Obviously he'd been injured. There was a lot of blood."" Ms Rowbotham described Khan as moving towards her ""quite fast"" and ""purposively"". She said: ""I was obviously saying 'no Usman, please.' It was quite obvious he wasn't going to stop."" Charity office manager Isobel Rowbotham pleaded with Usman Khan not to attack her as he approached with two knives Ms Rowbotham said she hunched down to try to protect herself but was stabbed multiple times. ""It felt more like punches, I guess,"" she continued. ""His final stabs were in my neck. ""It felt like he thought they were the final stabs, as if they were intended to finish me."" The court heard she lay on the floor and ""decided to play dead in case he came back again...I tried to slow down my breathing."" Usman Khan (left) sat at the same table as Saskia Jones (right) Ms Rowbotham said she wanted to call the police on her mobile but ""there was too much blood to press the screen."" Saskia Jones, 23, and 25-year-old Mr Merritt both died after being stabbed by Khan at the prisoner rehabilitation conference being held in Fishmongers' Hall. The inquest also heard that Mr Merritt had rebooked a rail ticket for his killer after Khan's train to London was cancelled. Simon Larmour, a Learning Together research associate, said he received a panicked phone call from Khan on the day of the attack saying his train from Stafford had been cancelled. Jurors heard that one of Khan's knives had a crudely etched Arabic symbol for Allah on it The court previously heard that during the journey, Khan strapped a fake suicide bomb to his waist whilst in the train toilet. Khan was met at Euston station by Mr Larmour and John Crilly - who would later help with attempts to subdue Khan on London Bridge. ""I saw Usman coming towards Issy (Isobel Rowbotham) and me with two knives,"" Mr Lamour said. ""He was yelling but I didn't really understand what he was saying."" Jurors were told that Mr Merritt had had some professional dealings with Khan before the Learning Together event Mr Larmour said he leapt over the table and ran to the reception area where he gave first aid to Mr Merritt. ""I couldn't see all the places he had been stabbed. I was stunned at that point. I tried to find the nearest material I could to put pressure on the wounds. ""He passed out quite quickly. He was moaning a little bit. His eyes were glazed over. He was pale."" The inquest also heard from retired judge John Samuels, who saw Ms Jones lying at the foot of a staircase with a ""chalk-white"" face. He was attending the conference, having previously run a training course for prisoner rehabilitation organisation Learning Together in 2018 He told the inquest how he was on the balcony of the building's grand entrance hall as the attack unfolded. ''I heard shouts and screams coming from downstairs and I could not understand what was happening,"" he said. ""The first sounds were male shouts, the shouts were angry and confused."" Fishmongers' Hall, below London Bridge Mr Samuels described how he then saw Ms Jones lying on the floor. ""I noted particularly her face was chalk-white, she appeared unconscious to me or perhaps even dead,"" he said. Terror offender monitoring rules lawful 'I quickly realised something bad had happened' Terror attack victim's life 'was a triumph' Mr Samuels then saw one of the organisers of the event, Dr Amy Ludlow, shouting ''police, ambulance, now'' into her mobile phone. Having been told to evacuate, Mr Samuels said he then heard an ''authoritative voice'' outside saying that there was a bomb and he should find shelter. Usman Khan was jailed in 2012 over a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange Mr Samuels said he now assumed the voice had been that of a police officer. The inquest is scheduled to last nine weeks and is expected to be followed by a separate jury inquest into the death of Khan.

UK troops likely to leave Afghanistan by September,"The UK is to ""drawdown"" the number of troops in Afghanistan from next month, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has said. Confirming the planned departure of forces, Mr Wallace also warned any attacks on existing troops would be ""met with a forceful response"". The UK military has been in Afghanistan since 2001, with more than 450 British troops dying during the conflict with the Taliban and fighters from al-Qaeda. The US has said it will withdraw all forces by 11 September. And Nato confirmed allies would begin withdrawing troops from 1 May. The last UK combat troops left in 2014, but about 750 remain as part of the Nato mission to train Afghan forces. In a statement, Mr Wallace said: ""The people of Afghanistan deserve a peaceful and stable future. ""As we drawdown, the security of our people currently serving in Afghanistan remains our priority and we have been clear that attacks on Allied troops will be met with a forceful response. ""The British public and our Armed Forces community, both serving and veterans, will have lasting memories of our time in Afghanistan. ""Most importantly we must remember those who paid the ultimate sacrifice, who will never be forgotten."" US troops to leave Afghanistan by 11 September Timeline: UK troops in Afghanistan Afghans face pivotal moment as US 'closes the book' US President Joe Biden has announced that American troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September,saying it was ""time to end America's longest war"". That would coincide with the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the US in 2001. Mr Biden said while the US ""will not stay involved in Afghanistan militarily"", its ""diplomatic and humanitarian work"" would continue. ""We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create the ideal conditions for our withdrawal, expecting a different result,"" he said. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, speaking to Nato allies in Brussels, said: ""I am here to work closely with our allies, with the (Nato) secretary general, on the principle that we have established from the start: In together, adapt together and out together."" He added that they would work closely in the coming months ""on a safe, deliberate and co-ordinated withdrawal of our forces from Afghanistan"". The new deadline is four months later than the Trump administration previously agreed in a deal with the Taliban. Our defence correspondent Jonathan Beale says the UK, like most Nato allies, relies on the US's infrastructure, logistics and support in Afghanistan. The US has some 2,500 troops in the country as part of a 9,600-strong Nato mission. At the height of the war, Nato had more than 130,000 troops from 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had 9,500 personnel and 137 bases in Helmand province alone. US troops training the Afghan security forces in Helmand The speaker of the Afghan parliament, Mir Rahman Rahmani, has warned the withdrawal of foreign forces in the current circumstances will lead to civil war. In February 2020,the US and the Taliban agreed a dealthat would see the US and Nato allies withdraw all troops within 14 months if the Taliban upheld its promises, including not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks. The Afghan war: The short and long story Who are the Taliban?

Covid test firm cuts price amid criticism over cost,"The cost of coronavirus testing for holidaymakers has been cut amid growing pressure from the travel industry. Randox, one of the biggest suppliers of PCR tests under the UK's ""testing for travel"" scheme, has reduced the price from Â£100 to Â£60. But travel organisation Abta warned that the cost was still a ""significant restriction"". Other industry figures including the boss of Easyjet have said the requirement could price out travellers. Foreign holidays are currently banned, and returning travellers have to quarantine on arrival. The earliest possible date for foreign travel from England has previously been given as 17 May, but it has not been confirmed. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have argued that it is too early for foreign holidays. For England, destination countries will be in one of three categories (green, amber or red) and each one will require passengers to take a pre-departure Covid test as well as a PCR test on return to the UK. Consumer group Which? has estimated that each PCR test - which is just one of the tests needed - could cost about Â£120 per person. People can start thinking about foreign travel - Shapps When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Test travel regime must be easy and cheap, says PM Mark Tanzer, chief executive of the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA), said that although one of the leading suppliers had cut costs, ""Â£60 is still a lot of money"" - particularly for families of four or five. He added that a ""better solution is to not have a PCR test"", speaking in front of the Transport Select Committee. MPs also questioned why PCR tests are typically up to 80% cheaper overseas. Mr Tanzer said: ""I can't see anything in the UK that is different about PCR that means it is more expensive there than elsewhere"". Criticism has come from other parts of the industry looking to salvage a key period of summer trade. Johan Lundgren, the chief executive of Easyjet, said on Wednesday: ""Easyjet was founded to make travel accessible for all and so we continue to engage with government to ensure that the cost of the required testing is driven down"". Mr Lundgren added that may ""risk turning back the clock and make travel too costly for some"". The airline also said that many European countries were planning to resume flying ""at scale"" in May. Bookings for summer travel, dependent on restrictions easing, will help boost the airline's finances which have been squeezed during the pandemic. Passenger numbers for the six months to 31 March fell by 89% to 4.1 million. This led to total group revenue for the same period dropping by 90% to Â£235m, while it expects a pre-tax loss of Â£690-730m. Easyjet said that has enough flexibility to ""significantly ramp capacity up or down quickly"", according to demand for flights. ""Customers are booking closer to departure and visibility remains limited"", it said. But overall between April and the end of June, it expects to fly up to 20% of 2019 capacity levels. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps recently told the BBC that for the first time he was not ""advising against booking foreign holidays"". This video can not be played Grant Shapps: ""The tests are coming out too expensive, we are trying to drive that down."" ""Yes, you'll want to check what the situation is in two or three weeks' time when that list [of countries] - the green, amber, red, is produced - you'll want to know that you've got good holiday insurance and flexible flights and the rest of it. ""But for the first time I think there is light at the end of the tunnel and we'll be able to restart international travel, including cruises by the way, in a safe and secure way, knowing about the vaccinations, everything we know about the disease this year, and of course that abundance of caution - having the tests in place."" The government has said it would work with airlines, travel firms and the test providers to see whether prices of tests can be reduced. That could involve cheaper tests, or the government providing the pre-departure tests. People 'can start thinking about foreign travel' UK holidays: What are the rules?

"Gang jailed for Â£160k supermarket theftsThe gang mainly targeted Asda stores, stealing perfume, thousands of nappies and razor blades.Manchester","The gang primarily targeted Asda in their crime spree Six men who stole more than Â£160,000 worth of items from supermarkets, by setting off alarms to distract security guards, have been jailed. The gang, based in Oldham, Greater Manchester, mainly targeted Asda stores for high-value items including perfume, alcohol, cosmetics and thousands of nappies. They committed 81 separate offences across the UK to avoid being caught, Cheshire Police said. The men were each jailed for 42 months. Nicolae Ilie, 37, Alin Mihai, 28, Florin Costea, 52, Stefan Florin, 31, Marius Meirosu, 25, and Gabriel Mocanu, 36, who were originally from Romania, all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal at Chester Crown Court. They set off security alarms as a distraction technique that enabled them to escape with the stolen items unseen, police said. Left to right clockwise: Stefan Florin, Nicolae Ilie, Marius Meirosu, Gabriel Mocanu, Florin Costea and Alin Mihai They would then sell on the items, such as printer cartridges, razor blades and alcohol. Between April and September 2019 they targeted stores across Scotland, Wales and England. Cheshire Police began investigating after Asda reported a Â£1,000 theft at its Barons Quay store in Northwich. Detectives examined CCTV footage, number plate recognition and credit card data which led them to a house in Oldham. Thousands of nappies and more than 50 razors, perfume and alcohol were found. Det Con Paul Matchett said it was clear the men ""travelled to the UK with the sole intention of committing crime"". He said they ""set up their base in Oldham"" and believed they could ""evade justice by spreading their crimes across the country in a bid to keep a low profile.""

Civil servant worked at Greensill,"Bill Crothers says he was ""transparent"" about the role he took on with Greensill Capital A top civil servant joined financial firm Greensill Capital as an adviser while still working for the government, a lobbying watchdog has revealed. Bill Crothers's part-time position had been ""agreed"" to by the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments added. Its chairman Lord Pickles complained of a ""lack of transparency"" over the situation. But Mr Crothers said he had been taken on by Greensill in a ""transparent"" way. Labour called his dual employment ""extraordinary and shocking"". Johnson urged to launch 'full' Cameron inquiry Analysis: Review into lobbying may change little David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? The disclosure about Mr Crothers - who had been the government's chief procurement officer prior to being taken on by Greensill - is the latest of several stories involving the now-collapsed financial firm. It employed former prime minister David Cameron as an adviser from 2018. The Financial Times and the Sunday Times revealed that Mr Cameron had contacted several ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, to push for greater involvement in government loans schemes for the company. Boris Johnson has set up an inquiry into lobbying - attempts to persuade governments to change policy - including Greensill's role. Government sources said this would also now look at the situation surrounding Mr Crothers. Lord Pickles is asking for Whitehall ""guidance"" on possible ""conflicts of interest"" Mr Crothers, who had already left his job as chief procurement officer but remained a Civil Service employee, joined Greensill as an adviser to its board in September 2015. The letter from Conservative peer Lord Pickles to leading civil servant Alex Chisholm says: ""This was agreed by the Cabinet Office under its internal conflicts-of-interest policy."" Lord Pickles asks for ""guidance on the conflicts-of-interest process"" undertaken. The letter adds: ""The lack of transparency around this part-time employment with Greensill may have left the misleading impression that Mr Crothers had wilfully ignored the obligation to seek advice."" Mr Crothers left the Civil Service in November 2015, two months after taking up his role at Greensill. He became a director of the firm in late 2016. A letter from Mr Crothers to Lord Pickles, a former Conservative Party chairman, written earlier this week, has also been published. In it, he says: ""I am concerned that there may be a view that I did not follow proper process regarding my role with Greensill Capital. ""I assure you that I completely respect the required process and your office, took steps to comply, and believe that I did so."" He adds: ""I was transparent about the move to Greensill Capital, and it was well known at the time."" The shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said: ""This is an extraordinary and shocking revelation. ""The Conservatives have weakened the rules so much they may as well rip them up and start again."" The government inquiry in to lobbying is expected to report  by the end of June, but Labour says it does not go far enough. It will use an opposition day debate on Wednesday to force a vote on whether to establish a new Commons select committee to investigate the issue. Unlike regular opposition day votes which are symbolic, this one would be binding if it passes because Parliament would be deciding if it should do something. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said there would be a response to Mr Pickles's letter ""in due course"". They added that the ""review into Greensill Capital and supply-chain finance"" would be ""wide-ranging"". Mr Cameron has said he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying and that he welcomes the investigation launched by Mr Johnson.

James Dyson says Brexit has given him 'freedom',"This video can not be played Sir James Dyson says leaving the EU has given the UK ""freedom of spirit"" Brexit has given the UK back its independence and boosted innovation, inventor Sir James Dyson has said. ""We've got our freedom, we can make trade agreements with other countries outside Europe [and] we can employ people from all around the world,"" Sir James told the BBC. Thelatest statistics for Februaryshow UK exports to the EU remain below the same level last year. He also defended moving Dyson's global headquarters to Singapore in 2019. At the time, the pro-Brexit entrepreneur was accused of ""hypocrisy"", afterclaiming the UK would gain more from leaving the EU than it would lose. ""We're a British company - I've put a lot into this country,"" he said. ""I can't make things here and bring over all the components from the Far East here, assemble them here and then send them back to the Far East. That just doesn't work."" The interview came as Dyson announced plans to create 200 new jobs at its research facilities in Malmesbury and Hullavington, Wiltshire. Dyson picks historic Singapore building for new HQ Dyson cuts 900 jobs amid coronavirus impact The plans arepart of a Â£2.75bn global investment plan into emerging technologies and products, announced in November. Sir James said the end of the UK's transition period with the EU had enabled Dyson to hire the engineering talent it was lacking in the UK. Freedom of movement between the UK and EU has ended and the government hasintroduced a points-based immigration system,externalwhich it says ""treats all applicants equally, regardless of where they come from"". But experts say UK companies who want to hire from outside the EU are in no better position than before Brexit while attempts to hire EU workers now face significant costs and administration that did not exist before. ""We have 60 different nationalities on this site. I employ them from all over the world,"" Mr Dyson said. It is certainly true that Brexit, and specifically leaving the Customs Union, gives Britain freedom to do new trade deals without having to work through the EU's external trade policy. So far, that freedom has been devoted to maintaining the level of access to certain overseas markets that British business already had by virtue of EU trade agreements. Others are now possible and for some the US would be the big prize. But it won't be easy - food standards for example are a contentious issue -and most economic analysis suggests the benefits will be very modest,external. On hiring foreign nationals, Sir James could have employed non-EU people before. There were hoops to go through and even with the new immigration system there still are. The terms of Brexit make it more difficult for EU nationals than it was while the UK was a member. Inside Dyson's battery-making plant Sir James said the reason he had to move Dyson out to Asia was because Dyson's British suppliers ""didn't want to expand with us"". When asked whether he could be making more innovation happen in the UK, he said: ""I've invested about Â£2bn on this site [in Wiltshire]. ""I'm taking on more people, I employ 4,000 people here, I pay a large amount of tax here."" He said that the invention of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine showed that the UK had ""an independence of spirit"" that was now able to shine through. AstraZeneca is a UK-Swedish company. Development of the vaccine begun during the Brexit transition period when the UK was still bound by EU regulation. ""We had to develop our own... a world record-beating vaccine produced in record time, and that's because we produced it."" Sir James said that Asia was the fastest growing market in the world and that it was ""very important"" for Dyson to have a presence there. ""It would be arrogant to think that we could design and develop products for Asia and Britain,"" he said. ""We can develop technology, but understanding what Asians want and what works in the market - we have to be there, we have to be immersed in it.""

Terror attack victim 'had chalk-white face'A retired judge describes seeing the attack unfold from a balcony at Fishmongers' Hall in London.London,"Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were killed during a conference on rehabilitating offenders A charity office manager has described being repeatedly stabbed during the terror attack at Fishmongers' Hall. Isobel Rowbotham told the inquest jury that she pleaded with convicted terrorist Usman Khan as he approached her on 29 November, 2019. She had just seen Jack Merritt moments after he had been fatally wounded by Khan in the toilets. ""He was shouting that he'd been stabbed,"" she told the inquest at London's Guildhall. ""He was holding his stomach. Obviously he'd been injured. There was a lot of blood."" Ms Rowbotham described Khan as moving towards her ""quite fast"" and ""purposively"". She said: ""I was obviously saying 'no Usman, please.' It was quite obvious he wasn't going to stop."" Charity office manager Isobel Rowbotham pleaded with Usman Khan not to attack her as he approached with two knives Ms Rowbotham said she hunched down to try to protect herself but was stabbed multiple times. ""It felt more like punches, I guess,"" she continued. ""His final stabs were in my neck. ""It felt like he thought they were the final stabs, as if they were intended to finish me."" The court heard she lay on the floor and ""decided to play dead in case he came back again...I tried to slow down my breathing."" Usman Khan (left) sat at the same table as Saskia Jones (right) Ms Rowbotham said she wanted to call the police on her mobile but ""there was too much blood to press the screen."" Saskia Jones, 23, and 25-year-old Mr Merritt both died after being stabbed by Khan at the prisoner rehabilitation conference being held in Fishmongers' Hall. The inquest also heard that Mr Merritt had rebooked a rail ticket for his killer after Khan's train to London was cancelled. Simon Larmour, a Learning Together research associate, said he received a panicked phone call from Khan on the day of the attack saying his train from Stafford had been cancelled. Jurors heard that one of Khan's knives had a crudely etched Arabic symbol for Allah on it The court previously heard that during the journey, Khan strapped a fake suicide bomb to his waist whilst in the train toilet. Khan was met at Euston station by Mr Larmour and John Crilly - who would later help with attempts to subdue Khan on London Bridge. ""I saw Usman coming towards Issy (Isobel Rowbotham) and me with two knives,"" Mr Lamour said. ""He was yelling but I didn't really understand what he was saying."" Jurors were told that Mr Merritt had had some professional dealings with Khan before the Learning Together event Mr Larmour said he leapt over the table and ran to the reception area where he gave first aid to Mr Merritt. ""I couldn't see all the places he had been stabbed. I was stunned at that point. I tried to find the nearest material I could to put pressure on the wounds. ""He passed out quite quickly. He was moaning a little bit. His eyes were glazed over. He was pale."" The inquest also heard from retired judge John Samuels, who saw Ms Jones lying at the foot of a staircase with a ""chalk-white"" face. He was attending the conference, having previously run a training course for prisoner rehabilitation organisation Learning Together in 2018 He told the inquest how he was on the balcony of the building's grand entrance hall as the attack unfolded. ''I heard shouts and screams coming from downstairs and I could not understand what was happening,"" he said. ""The first sounds were male shouts, the shouts were angry and confused."" Fishmongers' Hall, below London Bridge Mr Samuels described how he then saw Ms Jones lying on the floor. ""I noted particularly her face was chalk-white, she appeared unconscious to me or perhaps even dead,"" he said. Terror offender monitoring rules lawful 'I quickly realised something bad had happened' Terror attack victim's life 'was a triumph' Mr Samuels then saw one of the organisers of the event, Dr Amy Ludlow, shouting ''police, ambulance, now'' into her mobile phone. Having been told to evacuate, Mr Samuels said he then heard an ''authoritative voice'' outside saying that there was a bomb and he should find shelter. Usman Khan was jailed in 2012 over a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange Mr Samuels said he now assumed the voice had been that of a police officer. The inquest is scheduled to last nine weeks and is expected to be followed by a separate jury inquest into the death of Khan.

Jurors were told that Mr Merritt had had some professional dealings with Khan before the Learning Together event Mr Larmour said he leapt over the table and ran to the reception area where he gave first aid to Mr Merritt. ""I couldn't see all the places he had been stabbed. I was stunned at that point. I tried to find the nearest material I could to put pressure on the wounds. ""He passed out quite quickly. He was moaning a little bit. His eyes were glazed over. He was pale."" The inquest also heard from retired judge John Samuels, who saw Ms Jones lying at the foot of a staircase with a ""chalk-white"" face. He was attending the conference, having previously run a training course for prisoner rehabilitation organisation Learning Together in 2018 He told the inquest how he was on the balcony of the building's grand entrance hall as the attack unfolded. ''I heard shouts and screams coming from downstairs and I could not understand what was happening,"" he said. ""The first sounds were male shouts, the shouts were angry and confused."" Fishmongers' Hall, below London Bridge Mr Samuels described how he then saw Ms Jones lying on the floor. ""I noted particularly her face was chalk-white, she appeared unconscious to me or perhaps even dead,"" he said. Terror offender monitoring rules lawful 'I quickly realised something bad had happened' Terror attack victim's life 'was a triumph' Mr Samuels then saw one of the organisers of the event, Dr Amy Ludlow, shouting ''police, ambulance, now'' into her mobile phone. Having been told to evacuate, Mr Samuels said he then heard an ''authoritative voice'' outside saying that there was a bomb and he should find shelter. Usman Khan was jailed in 2012 over a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange Mr Samuels said he now assumed the voice had been that of a police officer. The inquest is scheduled to last nine weeks and is expected to be followed by a separate jury inquest into the death of Khan.

Ellie, from Bourne in Lincolnshire, works at weekends at Yew Tree Residential Care Home, making drinks and playing games with residents. Despite only being 16, her part-time job at the home means she was eligible. When offered the jab, she said it was important to take it to help protect the care home residents from the virus. The teenager, who is studying for her GCSEs, also helps look after her grandma, who lives with the family and is vulnerable due to a health condition. ""Being protected just helps me feel a lot safer around everyone,"" Ellie says. ""I don't have to worry about going into school, picking it up, and bringing it back home.""

But a shocking aspect of Covid-19 in Brazil is the number of babies dying. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 1,300 babies under the age of one have died from the virus. With exclusive access to one childrenâs ICU in the northeast of the country, BBC Brazilâs Nathalia Passarinho speaks to staff about caring for these critically ill children. Vaccinations are ""successful"" at reducing hospital admissions, the head of the NHS in England says. Sir Simon Stevens has been speaking as a new study shows a 75% reduced risk of emergency hospital admission among people who have received the Pfizer vaccine. The study by the NHS and the University of Manchester has found older people who have received the jab are less likely to be admitted to hospital, and less likely to have a positive test, compared with those who have not been vaccinated. Researchers examined data on more than 170,000 people aged 80 to 83 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine between 15 and 20 December last year. They compared this information with ""matched controls"" aged 76 to 79 who had not yet received the jab. Sir Simon says: ""Vaccines are successfully reducing hospitalisations and deaths amongst the cohorts that have had the vaccine. ""Data that we have analysed shows a 75% reduction in emergency Covid hospitalisations for the vaccination cohorts and, as more and more people are vaccinated, that effect will widen."" Residents in some areas of Smethwick in the West Midlands are being urged to get tested for coronavirus after a case of the South Africa variant was detected. It comes as the ""largest surge testing operation to date"" is being carried out in London after cases were identified there. Sandwell Council haspublished a list of postcodes,externalin Smethwick and Cape Hill where people should get tested. The authority is urging all residents in those areas to get tested, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated. Read more here.

I mean, there's really no substitute for that. ""But one of the things that kept me going through the lockdown [has been] being able to play music and set up little studios, wherever."" He says he feels lucky to have ""a couple of places"" and a ""nice garden"". ""I'm very lucky. I don't have the problems of living, say in a small flat in London or New York, which some of my friends have had,"" Sir Mick tells the radio host. ""Two kids in a two room flat in Manhattan?

Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows 88,000 people died from drug overdoses in the 12 month period ending in August 2020 - an increase of 27% on the previous year. The US authorities say the increase has been driven by illegally manufactured synthetic opioids. Peter Canning, a paramedic in Connecticut, has just released a book, Killing Season, about the crisis. He tells BBC World News the problem is being made worse by the isolation many people have had to endure during the coronavirus pandemic.

initially expected at the end of the year, but they will now arrive by
the end of June. EU Commission chief Ursula
von der Leyen says ""there are still many factors that can disrupt the
planned delivery schedules of vaccines"", referring to the J&J delay. ""It is therefore
important to act swiftly, anticipate and adjust whenever it is possible."" Denmark has announced it will stop using the AstraZeneca vaccinefollowing a small number of blood clotting

Sir Simon pledges there will be one for each local health area, with figures showing hundreds of thousands are continuing to suffer, several months after their first infection.

Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent This video can not be played 'I saw them more than my own family' A year on from the peak in coronavirus deaths among care home residents in England and Wales, there are increasing calls for a public inquiry. Many in the sector believe the government ignored their plight until the death toll made that impossible to do. Twelve months ago, nursing associate Damian Mann was desperately trying to save the lives of people he spends more time with than his relatives, every day. He works at Wren Hall Nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where 13 residents died with Covid-19 between the end of March and mid-April 2020. ""Some of the people have lived here for five, six years. I see them more than my own family,"" he says. ""And then they're not here any more."" Damian was working on a hastily set-up isolation unit. He was one of just a few staff who didn't contract the virus, so saw resident after resident pass away. ""We would always make sure someone was with them,"" he says. Read more here. Scottish businesses say they are ""close to exhaustion"" after 12 months of ""some of the most challenging trading conditions in modern history"".

Soutik BiswasIndia Correspondent ""Will a lockdown happen again?"" Over a grainy video call last week from a grotty little room in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the Sethi brothers repeatedly asked me this question, their voices trembling in nervousness. More than a decade ago, Santosh and Tunna Sethi left their families and homes in the eastern state of Orissa, also called Odisha, in search of work. They arrived in Mumbai, more than 1,600km (994 miles) away. Here, the brothers toiled in the shadows of the city's imposing skyscrapers that migrant workers build for the affluent. Ferrying cement, sand, bricks and stones, they earned 450 rupees ($6; Â£4.35) every day for eight hours of work. They lived, ate and slept in unfinished buildings, and sent most of their savings home to support their families. With more than three million reported Covid-19 infections, the state of Maharashtra, which has Mumbai as its capital, is the stubborn epicentre of India's second wave of infections. The government has beenwarning of a full lockdownunless cases begin to fall. Fear has gripped the Sethi brothers again. ""Will we have to return home? Do you have any information?"" they ask.

She said: ""I was obviously saying 'no Usman, please.' It was quite obvious he wasn't going to stop."" Charity office manager Isobel Rowbotham pleaded with Usman Khan not to attack her as he approached with two knives Ms Rowbotham said she hunched down to try to protect herself but was stabbed multiple times. ""It felt more like punches, I guess,"" she continued. ""His final stabs were in my neck. ""It felt like he thought they were the final stabs, as if they were intended to finish me.""

Over a grainy video call last week from a grotty little room in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the Sethi brothers repeatedly asked me this question, their voices trembling in nervousness.

Researchers examined data on more than 170,000 people aged 80 to 83 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine between 15 and 20 December last year. They compared this information with ""matched controls"" aged 76 to 79 who had not yet received the jab.

Stolen Roman statue found in Brussels antique shop,"A Roman statue dating back to the First Century BC has been recovered, almost a decade after it was stolen from an archaeological site in Italy. Two Italian officers came across the sculpture of a headless figure wearing a toga at an antique shop in Belgium. Suspicious of its origins, they searched a database of stolen artefacts and discovered the ""Togatus"" statue had been missing since 2011. The sculpture is believed to be worth around â¬100,000 ($120,000, Â£87,000). US tourist repents for taking ancient marble Roman jars found in Spanish seafood shop The story behind Italy's stolen treasures The two officers, who work for the antiquities division of the Carabinieri military police, were in the Belgian capital Brussels for a separate investigation earlier this year. After work one evening, they made their way to the city's Sablon district, which is famed for its antique shops, where they came across the marble figure. An investigation confirmed the statue had been stolen from the Villa Marini Dettina site on the outskirts of Rome in November 2011. It was seized by Belgian authorities and has now been returned to Italy, the government in Rome has announced. An Italian trader using a Spanish pseudonymÂ has since been referred to the prosecutor's office in Rome for receiving stolen goods and illegally exporting the statue. Italy has long campaigned to retrieve art and artefacts its government says were looted or stolen.

PMQs: Johnson defends inquiry amid lobbying row,"Prime Minister's Questions has taken place in the Commons It was the first time Boris Johnson faced MPs after rows over lobbying erupted Former PM David Cameron has been criticised for contacting ministers on behalf of Greensill Capital It has also been revealed a civil servant joined the finance firm before quitting Whitehall The PM defended the inquiry it had launched, but faced accusations of ""Tory sleaze"" from Sir Keir Labour used its opposition day debate in the Commons to call for a full parliamentary inquiry into lobbying Richard Morris, Kate Whannel and Jennifer Scott BBC Politics We are bringing the live page to a close for today. But don't worry, we will be keeping across this lobbying row and the inquiry. Be sure to follow all the news on theBBC Politics Twitter,externalandcheck out the websitefor news and analysis. Thanks for joining us and see you next week! Boris Johnson promises a probe into cronyism claims, but Labour says his government is beset by ""sleaze"". Read our story from PMQs here. Boris Johnson clashes with Sir Keir Starmer over the best way to investigate allegations. As expected, the lobbying row dominated most of PMQs, but in case you missed it, here are the highlights from today's session: Reality Check Prime
Minister Boris Johnson claimed Labour âcampaignedâ at the last general election
to get rid of the rules on lobbying. In 2019,Labourâs manifesto,externaldid
say: âWe will free the voices of civil society by repealing the Lobbying Act
2014 and overhauling the rules that govern corporate lobbying.â But that came in a section about
tackling vested interests, that also pledged to: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme On BBC Two's Politics Live, the conversation moves to the lack of sign language interpreters at UK government coronavirus press briefings. Asked why this is the case, Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she is a ""big fan"" of sign language interpretation at these press conferences and has ""no idea"" why that isn't being done. Labour MP Chris Bryant says the government in Wales has been doing it in every briefing since the start of the pandemic and calls for it to be introduced in Downing Street. Allow Twitter content?

Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent It was no surprise
that Sir Keir Starmer focussed on what he called âthe return of Tory sleazeâ. Labour feels this is a fruitful line of attack against the government and the
review its set up isnât fit for purpose. The prime ministerâs response relied
on a two-pronged strategy. First, what you might call the quick sidestep - to say heâs concerned about lobbying and then say Sir Keir should forward any
concerns he has to the review itself. Second was the swift segue, when Sir Keir
said the prime ministerâs arguments reminded him of his time as a prosecutor in
court and what he called ""the shoplifterâs defence"". Boris Johnson
recalled his own time as Mayor of London cutting crime and murder rates, adding
he was now busy rolling out vaccines. Shortly MPs will begin a debate on a Labour motion, which calls for a broader inquiry into lobbying by a cross-party panel of MPs. Speaking to the BBC, Labour's Rachel Reeves argued the remit of the inquiry launched by the government was ""too narrow"" just focusing on Greensill ""when we know the issues around
lobbying and access go much wider than that"". She also accused the
government of hand-picking ""a close friend of the Conservative party"" to lead the inquiry. However, Boris Johnson defended the inquiry, arguing that Labour's plan would mean politicians ""marking their own homework"". You can watch the debate on BBC Parliament. BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme Over to BBC Two's Politics Live, and our political editor Laura Kuenssberg speaks about the lobbying focus of the exchanges. She says Keir Starmer was embracing his former life as a lawyer in this PMQs,  and was trying to make himself out to be a ""sleaze-buster"" in the House of Commons. She says the Labour Party wants to make this into a broad, and consistent attack on the government. Labour are trying to make an impression that ""this culture is endemic in government"", which the Conservatives deny. Right now, Boris Johnson has no appetite to have a wholesale inquiry, she adds. Successive governments ""have grappled with this for years and years and years"", but the various organisations designed to look over lobbying don't have teeth. One watchdog only has powers to send ""polite, but strongly worded letters"" to warn former ministers, she says. The final question comes from Conservative Gareth Davies, who asks what is being done to tackle littering. Boris Johnson says he shares the MP's ""indignation"" about littering and urges people meeting outdoors ""to obey the basic laws of respect for other people"". He adds that his government is increasing on-the-spot fines for littering. ""Many may think that's draconian, personally I think it is the right thing to do,"" says the PM. He also urges people to ""tick off"" litterers. And that concludes today's PMQs. Labour MP Matt Western uses an old Turkish proverb in his question to the PM, saying: ""The fish rots from the head down."" He says since Boris Johnson became prime minister, ""Big Ben bongs"" have been replaced by ""bungs"". He lists accusations made against the government of lobbying, including Greensill, contracts on PPE granted to Tory donors and friends of Health Secretary Matt Hancock. But Boris Johnson says ""he is wrong in this instance"" and he doesn't believe Mr Western should have spoken in that way. He says there is ""one party which has brought in tough lobbying rules"", accusing Labour of giving too much power to trade unions. Labour's Kim Johnson says ""contrary to the race report""released earlier this month, institutional racism still exists. She asks the PM to answer allegations that Downing Street redrafted the report to change the narrative and urges him to withdraw it entirely. Boris Johnson says the report has ""interesting observations"", but adds that the government ""wouldn't necessarily agree"" with everything in it. He adds that his government will ""do everything we can"" to tackle inequality. Conservative Sir Peter Bottomley says the successful roll out of the vaccination programme is based on the dedication of NHS staff, who make it ""so easy for so many people"". Boris Johnson says this has been a ""colossal team effort"" with ""GPs often doing the lion's share of the work"" but supported by the army and other organisations. Labour's Ruth Cadbury asks Boris Johnson when he last spoke to David Cameron. ""I cannot remember when I last spoke to Dave,"" the PM replies. He adds that he has not had any contact with the former PM ""about the matters that have been in the press"". Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft asks a question in sign language. She then says ""if the prime minister doesn't understand, why does he still not have sign language at his press briefings?"" She asks what the point of the new Â£2m press briefing room is if it is not inclusive for disabled people. Boris Johnson thanks her for the way she asked her question, and says he will write to her ""as soon as I can"". The SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford asks the PM why the government is trying to strike down a law passed in Scotland to embed the UN convention on the rights of the child into the country's law. ""How does protecting children's rights in Scotland threaten the Tory government in London,"" he asks. Boris Johnson says the government ratified the UN convention 30 years ago. ""This is simply an attempt by the SNP to stir up constitutional chaos,"" he adds. Mr Blackford asks the PM to withdraw the legal challenge ""otherwise we'll see you in court"". But Mr Johnson says the SNP should ""improve their shameful record on education"". Reality Check Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for a wider
inquiry into lobbying and the contact between the government and former prime
minister David Cameron about the finance firm Greensill Capital. Boris Johnson has asked Nigel Boardman, a government lawyer,
to conduct a review by the end of June, looking into the development and use of
so-called supply chain finance schemes (the things Greensill was involved with)
in government, and especially the role of Greensill Capital and its founder. The government says that Mr Boardman will have access to all
the information he needs. But the investigation has no power of sanction and no legal
force. Labour is calling instead for a committee of government and
opposition MPs to be set up, which will take a broader look at the lobbying of
ministers and will have the power to summon and question witnesses in public. You can read more about the affair here. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

A teenager hasbecome one of the youngest people in the UK to become fully vaccinatedagainst Covid-19. Ellie, from Bourne in Lincolnshire, works at weekends at Yew Tree Residential Care Home, making drinks and playing games with residents. Despite only being 16, her part-time job at the home means she was eligible. When offered the jab, she said it was important to take it to help protect the care home residents from the virus. The teenager, who is studying for her GCSEs, also helps look after her grandma, who lives with the family and is vulnerable due to a health condition. ""Being protected just helps me feel a lot safer around everyone,"" Ellie says. ""I don't have to worry about going into school, picking it up, and bringing it back home."" On the subject of work, Ellie said: ""I tidy rooms, make tea and play dominos with the residents, and they love it. ""It doesn't really feel like a job and I get to drink tea whenever I want.""

But a shocking aspect of Covid-19 in Brazil is the number of babies dying. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 1,300 babies under the age of one have died from the virus. With exclusive access to one childrenâs ICU in the northeast of the country, BBC Brazilâs Nathalia Passarinho speaks to staff about caring for these critically ill children. Vaccinations are ""successful"" at reducing hospital admissions, the head of the NHS in England says. Sir Simon Stevens has been speaking as a new study shows a 75% reduced risk of emergency hospital admission among people who have received the Pfizer vaccine. The study by the NHS and the University of Manchester has found older people who have received the jab are less likely to be admitted to hospital, and less likely to have a positive test, compared with those who have not been vaccinated. Researchers examined data on more than 170,000 people aged 80 to 83 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine between 15 and 20 December last year. They compared this information with ""matched controls"" aged 76 to 79 who had not yet received the jab. Sir Simon says: ""Vaccines are successfully reducing hospitalisations and deaths amongst the cohorts that have had the vaccine. ""Data that we have analysed shows a 75% reduction in emergency Covid hospitalisations for the vaccination cohorts and, as more and more people are vaccinated, that effect will widen."" Residents in some areas of Smethwick in the West Midlands are being urged to get tested for coronavirus after a case of the South Africa variant was detected. It comes as the ""largest surge testing operation to date"" is being carried out in London after cases were identified there. Sandwell Council haspublished a list of postcodes,externalin Smethwick and Cape Hill where people should get tested.

I mean, there's really no substitute for that. ""But one of the things that kept me going through the lockdown [has been] being able to play music and set up little studios, wherever."" He says he feels lucky to have ""a couple of places"" and a ""nice garden"". ""I'm very lucky. I don't have the problems of living, say in a small flat in London or New York, which some of my friends have had,"" Sir Mick tells the radio host. ""Two kids in a two room flat in Manhattan?

Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows 88,000 people died from drug overdoses in the 12 month period ending in August 2020 - an increase of 27% on the previous year. The US authorities say the increase has been driven by illegally manufactured synthetic opioids. Peter Canning, a paramedic in Connecticut, has just released a book, Killing Season, about the crisis. He tells BBC World News the problem is being made worse by the isolation many people have had to endure during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Immediately after Covid struck us here, we started to see an increase in the deaths. The problem is that Covid, by increasing isolation... you have more people who are now using alone.""

The European Union will get 50 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine months earlier than expected. Itâs good news forthe blocâs slow and struggling inoculation programme, after further setbacks with the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccines due to rare
side effects. The Pfizer jabs were
initially expected at the end of the year, but they will now arrive by
the end of June. EU Commission chief Ursula
von der Leyen says ""there are still many factors that can disrupt the
planned delivery schedules of vaccines"", referring to the J&J delay. ""It is therefore
important to act swiftly, anticipate and adjust whenever it is possible."" Denmark has announced it will stop using the AstraZeneca vaccinefollowing a small number of blood clotting
cases.Meanwhile J&J has paused its shipments to Europe because of similar reports. Further safety investigations are being done on both vaccines. There will be a long Covid clinic in each area in England, head of the NHS Sir Simon Stevens says. He says people suffering from long-term after-effects after a Covid-19 infection need a ""clear front door"" to getting help.

Sir Simon pledges there will be one for each local health area, with figures showing hundreds of thousands are continuing to suffer, several months after their first infection. There are a wide range of common long Covid symptoms including fatigue, shortness of breath, insomnia, chest pain, and problems with memory and concentration. You can read more about long Covid here. Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent This video can not be played 'I saw them more than my own family' A year on from the peak in coronavirus deaths among care home residents in England and Wales, there are increasing calls for a public inquiry. Many in the sector believe the government ignored their plight until the death toll made that impossible to do. Twelve months ago, nursing associate Damian Mann was desperately trying to save the lives of people he spends more time with than his relatives, every day. He works at Wren Hall Nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where 13 residents died with Covid-19 between the end of March and mid-April 2020. ""Some of the people have lived here for five, six years. I see them more than my own family,"" he says. ""And then they're not here any more."" Damian was working on a hastily set-up isolation unit. He was one of just a few staff who didn't contract the virus, so saw resident after resident pass away. ""We would always make sure someone was with them,"" he says. Read more here.

Soutik BiswasIndia Correspondent ""Will a lockdown happen again?"" Over a grainy video call last week from a grotty little room in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the Sethi brothers repeatedly asked me this question, their voices trembling in nervousness. More than a decade ago, Santosh and Tunna Sethi left their families and homes in the eastern state of Orissa, also called Odisha, in search of work. They arrived in Mumbai, more than 1,600km (994 miles) away. Here, the brothers toiled in the shadows of the city's imposing skyscrapers that migrant workers build for the affluent. Ferrying cement, sand, bricks and stones, they earned 450 rupees ($6; Â£4.35) every day for eight hours of work. They lived, ate and slept in unfinished buildings, and sent most of their savings home to support their families. With more than three million reported Covid-19 infections, the state of Maharashtra, which has Mumbai as its capital, is the stubborn epicentre of India's second wave of infections. The government has beenwarning of a full lockdownunless cases begin to fall. Fear has gripped the Sethi brothers again. ""Will we have to return home? Do you have any information?"" they ask.

Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows 88,000 people died from drug overdoses in the 12 month period ending in August 2020 - an increase of 27% on the previous year. The US authorities say the increase has been driven by illegally manufactured synthetic opioids. Peter Canning, a paramedic in Connecticut, has just released a book, Killing Season, about the crisis. He tells BBC World News the problem is being made worse by the isolation many people have had to endure during the coronavirus pandemic.

There will be a long Covid clinic in each area in England, head of the NHS Sir Simon Stevens says. He says people suffering from long-term after-effects after a Covid-19 infection need a ""clear front door"" to getting help.

Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent This video can not be played 'I saw them more than my own family' A year on from the peak in coronavirus deaths among care home residents in England and Wales, there are increasing calls for a public inquiry. Many in the sector believe the government ignored their plight until the death toll made that impossible to do. Twelve months ago, nursing associate Damian Mann was desperately trying to save the lives of people he spends more time with than his relatives, every day. He works at Wren Hall Nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where 13 residents died with Covid-19 between the end of March and mid-April 2020. ""Some of the people have lived here for five, six years. I see them more than my own family,"" he says. ""And then they're not here any more."" Damian was working on a hastily set-up isolation unit. He was one of just a few staff who didn't contract the virus, so saw resident after resident pass away. ""We would always make sure someone was with them,"" he says. Read more here. Scottish businesses say they are ""close to exhaustion"" after 12 months of ""some of the most challenging trading conditions in modern history"".

Soutik BiswasIndia Correspondent ""Will a lockdown happen again?"" Over a grainy video call last week from a grotty little room in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the Sethi brothers repeatedly asked me this question, their voices trembling in nervousness. More than a decade ago, Santosh and Tunna Sethi left their families and homes in the eastern state of Orissa, also called Odisha, in search of work. They arrived in Mumbai, more than 1,600km (994 miles) away. Here, the brothers toiled in the shadows of the city's imposing skyscrapers that migrant workers build for the affluent. Ferrying cement, sand, bricks and stones, they earned 450 rupees ($6; Â£4.35) every day for eight hours of work. They lived, ate and slept in unfinished buildings, and sent most of their savings home to support their families. With more than three million reported Covid-19 infections, the state of Maharashtra, which has Mumbai as its capital, is the stubborn epicentre of India's second wave of infections. The government has beenwarning of a full lockdownunless cases begin to fall. Fear has gripped the Sethi brothers again. ""Will we have to return home? Do you have any information?"" they ask.

Covid test firm cuts prices for holidaymakers,"The cost of coronavirus testing for holidaymakers has been cut amid growing pressure from the travel industry. Randox, one of the biggest suppliers of PCR tests under the UK's ""testing for travel"" scheme, has reduced the price from Â£100 to Â£60. But travel organisation Abta warned that the cost was still a ""significant restriction"". Other industry figures including the boss of Easyjet have said the requirement could price out travellers. Foreign holidays are currently banned, and returning travellers have to quarantine on arrival. The earliest possible date for foreign travel from England has previously been given as 17 May, but it has not been confirmed. The first ministers of Scotland and Wales have argued that it is too early for foreign holidays. For England, destination countries will be in one of three categories (green, amber or red) and each one will require passengers to take a pre-departure Covid test as well as a PCR test on return to the UK. Consumer group Which? has estimated that each PCR test - which is just one of the tests needed - could cost about Â£120 per person. People can start thinking about foreign travel - Shapps When can I go on holiday abroad or in the UK? Test travel regime must be easy and cheap, says PM Mark Tanzer, chief executive of the Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA), said that although one of the leading suppliers had cut costs, ""Â£60 is still a lot of money"" - particularly for families of four or five. He added that a ""better solution is to not have a PCR test"", speaking in front of the Transport Select Committee. MPs also questioned why PCR tests are typically up to 80% cheaper overseas. Mr Tanzer said: ""I can't see anything in the UK that is different about PCR that means it is more expensive there than elsewhere"". Criticism has come from other parts of the industry looking to salvage a key period of summer trade. Johan Lundgren, the chief executive of Easyjet, said on Wednesday: ""Easyjet was founded to make travel accessible for all and so we continue to engage with government to ensure that the cost of the required testing is driven down"". Mr Lundgren added that may ""risk turning back the clock and make travel too costly for some"". The airline also said that many European countries were planning to resume flying ""at scale"" in May. Bookings for summer travel, dependent on restrictions easing, will help boost the airline's finances which have been squeezed during the pandemic. Passenger numbers for the six months to 31 March fell by 89% to 4.1 million. This led to total group revenue for the same period dropping by 90% to Â£235m, while it expects a pre-tax loss of Â£690-730m. Easyjet said that has enough flexibility to ""significantly ramp capacity up or down quickly"", according to demand for flights. ""Customers are booking closer to departure and visibility remains limited"", it said. But overall between April and the end of June, it expects to fly up to 20% of 2019 capacity levels. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps recently told the BBC that for the first time he was not ""advising against booking foreign holidays"". This video can not be played Grant Shapps: ""The tests are coming out too expensive, we are trying to drive that down."" ""Yes, you'll want to check what the situation is in two or three weeks' time when that list [of countries] - the green, amber, red, is produced - you'll want to know that you've got good holiday insurance and flexible flights and the rest of it. ""But for the first time I think there is light at the end of the tunnel and we'll be able to restart international travel, including cruises by the way, in a safe and secure way, knowing about the vaccinations, everything we know about the disease this year, and of course that abundance of caution - having the tests in place."" The government has said it would work with airlines, travel firms and the test providers to see whether prices of tests can be reduced. That could involve cheaper tests, or the government providing the pre-departure tests. People 'can start thinking about foreign travel' UK holidays: What are the rules?

Ellie, from Bourne in Lincolnshire, works at weekends at Yew Tree Residential Care Home, making drinks and playing games with residents. Despite only being 16, her part-time job at the home means she was eligible. When offered the jab, she said it was important to take it to help protect the care home residents from the virus. The teenager, who is studying for her GCSEs, also helps look after her grandma, who lives with the family and is vulnerable due to a health condition. ""Being protected just helps me feel a lot safer around everyone,"" Ellie says. ""I don't have to worry about going into school, picking it up, and bringing it back home."" On the subject of work, Ellie said: ""I tidy rooms, make tea and play dominos with the residents, and they love it. ""It doesn't really feel like a job and I get to drink tea whenever I want.""

But a shocking aspect of Covid-19 in Brazil is the number of babies dying. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 1,300 babies under the age of one have died from the virus. With exclusive access to one childrenâs ICU in the northeast of the country, BBC Brazilâs Nathalia Passarinho speaks to staff about caring for these critically ill children. Vaccinations are ""successful"" at reducing hospital admissions, the head of the NHS in England says. Sir Simon Stevens has been speaking as a new study shows a 75% reduced risk of emergency hospital admission among people who have received the Pfizer vaccine. The study by the NHS and the University of Manchester has found older people who have received the jab are less likely to be admitted to hospital, and less likely to have a positive test, compared with those who have not been vaccinated. Researchers examined data on more than 170,000 people aged 80 to 83 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine between 15 and 20 December last year. They compared this information with ""matched controls"" aged 76 to 79 who had not yet received the jab. Sir Simon says: ""Vaccines are successfully reducing hospitalisations and deaths amongst the cohorts that have had the vaccine. ""Data that we have analysed shows a 75% reduction in emergency Covid hospitalisations for the vaccination cohorts and, as more and more people are vaccinated, that effect will widen.""

The US authorities say the increase has been driven by illegally manufactured synthetic opioids. Peter Canning, a paramedic in Connecticut, has just released a book, Killing Season, about the crisis. He tells BBC World News the problem is being made worse by the isolation many people have had to endure during the coronavirus pandemic.

Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent This video can not be played 'I saw them more than my own family' A year on from the peak in coronavirus deaths among care home residents in England and Wales, there are increasing calls for a public inquiry. Many in the sector believe the government ignored their plight until the death toll made that impossible to do. Twelve months ago, nursing associate Damian Mann was desperately trying to save the lives of people he spends more time with than his relatives, every day. He works at Wren Hall Nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where 13 residents died with Covid-19 between the end of March and mid-April 2020. ""Some of the people have lived here for five, six years. I see them more than my own family,"" he says. ""And then they're not here any more."" Damian was working on a hastily set-up isolation unit. He was one of just a few staff who didn't contract the virus, so saw resident after resident pass away. ""We would always make sure someone was with them,"" he says. Read more here.

Soutik BiswasIndia Correspondent ""Will a lockdown happen again?"" Over a grainy video call last week from a grotty little room in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the Sethi brothers repeatedly asked me this question, their voices trembling in nervousness. More than a decade ago, Santosh and Tunna Sethi left their families and homes in the eastern state of Orissa, also called Odisha, in search of work. They arrived in Mumbai, more than 1,600km (994 miles) away. Here, the brothers toiled in the shadows of the city's imposing skyscrapers that migrant workers build for the affluent. Ferrying cement, sand, bricks and stones, they earned 450 rupees ($6; Â£4.35) every day for eight hours of work. They lived, ate and slept in unfinished buildings, and sent most of their savings home to support their families. With more than three million reported Covid-19 infections, the state of Maharashtra, which has Mumbai as its capital, is the stubborn epicentre of India's second wave of infections. The government has beenwarning of a full lockdownunless cases begin to fall. Fear has gripped the Sethi brothers again. ""Will we have to return home? Do you have any information?"" they ask.

Terror attack victim 'had chalk-white face'A retired judge describes seeing the attack unfold from a balcony at Fishmongers' Hall in London.,"Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were killed during a conference on rehabilitating offenders A charity office manager has described being repeatedly stabbed during the terror attack at Fishmongers' Hall. Isobel Rowbotham told the inquest jury that she pleaded with convicted terrorist Usman Khan as he approached her on 29 November, 2019. She had just seen Jack Merritt moments after he had been fatally wounded by Khan in the toilets. ""He was shouting that he'd been stabbed,"" she told the inquest at London's Guildhall. ""He was holding his stomach. Obviously he'd been injured. There was a lot of blood."" Ms Rowbotham described Khan as moving towards her ""quite fast"" and ""purposively"". She said: ""I was obviously saying 'no Usman, please.' It was quite obvious he wasn't going to stop."" Charity office manager Isobel Rowbotham pleaded with Usman Khan not to attack her as he approached with two knives Ms Rowbotham said she hunched down to try to protect herself but was stabbed multiple times. ""It felt more like punches, I guess,"" she continued. ""His final stabs were in my neck. ""It felt like he thought they were the final stabs, as if they were intended to finish me."" The court heard she lay on the floor and ""decided to play dead in case he came back again...I tried to slow down my breathing."" Usman Khan (left) sat at the same table as Saskia Jones (right) Ms Rowbotham said she wanted to call the police on her mobile but ""there was too much blood to press the screen."" Saskia Jones, 23, and 25-year-old Mr Merritt both died after being stabbed by Khan at the prisoner rehabilitation conference being held in Fishmongers' Hall. The inquest also heard that Mr Merritt had rebooked a rail ticket for his killer after Khan's train to London was cancelled. Simon Larmour, a Learning Together research associate, said he received a panicked phone call from Khan on the day of the attack saying his train from Stafford had been cancelled. Jurors heard that one of Khan's knives had a crudely etched Arabic symbol for Allah on it The court previously heard that during the journey, Khan strapped a fake suicide bomb to his waist whilst in the train toilet. Khan was met at Euston station by Mr Larmour and John Crilly - who would later help with attempts to subdue Khan on London Bridge. ""I saw Usman coming towards Issy (Isobel Rowbotham) and me with two knives,"" Mr Lamour said. ""He was yelling but I didn't really understand what he was saying."" Jurors were told that Mr Merritt had had some professional dealings with Khan before the Learning Together event Mr Larmour said he leapt over the table and ran to the reception area where he gave first aid to Mr Merritt. ""I couldn't see all the places he had been stabbed. I was stunned at that point. I tried to find the nearest material I could to put pressure on the wounds. ""He passed out quite quickly. He was moaning a little bit. His eyes were glazed over. He was pale."" The inquest also heard from retired judge John Samuels, who saw Ms Jones lying at the foot of a staircase with a ""chalk-white"" face. He was attending the conference, having previously run a training course for prisoner rehabilitation organisation Learning Together in 2018 He told the inquest how he was on the balcony of the building's grand entrance hall as the attack unfolded. ''I heard shouts and screams coming from downstairs and I could not understand what was happening,"" he said. ""The first sounds were male shouts, the shouts were angry and confused."" Fishmongers' Hall, below London Bridge Mr Samuels described how he then saw Ms Jones lying on the floor. ""I noted particularly her face was chalk-white, she appeared unconscious to me or perhaps even dead,"" he said. Terror offender monitoring rules lawful 'I quickly realised something bad had happened' Terror attack victim's life 'was a triumph' Mr Samuels then saw one of the organisers of the event, Dr Amy Ludlow, shouting ''police, ambulance, now'' into her mobile phone. Having been told to evacuate, Mr Samuels said he then heard an ''authoritative voice'' outside saying that there was a bomb and he should find shelter. Usman Khan was jailed in 2012 over a plot to blow up the London Stock Exchange Mr Samuels said he now assumed the voice had been that of a police officer. The inquest is scheduled to last nine weeks and is expected to be followed by a separate jury inquest into the death of Khan.

As expected, the lobbying row dominated most of PMQs, but in case you missed it, here are the highlights from today's session: Reality Check Prime

to get rid of the rules on lobbying. In 2019,Labourâs manifesto,externaldid

Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent It was no surprise
that Sir Keir Starmer focussed on what he called âthe return of Tory sleazeâ. Labour feels this is a fruitful line of attack against the government and the
review its set up isnât fit for purpose. The prime ministerâs response relied
on a two-pronged strategy. First, what you might call the quick sidestep - to say heâs concerned about lobbying and then say Sir Keir should forward any
concerns he has to the review itself. Second was the swift segue, when Sir Keir
said the prime ministerâs arguments reminded him of his time as a prosecutor in
court and what he called ""the shoplifterâs defence"". Boris Johnson
recalled his own time as Mayor of London cutting crime and murder rates, adding
he was now busy rolling out vaccines. Shortly MPs will begin a debate on a Labour motion, which calls for a broader inquiry into lobbying by a cross-party panel of MPs. Speaking to the BBC, Labour's Rachel Reeves argued the remit of the inquiry launched by the government was ""too narrow"" just focusing on Greensill ""when we know the issues around
lobbying and access go much wider than that"". She also accused the
government of hand-picking ""a close friend of the Conservative party"" to lead the inquiry. However, Boris Johnson defended the inquiry, arguing that Labour's plan would mean politicians ""marking their own homework"". You can watch the debate on BBC Parliament. BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme Over to BBC Two's Politics Live, and our political editor Laura Kuenssberg speaks about the lobbying focus of the exchanges. She says Keir Starmer was embracing his former life as a lawyer in this PMQs,  and was trying to make himself out to be a ""sleaze-buster"" in the House of Commons. She says the Labour Party wants to make this into a broad, and consistent attack on the government. Labour are trying to make an impression that ""this culture is endemic in government"", which the Conservatives deny. Right now, Boris Johnson has no appetite to have a wholesale inquiry, she adds. Successive governments ""have grappled with this for years and years and years"", but the various organisations designed to look over lobbying don't have teeth. One watchdog only has powers to send ""polite, but strongly worded letters"" to warn former ministers, she says. The final question comes from Conservative Gareth Davies, who asks what is being done to tackle littering. Boris Johnson says he shares the MP's ""indignation"" about littering and urges people meeting outdoors ""to obey the basic laws of respect for other people"". He adds that his government is increasing on-the-spot fines for littering. ""Many may think that's draconian, personally I think it is the right thing to do,"" says the PM. He also urges people to ""tick off"" litterers. And that concludes today's PMQs. Labour MP Matt Western uses an old Turkish proverb in his question to the PM, saying: ""The fish rots from the head down."" He says since Boris Johnson became prime minister, ""Big Ben bongs"" have been replaced by ""bungs"". He lists accusations made against the government of lobbying, including Greensill, contracts on PPE granted to Tory donors and friends of Health Secretary Matt Hancock. But Boris Johnson says ""he is wrong in this instance"" and he doesn't believe Mr Western should have spoken in that way. He says there is ""one party which has brought in tough lobbying rules"", accusing Labour of giving too much power to trade unions. Labour's Kim Johnson says ""contrary to the race report""released earlier this month, institutional racism still exists. She asks the PM to answer allegations that Downing Street redrafted the report to change the narrative and urges him to withdraw it entirely. Boris Johnson says the report has ""interesting observations"", but adds that the government ""wouldn't necessarily agree"" with everything in it. He adds that his government will ""do everything we can"" to tackle inequality. Conservative Sir Peter Bottomley says the successful roll out of the vaccination programme is based on the dedication of NHS staff, who make it ""so easy for so many people"". Boris Johnson says this has been a ""colossal team effort"" with ""GPs often doing the lion's share of the work"" but supported by the army and other organisations. Labour's Ruth Cadbury asks Boris Johnson when he last spoke to David Cameron. ""I cannot remember when I last spoke to Dave,"" the PM replies. He adds that he has not had any contact with the former PM ""about the matters that have been in the press"". Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft asks a question in sign language. She then says ""if the prime minister doesn't understand, why does he still not have sign language at his press briefings?"" She asks what the point of the new Â£2m press briefing room is if it is not inclusive for disabled people. Boris Johnson thanks her for the way she asked her question, and says he will write to her ""as soon as I can"". The SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford asks the PM why the government is trying to strike down a law passed in Scotland to embed the UN convention on the rights of the child into the country's law. ""How does protecting children's rights in Scotland threaten the Tory government in London,"" he asks. Boris Johnson says the government ratified the UN convention 30 years ago. ""This is simply an attempt by the SNP to stir up constitutional chaos,"" he adds. Mr Blackford asks the PM to withdraw the legal challenge ""otherwise we'll see you in court"". But Mr Johnson says the SNP should ""improve their shameful record on education"". Reality Check Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for a wider
inquiry into lobbying and the contact between the government and former prime
minister David Cameron about the finance firm Greensill Capital. Boris Johnson has asked Nigel Boardman, a government lawyer,
to conduct a review by the end of June, looking into the development and use of
so-called supply chain finance schemes (the things Greensill was involved with)
in government, and especially the role of Greensill Capital and its founder. The government says that Mr Boardman will have access to all
the information he needs. But the investigation has no power of sanction and no legal
force. Labour is calling instead for a committee of government and
opposition MPs to be set up, which will take a broader look at the lobbying of
ministers and will have the power to summon and question witnesses in public. You can read more about the affair here. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

A teenager hasbecome one of the youngest people in the UK to become fully vaccinatedagainst Covid-19. Ellie, from Bourne in Lincolnshire, works at weekends at Yew Tree Residential Care Home, making drinks and playing games with residents. Despite only being 16, her part-time job at the home means she was eligible. When offered the jab, she said it was important to take it to help protect the care home residents from the virus. The teenager, who is studying for her GCSEs, also helps look after her grandma, who lives with the family and is vulnerable due to a health condition. ""Being protected just helps me feel a lot safer around everyone,"" Ellie says. ""I don't have to worry about going into school, picking it up, and bringing it back home."" On the subject of work, Ellie said: ""I tidy rooms, make tea and play dominos with the residents, and they love it. ""It doesn't really feel like a job and I get to drink tea whenever I want.""

But a shocking aspect of Covid-19 in Brazil is the number of babies dying. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 1,300 babies under the age of one have died from the virus. With exclusive access to one childrenâs ICU in the northeast of the country, BBC Brazilâs Nathalia Passarinho speaks to staff about caring for these critically ill children. Vaccinations are ""successful"" at reducing hospital admissions, the head of the NHS in England says. Sir Simon Stevens has been speaking as a new study shows a 75% reduced risk of emergency hospital admission among people who have received the Pfizer vaccine. The study by the NHS and the University of Manchester has found older people who have received the jab are less likely to be admitted to hospital, and less likely to have a positive test, compared with those who have not been vaccinated. Researchers examined data on more than 170,000 people aged 80 to 83 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine between 15 and 20 December last year. They compared this information with ""matched controls"" aged 76 to 79 who had not yet received the jab. Sir Simon says: ""Vaccines are successfully reducing hospitalisations and deaths amongst the cohorts that have had the vaccine. ""Data that we have analysed shows a 75% reduction in emergency Covid hospitalisations for the vaccination cohorts and, as more and more people are vaccinated, that effect will widen."" Residents in some areas of Smethwick in the West Midlands are being urged to get tested for coronavirus after a case of the South Africa variant was detected.

I mean, there's really no substitute for that. ""But one of the things that kept me going through the lockdown [has been] being able to play music and set up little studios, wherever."" He says he feels lucky to have ""a couple of places"" and a ""nice garden"". ""I'm very lucky.

The US authorities say the increase has been driven by illegally manufactured synthetic opioids. Peter Canning, a paramedic in Connecticut, has just released a book, Killing Season, about the crisis. He tells BBC World News the problem is being made worse by the isolation many people have had to endure during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Immediately after Covid struck us here, we started to see an increase in the deaths. The problem is that Covid, by increasing isolation... you have more people who are now using alone."" A pigeon has caused a Covid-19 testing site to be temporarily closed for more than four hours. The Centre AT7 site in Coventry closed at about 11:30 BST after the bird flew into the building.

The European Union will get 50 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine months earlier than expected. Itâs good news forthe blocâs slow and struggling inoculation programme, after further setbacks with the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccines due to rare
side effects. The Pfizer jabs were
initially expected at the end of the year, but they will now arrive by
the end of June. EU Commission chief Ursula
von der Leyen says ""there are still many factors that can disrupt the
planned delivery schedules of vaccines"", referring to the J&J delay. ""It is therefore
important to act swiftly, anticipate and adjust whenever it is possible."" Denmark has announced it will stop using the AstraZeneca vaccinefollowing a small number of blood clotting
cases.Meanwhile J&J has paused its shipments to Europe because of similar reports. Further safety investigations are being done on both vaccines. There will be a long Covid clinic in each area in England, head of the NHS Sir Simon Stevens says. He says people suffering from long-term after-effects after a Covid-19 infection need a ""clear front door"" to getting help. There are already 63 long Covid clinics in England, with a further 83 opening by the end of the month. Sir Simon pledges there will be one for each local health area, with figures showing hundreds of thousands are continuing to suffer, several months after their first infection. There are a wide range of common long Covid symptoms including fatigue, shortness of breath, insomnia, chest pain, and problems with memory and concentration. You can read more about long Covid here. Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent This video can not be played 'I saw them more than my own family' A year on from the peak in coronavirus deaths among care home residents in England and Wales, there are increasing calls for a public inquiry. Many in the sector believe the government ignored their plight until the death toll made that impossible to do. Twelve months ago, nursing associate Damian Mann was desperately trying to save the lives of people he spends more time with than his relatives, every day. He works at Wren Hall Nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where 13 residents died with Covid-19 between the end of March and mid-April 2020. ""Some of the people have lived here for five, six years. I see them more than my own family,"" he says. ""And then they're not here any more."" Damian was working on a hastily set-up isolation unit. He was one of just a few staff who didn't contract the virus, so saw resident after resident pass away. ""We would always make sure someone was with them,"" he says. Read more here.

Soutik BiswasIndia Correspondent ""Will a lockdown happen again?"" Over a grainy video call last week from a grotty little room in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the Sethi brothers repeatedly asked me this question, their voices trembling in nervousness. More than a decade ago, Santosh and Tunna Sethi left their families and homes in the eastern state of Orissa, also called Odisha, in search of work. They arrived in Mumbai, more than 1,600km (994 miles) away. Here, the brothers toiled in the shadows of the city's imposing skyscrapers that migrant workers build for the affluent. Ferrying cement, sand, bricks and stones, they earned 450 rupees ($6; Â£4.35) every day for eight hours of work. They lived, ate and slept in unfinished buildings, and sent most of their savings home to support their families. With more than three million reported Covid-19 infections, the state of Maharashtra, which has Mumbai as its capital, is the stubborn epicentre of India's second wave of infections. The government has beenwarning of a full lockdownunless cases begin to fall. Fear has gripped the Sethi brothers again. ""Will we have to return home? Do you have any information?"" they ask.

A teenager hasbecome one of the youngest people in the UK to become fully vaccinatedagainst Covid-19. Ellie, from Bourne in Lincolnshire, works at weekends at Yew Tree Residential Care Home, making drinks and playing games with residents. Despite only being 16, her part-time job at the home means she was eligible. When offered the jab, she said it was important to take it to help protect the care home residents from the virus. The teenager, who is studying for her GCSEs, also helps look after her grandma, who lives with the family and is vulnerable due to a health condition. ""Being protected just helps me feel a lot safer around everyone,"" Ellie says. ""I don't have to worry about going into school, picking it up, and bringing it back home."" On the subject of work, Ellie said: ""I tidy rooms, make tea and play dominos with the residents, and they love it. ""It doesn't really feel like a job and I get to drink tea whenever I want.""

But a shocking aspect of Covid-19 in Brazil is the number of babies dying. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 1,300 babies under the age of one have died from the virus. With exclusive access to one childrenâs ICU in the northeast of the country, BBC Brazilâs Nathalia Passarinho speaks to staff about caring for these critically ill children. Vaccinations are ""successful"" at reducing hospital admissions, the head of the NHS in England says. Sir Simon Stevens has been speaking as a new study shows a 75% reduced risk of emergency hospital admission among people who have received the Pfizer vaccine. The study by the NHS and the University of Manchester has found older people who have received the jab are less likely to be admitted to hospital, and less likely to have a positive test, compared with those who have not been vaccinated. Researchers examined data on more than 170,000 people aged 80 to 83 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine between 15 and 20 December last year. They compared this information with ""matched controls"" aged 76 to 79 who had not yet received the jab. Sir Simon says: ""Vaccines are successfully reducing hospitalisations and deaths amongst the cohorts that have had the vaccine. ""Data that we have analysed shows a 75% reduction in emergency Covid hospitalisations for the vaccination cohorts and, as more and more people are vaccinated, that effect will widen."" Residents in some areas of Smethwick in the West Midlands are being urged to get tested for coronavirus after a case of the South Africa variant was detected. It comes as the ""largest surge testing operation to date"" is being carried out in London after cases were identified there. Sandwell Council haspublished a list of postcodes,externalin Smethwick and Cape Hill where people should get tested. The authority is urging all residents in those areas to get tested, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated. Read more here. Rolling Stones frontman Sir Mick Jagger says he's coped with lockdown by staying ""pretty creative"" and focusing on music. ""I've written a lot of songs and finished records,"" he tellsBBC 6 Music's Matt Everitt. ""Obviously, it's not as good as being together in the same room with a group of musicians. I mean, there's really no substitute for that. ""But one of the things that kept me going through the lockdown [has been] being able to play music and set up little studios, wherever."" He says he feels lucky to have ""a couple of places"" and a ""nice garden"". ""I'm very lucky. I don't have the problems of living, say in a small flat in London or New York, which some of my friends have had,"" Sir Mick tells the radio host. ""Two kids in a two room flat in Manhattan?

No 10 reject wider inquiry,"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: Boris Johnson is 'blocking a proper inquiry' The government has defeated Labour plans for a parliamentary inquiry into lobbying, amid a row over contacts with finance firm Greensill Capital. Sir Keir Starmer had wanted a ""full"" probe, including public hearings by a cross-party panel of MPs. Boris Johnson has insisted the lawyer he appointed this week to carry out a review of the affair will lead a ""proper"" inquiry. And he said the Tories had been ""consistently tough on lobbying"". Earlier, Sir Keir said the Greensill affair demonstrated ""sleaze and cronyism"" at the ""heart"" of the Conservative Party. A row about lobbying has centred on attempts by Greensill Capital, a specialist bank whichcollapsed in March, to influence government ministers and top civil servants. On Wednesday, the Commons Treasury select committee said it planned to launch an inquiry into the ""lessons"" from the firm's demise. David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting' Kuenssberg: Labour's long-term strategy to attack cronyism The government has appointed lawyer Nigel Boardman to look into the matter and report back by the end of June. Labour said a cross-party Commons committee should investigate instead, with a wider remit to recommend changes to lobbying rules. But speaking earlier at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said Labour's proposals would involve MPs ""marking their own homework"". He ordered Tory MPs to vote against the plan, which was defeated by 357 votes to 262. Sleaze - amid stiff competition, it's perhaps the dirtiest word in politics. It's used as shorthand for behaviour that's immoral, inappropriate, corrupt or just plain wrong. And Labour's choice to attach it to the current government's actions is no accident. Sir Keir Starmer is seeking to evoke the scandals of the past which have led to the downfall of Conservative ministers. In the latter years of John Major's government in the 1990s accusations of sleaze were so commonplace it was arguably a factor in them losing power. But while Boris Johnson and his ministers will be keen to avoid accusations of improper behaviour in office, there are dangers for the opposition here too. Labour governments have seen their fair share of scandal in the past and it's a brave politician of any colour who claims to be beyond reproach. Calls to examine lobbying and the relationship between civil servants, politicians and and private firms have intensified in the past week. These have followed revelations about former Prime Minister David Cameron's efforts to influence ministers on behalf of Greensill, where he started working as an adviser in August 2018, two years after he left Downing Street. These involvedtexting Chancellor Rishi Sunakand contacting other ministers about a government-backed Covid loan scheme on behalf of the company. Along with the company's founder Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron also met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" in 2019 todiscuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff. It's another word for trying to persuade the government to change its policies It can be done by individuals, companies, organisations and charities who contact ministers, backbench MPs and other politicians Some organisations and companies employ professional lobbyists to make their case for them Former MPs and civil servants often work as lobbyists Speaking earlier, Sir Keir suggested there was a ""revolving door"" between the government and the private sector. He told MPs: ""I know the prime minister is launching an inquiry. That inquiry isn't even looking at the lobbying rules. ""I'm not sure it's looking at very much at all, because every day there's further evidence of the sleaze that's now at the heart of this Conservative government."" But the prime minster said Mr Boardman would be leading a ""proper independent review,"" and Labour's committee idea would ""not do a blind bit of good"".

Conservative MP William Wragg, who chairs a Commons committee currently looking into business appointments, said the Greensill affair was a ""tasteless, slap-dash and unbecoming episode for any former prime minister"". But, speaking ahead of Wednesday's vote, he suggested Mr Cameron's involvement was a ""red herring"" compared with the wider issues - such as why companies were interested in employing ""de-skilled"" former ministers at all.

In the latter years of John Major's government in the 1990s accusations of sleaze were so commonplace it was arguably a factor in them losing power. But while Boris Johnson and his ministers will be keen to avoid accusations of improper behaviour in office, there are dangers for the opposition here too. Labour governments have seen their fair share of scandal in the past and it's a brave politician of any colour who claims to be beyond reproach. Calls to examine lobbying and the relationship between civil servants, politicians and and private firms have intensified in the past week. These have followed revelations about former Prime Minister David Cameron's efforts to influence ministers on behalf of Greensill, where he started working as an adviser in August 2018, two years after he left Downing Street. These involvedtexting Chancellor Rishi Sunakand contacting other ministers about a government-backed Covid loan scheme on behalf of the company. Along with the company's founder Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron also met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" in 2019 todiscuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff. It's another word for trying to persuade the government to change its policies It can be done by individuals, companies, organisations and charities who contact ministers, backbench MPs and other politicians Some organisations and companies employ professional lobbyists to make their case for them Former MPs and civil servants often work as lobbyists Speaking earlier, Sir Keir suggested there was a ""revolving door"" between the government and the private sector. He told MPs: ""I know the prime minister is launching an inquiry. That inquiry isn't even looking at the lobbying rules. ""I'm not sure it's looking at very much at all, because every day there's further evidence of the sleaze that's now at the heart of this Conservative government."" But the prime minster said Mr Boardman would be leading a ""proper independent review,"" and Labour's committee idea would ""not do a blind bit of good"". Mr Cameron has insisted he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying, although he has acknowledged that he should have communicated with the government ""through only the most formal of channels"". Conservative MP William Wragg, who chairs a Commons committee currently looking into business appointments, said the Greensill affair was a ""tasteless, slap-dash and unbecoming episode for any former prime minister"". But, speaking ahead of Wednesday's vote, he suggested Mr Cameron's involvement was a ""red herring"" compared with the wider issues - such as why companies were interested in employing ""de-skilled"" former ministers at all. Mr Greensill, who worked as an unpaid government adviser during Mr Cameron's early years in Downing Street, has not commented on the row. Mr Cameron has said the idea of him working at Greensill Capital ""was never raised, or considered by me, until well after I left office"". What's the David Cameron lobbying row about?

Pregnant nurseâs family yet to get GoFundMe money,"Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong died five days after her baby was delivered at Luton and Dunstable Hospital, where she worked as a nurse The family of a pregnant nurse who died with Covid-19 have yet to receive any money from a fundraising campaign that names them as beneficiaries. Mary Agyapong, 28, died after giving birth in April 2020 at Luton and Dunstable Hospital, where she worked. A GoFundMe page set up by family friend Rhoda Asiedu has raised more than Â£186,000 and she said the money had been placed into a trust. Ms Agyapong's widower said he found it ""surprising"" he had not been involved. At an inquest last month coroner Emma Whitting found it was ""unclear"" how mother-of-two Ms Agyapong contracted Covid-19 before her death. But at the hearing's conclusion Ms Whitting urged Prime Minister Boris Johnsonto begin a public inquiry into the pandemic. Ernest Boateng said his wife was ""very worried"" for her health while she worked in the pandemic On 15 April 2020an online GoFundMe page was createdby Ms Asiedu, who lives in Birmingham, to support ""Mary's husband, and the couple's children... during this heavy and trying time"". A statement released by Ms Asiedu said it had been placed on trust for the education of Ms Agyapong's children and that 80% would be released when they turned 21. Speaking on behalf of the trust, she said the remaining 20% would be provided to Ms Agyapong's widower Ernest Boateng for ""maintenance and upkeep"" of the children, however he had ""failed to co-operate with the trustees to arrange a schedule of maintenance"". The BBC has not received a response to its request to see the trust documents. Mr Boateng, who is studying law, said he had been ""struggling a bit"" financially. ""I just try to keep my head above the water,"" he said. ""I find it very surprising that we have not been asked or involved with this GoFundMe money - it's beyond my understanding."" Ms Agyapong had collapsed at her home in Luton before she was taken to hospital Wendy Addai, part of the fundraising team, told the BBC: ""We wanted the money to be used in a way which ensured the children's well-being in their adult life as well as their childhood after seeing the huge sum that was raised, which we are very thankful for. ""None of us anticipated for us to raise this much as the original goal was Â£2,000. ""So we went to seek advice from a lawyer, who was finalising agreements with Ernest's lawyers. ""In regards to GoFundMe themselves they requested updates and proof with what was being done with the money but that was as far as their involvement went. Our intentions were and will always remain good and for the interest of Mary's babies."" Ms Agyapong had worked at Luton and Dunstable Hospital for five years GoFundMe said it was always clear the money would be placed in a trust, adding: ""Our records show the wording of the page has not been changed since it launched on 15 April 2020."" But the BBC found an archived snapshot of the webpage on 16 April with no reference to a trust at all. When contacted by the BBC, fundraiser Ms Asiedu directed media requests to her legal team. Clarification on 26 April 2021: Updates story to make it clear that Ms Asiedu released a statement on behalf of the trust.

Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent It was no surprise
that Sir Keir Starmer focussed on what he called âthe return of Tory sleazeâ. Labour feels this is a fruitful line of attack against the government and the
review its set up isnât fit for purpose. The prime ministerâs response relied
on a two-pronged strategy. First, what you might call the quick sidestep - to say heâs concerned about lobbying and then say Sir Keir should forward any
concerns he has to the review itself. Second was the swift segue, when Sir Keir
said the prime ministerâs arguments reminded him of his time as a prosecutor in
court and what he called ""the shoplifterâs defence"". Boris Johnson
recalled his own time as Mayor of London cutting crime and murder rates, adding
he was now busy rolling out vaccines. Shortly MPs will begin a debate on a Labour motion, which calls for a broader inquiry into lobbying by a cross-party panel of MPs. Speaking to the BBC, Labour's Rachel Reeves argued the remit of the inquiry launched by the government was ""too narrow"" just focusing on Greensill ""when we know the issues around
lobbying and access go much wider than that"". She also accused the
government of hand-picking ""a close friend of the Conservative party"" to lead the inquiry. However, Boris Johnson defended the inquiry, arguing that Labour's plan would mean politicians ""marking their own homework"". You can watch the debate on BBC Parliament. BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme Over to BBC Two's Politics Live, and our political editor Laura Kuenssberg speaks about the lobbying focus of the exchanges. She says Keir Starmer was embracing his former life as a lawyer in this PMQs,  and was trying to make himself out to be a ""sleaze-buster"" in the House of Commons. She says the Labour Party wants to make this into a broad, and consistent attack on the government. Labour are trying to make an impression that ""this culture is endemic in government"", which the Conservatives deny. Right now, Boris Johnson has no appetite to have a wholesale inquiry, she adds. Successive governments ""have grappled with this for years and years and years"", but the various organisations designed to look over lobbying don't have teeth. One watchdog only has powers to send ""polite, but strongly worded letters"" to warn former ministers, she says. The final question comes from Conservative Gareth Davies, who asks what is being done to tackle littering. Boris Johnson says he shares the MP's ""indignation"" about littering and urges people meeting outdoors ""to obey the basic laws of respect for other people"". He adds that his government is increasing on-the-spot fines for littering. ""Many may think that's draconian, personally I think it is the right thing to do,"" says the PM. He also urges people to ""tick off"" litterers. And that concludes today's PMQs. Labour MP Matt Western uses an old Turkish proverb in his question to the PM, saying: ""The fish rots from the head down."" He says since Boris Johnson became prime minister, ""Big Ben bongs"" have been replaced by ""bungs"". He lists accusations made against the government of lobbying, including Greensill, contracts on PPE granted to Tory donors and friends of Health Secretary Matt Hancock. But Boris Johnson says ""he is wrong in this instance"" and he doesn't believe Mr Western should have spoken in that way. He says there is ""one party which has brought in tough lobbying rules"", accusing Labour of giving too much power to trade unions. Labour's Kim Johnson says ""contrary to the race report""released earlier this month, institutional racism still exists. She asks the PM to answer allegations that Downing Street redrafted the report to change the narrative and urges him to withdraw it entirely. Boris Johnson says the report has ""interesting observations"", but adds that the government ""wouldn't necessarily agree"" with everything in it. He adds that his government will ""do everything we can"" to tackle inequality. Conservative Sir Peter Bottomley says the successful roll out of the vaccination programme is based on the dedication of NHS staff, who make it ""so easy for so many people"". Boris Johnson says this has been a ""colossal team effort"" with ""GPs often doing the lion's share of the work"" but supported by the army and other organisations. Labour's Ruth Cadbury asks Boris Johnson when he last spoke to David Cameron. ""I cannot remember when I last spoke to Dave,"" the PM replies. He adds that he has not had any contact with the former PM ""about the matters that have been in the press"". Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft asks a question in sign language. She then says ""if the prime minister doesn't understand, why does he still not have sign language at his press briefings?"" She asks what the point of the new Â£2m press briefing room is if it is not inclusive for disabled people. Boris Johnson thanks her for the way she asked her question, and says he will write to her ""as soon as I can"". The SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford asks the PM why the government is trying to strike down a law passed in Scotland to embed the UN convention on the rights of the child into the country's law. ""How does protecting children's rights in Scotland threaten the Tory government in London,"" he asks. Boris Johnson says the government ratified the UN convention 30 years ago. ""This is simply an attempt by the SNP to stir up constitutional chaos,"" he adds. Mr Blackford asks the PM to withdraw the legal challenge ""otherwise we'll see you in court"". But Mr Johnson says the SNP should ""improve their shameful record on education"". Reality Check Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for a wider
inquiry into lobbying and the contact between the government and former prime
minister David Cameron about the finance firm Greensill Capital. Boris Johnson has asked Nigel Boardman, a government lawyer,
to conduct a review by the end of June, looking into the development and use of
so-called supply chain finance schemes (the things Greensill was involved with)
in government, and especially the role of Greensill Capital and its founder. The government says that Mr Boardman will have access to all
the information he needs. But the investigation has no power of sanction and no legal
force. Labour is calling instead for a committee of government and
opposition MPs to be set up, which will take a broader look at the lobbying of
ministers and will have the power to summon and question witnesses in public. You can read more about the affair here. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Call to widen Greensill probe rejected by No 10Tory MPs will vote against Labour's demand for an inquiry that could question witnesses in public.,"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: Boris Johnson is 'blocking a proper inquiry' The government has defeated Labour plans for a parliamentary inquiry into lobbying, amid a row over contacts with finance firm Greensill Capital. Sir Keir Starmer had wanted a ""full"" probe, including public hearings by a cross-party panel of MPs. Boris Johnson has insisted the lawyer he appointed this week to carry out a review of the affair will lead a ""proper"" inquiry. And he said the Tories had been ""consistently tough on lobbying"". Earlier, Sir Keir said the Greensill affair demonstrated ""sleaze and cronyism"" at the ""heart"" of the Conservative Party. A row about lobbying has centred on attempts by Greensill Capital, a specialist bank whichcollapsed in March, to influence government ministers and top civil servants. On Wednesday, the Commons Treasury select committee said it planned to launch an inquiry into the ""lessons"" from the firm's demise. David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting' Kuenssberg: Labour's long-term strategy to attack cronyism The government has appointed lawyer Nigel Boardman to look into the matter and report back by the end of June. Labour said a cross-party Commons committee should investigate instead, with a wider remit to recommend changes to lobbying rules. But speaking earlier at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said Labour's proposals would involve MPs ""marking their own homework"". He ordered Tory MPs to vote against the plan, which was defeated by 357 votes to 262. Sleaze - amid stiff competition, it's perhaps the dirtiest word in politics. It's used as shorthand for behaviour that's immoral, inappropriate, corrupt or just plain wrong. And Labour's choice to attach it to the current government's actions is no accident.

Boris Johnson clashes with Sir Keir Starmer over the best way to investigate allegations. As expected, the lobbying row dominated most of PMQs, but in case you missed it, here are the highlights from today's session: Reality Check Prime
Minister Boris Johnson claimed Labour âcampaignedâ at the last general election
to get rid of the rules on lobbying. In 2019,Labourâs manifesto,externaldid
say: âWe will free the voices of civil society by repealing the Lobbying Act
2014 and overhauling the rules that govern corporate lobbying.â But that came in a section about

Asked why this is the case, Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom says she is a ""big fan"" of sign language interpretation at these press conferences and has ""no idea"" why that isn't being done. Labour MP Chris Bryant says the government in Wales has been doing it in every briefing since the start of the pandemic and calls for it to be introduced in Downing Street. Allow Twitter content?

Damian GrammaticasPolitical correspondent It was no surprise
that Sir Keir Starmer focussed on what he called âthe return of Tory sleazeâ. Labour feels this is a fruitful line of attack against the government and the
review its set up isnât fit for purpose. The prime ministerâs response relied
on a two-pronged strategy. First, what you might call the quick sidestep - to say heâs concerned about lobbying and then say Sir Keir should forward any
concerns he has to the review itself. Second was the swift segue, when Sir Keir
said the prime ministerâs arguments reminded him of his time as a prosecutor in
court and what he called ""the shoplifterâs defence"". Boris Johnson
recalled his own time as Mayor of London cutting crime and murder rates, adding
he was now busy rolling out vaccines. Shortly MPs will begin a debate on a Labour motion, which calls for a broader inquiry into lobbying by a cross-party panel of MPs. Speaking to the BBC, Labour's Rachel Reeves argued the remit of the inquiry launched by the government was ""too narrow"" just focusing on Greensill ""when we know the issues around
lobbying and access go much wider than that"". She also accused the
government of hand-picking ""a close friend of the Conservative party"" to lead the inquiry. However, Boris Johnson defended the inquiry, arguing that Labour's plan would mean politicians ""marking their own homework"". You can watch the debate on BBC Parliament. BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme Over to BBC Two's Politics Live, and our political editor Laura Kuenssberg speaks about the lobbying focus of the exchanges. She says Keir Starmer was embracing his former life as a lawyer in this PMQs,  and was trying to make himself out to be a ""sleaze-buster"" in the House of Commons. She says the Labour Party wants to make this into a broad, and consistent attack on the government. Labour are trying to make an impression that ""this culture is endemic in government"", which the Conservatives deny. Right now, Boris Johnson has no appetite to have a wholesale inquiry, she adds. Successive governments ""have grappled with this for years and years and years"", but the various organisations designed to look over lobbying don't have teeth. One watchdog only has powers to send ""polite, but strongly worded letters"" to warn former ministers, she says. The final question comes from Conservative Gareth Davies, who asks what is being done to tackle littering. Boris Johnson says he shares the MP's ""indignation"" about littering and urges people meeting outdoors ""to obey the basic laws of respect for other people"". He adds that his government is increasing on-the-spot fines for littering. ""Many may think that's draconian, personally I think it is the right thing to do,"" says the PM. He also urges people to ""tick off"" litterers. And that concludes today's PMQs. Labour MP Matt Western uses an old Turkish proverb in his question to the PM, saying: ""The fish rots from the head down."" He says since Boris Johnson became prime minister, ""Big Ben bongs"" have been replaced by ""bungs"". He lists accusations made against the government of lobbying, including Greensill, contracts on PPE granted to Tory donors and friends of Health Secretary Matt Hancock. But Boris Johnson says ""he is wrong in this instance"" and he doesn't believe Mr Western should have spoken in that way. He says there is ""one party which has brought in tough lobbying rules"", accusing Labour of giving too much power to trade unions. Labour's Kim Johnson says ""contrary to the race report""released earlier this month, institutional racism still exists. She asks the PM to answer allegations that Downing Street redrafted the report to change the narrative and urges him to withdraw it entirely. Boris Johnson says the report has ""interesting observations"", but adds that the government ""wouldn't necessarily agree"" with everything in it. He adds that his government will ""do everything we can"" to tackle inequality. Conservative Sir Peter Bottomley says the successful roll out of the vaccination programme is based on the dedication of NHS staff, who make it ""so easy for so many people"". Boris Johnson says this has been a ""colossal team effort"" with ""GPs often doing the lion's share of the work"" but supported by the army and other organisations. Labour's Ruth Cadbury asks Boris Johnson when he last spoke to David Cameron. ""I cannot remember when I last spoke to Dave,"" the PM replies. He adds that he has not had any contact with the former PM ""about the matters that have been in the press"". Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft asks a question in sign language. She then says ""if the prime minister doesn't understand, why does he still not have sign language at his press briefings?"" She asks what the point of the new Â£2m press briefing room is if it is not inclusive for disabled people. Boris Johnson thanks her for the way she asked her question, and says he will write to her ""as soon as I can"". The SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford asks the PM why the government is trying to strike down a law passed in Scotland to embed the UN convention on the rights of the child into the country's law. ""How does protecting children's rights in Scotland threaten the Tory government in London,"" he asks. Boris Johnson says the government ratified the UN convention 30 years ago. ""This is simply an attempt by the SNP to stir up constitutional chaos,"" he adds. Mr Blackford asks the PM to withdraw the legal challenge ""otherwise we'll see you in court"". But Mr Johnson says the SNP should ""improve their shameful record on education"". Reality Check Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for a wider

A teenager hasbecome one of the youngest people in the UK to become fully vaccinatedagainst Covid-19. Ellie, from Bourne in Lincolnshire, works at weekends at Yew Tree Residential Care Home, making drinks and playing games with residents. Despite only being 16, her part-time job at the home means she was eligible. When offered the jab, she said it was important to take it to help protect the care home residents from the virus. The teenager, who is studying for her GCSEs, also helps look after her grandma, who lives with the family and is vulnerable due to a health condition. ""Being protected just helps me feel a lot safer around everyone,"" Ellie says. ""I don't have to worry about going into school, picking it up, and bringing it back home."" On the subject of work, Ellie said: ""I tidy rooms, make tea and play dominos with the residents, and they love it. ""It doesn't really feel like a job and I get to drink tea whenever I want.""

But a shocking aspect of Covid-19 in Brazil is the number of babies dying. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 1,300 babies under the age of one have died from the virus. With exclusive access to one childrenâs ICU in the northeast of the country, BBC Brazilâs Nathalia Passarinho speaks to staff about caring for these critically ill children. Vaccinations are ""successful"" at reducing hospital admissions, the head of the NHS in England says. Sir Simon Stevens has been speaking as a new study shows a 75% reduced risk of emergency hospital admission among people who have received the Pfizer vaccine. The study by the NHS and the University of Manchester has found older people who have received the jab are less likely to be admitted to hospital, and less likely to have a positive test, compared with those who have not been vaccinated. Researchers examined data on more than 170,000 people aged 80 to 83 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine between 15 and 20 December last year. They compared this information with ""matched controls"" aged 76 to 79 who had not yet received the jab. Sir Simon says: ""Vaccines are successfully reducing hospitalisations and deaths amongst the cohorts that have had the vaccine. ""Data that we have analysed shows a 75% reduction in emergency Covid hospitalisations for the vaccination cohorts and, as more and more people are vaccinated, that effect will widen."" Residents in some areas of Smethwick in the West Midlands are being urged to get tested for coronavirus after a case of the South Africa variant was detected. It comes as the ""largest surge testing operation to date"" is being carried out in London after cases were identified there. Sandwell Council haspublished a list of postcodes,externalin Smethwick and Cape Hill where people should get tested. The authority is urging all residents in those areas to get tested, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated. Read more here.

""I've written a lot of songs and finished records,"" he tellsBBC 6 Music's Matt Everitt. ""Obviously, it's not as good as being together in the same room with a group of musicians. I mean, there's really no substitute for that. ""But one of the things that kept me going through the lockdown [has been] being able to play music and set up little studios, wherever."" He says he feels lucky to have ""a couple of places"" and a ""nice garden"". ""I'm very lucky. I don't have the problems of living, say in a small flat in London or New York, which some of my friends have had,"" Sir Mick tells the radio host. ""Two kids in a two room flat in Manhattan?

Provisional data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows 88,000 people died from drug overdoses in the 12 month period ending in August 2020 - an increase of 27% on the previous year. The US authorities say the increase has been driven by illegally manufactured synthetic opioids. Peter Canning, a paramedic in Connecticut, has just released a book, Killing Season, about the crisis. He tells BBC World News the problem is being made worse by the isolation many people have had to endure during the coronavirus pandemic.

The European Union will get 50 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine months earlier than expected. Itâs good news forthe blocâs slow and struggling inoculation programme, after further setbacks with the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) vaccines due to rare
side effects. The Pfizer jabs were
initially expected at the end of the year, but they will now arrive by
the end of June. EU Commission chief Ursula
von der Leyen says ""there are still many factors that can disrupt the
planned delivery schedules of vaccines"", referring to the J&J delay. ""It is therefore
important to act swiftly, anticipate and adjust whenever it is possible."" Denmark has announced it will stop using the AstraZeneca vaccinefollowing a small number of blood clotting

There will be a long Covid clinic in each area in England, head of the NHS Sir Simon Stevens says. He says people suffering from long-term after-effects after a Covid-19 infection need a ""clear front door"" to getting help.

Sir Simon pledges there will be one for each local health area, with figures showing hundreds of thousands are continuing to suffer, several months after their first infection.

Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent This video can not be played 'I saw them more than my own family' A year on from the peak in coronavirus deaths among care home residents in England and Wales, there are increasing calls for a public inquiry. Many in the sector believe the government ignored their plight until the death toll made that impossible to do. Twelve months ago, nursing associate Damian Mann was desperately trying to save the lives of people he spends more time with than his relatives, every day. He works at Wren Hall Nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where 13 residents died with Covid-19 between the end of March and mid-April 2020. ""Some of the people have lived here for five, six years. I see them more than my own family,"" he says. ""And then they're not here any more."" Damian was working on a hastily set-up isolation unit. He was one of just a few staff who didn't contract the virus, so saw resident after resident pass away. ""We would always make sure someone was with them,"" he says. Read more here.

Soutik BiswasIndia Correspondent ""Will a lockdown happen again?"" Over a grainy video call last week from a grotty little room in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the Sethi brothers repeatedly asked me this question, their voices trembling in nervousness. More than a decade ago, Santosh and Tunna Sethi left their families and homes in the eastern state of Orissa, also called Odisha, in search of work. They arrived in Mumbai, more than 1,600km (994 miles) away. Here, the brothers toiled in the shadows of the city's imposing skyscrapers that migrant workers build for the affluent. Ferrying cement, sand, bricks and stones, they earned 450 rupees ($6; Â£4.35) every day for eight hours of work. They lived, ate and slept in unfinished buildings, and sent most of their savings home to support their families. With more than three million reported Covid-19 infections, the state of Maharashtra, which has Mumbai as its capital, is the stubborn epicentre of India's second wave of infections. The government has beenwarning of a full lockdownunless cases begin to fall. Fear has gripped the Sethi brothers again. ""Will we have to return home? Do you have any information?"" they ask.

Sir Simon says: ""Vaccines are successfully reducing hospitalisations and deaths amongst the cohorts that have had the vaccine. ""Data that we have analysed shows a 75% reduction in emergency Covid hospitalisations for the vaccination cohorts and, as more and more people are vaccinated, that effect will widen."" Residents in some areas of Smethwick in the West Midlands are being urged to get tested for coronavirus after a case of the South Africa variant was detected. It comes as the ""largest surge testing operation to date"" is being carried out in London after cases were identified there. Sandwell Council haspublished a list of postcodes,externalin Smethwick and Cape Hill where people should get tested. The authority is urging all residents in those areas to get tested, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated. Read more here.

The US authorities say the increase has been driven by illegally manufactured synthetic opioids. Peter Canning, a paramedic in Connecticut, has just released a book, Killing Season, about the crisis. He tells BBC World News the problem is being made worse by the isolation many people have had to endure during the coronavirus pandemic.

Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent This video can not be played 'I saw them more than my own family' A year on from the peak in coronavirus deaths among care home residents in England and Wales, there are increasing calls for a public inquiry. Many in the sector believe the government ignored their plight until the death toll made that impossible to do. Twelve months ago, nursing associate Damian Mann was desperately trying to save the lives of people he spends more time with than his relatives, every day. He works at Wren Hall Nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where 13 residents died with Covid-19 between the end of March and mid-April 2020. ""Some of the people have lived here for five, six years. I see them more than my own family,"" he says. ""And then they're not here any more."" Damian was working on a hastily set-up isolation unit. He was one of just a few staff who didn't contract the virus, so saw resident after resident pass away. ""We would always make sure someone was with them,"" he says. Read more here.

Soutik BiswasIndia Correspondent ""Will a lockdown happen again?"" Over a grainy video call last week from a grotty little room in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the Sethi brothers repeatedly asked me this question, their voices trembling in nervousness. More than a decade ago, Santosh and Tunna Sethi left their families and homes in the eastern state of Orissa, also called Odisha, in search of work. They arrived in Mumbai, more than 1,600km (994 miles) away. Here, the brothers toiled in the shadows of the city's imposing skyscrapers that migrant workers build for the affluent. Ferrying cement, sand, bricks and stones, they earned 450 rupees ($6; Â£4.35) every day for eight hours of work. They lived, ate and slept in unfinished buildings, and sent most of their savings home to support their families. With more than three million reported Covid-19 infections, the state of Maharashtra, which has Mumbai as its capital, is the stubborn epicentre of India's second wave of infections. The government has beenwarning of a full lockdownunless cases begin to fall. Fear has gripped the Sethi brothers again. ""Will we have to return home? Do you have any information?"" they ask.

The remote island where every adult is now vaccinated,"This video can not be played Fair Isle is the UK's most remote inhabited island It may be one of the UK's most remote communities but tiny Fair Isle - with a population of just 48 people - can now claim to be one of the safest. The Scottish island - located between Orkney and Shetland - is famed for its knitwear and migratory birds. It only got a reliable 24-hour-a-day electricity supply in 2018. This week, vials of AstraZeneca vaccine were flown in on a small plane, meaning every adult on the island was able to have their second dose. It was a practical solution to a tricky problem. The logistics of vaccinating the furthest-flung communities along the edges of Scotland were challenging, to say the least. Fair Isle is three miles long and one-and-a-half miles wide The first vaccine, from Pfizer, required storage temperatures so low that the tiny planes and boats serving these islands were out of the question. For a fragile community, many of whom are older, bringing people out individually to the mainland clinic did not make sense either. However, the AstraZeneca vaccine can be transported in a cool box. So that is exactly what NHS Shetland has done, sending the vials in on the tiny planes that run lifeline services to its smaller isles. The remote island where jumpers are always in fashion Glory of 24-hour power reaches Fair Isle The island is three miles long and one-and-a-half miles wide. When the plane touched down on the rubble airstrip near Fair Isle's 600ft cliffs the sun was shining - the first glimpse of spring after relentless weeks of sleet, snow and gales. The rather unassuming white box was loaded carefully into the nurse's car, and taken down to the small surgery, where nurses Kirstin Robson and Margaret Cooper got ready to vaccinate Fair Isle. Vaccine supplies were flown in this week John Best, the oldest islander, joked with the nurse as he rolled up his sleeve. He said the island feels like ""one of the safest places in the country"" - not only fully vaccinated, but cut off from the threat of infection, with almost no visitors allowed in. ""It's a funny thing"", he said, ""because this was a very welcoming island. And it will be again. ""But it's an element we haven't had for about a year now."" In normal times, Fair Isle defies the clichÃ©s associated with it - ""wild"", ""isolated"" - and is in fact an intensely sociable place, famous for music, dancing, and a warm welcome. The islanders are keen to return to those days. David Parnaby has lived here for 10 years, and his two young children make up half the school roll. Wind is rarely in short supply in exposed Fair Isle, which can come in handy He readily admits there is ""no better place"" to spend lockdown than Fair Isle, with its stunning scenery and nature - but adds that with no pubs or cafes, social life here is heavily dependent on the kind of household visits that have been banned. There is real hope, though, that this second vaccine dose will allow a loosening of restrictions. ""We've been really impressed at the way the NHS has handled it, getting everybody done,"" he said. ""It just gives the whole isle a wee bit more confidence as we start, hopefully, to get back towards normal life here on Fair Isle."" Fair Isle knitwear, shown in this photo from the 1970s, is famed around the world Other remote islands have been vaccinated in this way - some in the Hebrides, along with Shetland's Foula and Skerries. ""Fair Isle was one of those areas in the UK where there were no confirmed cases, so we thought it was important to maintain that as a statistic,"" explained interim director of community health and social care, Brian Chittick. ""We're lucky"", Thomas Fisher said, as he waited his turn outside the surgery. He had a bad reaction to the first dose, but is not complaining. His partner Marie Bruhat agreed, but wanted to stress how vulnerable Fair Isle has been during the pandemic. The vaccinations took the nurses just a morning ""If someone had it, it would spread so quickly,"" she said. ""So knowing that everyone will be covered - to a degree - is going to give more peace of mind."" Vaccinating all of Fair Isle took just a morning. As nurse Kirstin packed up, she reflected on what surely counts as a good day in the life of an island nurse. ""It's been great - after 10 days without a boat we've now got a full shop, the sun is out, the lambs are coming,"" she grinned. Better times ahead, then? ""Absolutely. Definitely"".

Jake Paul denies assaulting Justine Paradise,"YouTuber Jake Paul has denied sexually assaulting TikTok star Justine Paradise, after she accused him online. Paradiseshared a 20-minute video,externallast week in which she alleged that Paul forced her to perform oral sex on him and touched her without her consent, at his home in Los Angeles in 2019. ""He didn't ask for consent or anything,"" said Paradise. ""That's not okay. On no level at all is that okay."" In a statement posted on Twitter, Paul said the allegations were ""100% false"". Jake Paul accused of assault by Justine Paradise Paradise said she had waited for two years to speak out because she had signed a non-disclosure agreement, something which was allegedly required of all guests who entered Paul's home. The pair met several times in June and July 2019, when Paradise would visit Paul's home - known as his Team 10 house - in California. Paradise says she was introduced to Paul via a mutual friend. Paul, who is preparing for a boxing match versus UFC fighter Ben Askren on Saturday, said the allegations were designed to distract attention from the fight.

Gang jailed after Â£160k supermarket thefts,"The gang primarily targeted Asda in their crime spree Six men who stole more than Â£160,000 worth of items from supermarkets, by setting off alarms to distract security guards, have been jailed. The gang, based in Oldham, Greater Manchester, mainly targeted Asda stores for high-value items including perfume, alcohol, cosmetics and thousands of nappies. They committed 81 separate offences across the UK to avoid being caught, Cheshire Police said. The men were each jailed for 42 months. Nicolae Ilie, 37, Alin Mihai, 28, Florin Costea, 52, Stefan Florin, 31, Marius Meirosu, 25, and Gabriel Mocanu, 36, who were originally from Romania, all pleaded guilty to conspiracy to steal at Chester Crown Court. They set off security alarms as a distraction technique that enabled them to escape with the stolen items unseen, police said. Left to right clockwise: Stefan Florin, Nicolae Ilie, Marius Meirosu, Gabriel Mocanu, Florin Costea and Alin Mihai They would then sell on the items, such as printer cartridges, razor blades and alcohol. Between April and September 2019 they targeted stores across Scotland, Wales and England. Cheshire Police began investigating after Asda reported a Â£1,000 theft at its Barons Quay store in Northwich. Detectives examined CCTV footage, number plate recognition and credit card data which led them to a house in Oldham. Thousands of nappies and more than 50 razors, perfume and alcohol were found. Det Con Paul Matchett said it was clear the men ""travelled to the UK with the sole intention of committing crime"". He said they ""set up their base in Oldham"" and believed they could ""evade justice by spreading their crimes across the country in a bid to keep a low profile.""

Tesco counts cost of Covid trading as profits drop,"Tesco has announced a rise in sales but a sharp fall in full-year profits after spending nearly Â£900m to carry on trading through the Covid pandemic. The UK's largest supermarket said ""exceptionally strong"" revenue grew by 7% to Â£53.4bn. However, pre-tax profits dropped by nearly 20% following a number of Covid-related costs including giving full pay to staff off work ill or shielding. It also incurred Â£535m after forgoing business rates relief. The government announced the business rates holiday last March to help support retail, leisure and hospitality companies through the pandemic. However, supermarkets are classed as essential retailers and have been allowed to stay open during lockdown. Tesco said it would repay the rate relief following criticism over its decision to pay millions of pounds worth of dividends to shareholders. Tesco's full year pre-tax profit fell from Â£1bn to Â£825m. Richard Hyman, a partner at the retail consultancy TPC, said that trading through Covid had cost Tesco a lot of money: ""In order to [trade through the pandemic] they've had to spend a lot of money looking after the health of both their customers and their staff and that's been very very costly,"" he said. Tesco said its strong sales growth was boosted by a 77% rise in online sales. Like-for-like sales, which strips out revenue from shops opened or closed during the year, rose by 6.3% for the group. The supermarket said that while some of the additional sales volumes would fall away as Covid restrictions eased, it expected a strong recovery in profitability as most of the costs incurred in the pandemic would not be repeated. It said because of a ""greater than usual level of uncertainty around sales volumes, mix and channel shift"" it was difficult to predict operating profit for its retail business. However, Tesco said it expected it to recover to a similar level in the previous financial year. The company also announced a Â£175m loss at Tesco Bank compared with a Â£193m profit in the previous 12 months. It said there had been a ""material decline"" in customer spending because of Covid, leading to "" lower levels of new business activity in loans and credit cards, lower credit card balances, and a reduction in ATM and travel money transactions"". It added: ""Higher levels of unemployment and lower GDP forecasts resulted in an increase in the provision for potential bad debts."" Tesco said that while it expected the bank to return to profit in the next financial year, the pace and scale of recovery  ""is highly dependent on the economic outlook, which remains uncertain"".

"Chinese man kidnapped, killed in body swap scheme","Traditional burials are banned in parts of China A Chinese man with Down's syndrome was kidnapped and killed in a bungled plot to grant another man's wish for burial rather than cremation. Before he died of cancer in 2017 a man from south-east China told his family he wanted a traditional burial, but in some regions these are banned. His family hired someone to find a substitute body that could be cremated in place of their relative's. But unknown to them, the man they hired committed murder to provide the body. In September 2020 the man hired by the family - identified only by his surname Huang - was given a suspended death sentence over the murder. While the murder happened in 2017, the case only gained prominence last week after an article about the incident came to wider attention online in China. Court documents show Huang had in 2017 been offered money by the family to provide them with another body as they wanted their deceased family member to have a traditional burial. The family live in Shanwei city in Guangdong province, where the government requires all dead bodies to be cremated. But while the family assumed he would look for another dead body, Huang killed someone in order to fulfil the deal. Why Chinese are 'turning in' their graves Chinese court clears man after 27 years in prison Why strippers attend funerals in China Spotting a man with Down's syndrome picking litter from the street, Huang persuaded him to get into a car and gave the victim alcohol until he passed out. He then put the victim's body into a coffin and days later it was passed on to the family in exchange for money. The family paid 107,000 yuan (Â£11,900; $16,300), of which 90,000 yuan went to the accused while the rest went to a middleman who has since died. The family then proceeded to have that coffin cremated, pretending it contained the body of their own relative. The relative's actual body was then buried in secret in a traditional way. Cremated remains are usually kept in columbarium walls After the victim's disappearance in 2017, he was reported as a missing person. It took police more than two years to uncover the crime and track down the accused. In September 2020, Huang was given a suspended death sentence, which he appealed against. This was eventually dismissed by the Guangdong Higher People's Court in December 2020 and a suspended death sentence was upheld. This means that if he does not reoffend after two years, the sentence will be commuted to life in prison. The family who hired Huang were found guilty of ""insulting a corpse"", but were not handed a prison sentence. It is unclear if they had to instead pay a fine. Last week a news outlet published a feature with the victim's family, giving the story a national platform. A traditional burial is favoured in China, with people investing heavily in funerals and coffins, believing that doing so is a way of showing filial piety towards their ancestors. But China has increasingly been campaigning for people to refrain from burying their dead and in some regions there is an outright ban on burials. This is intended to save land and discourage extravagant burial ceremonies. A regulation dating back to 1997 stipulates that ""densely populated regions with relatively little land and convenient transport should practise cremation"". ""Those regions which cannot meet such requirements are allowed to conduct burials,"" the regulation says. Body swapping is not unheard of in China, and mostly occurs in rural areas where more people put stress on following traditional burial ways.

Use of force on George Floyd 'justified',"This video can not be played Watch: The three key arguments used by Chauvin's defence A police officer was ""justified"" in pinning George Floyd to the ground before his death, says a use-of-force expert called by the defence team. Barry Brodd told the trial in Minnesota that Derek Chauvin - who denies murder - acted with ""objective reasonableness"" during the arrest last May. Video of Mr Chauvin kneeling on the neck of Mr Floyd led to worldwide protests against racism and policing. Tensions are running high over a recent police shooting of a black man. As it happened: Day 12 of Chauvin trial The man accused of killing George Floyd Watching the Chauvin trial 'was hurtful' 'I stay up at night apologising to George' That happened on Sunday in a Minnesota suburb only 10 miles (16 km) away from the court where Mr Chauvin's trial is taking place. On Tuesday, the court heard testimony from witnesses called by Mr Chauvin's defence team. Former police officer Mr Brodd told the court that ""the imminent threat"" posed by Floyd was a major factor in his detention. ""I felt that Derek Chauvin was justified and acting with objective reasonableness following Minneapolis police department policy and current standards of law enforcement in his interaction with George Floyd,"" he said. ""From a police officer's standpoint, you don't have to wait for it to happen. You just have to have a reasonable fear that somebody is going to strike you, stab you, shoot you."" Mr Brodd added: ""It's easy to sit in an office and judge an officer's conduct. It's more of a challenge to put yourself in the officer's shoes, to try to make an evaluation through what they are feeling, what they're sensing, the fear they have, and then make a determination."" This video can not be played Watch: The moment the defence witness backtracks under cross-examination Defence lawyer Eric Nelson asked Mr Brodd: ""Was this a deadly use of force?"" ""No, it was not,"" Mr Brodd replied. He said that the crowd surrounding George Floyd during his arrest ""posed an unknown threat"" and drew Mr Chauvin's attention away from Floyd. Cross-examining Mr Brodd, the prosecution maintained that the dangers of positional asphyxia - not being able to breathe in a certain position - were well known. ""Would you agree that that's something commonly understood in law enforcement?"" prosecutor Steve Schleicher asked. ""Yes,"" Mr Brodd replied, confirming it was not new information. His testimony was an attempt by the defence to rebut a number of medical experts called by the prosecution who said Chauvin used excessive, deadly force. The trial also heard from Peter Chang, a Minneapolis Park Police officer who responded to the scene of Floyd's arrest. The court was shown footage from his bodycam. Mr Chang told the court the crowd of bystanders around Floyd was ""very aggressive to the officers"". ""Did that cause you any concern?"" Mr Nelson asked him. ""Concern for the officers' safety, yes,"" Mr Chang replied. Shawanda Hill, an acquaintance of George Floyd, was compelled by the defence to testify on Tuesday. This video can not be played Watch: How the prosecution made its case against Derek Chauvin She was sitting in the back seat of the car when Floyd was approached by store employees who confronted him over an alleged counterfeit $20 bill. She said Floyd had earlier been ""happy, normal, talking, alert"". She said that he had offered to give her a ride, and that she received a phone call while sitting in the car with Floyd. While she was on the phone, she said Floyd suddenly fell asleep just before the employees came out to confront him. She said she woke him again as the police arrived. Shawanda Hill said Floyd was startled when police arrived She said that as soon as Floyd woke up, the first thing he saw was an officer's gun. Ms Hill said that he immediately grew distressed and started pleading with the officers not to kill him. ""Did he seem startled when the officer pulled a gun on him?"" the prosecutor asks. ""Very,"" she said. Last week the court heard from several expert witnesses who testified that Mr Chauvin's use of force was excessive. They were also steadfast in their belief that Mr Floyd died from being subdued and not from drug use or ill health. The police chief who fired the officer after seeing the video of him kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck told the court his actions went against all police training. There were also eyewitnesses who described their concerns for Mr Floyd as they watched the arrest taking place. What questions do you have about the Derek Chauvin trial?

'A third' of young black people now unemployed,"Twenty-one-year-old Mary Ibiyemi from Glasgow lost her job in a takeaway last year because her employer ""just couldn't keep me on anymore"" in the pandemic. She then spent fruitless months looking for jobs, a time when her self-esteem ""just went down"". She thinks it's hard for any young person finding work at the moment, but particularly if you are black. ""My surname isn't one a lot of people can pronounce, and I feel employers are more likely to skip over it,"" she said, ""I feel if you're from the black or Asian communities, if you have a hard-sounding name then they are less likely to take the time to get to know the person, the pronunciation and try to work with you as a person."" Over the past year, the UK jobless rate for young black people rose by more than a third to 35%, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank. That compared with a rate of 24% for young people of Asian descent and a rate of 13% for young white people, both up three percentage points. The foundation said Covid had widened existing gaps between ethnic groups. Lester Holloway, anti-racism policy officer at the Trade Union Congress (TUC), said all young people needed opportunities but black and minority ethnic (BME) young workers faced ""additional obstacles because of their race"". 'Finding work feels impossible for my generation' 'I've made 200 applications and don't have a job' ""That's an example of racial injustice,"" he said. ""Ministers must stop delaying and challenge the structural racism and inequality that holds back BME people from such an early age."" The employment gap between young ethnic workers and white workers has been with us a long time, but this data, gathered during the pandemic, shows it's getting worse. This research also makes clear that the problem is not just due to a lack of access to education among ethnic people. More than one-in-three young black graduates were unemployed in the second half of 2020 - an unemployment rate almost three times that of young white graduates. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities' recent report on race concluded there was no evidence of institutional racism in the UK, but the findings have been fiercely contested. They also come after the unequal health outcomes of Covid sufferers from BME backgrounds have been laid bare. UK not rigged against minorities, race report says Campaigners criticise government race report Mary finally found a part time role, but many others won't be so lucky. According to the Resolution Foundation, young people in general have borne the brunt of job losses in lockdown, because they disproportionately worked in sectors hit by the crisis, such as hospitality and leisure. At the height of the pandemic last year, between the second and third quarters of 2020, the unemployment rate among 18 to 24-year-olds rose from 11.5% to 13.6%, the foundation said. This was the largest quarter-on-quarter rise among this age group since 1992. ""The rise in youth unemployment is not just about those losing their jobs, but also about young people not finding work in the first place,"" the foundation added. ""Those who left education just before or during the crisis - the so-called class of 2020 - have faced particular difficulties, with unemployment rising fastest among those who recently left education. ""Having a degree has not protected recent graduates from this effect."" The Resolution Foundation wants the Kickstart scheme to protect young people from the impact of long-term unemployment But here too, there is a big disparity between ethnic groups. By the end of last year, unemployment among young black graduates had risen to 34%, up from 22% before the pandemic. That was a rate almost three times that of young white graduates during the same period (13%). The unemployment rate for young Asian graduates during this period was 24%. The Foundation called for the government's Â£2bn Kickstart youth jobs scheme to be expanded and extended to protect young people from the impact of long-term unemployment. It also urged special efforts to ensure that young people from hard-hit ethnic backgrounds had access to the scheme, alongside access to quality education and training options, and, where needed, financial support for full-time study. Kathleen Henehan, a senior research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The furlough scheme has done a fantastic job of minimising job losses amidst unprecedented shutdowns of our economy. ""But young people have still experienced a sharp rise in unemployment during the Covid-19 crisis - with recent education-leavers and young black people being hardest hit. ""This pandemic has created a highly generationally unequal unemployment surge and widened pre-existing gaps between different ethnic groups. ""Young people have sacrificed their livelihoods in order to save the lives of others from Covid-19, and putting their careers back on track must be a priority for government in the months and years ahead.""

Top civil servant worked for Greensill,"Bill Crothers says he was ""transparent"" about the role he took on with Greensill Capital A top civil servant joined financial firm Greensill Capital as an adviser while still working for the government, a lobbying watchdog has revealed. Bill Crothers's part-time position had been ""agreed"" to by the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments added. Its chairman Lord Pickles complained of a ""lack of transparency"" over the situation. But Mr Crothers said he had been taken on by Greensill in a ""transparent"" way. Labour called his dual employment ""extraordinary and shocking"". Johnson urged to launch 'full' Cameron inquiry Analysis: Review into lobbying may change little David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? The disclosure about Mr Crothers - who had been the government's chief procurement officer prior to being taken on by Greensill - is the latest of several stories involving the now-collapsed financial firm. It employed former prime minister David Cameron as an adviser from 2018. The Financial Times and the Sunday Times revealed that Mr Cameron had contacted several ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, to push for greater involvement in government loans schemes for the company. Boris Johnson has set up an inquiry into lobbying - attempts to persuade governments to change policy - including Greensill's role. Government sources said this would also now look at the situation surrounding Mr Crothers. Lord Pickles is asking for Whitehall ""guidance"" on possible ""conflicts of interest"" Mr Crothers, who had already left his job as chief procurement officer but remained a Civil Service employee, joined Greensill as an adviser to its board in September 2015. The letter from Conservative peer Lord Pickles to leading civil servant Alex Chisholm says: ""This was agreed by the Cabinet Office under its internal conflicts-of-interest policy."" Lord Pickles asks for ""guidance on the conflicts-of-interest process"" undertaken. The letter adds: ""The lack of transparency around this part-time employment with Greensill may have left the misleading impression that Mr Crothers had wilfully ignored the obligation to seek advice."" Mr Crothers left the Civil Service in November 2015, two months after taking up his role at Greensill. He became a director of the firm in late 2016. A letter from Mr Crothers to Lord Pickles, a former Conservative Party chairman, written earlier this week, has also been published. In it, he says: ""I am concerned that there may be a view that I did not follow proper process regarding my role with Greensill Capital. ""I assure you that I completely respect the required process and your office, took steps to comply, and believe that I did so."" He adds: ""I was transparent about the move to Greensill Capital, and it was well known at the time."" The shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said: ""This is an extraordinary and shocking revelation. ""The Conservatives have weakened the rules so much they may as well rip them up and start again."" The government inquiry in to lobbying is expected to report  by the end of June, but Labour says it does not go far enough. It will use an opposition day debate on Wednesday to force a vote on whether to establish a new Commons select committee to investigate the issue. Unlike regular opposition day votes which are symbolic, this one would be binding if it passes because Parliament would be deciding if it should do something. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said there would be a response to Mr Pickles's letter ""in due course"". They added that the ""review into Greensill Capital and supply-chain finance"" would be ""wide-ranging"". Mr Cameron has said he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying and that he welcomes the investigation launched by Mr Johnson.

No 10 rejects calls for new MPs lobbying inquiry,"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: Boris Johnson is 'blocking a proper inquiry' The government has defeated Labour plans for a parliamentary inquiry into lobbying, amid a row over contacts with finance firm Greensill Capital. Sir Keir Starmer had wanted a ""full"" probe, including public hearings by a cross-party panel of MPs. Boris Johnson has insisted the lawyer he appointed this week to carry out a review of the affair will lead a ""proper"" inquiry. And he said the Tories had been ""consistently tough on lobbying"". Earlier, Sir Keir said the Greensill affair demonstrated ""sleaze and cronyism"" at the ""heart"" of the Conservative Party. A row about lobbying has centred on attempts by Greensill Capital, a specialist bank whichcollapsed in March, to influence government ministers and top civil servants. On Wednesday, the Commons Treasury select committee said it planned to launch an inquiry into the ""lessons"" from the firm's demise. David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting' Kuenssberg: Labour's long-term strategy to attack cronyism The government has appointed lawyer Nigel Boardman to look into the matter and report back by the end of June. Labour said a cross-party Commons committee should investigate instead, with a wider remit to recommend changes to lobbying rules. But speaking earlier at Prime Minister's Questions, Mr Johnson said Labour's proposals would involve MPs ""marking their own homework"". He ordered Tory MPs to vote against the plan, which was defeated by 357 votes to 262. Sleaze - amid stiff competition, it's perhaps the dirtiest word in politics. It's used as shorthand for behaviour that's immoral, inappropriate, corrupt or just plain wrong. And Labour's choice to attach it to the current government's actions is no accident. Sir Keir Starmer is seeking to evoke the scandals of the past which have led to the downfall of Conservative ministers. In the latter years of John Major's government in the 1990s accusations of sleaze were so commonplace it was arguably a factor in them losing power. But while Boris Johnson and his ministers will be keen to avoid accusations of improper behaviour in office, there are dangers for the opposition here too. Labour governments have seen their fair share of scandal in the past and it's a brave politician of any colour who claims to be beyond reproach. Calls to examine lobbying and the relationship between civil servants, politicians and and private firms have intensified in the past week. These have followed revelations about former Prime Minister David Cameron's efforts to influence ministers on behalf of Greensill, where he started working as an adviser in August 2018, two years after he left Downing Street. These involvedtexting Chancellor Rishi Sunakand contacting other ministers about a government-backed Covid loan scheme on behalf of the company. Along with the company's founder Lex Greensill, Mr Cameron also met Health Secretary Matt Hancock for a ""private drink"" in 2019 todiscuss a new payment scheme for NHS staff. It's another word for trying to persuade the government to change its policies It can be done by individuals, companies, organisations and charities who contact ministers, backbench MPs and other politicians Some organisations and companies employ professional lobbyists to make their case for them Former MPs and civil servants often work as lobbyists Speaking earlier, Sir Keir suggested there was a ""revolving door"" between the government and the private sector. He told MPs: ""I know the prime minister is launching an inquiry. That inquiry isn't even looking at the lobbying rules. ""I'm not sure it's looking at very much at all, because every day there's further evidence of the sleaze that's now at the heart of this Conservative government."" But the prime minster said Mr Boardman would be leading a ""proper independent review,"" and Labour's committee idea would ""not do a blind bit of good"". Mr Cameron has insisted he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying, although he has acknowledged that he should have communicated with the government ""through only the most formal of channels"". Conservative MP William Wragg, who chairs a Commons committee currently looking into business appointments, said the Greensill affair was a ""tasteless, slap-dash and unbecoming episode for any former prime minister"". But, speaking ahead of Wednesday's vote, he suggested Mr Cameron's involvement was a ""red herring"" compared with the wider issues - such as why companies were interested in employing ""de-skilled"" former ministers at all. Mr Greensill, who worked as an unpaid government adviser during Mr Cameron's early years in Downing Street, has not commented on the row. Mr Cameron has said the idea of him working at Greensill Capital ""was never raised, or considered by me, until well after I left office"". What's the David Cameron lobbying row about?

"Pregnant nurseâs family yet to get GoFundMe moneyMore than Â£186,000 was raised on a GoFundMe page set up after Mary Agyapong died with Covid-19.Beds, Herts & Bucks","Mary Agyeiwaa Agyapong died five days after her baby was delivered at Luton and Dunstable Hospital, where she worked as a nurse The family of a pregnant nurse who died with Covid-19 have yet to receive any money from a fundraising campaign that names them as beneficiaries. Mary Agyapong, 28, died after giving birth in April 2020 at Luton and Dunstable Hospital, where she worked. A GoFundMe page set up by family friend Rhoda Asiedu has raised more than Â£186,000 and she said the money had been placed into a trust. Ms Agyapong's widower said he found it ""surprising"" he had not been involved. At an inquest last month coroner Emma Whitting found it was ""unclear"" how mother-of-two Ms Agyapong contracted Covid-19 before her death. But at the hearing's conclusion Ms Whitting urged Prime Minister Boris Johnsonto begin a public inquiry into the pandemic. Ernest Boateng said his wife was ""very worried"" for her health while she worked in the pandemic On 15 April 2020an online GoFundMe page was createdby Ms Asiedu, who lives in Birmingham, to support ""Mary's husband, and the couple's children... during this heavy and trying time"". A statement released by Ms Asiedu said it had been placed on trust for the education of Ms Agyapong's children and that 80% would be released when they turned 21. Speaking on behalf of the trust, she said the remaining 20% would be provided to Ms Agyapong's widower Ernest Boateng for ""maintenance and upkeep"" of the children, however he had ""failed to co-operate with the trustees to arrange a schedule of maintenance"". The BBC has not received a response to its request to see the trust documents. Mr Boateng, who is studying law, said he had been ""struggling a bit"" financially. ""I just try to keep my head above the water,"" he said. ""I find it very surprising that we have not been asked or involved with this GoFundMe money - it's beyond my understanding."" Ms Agyapong had collapsed at her home in Luton before she was taken to hospital Wendy Addai, part of the fundraising team, told the BBC: ""We wanted the money to be used in a way which ensured the children's well-being in their adult life as well as their childhood after seeing the huge sum that was raised, which we are very thankful for. ""None of us anticipated for us to raise this much as the original goal was Â£2,000. ""So we went to seek advice from a lawyer, who was finalising agreements with Ernest's lawyers. ""In regards to GoFundMe themselves they requested updates and proof with what was being done with the money but that was as far as their involvement went. Our intentions were and will always remain good and for the interest of Mary's babies."" Ms Agyapong had worked at Luton and Dunstable Hospital for five years GoFundMe said it was always clear the money would be placed in a trust, adding: ""Our records show the wording of the page has not been changed since it launched on 15 April 2020."" But the BBC found an archived snapshot of the webpage on 16 April with no reference to a trust at all. When contacted by the BBC, fundraiser Ms Asiedu directed media requests to her legal team.

But a shocking aspect of Covid-19 in Brazil is the number of babies dying. Since the beginning of the pandemic, 1,300 babies under the age of one have died from the virus. With exclusive access to one childrenâs ICU in the northeast of the country, BBC Brazilâs Nathalia Passarinho speaks to staff about caring for these critically ill children. Vaccinations are ""successful"" at reducing hospital admissions, the head of the NHS in England says. Sir Simon Stevens has been speaking as a new study shows a 75% reduced risk of emergency hospital admission among people who have received the Pfizer vaccine. The study by the NHS and the University of Manchester has found older people who have received the jab are less likely to be admitted to hospital, and less likely to have a positive test, compared with those who have not been vaccinated. Researchers examined data on more than 170,000 people aged 80 to 83 who received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine between 15 and 20 December last year. They compared this information with ""matched controls"" aged 76 to 79 who had not yet received the jab. Sir Simon says: ""Vaccines are successfully reducing hospitalisations and deaths amongst the cohorts that have had the vaccine. ""Data that we have analysed shows a 75% reduction in emergency Covid hospitalisations for the vaccination cohorts and, as more and more people are vaccinated, that effect will widen."" Residents in some areas of Smethwick in the West Midlands are being urged to get tested for coronavirus after a case of the South Africa variant was detected. It comes as the ""largest surge testing operation to date"" is being carried out in London after cases were identified there. Sandwell Council haspublished a list of postcodes,externalin Smethwick and Cape Hill where people should get tested. The authority is urging all residents in those areas to get tested, regardless of whether they have been vaccinated. Read more here.

I mean, there's really no substitute for that. ""But one of the things that kept me going through the lockdown [has been] being able to play music and set up little studios, wherever."" He says he feels lucky to have ""a couple of places"" and a ""nice garden"". ""I'm very lucky. I don't have the problems of living, say in a small flat in London or New York, which some of my friends have had,"" Sir Mick tells the radio host. ""Two kids in a two room flat in Manhattan?

Alison HoltSocial affairs correspondent This video can not be played 'I saw them more than my own family' A year on from the peak in coronavirus deaths among care home residents in England and Wales, there are increasing calls for a public inquiry. Many in the sector believe the government ignored their plight until the death toll made that impossible to do. Twelve months ago, nursing associate Damian Mann was desperately trying to save the lives of people he spends more time with than his relatives, every day. He works at Wren Hall Nursing home in Nottinghamshire, where 13 residents died with Covid-19 between the end of March and mid-April 2020. ""Some of the people have lived here for five, six years. I see them more than my own family,"" he says. ""And then they're not here any more."" Damian was working on a hastily set-up isolation unit. He was one of just a few staff who didn't contract the virus, so saw resident after resident pass away. ""We would always make sure someone was with them,"" he says. Read more here.

Soutik BiswasIndia Correspondent ""Will a lockdown happen again?"" Over a grainy video call last week from a grotty little room in the western Indian city of Mumbai, the Sethi brothers repeatedly asked me this question, their voices trembling in nervousness. More than a decade ago, Santosh and Tunna Sethi left their families and homes in the eastern state of Orissa, also called Odisha, in search of work. They arrived in Mumbai, more than 1,600km (994 miles) away. Here, the brothers toiled in the shadows of the city's imposing skyscrapers that migrant workers build for the affluent. Ferrying cement, sand, bricks and stones, they earned 450 rupees ($6; Â£4.35) every day for eight hours of work. They lived, ate and slept in unfinished buildings, and sent most of their savings home to support their families. With more than three million reported Covid-19 infections, the state of Maharashtra, which has Mumbai as its capital, is the stubborn epicentre of India's second wave of infections. The government has beenwarning of a full lockdownunless cases begin to fall. Fear has gripped the Sethi brothers again. ""Will we have to return home? Do you have any information?"" they ask.

"The remote island where every adult is now vaccinatedFair Isle is one of the UK's most remote communities - but every adult has now had a second vaccine.NE Scotland, Orkney & Shetland","This video can not be played Fair Isle is the UK's most remote inhabited island It may be one of the UK's most remote communities but tiny Fair Isle - with a population of just 48 people - can now claim to be one of the safest. The Scottish island - located between Orkney and Shetland - is famed for its knitwear and migratory birds. It only got a reliable 24-hour-a-day electricity supply in 2018. This week, vials of AstraZeneca vaccine were flown in on a small plane, meaning every adult on the island was able to have their second dose. It was a practical solution to a tricky problem. The logistics of vaccinating the furthest-flung communities along the edges of Scotland were challenging, to say the least. Fair Isle is three miles long and one-and-a-half miles wide The first vaccine, from Pfizer, required storage temperatures so low that the tiny planes and boats serving these islands were out of the question. For a fragile community, many of whom are older, bringing people out individually to the mainland clinic did not make sense either. However, the AstraZeneca vaccine can be transported in a cool box. So that is exactly what NHS Shetland has done, sending the vials in on the tiny planes that run lifeline services to its smaller isles. The remote island where jumpers are always in fashion Glory of 24-hour power reaches Fair Isle The island is three miles long and one-and-a-half miles wide. When the plane touched down on the rubble airstrip near Fair Isle's 600ft cliffs the sun was shining - the first glimpse of spring after relentless weeks of sleet, snow and gales. The rather unassuming white box was loaded carefully into the nurse's car, and taken down to the small surgery, where nurses Kirstin Robson and Margaret Cooper got ready to vaccinate Fair Isle. Vaccine supplies were flown in this week John Best, the oldest islander, joked with the nurse as he rolled up his sleeve. He said the island feels like ""one of the safest places in the country"" - not only fully vaccinated, but cut off from the threat of infection, with almost no visitors allowed in. ""It's a funny thing"", he said, ""because this was a very welcoming island. And it will be again. ""But it's an element we haven't had for about a year now."" In normal times, Fair Isle defies the clichÃ©s associated with it - ""wild"", ""isolated"" - and is in fact an intensely sociable place, famous for music, dancing, and a warm welcome. The islanders are keen to return to those days. David Parnaby has lived here for 10 years, and his two young children make up half the school roll. Wind is rarely in short supply in exposed Fair Isle, which can come in handy He readily admits there is ""no better place"" to spend lockdown than Fair Isle, with its stunning scenery and nature - but adds that with no pubs or cafes, social life here is heavily dependent on the kind of household visits that have been banned. There is real hope, though, that this second vaccine dose will allow a loosening of restrictions. ""We've been really impressed at the way the NHS has handled it, getting everybody done,"" he said. ""It just gives the whole isle a wee bit more confidence as we start, hopefully, to get back towards normal life here on Fair Isle."" Fair Isle knitwear, shown in this photo from the 1970s, is famed around the world Other remote islands have been vaccinated in this way - some in the Hebrides, along with Shetland's Foula and Skerries. ""Fair Isle was one of those areas in the UK where there were no confirmed cases, so we thought it was important to maintain that as a statistic,"" explained interim director of community health and social care, Brian Chittick. ""We're lucky"", Thomas Fisher said, as he waited his turn outside the surgery. He had a bad reaction to the first dose, but is not complaining. His partner Marie Bruhat agreed, but wanted to stress how vulnerable Fair Isle has been during the pandemic. The vaccinations took the nurses just a morning ""If someone had it, it would spread so quickly,"" she said. ""So knowing that everyone will be covered - to a degree - is going to give more peace of mind."" Vaccinating all of Fair Isle took just a morning. As nurse Kirstin packed up, she reflected on what surely counts as a good day in the life of an island nurse. ""It's been great - after 10 days without a boat we've now got a full shop, the sun is out, the lambs are coming,"" she grinned. Better times ahead, then? ""Absolutely. Definitely"".

"'A third' of young black people now unemployedYoung black people are three times more likely to be out of work than white peers, research shows.Business","Twenty-one-year-old Mary Ibiyemi from Glasgow lost her job in a takeaway last year because her employer ""just couldn't keep me on anymore"" in the pandemic. She then spent fruitless months looking for jobs, a time when her self-esteem ""just went down"". She thinks it's hard for any young person finding work at the moment, but particularly if you are black. ""My surname isn't one a lot of people can pronounce, and I feel employers are more likely to skip over it,"" she said, ""I feel if you're from the black or Asian communities, if you have a hard-sounding name then they are less likely to take the time to get to know the person, the pronunciation and try to work with you as a person."" Over the past year, the UK jobless rate for young black people rose by more than a third to 35%, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank. That compared with a rate of 24% for young people of Asian descent and a rate of 13% for young white people, both up three percentage points. The foundation said Covid had widened existing gaps between ethnic groups. Lester Holloway, anti-racism policy officer at the Trade Union Congress (TUC), said all young people needed opportunities but black and minority ethnic (BME) young workers faced ""additional obstacles because of their race"". 'Finding work feels impossible for my generation' 'I've made 200 applications and don't have a job' ""That's an example of racial injustice,"" he said. ""Ministers must stop delaying and challenge the structural racism and inequality that holds back BME people from such an early age."" The employment gap between young ethnic workers and white workers has been with us a long time, but this data, gathered during the pandemic, shows it's getting worse. This research also makes clear that the problem is not just due to a lack of access to education among ethnic people. More than one-in-three young black graduates were unemployed in the second half of 2020 - an unemployment rate almost three times that of young white graduates. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities' recent report on race concluded there was no evidence of institutional racism in the UK, but the findings have been fiercely contested. They also come after the unequal health outcomes of Covid sufferers from BME backgrounds have been laid bare. UK not rigged against minorities, race report says Campaigners criticise government race report Mary finally found a part time role, but many others won't be so lucky. According to the Resolution Foundation, young people in general have borne the brunt of job losses in lockdown, because they disproportionately worked in sectors hit by the crisis, such as hospitality and leisure. At the height of the pandemic last year, between the second and third quarters of 2020, the unemployment rate among 18 to 24-year-olds rose from 11.5% to 13.6%, the foundation said. This was the largest quarter-on-quarter rise among this age group since 1992. ""The rise in youth unemployment is not just about those losing their jobs, but also about young people not finding work in the first place,"" the foundation added. ""Those who left education just before or during the crisis - the so-called class of 2020 - have faced particular difficulties, with unemployment rising fastest among those who recently left education. ""Having a degree has not protected recent graduates from this effect."" The Resolution Foundation wants the Kickstart scheme to protect young people from the impact of long-term unemployment But here too, there is a big disparity between ethnic groups. By the end of last year, unemployment among young black graduates had risen to 34%, up from 22% before the pandemic. That was a rate almost three times that of young white graduates during the same period (13%). The unemployment rate for young Asian graduates during this period was 24%. The Foundation called for the government's Â£2bn Kickstart youth jobs scheme to be expanded and extended to protect young people from the impact of long-term unemployment. It also urged special efforts to ensure that young people from hard-hit ethnic backgrounds had access to the scheme, alongside access to quality education and training options, and, where needed, financial support for full-time study. Kathleen Henehan, a senior research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The furlough scheme has done a fantastic job of minimising job losses amidst unprecedented shutdowns of our economy. ""But young people have still experienced a sharp rise in unemployment during the Covid-19 crisis - with recent education-leavers and young black people being hardest hit. ""This pandemic has created a highly generationally unequal unemployment surge and widened pre-existing gaps between different ethnic groups. ""Young people have sacrificed their livelihoods in order to save the lives of others from Covid-19, and putting their careers back on track must be a priority for government in the months and years ahead.""

Third Neighbours star alleges racism on set,"Johal (centre) with some of her former Neighbours castmates Alan Fletcher and Bell Hall A third Neighbours star, Sharon Johal, has spoken out about the racism she says she endured on the set of the popular Australian soap opera. The Australian actress, who has Indian heritage, left the show in March after four years as character Dipi Rebecchi. Johal said she had faced racist taunts from white castmates, and felt further targeted when she asked for help. She said she felt ""morally compelled"" to voice her trauma after two Aboriginal stars did so last week. The former lawyer and Melbourne-based actress described it as a ""human rights issue"". On-set racism allegations were first raised by former cast members Meyne Wyatt and Shareena Clanton. Clanton had said it was ""traumatising to work in such a culturally unsafe space"". In response,production company Fremantle Media said it would hold a review into the allegations. Clanton praised Johal's expression on Tuesday, commenting on her Instagram post: ""So it begins... I am with you and so proud of you for speaking up."" In a 1,500 word statement on Tuesday,,externalJohal said she had experienced ""direct, indirect and casual racism"" on the set from other castmates and crew members. She did not identify anyone. She said one former castmate compared her to a bobble-head toy, and repeatedly mimicked Indian character Apu from The Simpsons in her presence ""with accompanying Indian accent and movement of head"" - despite Johal requesting they desist.

Another castmate, still on the show, had also repeatedly referred to her as ""you people"" when talking about people of Indian descent in a derogatory way. Johal said when she asked what the castmate had meant, she was told: ""You know, Indians."" She was later alerted by crew members that the same castmate had also called her ""the black one"" or ""blackie"" behind her back. She alleged they had also repeatedly voiced claims on set that the show had only hired Indian actors to ""fill their diversity quotas"" and ""not because they're any good."" When she raised complaints with management, no disciplinary action was taken and she was further targeted, she said. ""While they were sympathetic and the actor [was] questioned on one occasion .. no further action was taken."" Management also failed to protect her when she asked for moderation of racist abuse posted on the show's social media accounts, she says. ""I was again sympathised with, but was advised: ""We leave the comments as they are for people to discuss."" Johal alleges Neighbours management failed in their duty of care to cast members from diverse backgrounds Johal said she also felt isolated and marginalised by other cast members, who she alleges witnessed the behaviour - including the Apu mimicking incident-  but did not help or support her when she spoke up. ""I did not have faith that I would be adequately supported should I have taken the action to instigate a formal investigation into the allegations,"" he said. In response to Johal's allegations on Tuesday, Fremantle Media said: ""We remain committed to ensuring a respectful and inclusive workplace for all employees on the set of Neighbours and take very seriously any questions about racism or any other form of discrimination."" Does Neighbours really represent Australia? Review launched into Neighbours racism claims Aboriginal actors accuse Neighbours set of racism Johal commended Fremantle Media's investigation and requested that it be widened to include all forms of discrimination. She noted she had been ""one of the few people of colour"" to have been a series regular in the show's 36-year history and the show had ""taken great strides"" in including diverse characters. But much more needed to be done and some storylines and scripts were ""culturally insensitive"" she added. She said she had decided to speak publicly in the hope that ""this can be a transformative moment in the show's history"" and in Australia's screen industry more broadly. A 2018 Screen Australia industry report found that only 7% of characters on screen were from non-European backgrounds,,externalcompared to 17% of the population.

"Newquay is hottest sellers' market, says Rightmove","Newquay has been named the hottest property seller's market by online property portal, Rightmove. It says eight out of 10 listed homes have been sold, subject to contract, since the start of the year, the fastest moving market in the UK. Reflecting the trend for less-centralised living, it says city centre properties are moving much more slowly. Birmingham city centre is the worst place for sellers. Only 18% of properties have sold so far this year. The start of restrictions easing has increased activity in what Rightmove says was already an incredibly busy housing market. This high demand has pushed prices to record highs in some areas. Looe, also in Cornwall, was another seller hotspot recorded by Rightmove Its findings reflect those made by others in the property business. Last week the Halifax said there was ""something of a resurgence"" in the UK housing market in March. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, moved to help home buyers by extending the holiday on property stamp duty in England, Northern Ireland and Wales. Early last month the tax, which has been suspended on the first Â£500,000 of all property sales in England and Northern Ireland since July, was extended for another three months to the end of June. The Halifax said this was key to the annual rise of 6.5% in house prices, taking the average to Â£254,606 in March. How Covid has changed where we want to live Home movers 'have a spring in their step' Stamp duty holiday extended to end of June Rightmove said the ten hottest sellers' markets it recorded had all seen asking prices hit records since the market reopened last May, with seven of them hitting a price record in 2021. The most popular market after Newquay is Newton-Le-Willows in Merseyside, where just under 82% of listed properties are sold, subject to contract, followed by Plymstock in Devon, where 81% are at that stage in the selling process. The findings echo research conducted last month by Rightmove and the BBC. It looked at the most popular places people were searching for property, findingCornwall had overtaken London this year as the most searched for locationon Rightmove, while neighbouring Devon was the third most searched for and Dorset rose from 20th to 10th. Bradley Start, partner at Start & Co Estate Agents in Newquay, said: ""The stock shortage is the worst I've seen in 30 years and there's just seemingly endless demand. ""We're getting requests for viewings within minutes of a property going on Rightmove and many properties are going to best and final offers due to the competition, something that usually we would only see a few times a year."" Simon Shepherd, manager of Ashtons in Newton-Le-Willows, said: ""The past year has just been crazy. Right now I've had to rip up the rule book because the demand means it's hard to predict what a home is going to sell for, as in many cases we're achieving over the asking price."" Marshall Moore moved to Cornwall after getting a university job Marshall Moore was among those looking to move. The 50-year-old spent the last 15 years living in the mega-cities of Seoul and Hong Kong before moving to just outside Truro. The US academic told the BBC last month :""It is such a relief. It is gorgeous and cultural and, in some ways, like San Francisco - but with more wind."" Mr Moore, who teaches creative writing, was given the chance to move owing to his job, but is clear about the benefits of the location. ""There is openness, space, fresh air, it is calm and there's the mild weather,"" he says. ""We can also afford to live in an actual house rather than an apartment. I feel incredibly lucky.""

"Black youth unemployment 'hits 35% in pandemic'Young black people are three times more likely to be out of work than white peers, research shows.Business","Twenty-one-year-old Mary Ibiyemi from Glasgow lost her job in a takeaway last year because her employer ""just couldn't keep me on anymore"" in the pandemic. She then spent fruitless months looking for jobs, a time when her self-esteem ""just went down"". She thinks it's hard for any young person finding work at the moment, but particularly if you are black. ""My surname isn't one a lot of people can pronounce, and I feel employers are more likely to skip over it,"" she said, ""I feel if you're from the black or Asian communities, if you have a hard-sounding name then they are less likely to take the time to get to know the person, the pronunciation and try to work with you as a person."" Over the past year, the UK jobless rate for young black people rose by more than a third to 35%, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank. That compared with a rate of 24% for young people of Asian descent and a rate of 13% for young white people, both up three percentage points. The foundation said Covid had widened existing gaps between ethnic groups. Lester Holloway, anti-racism policy officer at the Trade Union Congress (TUC), said all young people needed opportunities but black and minority ethnic (BME) young workers faced ""additional obstacles because of their race"". 'Finding work feels impossible for my generation' 'I've made 200 applications and don't have a job' ""That's an example of racial injustice,"" he said. ""Ministers must stop delaying and challenge the structural racism and inequality that holds back BME people from such an early age."" The employment gap between young ethnic workers and white workers has been with us a long time, but this data, gathered during the pandemic, shows it's getting worse. This research also makes clear that the problem is not just due to a lack of access to education among ethnic people. More than one-in-three young black graduates were unemployed in the second half of 2020 - an unemployment rate almost three times that of young white graduates. The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities' recent report on race concluded there was no evidence of institutional racism in the UK, but the findings have been fiercely contested. They also come after the unequal health outcomes of Covid sufferers from BME backgrounds have been laid bare. UK not rigged against minorities, race report says Campaigners criticise government race report Mary finally found a part time role, but many others won't be so lucky. According to the Resolution Foundation, young people in general have borne the brunt of job losses in lockdown, because they disproportionately worked in sectors hit by the crisis, such as hospitality and leisure. At the height of the pandemic last year, between the second and third quarters of 2020, the unemployment rate among 18 to 24-year-olds rose from 11.5% to 13.6%, the foundation said. This was the largest quarter-on-quarter rise among this age group since 1992. ""The rise in youth unemployment is not just about those losing their jobs, but also about young people not finding work in the first place,"" the foundation added. ""Those who left education just before or during the crisis - the so-called class of 2020 - have faced particular difficulties, with unemployment rising fastest among those who recently left education. ""Having a degree has not protected recent graduates from this effect."" The Resolution Foundation wants the Kickstart scheme to protect young people from the impact of long-term unemployment But here too, there is a big disparity between ethnic groups. By the end of last year, unemployment among young black graduates had risen to 34%, up from 22% before the pandemic. That was a rate almost three times that of young white graduates during the same period (13%). The unemployment rate for young Asian graduates during this period was 24%. The Foundation called for the government's Â£2bn Kickstart youth jobs scheme to be expanded and extended to protect young people from the impact of long-term unemployment. It also urged special efforts to ensure that young people from hard-hit ethnic backgrounds had access to the scheme, alongside access to quality education and training options, and, where needed, financial support for full-time study. Kathleen Henehan, a senior research and policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation, said: ""The furlough scheme has done a fantastic job of minimising job losses amidst unprecedented shutdowns of our economy. ""But young people have still experienced a sharp rise in unemployment during the Covid-19 crisis - with recent education-leavers and young black people being hardest hit. ""This pandemic has created a highly generationally unequal unemployment surge and widened pre-existing gaps between different ethnic groups. ""Young people have sacrificed their livelihoods in order to save the lives of others from Covid-19, and putting their careers back on track must be a priority for government in the months and years ahead.""
