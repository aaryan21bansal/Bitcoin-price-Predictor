Tetra Pak billionaire Hans Rausing dies at 93,"Hans Rausing, the Swedish billionaire who helped build food packaging company Tetra Pak into a global giant, has died aged 93. Son of its founder, Ruben Rausing, he ran the firm from 1950 until 1995 - when he sold his share in the family business to his brother. Mr Rausing was known for his philanthropy in Sweden and the UK. His family's fortune, estimated by Forbes at $12bn (Â£9.8bn), makes them one of the richest living in the UK. In recent years, Mr Rausing's family were hit by scandal, afterhis son was given a suspended prison sentence for failing to report the death of his wife. Hans Rausing's father, Ruben, founded Tetra Pak, later Tetra Laval, in Sweden in 1944. The company is widely praised for revolutionising the global food packing trade. The original design for its innovative cardboard packaging was a tetrahedron, giving the firm its name, but the company's fortunes only really took off in the late 1960s under the leadership of Hans and his brother Gad. Watch: How the Tetra Pak became a million dollar idea The invention of the now more common cube-shaped cartons and aseptic technology to preserve the contents helped Tetra Pak replace heavier, breakable glass bottles in a growing number of markets. In the 1980s the Rausing brothers moved to the UK in order to avoid the higher rate of tax in their home country and Hans Rausing shot to the top of the UK's rich list. After he left the family firm in 1995, Mr Rausing, who lived in Wadhurst, East Sussex, devoted part of his time to philanthropy. More than Â£1bn was given to causes including innovation and research in medicine, human rights, culture and the environment, his family said. In 2006 he was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) for his philanthropic activities. His three children said in a joint statement: ""Our father was an extraordinary man, achieving so many things in his long and distinguished career as entrepreneur and industrialist, and then as a philanthropist supporting multiple charities and foundations. ""We are very proud of that, but most of all we will cherish our fond memories of him as a loving father and devoted family man."" His son, Hans Kristian Rausing, was sentenced in 2012 for delaying the lawful and decent burial of his wife. The charge came after police discovered the decomposing body ofEva Rausing, 48,at the couple's home in Belgravia, central London. Police found the mother-of-four, who had been dead for two months, under a pile of clothing and bin bags during a police search following Hans Kristian Rausing's arrest on suspicion of drugs possession. The couple had fought a public battle against drug addiction after meeting in a rehabilitation centre in the 1980s. Million dollar idea: The Tetra Pak.

US set to hit China with a fresh wave of tariffs,"The US has imposed fresh tariffs on $112bn (Â£92bn) of Chinese imports such as shoes, nappies and food. The new tariffs are a sharp escalation in the bruising trade war, and could cost households $800 a year. The move is the first phase of US President Donald Trump's latest plan to place 15% duties on $300bn of Chinese imports by the end of the year. In response, Beijing began to introduce measures targeting $75bn worth of US goods. The measures included a 5% tariff on US crude oil, the first time fuel has been hit in the trade battle between the world's two largest economies. What was initially a dispute over China's allegedly unfair trade practices is increasingly seen as a geopolitical power struggle. A quick guide to the US-China war The US-China trade row in charts So far, Washington has imposed tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars worth of Chinese goods to pressure Beijing into changing its policies on intellectual property, industrial subsidies, market access, and the forced transfers of technology to Chinese firms. Beijing has consistently denied that it engages in unfair trade practices, and has retaliated with tariffs on a wide range of US products. Katie Prescott, BBC Business Reporter It's the American consumer who will bear the brunt of these fresh tariffs, unlike previous rounds which have hit the manufacturing sector hardest. Nappies, dishwashers, shoes, clothes, food - looking throughthe 122-page list of eligible products,external, it's hard to find something that's not on there. Many retailers say they have little choice but to pass on the cost to shoppers. The president of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, Rick Helfenbein, describes the tariffs as like ""punishing your daughter for something your son did. It makes no sense"". The next round of tariffs on more clothes and big-ticket items like laptops and iPhones are due in December. Mr Trump says this will help to protect spending during the Christmas season. By the end of the year, they'll be in place on almost all goods that the US buys every year from China. And that could add up to $800 to the average household's annual spend, according to Katheryn Russ from the University of California. Businesses are finding it increasingly hard to navigate the uncertainty of the long-running trade dispute. Analysts say that in view of the latest escalation, the prospect of a resolution looks grim. ""It's difficult at this stage to see how there can be a deal or at least a good deal,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, a senior China economist at Capital Economics, told the BBC. ""Since talks broke down back in May, the position of both sides has hardened and there have been other complications, namely the Huawei ban and Hong Kong protests, which have made it even more difficult to bridge the gap."" The US government put Huawei on a trade blacklist in May, while Mr Trumphas tied protests in Hong Kong to a possible trade deal with China. If fully imposed, Mr Trump's programme would mean that nearly all Chinese imports - worth about $550bn - would be subject to punitive tariffs. Mr Trump has repeatedly argued that China pays for tariffs, but many US companies have rebutted that claim. More than 200 footwear firms - including Nike and Converse - said the new duties would add to existing tariffs of up to 67% on some shoes, driving up costs for consumers by $4bn each year. Who really pays in a tariff war? 'We're all paying for this' They said the incoming tariffs on footwear would ""also mean these massive tax increases hit tens of millions of Americans when they purchase shoes during the holiday season"". The American Chamber of Commerce in China also voiced concerns after theUS said it was going ahead with new tariffs. ""Our members have long been clear that tariffs are paid by consumers and harm business,""it said in a statement,external. ""We urge... that both sides work towards a sustainable agreement as soon as possible that resolves the fundamental, structural issues foreign businesses have long faced in China."" Mr Trump has said that trade teams from the US and China are continuing to talk and will meet in September, but further details have not been publicly confirmed. From 15 December, the second phase of 15% tariffs will be rolled out on the remainder of Chinese good not previously affected. This includes technology like phones which Mr Trump has sought to protect until now. On the same date, China will roll out tariffs on around 3,000 more US products. The Trump administration plans, in addition, to raise the rates on existing duties from 25% to 30% on 1 October. Mr Evans-Pritchard from Capital Economics said this rate could increase further still. ""The tariff rate could go all the way up to 45%,"" he said. ""Those are the goods that do the most damage to China and the least collateral damage to the US."" For the US and Chinese economies, analysts say the pressure created by tariffs is also building. ""The full-blown trade war, together with China's retaliation in kind, could reduce potential US GDP growth in the short run by almost 1%,"" said Gary Hufbauer of the Washington-based Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""The impact on China would be larger, as much as 5%."" Until 20 September, the US trade department will collect public comments on the planned tariff increases to 30%.

Did Trump tweet classified military imagery?,"Donald Trump's latest tweet has potentially set a precedent for classified information being shared by a president President Donald Trump has set a new standard for extraordinary presidential behaviour. Not only has he tweeted what would normally be a highly classified, military-quality satellite image showing the devastation around the launch pad at Iran's main space centre following a significant explosion. He has gone further by apparently taunting the Iranians, insisting the US was not involved in the ""catastrophic accident"" but also wishing Iran ""good luck"" in finding out what happened. Was this presidential sarcasm or misinformation? Was he implying that somebody else might indeed have been involved? Or was it just the president's regular habit of responding by saying the first thing that came into his head? It's hard to say. But, as ever, Mr Trump's intervention raises more questions than it answers. For some weeks now experts have been reporting preparations for an Iranian space launch. Commercial satellite imagery of the space centre showed the launch pad being made ready. The mission, according to Iranian reports, was to put a small telecommunications satellite - Nahid 1 - into orbit. Two previous launch attempts at the start of this year had ended in failure. This one, too, appears now to have ended in disaster. The difference, though, is that the full magnitude of the calamity has been revealed by President Trump himself. So what caused Iran's rocket to explode so dramatically on the launchpad? We simply do not know. But there are two obvious answers. What would a US-Iran conflict look like? Iran nuclear deal: Key details Firstly it could have been down to a simple technical malfunction; a problem with fuel or some kind of error in the rocket's manufacture - a faulty weld seam or whatever. These things happen; think back to some of the disasters during America's own space programme. Even the most technologically advanced nations have setbacks. But Iran's track record with launches is very poor. A New York Times article back in February, drawing heavily on interviews with unnamed US officials, suggested that Iran's two earlier failures this year were part of a pattern. It suggested that some 67% of Iran's orbital launch attempts over the past 11 years had failed. It described this as ""an astonishingly high number"" compared to the average 5% failure rate for comparable launches worldwide."" Tensions have been escalating between the US and Iran The article indicated that the Trump administration was moving to reactivate a sabotage programme against Iran's missile efforts by introducing faulty parts into the supply chain and so on. A previous US effort had been phased out by President Obama. So could sabotage be implicated in this latest accident?  Who knows, but Mr Trump himself has only muddied the waters by his Twitter intervention. There is a significant history of external forces attempting to hamper Iran's military research. Israel and the US were involved in efforts to sabotage Iran's uranium enrichment programme using a computer virus. Iranian scientists and technicians have been assassinated. US-Iran relations: a brief history And of course both the US and Israel see Iran's space programme as inextricably linked to its wider missile efforts. However, the most extraordinary aspect of this affair is the president's publication of a normally classified high-resolution satellite image that could only have come from a military source. This has thrown the missile and arms control community on the Twitter-sphere into a frenzy. It is an amazing thing for a US president to do, giving all Washington's enemies a very public insight into its extraordinary intelligence-gathering capabilities.

Riot police deployed following demonstrations,"Riot police, mounted officers, a helicopter and dog units were called in following an Irish Unity march and counter protest in Glasgow. The planned march through Govan, by the James Connolly Republican Flute Band, was met by hundreds of ""disruptive"" counter demonstrators. Police said this led to ""significant disorder"", with Govan Road blocked by officers. Witnesses reported the use of smoke bombs. The Irish Unity march was planned to start at 18:30 in Elder Park, Govan. But it was met by a counter demonstration of ""several hundred people"" from loyalist groups at about 19:00.

Multi-billion pound cash boost for schools,"Schools in England are being promised billions more in spending over the next three years, in an announcement from Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Next year schools will receive a Â£2.6bn uplift, rising to Â£4.8bn the following year - with schools spending Â£7.1bn more than at present by 2022-23. It follows a campaign by school leaders warning of worsening budget shortages. Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton said the extra cash was a recognition of the ""severity of the funding crisis"". The prime minister said he wanted to ""ensure all young people get the best possible start in life. That means the right funding"". ""We should not accept the idea that there can be 'winners or losers' when it comes to our children's futures,"" said Mr Johnson. ""That's why we are providing additional funding now and for the future for every school, with those historically underfunded receiving the greatest increase."" NI schools set to get extra Â£500m, claims DUP Multi-million pound boost promised for Wales School funding top priority for Gavin Williamson School leaders have been protesting about funding shortages - with head teachers writing to millions of parents with warnings about schools running out of cash. But the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says the funding increase should be enough to restore school spending to pre-austerity levels. Boris Johnson facing young questioners in Downing Street The independent financial think tank said the Â£7.1bn increase, promised in three years, will be sufficient to reverse cuts to schools of 8% over the past decade. ""This package represents a large increase in spending per pupil, taking it back to about the same level it was in 2009-10,"" said Luke Sibieta, a research fellow at the IFS. ""However, a 13-year period of no net growth in school spending per pupil, after inflation, still represents a significant squeeze on school budgets when considered in historical terms."" The cash injection will include Â£700m extra for special needs pupils and new minimum levels of per pupil funding. Secondary schools will have at least Â£5,000 per pupil from next year and from 2021 primary schools will have a minimum threshold of Â£4,000 per pupil. The money is on top of an extra Â£1.5bn per year to cover rises in teachers' pension costs There were already spending increases in the pipeline - such as for rising numbers of pupils - but this announcement provides additional funding above this. It is also on top of an extra Â£1.5bn per year to cover rises in teachers' pension costs. School leaders responded with a mix of guarded welcomes and a warning that they wanted to check the details before ending their protests. ""After five years of disappointment on funding, I'm sure the prime minster would forgive us only giving this a cautious welcome,"" said Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers. ""We hope that this announcement is as good as it looks,"" said Mr Whiteman. But he warned it would be ""disastrous if the detail did not live up to the headline"". by Robert Cuffe, BBC head of statistics Boris Johnson's announcement of extra money for schools will be welcome to many, but do the sums add up? The prime minister said he would invest ""over Â£14bn in primary and secondary education between now and 2022/23"". That includes an additional Â£2.6bn next year, Â£4.8bn the year after that and Â£7.1bn in 2022-23. When you add all three together, you get Â£14.5bn, but that's not normally how we talk about spending increases. We talk about budgets for each individual year, so usual practice is to pick a year (normally the last, with the biggest increase) and use that to measure the generosity of pledges. For example, Theresa May's increased spending for the NHSwas described as ""an extra Â£20bn a year by 2023"". Describing this as a Â£14bn increase would make the government seem more generous than it is in fact being. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, welcomed the promise of higher funding, but highlighted that there was ""great political uncertainty"" about making financial promises beyond this year. ""The crisis is now and extra funding is needed as soon as possible,"" said Mr Barton. Head teachers had marched through Westminster over school funding shortages Head teachers have been staging protest marches over funding - with further planned for this autumn - but organiser Jules White said the heads would now assess the government's plans in detail before deciding how to proceed. Kevin Courtney, joint leader of the National Education Union, welcomed a longer-term, three-year funding plan. But he said the announcement ""should really come with a note of apology as the government has for so long derided our campaign and said there was no problem with education funding"". Angela Rayner MP, Labour's shadow education secretary, rejected the funding plan as a ""con trick"" which would fail to reverse previous cuts. She said schools were still being ""told to wait years for desperately needed funding"".

"NI schools could get Â£500m boost, says DUP","Northern Ireland schools should benefit from extra funding announced by the prime minister, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has said. Schools in England are being promised billions more in spending over the next three years. That will automatically mean extra money for public spending in Northern Ireland. The DUP said it will amount to an extra Â£500m which should be allocated to education. Multi-billion pound cash boost for schools Q&A: The DUP-Tory deal one year on What is the Barnett formula? The system of devolved public funding,known as the Barnett formula, does not mean the money will automatically be spent on education. Instead, local politicians decide how the extra funds should be allocated. Schools in England were promised billions more in spending over the next three years, in an announcement from Prime Minister Boris Johnson In the absence of a Stormont government, those spending decisions have been made by civil servants and Northern Ireland budgets have been passed at Westminster. The BBC understands it is highly likely some of the new money will be spent on schools in Northern Ireland. School finances have been under intense pressure with school principals warning of worsening budget shortages. Following Mr Johnson's announcement, DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""This is a much-needed boost for education resource funding over the three years starting from 2020/21. ""I have already spoken with the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson who has confirmed that there will be a Barnett consequential for Northern Ireland of Â£500m. ""This will be on top of the additional funding which has already been delivered for education through our confidence-and-supply agreement."" Allow Twitter content?

In the DUP's 2017 confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Conservatives, the government agreed a financial package with the party in exchange for support on certain issues.

She added that she was ""deeply frustrated"" with the lack of a Northern Ireland Assembly. ""Sinn FÃ©in continues to place their preconditions above getting on with the job. It's time for them to lift the boycott,"" she said. When contacted by BBC News NI, a Downing Street spokesperson said more details of any extra education funding for Northern Ireland were unlikely to be revealed until the chancellor Sajid Javid announces his spending review.

Thousands face electricity price rises in autumn,"Thousands of Northern Ireland electricity customers will face increased energy costs this autumn. SSE Airtricity, the second biggest supplier, is raising prices by almost 7% or Â£39 a year for the typical household. Electric Ireland, the third biggest supplier, is imposing an 8% increase or Â£44 a year. The firms said the rises reflected increased costs from the network provider and the market operator.

David Manning, director of Home Energy at SSE Airtricity, said: ""We're disappointed to have to announce an increase in our electricity prices at this time. ""While there have been reductions in wholesale energy costs these have been negated by external cost increases applied to all energy suppliers."" SSE has about 170,000 household customers, which is just over 20% of the market. Electric Ireland has around 92,000 domestic customers, about 11% of the market.

The case went to the highest court in the UK, which ruled in August 2018 thatdenying the benefit to unmarried parents breached human rights law.,external ""The Supreme Court decided that the government was discriminating against these children, but nothing has changed,"" Ms McLaughlin said. ""You would like to think that somebody would have decided to move quickly on this."" It is five years since she began her legal battle. Her children were 19, 17, 13 and 11 when Mr Adams died from cancer. ""They lost their daddy, but then they also lost out because I had to go out more to work,"" she said. Ms McLaughlin took on three jobs to support her family. ""Had I been able to work one job, then I still would have been there for them coming in from school with the dinner ready for them - but that just went,"" she said. She said she took the legal challenge mainly not for herself, but for the children of other unmarried parents who lose a mother or father. Bereavement charities said more than 2,000 families a year are in the same situation. Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster, Georgia Elms, who works for the Widowed and Young charity said marital status made no difference to grieving. ""Families are trying to bring up their children without this financial support which is really needed,"" she said. ""These children, just because their parents aren't married, their grief is no different, their needs are no different."" Ms McLaughlin is pressing for the government to change the eligibility for Widowed Parents' Allowance, to bring it in line with the judgement. ""How can they not? It really is shameful that they haven't. We are talking about children who have lost a parent,"" she said. The Department for Work and Pensions has said it is ""committed to supporting people during bereavement and have widened the support available"". A spokesperson added: ""This is in addition to help provided for co-habiting couples through the wider welfare system."" The Supreme Court judgement did not automatically change the law. But by declaring the current law was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, it put pressure on politicians to act. Siobhan McLaughlin's solicitor Laura Banks may go to the European Court of Human Rights Other bereaved families from around the UK have contacted Ms McLaughlin's solicitor, Laura Banks. ""The Supreme Court has said the restriction amounts to unlawful discrimination,"" Ms Banks said. ""The government should be treating this as a priority. ""This is pushing families into poverty, sometimes into debt - and that's unacceptable."" Ms Banks has not ruled out taking the issue to the European Court of Human Rights in the future. ""We would like to think the government would act on this,"" she said. ""But absolutely, if there is no progress we will have to consider other options."" The matter was raised in the Work and Pensions Committee at Westminster last month. The Minister for Family Support and Child Maintenance, Will Quince, gave evidence to the committee's inquiry into support for the bereaved. He told MPs: ""Because of the complexity, every time I think I am looking at a potential solution, there are more unintended consequences that then lead to more issues."" But he added: ""I desperately want to find a solution to this as quickly as possible."" Asked by the Conservative MP Nigel Mills if the options included ""do nothing"", Mr Quince replied they did not. He said: ""I am determined to find a resolution, but it has to be the right one.""

"NI schools set to get extra Â£500m, claims DUP","Northern Ireland schools should benefit from extra funding announced by the prime minister, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has said. Schools in England are being promised billions more in spending over the next three years. That will automatically mean extra money for public spending in Northern Ireland. The DUP said it will amount to an extra Â£500m which should be allocated to education. Multi-billion pound cash boost for schools Q&A: The DUP-Tory deal one year on What is the Barnett formula? The system of devolved public funding,known as the Barnett formula, does not mean the money will automatically be spent on education. Instead, local politicians decide how the extra funds should be allocated. Schools in England were promised billions more in spending over the next three years, in an announcement from Prime Minister Boris Johnson In the absence of a Stormont government, those spending decisions have been made by civil servants and Northern Ireland budgets have been passed at Westminster. The BBC understands it is highly likely some of the new money will be spent on schools in Northern Ireland. School finances have been under intense pressure with school principals warning of worsening budget shortages. Following Mr Johnson's announcement, DUP leader Arlene Foster said: ""This is a much-needed boost for education resource funding over the three years starting from 2020/21. ""I have already spoken with the Education Secretary Gavin Williamson who has confirmed that there will be a Barnett consequential for Northern Ireland of Â£500m. ""This will be on top of the additional funding which has already been delivered for education through our confidence-and-supply agreement."" Allow Twitter content?

In the DUP's 2017 confidence-and-supply arrangement with the Conservatives, the government agreed a financial package with the party in exchange for support on certain issues. Mrs Foster said she had asked to meet the permanent secretary in the Department of Education to ""press for special needs to be prioritised in Northern Ireland too"". She added that she was ""deeply frustrated"" with the lack of a Northern Ireland Assembly. ""Sinn FÃ©in continues to place their preconditions above getting on with the job. It's time for them to lift the boycott,"" she said. When contacted by BBC News NI, a Downing Street spokesperson said more details of any extra education funding for Northern Ireland were unlikely to be revealed until the chancellor Sajid Javid announces his spending review.

Evans beaten by Federer masterclass,"Roger Federer is chasing a record sixth men's singles title at the US Open US Open 2019 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:26 Aug - 8 Sep Coverage:Live text and BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra commentary on selected matches on the BBC Sport website and app. Clickherefor Live Guide. British number two Dan Evans was outclassed as Swiss great Roger Federer rediscovered his best form to ease into the US Open fourth round. Federer, 38, played with his trademark fluency in a 6-2 6-2 6-1 victory on Arthur Ashe Stadium. The third seed had dropped the first sets in both of his previous two matches, but played with a swagger. Five-time champion Federer, who lost in the last 16 last year, will play Belgian 15th seed David Goffin next. Evans was playing his second match in 24 hours after only completing his three-hour victory over French 25th seed Lucas Pouille at about 15:00 local time on Thursday. Despite only leaving the Flushing Meadows site at about 18:00, the world number 58 had to be back to play Federer at midday on Friday. ""I was fatigued, I thought it was pretty tough to be first up after playing yesterday if I'm brutally honest,"" Evans, 29, said. ""Him being totally fresh and me battling yesterday, it is completely polar opposite. ""To try and beat him being tired, stiff, and having played four setsâ¦ it is nigh on impossible. ""He played near-perfect tennis."" Follow day five of the US Open - live radio and text commentary Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Evans, resurrecting his career after being without a ranking last year, pushed the 20-time Grand Slam champion when they met at the Australian Open in January but the 29-year-old could not impose himself in what proved to be a miserable first appearance on Ashe. The Briton did not look overawed by the occasion as he stepped out in the lunchtime New York heat, laughing with Federer and basketball legend Kobe Bryant - who was helping with the coin toss - at the net. But the smiles soon turned to grimaces as he was beaten in one hour 20 minutes - the shortest completed men's match of the tournament. Evans played some wonderful stuff in his second-round win over 25th seed Lucas Pouille on Thursday, albeit helped by an erratic display from the Frenchman who could not land a first serve and clocked up 81 unforced errors. Here, he was given no help by Federer. The Swiss, perhaps benefiting by an extra day off than Evans, showed his intentions by starting the match with an ace and was then allowed to dictate his service games, pushing forward regularly and finishing by winning 69% of his 36 net points. The second set flashed by Evans, with Federer not dropping a single point on his serve and hitting 20 winners compared to none from the Briton. ""In the locker room we call that a golden set,"" former player Jeff Tarango said on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra commentary. ""It's a golden serving set - it's so hard to serve a whole set without losing a point and we've just seen Roger Federer do it. ""Federer is definitely going to talk about it at dinner."" Evans earned some brief respite in the third by breaking back for 2-1 and showed his relief with a huge roar. That could not inspire a change of fortunes, however, Federer stepping up to immediately regain his advantage and then win the next three games to seal a comfortable win.

"Tetra Pak billionaire Hans Rausing dies at 93The driving force behind the packaging giant will also be remembered for his philanthropy, his family says.Business","Hans Rausing, the Swedish billionaire who helped build food packaging company Tetra Pak into a global giant, has died aged 93. Son of its founder, Ruben Rausing, he ran the firm from 1950 until 1995 - when he sold his share in the family business to his brother. Mr Rausing was known for his philanthropy in Sweden and the UK. His family's fortune, estimated by Forbes at $12bn (Â£9.8bn), makes them one of the richest living in the UK. In recent years, Mr Rausing's family were hit by scandal, afterhis son was given a suspended prison sentence for failing to report the death of his wife. Hans Rausing's father, Ruben, founded Tetra Pak, later Tetra Laval, in Sweden in 1944. The company is widely praised for revolutionising the global food packing trade. The original design for its innovative cardboard packaging was a tetrahedron, giving the firm its name, but the company's fortunes only really took off in the late 1960s under the leadership of Hans and his brother Gad. Watch: How the Tetra Pak became a million dollar idea The invention of the now more common cube-shaped cartons and aseptic technology to preserve the contents helped Tetra Pak replace heavier, breakable glass bottles in a growing number of markets. In the 1980s the Rausing brothers moved to the UK in order to avoid the higher rate of tax in their home country and Hans Rausing shot to the top of the UK's rich list. After he left the family firm in 1995, Mr Rausing, who lived in Wadhurst, East Sussex, devoted part of his time to philanthropy. More than Â£1bn was given to causes including innovation and research in medicine, human rights, culture and the environment, his family said. In 2006 he was made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) for his philanthropic activities. His three children said in a joint statement: ""Our father was an extraordinary man, achieving so many things in his long and distinguished career as entrepreneur and industrialist, and then as a philanthropist supporting multiple charities and foundations. ""We are very proud of that, but most of all we will cherish our fond memories of him as a loving father and devoted family man."" His son, Hans Kristian Rausing, was sentenced in 2012 for delaying the lawful and decent burial of his wife. The charge came after police discovered the decomposing body ofEva Rausing, 48,at the couple's home in Belgravia, central London. Police found the mother-of-four, who had been dead for two months, under a pile of clothing and bin bags during a police search following Hans Kristian Rausing's arrest on suspicion of drugs possession. The couple had fought a public battle against drug addiction after meeting in a rehabilitation centre in the 1980s. Million dollar idea: The Tetra Pak.

Multi-billion pound cash boost given to schoolsSchools in England will benefit by more than Â£7bn over the next three years.Family & Education,"Schools in England are being promised billions more in spending over the next three years, in an announcement from Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Next year schools will receive a Â£2.6bn uplift, rising to Â£4.8bn the following year - with schools spending Â£7.1bn more than at present by 2022-23. It follows a campaign by school leaders warning of worsening budget shortages. Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton said the extra cash was a recognition of the ""severity of the funding crisis"".

Evans beaten by Federer masterclassBritish number two Dan Evans is outclassed as Roger Federer eases into the US Open fourth round.BBC Sport,"Roger Federer is chasing a record sixth men's singles title at the US Open US Open 2019 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:26 Aug - 8 Sep Coverage:Live text and BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra commentary on selected matches on the BBC Sport website and app. Clickherefor Live Guide. British number two Dan Evans was outclassed as Swiss great Roger Federer rediscovered his best form to ease into the US Open fourth round. Federer, 38, played with his trademark fluency in a 6-2 6-2 6-1 victory on Arthur Ashe Stadium. The third seed had dropped the first sets in both of his previous two matches, but played with a swagger. Five-time champion Federer, who lost in the last 16 last year, will play Belgian 15th seed David Goffin next. Evans was playing his second match in 24 hours after only completing his three-hour victory over French 25th seed Lucas Pouille at about 15:00 local time on Thursday. Despite only leaving the Flushing Meadows site at about 18:00, the world number 58 had to be back to play Federer at midday on Friday. ""I was fatigued, I thought it was pretty tough to be first up after playing yesterday if I'm brutally honest,"" Evans, 29, said. ""Him being totally fresh and me battling yesterday, it is completely polar opposite. ""To try and beat him being tired, stiff, and having played four setsâ¦ it is nigh on impossible. ""He played near-perfect tennis."" Follow day five of the US Open - live radio and text commentary Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Evans, resurrecting his career after being without a ranking last year, pushed the 20-time Grand Slam champion when they met at the Australian Open in January but the 29-year-old could not impose himself in what proved to be a miserable first appearance on Ashe. The Briton did not look overawed by the occasion as he stepped out in the lunchtime New York heat, laughing with Federer and basketball legend Kobe Bryant - who was helping with the coin toss - at the net. But the smiles soon turned to grimaces as he was beaten in one hour 20 minutes - the shortest completed men's match of the tournament. Evans played some wonderful stuff in his second-round win over 25th seed Lucas Pouille on Thursday, albeit helped by an erratic display from the Frenchman who could not land a first serve and clocked up 81 unforced errors. Here, he was given no help by Federer. The Swiss, perhaps benefiting by an extra day off than Evans, showed his intentions by starting the match with an ace and was then allowed to dictate his service games, pushing forward regularly and finishing by winning 69% of his 36 net points. The second set flashed by Evans, with Federer not dropping a single point on his serve and hitting 20 winners compared to none from the Briton. ""In the locker room we call that a golden set,"" former player Jeff Tarango said on BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra commentary. ""It's a golden serving set - it's so hard to serve a whole set without losing a point and we've just seen Roger Federer do it. ""Federer is definitely going to talk about it at dinner."" Evans earned some brief respite in the third by breaking back for 2-1 and showed his relief with a huge roar. That could not inspire a change of fortunes, however, Federer stepping up to immediately regain his advantage and then win the next three games to seal a comfortable win.

Schools funding boost to be confirmed,"A leaked government document appears to confirm an expected Â£4bn boost in funding for schools in England. Details of the cash injection for education,revealed by the BBCat the weekend, have been published by the Guardian newspaper. It follows warnings by heads and teachers of a worsening funding crisis in schools and colleges. In the Conservative leadership campaign, Boris Johnson had promised to reverse cuts to school budgets. Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton said school leaders would ""need some convincing that any funding commitment really does address the crisis and isn't simply part of a strategy for a forthcoming general election"". It is understood thatthe leaked document published by the Guardian,externalshows the education department's bid for funding, rather than a final outcome. It includes proposals for how extra funding would be spent, such as higher starting salaries for teachers to tackle a staffing shortage. There are also suggestions of measures to improve discipline, such as ensuring that teachers are able to use ""reasonable force"" in restraining pupils and to ban mobile phones. Schools to receive Â£4bn extra in funding School funding top priority for Gavin Williamson Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap Â£3.8bn needed to reverse school cuts Schools need multi-billion cash injection, say MPs And there would be a further commitment to open more free schools. But it is understood that these have been ideas put forward during negotiations for more funding - and that the final deal will reflect Mr Johnson's pledge to put Â£4.6bn extra per year into schools by 2022. A one-year settlement would be seen as a stepping stone towards that amount. The Guardian's leak breaks down potential increases - including Â£2.8bn for primary and secondary schools up to the age of 16, including Â£800m for children with special educational needs and disabilities. A further Â£800m could be for two areas which have faced particular funding problems - sixth form and further education. Putting more money into cash-strapped schools is likely to be seen as a popular grassroots measure ahead of a possible autumn general election. There has been a long-running campaign by school leaders protesting about inadequate funding. This was backed by analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that suggestedschools had suffered budget reductions of 8%since 2010. The Department for Education had rejected such accusations, saying that schools were receiving record levels of funding. But teachers' unions and head teachers' campaign groups have maintained a constant challenge - writing directly to millions of parents about the financial difficulties facing schools. Further protests by head teachers are expected in the autumn term - and school leaders will want to check the detail of any promises. Jules White, the West Sussex head teacher who has organised a funding campaign involving thousands of schools, says there is a ""strong sentiment"" among heads that there must be a ""guaranteed long-term settlement"" and there is transparency in the detail of what is being promised. ""Once we see the details we will tell parents the accurate truth again,"" said Mr White. ""If the news is good we will say it but we will not be fobbed off by any election-driven gimmicks."" Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said schools would welcome any increase in funding. But he warned that: ""Any extra money must be allocated immediately and it needs to be part of a longer-term commitment to reverse the education cuts because the sums of money being discussed are not enough to achieve that objective on their own."" Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: ""Time after time Boris Johnson has backed Tory cuts to school budgets that created the crisis in our classrooms, while slashing taxes for the richest. ""Johnson shows no sign of taking the action needed to undo that damage, and isn't even proposing to reverse the Conservatives' cuts to schools since 2010.""

YouTube restores far-right channels after appeal,"Mr Sellner protested about the removal of his channel from YouTube The channels of two prominent far-right YouTubers have been re-instated after the video-sharing site said it made a mistake in removing them. Initially, YouTube gave no reason for changing its decision and just said it had made a ""wrong call"". Later, it said that while many people found the channels ""deeply offensive"", they had not broken its rules. The decision came days after YouTube's chief executive said YouTube had to be open to hosting ""controversial"" ideas. YouTube removed several channels and accounts this week, claiming they had broken its hate speech policies. Among them was a channel run by white nationalist Martin Sellner and an anonymous British YouTuber known as The Iconoclast. Mr Sellner was reportedly in contact with the man who allegedly carried out the Christchurch mosque shootings in March this year that killed 51 people.Austrian police are investigatinghis links to the attack. He denies any involvement in the shooting. Mr Sellneris also banned from enteringthe UK, with authorities saying his presence would not be ""conducive to the public good"". Both men protested about the closure of their YouTube channels on social media. They shared information sent to them from YouTube, which said they had ""repeatedly"" broken its guidelines. On Thursday, YouTube reversed its decision and reinstated the two channels. Several other far-right channels that YouTube banned this week remain unavailable. An explanation for the change of heart came on Friday. Farshad Shadloo, YouTube's global product policy communications lead, said that after a ""thorough review"" it had decided that the channels had not broken its rules.

""Hearing a broad range of perspectives ultimately makes us a stronger and more informed society,"" she claimed. On Thursday, a previously banned channel called the War Room returned to YouTube. The War Room is a programme produced by right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars brand. Infowars was removed from YouTube in 2018 for repeatedly breaking the site's rules on harassment and hate speech.

A night of mayhem in Hong Kong," By Saira Asher and Grace Tsoi  A political crisis has raged in Hong Kong through the summer and protest has spread to almost every corner of the territory - from suburban housing estates to neon shopping districts. It has, at times, spilled over into violent clashes. The protest on Sunday 25 August, in the working-class district of Tsuen Wan, came after the first full week without incident since June. Some had hoped that the worst of the violence was over. It did flare up, though, and with a new level of intensity. A warning shot was fired by a police officer - the first time a live round has been used since the demonstrations broke out in June. Also for the first time, water cannon  made an appearance. And a 12-year-old was among dozens arrested - the youngest detained to date. All of this has created a new sense of foreboding. This is the story of one evening in Hong Kong. Telegram chat has been translated and edited. Names have been changed Telegram chat has been translated and edited. Names have been changed  The Tsuen Wan protest began much like any other, with a group of people who wanted the city-wide outcry to be marked in their own neighbourhood. There is only one way that can happen - via the encrypted messaging app Telegram, where there are dozens of groups dedicated to ensuring the protest movement stays alive, stays strategic, well organised and supplied. Some groups - with tens of thousands of members - discuss strategy. Smaller channels organise protest logistics and provide live updates about marches, while individual channels coordinate supplies, first aid, and even offer to make posters. It was on Telegram where about a dozen or so strangers from Kwai Chung and Tsuen Wan connected in June to organise the 25 August protest. One of them was 26-year-old Potter. “We never thought we would do it by ourselves,” he said, adding that none of them had done it before. Within days, those well-established Telegram groups for promotion, medical volunteers, supply procurement and even drivers swung into action for Tsuen Wan. There was even advice on how to negotiate with police to get permission to march. The supplies team collected 10 large bags of  water, bandages and other necessities, which had been mostly donated by enthusiastic residents. “Before the march, we had identified potential hotspots so we placed some supplies and protective gear nearby,” said Vita, a volunteer. “The movement can only become so big because everybody contributes in their own way,” Potter said. But he was quick to say that he was not a leader of the movement - in fact no-one could be called that. Protesters know it’s harder for the government to crack down if individuals can't be identified as faces of the movement. Their spiritual predecessor was the 2014 Umbrella Movement, which called for universal suffrage. Seventy-nine days of occupying central Hong Kong won no concessions from the government and put the movement’s leaders in jail. Umbrella Movement - October 19, 2014 Umbrella Movement - October 19, 2014 This time round, the popular messaging forum, LIHKG, has been used to make broad decisions about the direction of the movement. Posts are voted on by thousands of people, and whichever strategy gets the most votes is put into action. While Potter is helping to organise a peaceful march, most protesters know that violence will likely break out afterwards - as it has after many previous rallies. The hardline groups - those who form the frontline, facing police tear gas - are much smaller. Their Telegram chats are private. One hardline protester, who goes by the name Scorched Earth, said his group doesn't plan its moves much in advance. “We will fight every time there are clashes after protests,” he said. “This regime relies on the police force to maintain its rule. If we defeat the police, they can no longer avoid having a dialogue with us.” He believes there is a tacit understanding between the non-violent and more forceful camps. “They know something will happen next.”  Thousands of people streamed sedately in the pouring rain along the planned route, some 2.5km to the heart of Tsuen Wan. They chanted slogans like, “Heung Gong yahn ga yau”, which translates as “Hong Kong people add oil” -  but is used as an expression of encouragement to mean “keep going”. It has become one of the main slogans of the movement. Families with small children, the elderly and young adults mingled - but there were no police in sight, presumably because they knew, as with previous protests, that this is not where the violence would erupt.  A small group of young men set up barricades to block off part of a road from traffic. It was playful, lighthearted and one was just 15 years old. They had gone to great lengths to hide their faces. Since the start of this movement, protesters have concealed their identities. As well as using encrypted messaging apps, they have not given journalists too many personal details and avoided using their personal train passes for transport - for fear of being tracked by the authorities. Along the route, a family with two boys - aged three and six - handed out home-made rice balls. When the stream of people reached Tsuen Wan Park, the official end of the march, there was a sense that it wasn’t over. But no-one was sure where the focus might shift to next. “Hong Kong is now at a critical moment,” said one girl dressed all in black, as she watched the Telegram chats for live updates. Under a canopy, medical volunteers were making their final preparations in case things turned violent. “We are deciding on the positions of the patrol teams in case of emergency,” said Jonathan, a medical student who was among some 80 first aiders on the ground. Meanwhile, a few hundred metres away, on Yeung Uk Road - a major artery in the industrial neighbourhood - barricades were being set up. Hundreds of hardline protesters were gathering, wearing yellow hard hats and dressed in black.  Some of them had made their way over from the peaceful march. The hardliners believe escalating action and provoking the police is the only way to make the government take any action. They came ready to face tear gas and rubber bullets, their determination manifest as they dug up bricks from pavements to throw at police, and gathered metal gates and bamboo poles to shore up the barricades. Although these scenes are now common in Hong Kong, this hardline group has become increasingly militant. They have upped the ante every weekend. This time they came with petrol bombs.   A sense of anticipation swept through the crowd, as everyone got the next update on Telegram. “1650 Riot police is advancing,” the message said. As if on cue, the crowd moved towards Yeung Uk Road, to shout their support and watch the drama unfold. They arrived to find riot police arranged across the road in straight lines, their full-length shields forming a transparent bullet-proof wall in front of them. Anger surged through the front liners and bystanders, as well as those crowding the overhead footbridges. For many of those involved in the movement, the police have become a symbol of hate. Insults were hurled and piercing strands of neon blue light cut over the heads of the crowd, as a few protesters shone bright laser beams at the police - another tactic used to provoke and disorient officers. “Hong Kong police break the law knowingly,” someone shouted. There were chants of “add oil” and a deafening drum beat as people banged their umbrellas on any hard surface they could find. Suddenly, the hardline protesters rushed their barricades forward to within 50m of the police. Umbrellas out, they crouched behind the water-filled plastic barriers armed with bricks and metal poles. Some threw eggs, others poured soap and batteries on the ground to stop riot police from advancing. “We are just trying to express our feelings. We think the police are using force against protesters and journalists and we think we should speak out and stop this kind of madness,” said a frontline protester, his face fully covered. Then police raised a red warning flag - a signal that force would be used to disperse the crowds. Minutes later, a black flag went up, indicating tear gas would be fired. Police put on their gas masks, stood their shields up and prepared to fire. Police protocol dictates there should be some time between the warning and firing of the tear gas, to allow people to leave the vicinity. But the protesters were undeterred - the use of tear gas is routine now - and they put their own masks on. Twenty tense minutes passed, with more chanting, beating of umbrellas and taunts at police. “Now there are so many police,” said a male protester wearing a yellow helmet and a gas mask on the frontline. “We are a bit afraid and want to make sure those without gear will be able to leave safely.” As the first police tear gas rounds were fired over the protester lines, the protesters readied their own weapons - Molotov cocktails. As the smoke swept into the crowd, the first of many petrol bombs was thrown into the space between the two sides. Some protesters, armed with water guns, rushed to put out the tear gas canisters as they landed on the street. A man with a blue tennis racket, swimming floats on his arms for protection, started batting some of the canisters back at police. More threw the bricks and projectiles they had brought. Bamboo poles, metal barricades and signposts went flying towards police. Some used their umbrellas to catch tear gas canisters and lob them back at officers. A long-haired man fell to his knees as he breathed in CS gas, a component of tear gas that causes dizziness or difficulty breathing. Someone threw him a water bottle to pour over his face.  One student in her 20s who had earlier been on the peaceful march had little to protect her from the tear gas. It was her first experience of it. “I am not afraid. I am mentally prepared for it,” she said. In a nearby shopping centre, medical volunteers washed people's reddened eyes with saline and tended to protesters who were vomiting after inhaling the smoke.  Telegram lit up with a new warning, that water cannon trucks had been spotted in the area. This was the first time water cannon had been deployed in these protests, and some protesters retreated - unsure of their power. Telegram chat has been translated and edited. Names have been changed Telegram chat has been translated and edited. Names have been changed Most protesters held their positions. Many, crouching down, continued to beat poles or bamboo sticks on the floor and railings. Some had climbed on to an overhead footbridge and were throwing fire bombs and bricks from above. Dozens of police ran up the stairs to stop them. The main battle only ended when two water cannon trucks ploughed down the main street, followed by a line of police officers. The powerful water jets sprayed over the debris - canisters, bricks and poles - in the wake of retreating protesters. Despite the intensity of the 25 August confrontation on Yeung Uk Road, those scenes were not shocking for Hong Kong any more. What did shock everyone was what happened next.  Among the 54 people detained on Sunday - for unlawful assembly, possession of weapons and assaulting police officers - was a 12-year-old boy, the youngest person so far to be arrested. News of his arrest spread online. As he was being detained, he yelled out the name of his family members and their phone numbers. Later, we found out that a social worker had contacted them and he had been released on bail. In the hours after the stand-off on Yeung Uk Road, small groups of young men armed with makeshift weapons roamed the narrow streets of Tsuen Wan - streets too small for the water cannon trucks. At around 19:30, a group of police officers encountered a group of protesters. Holding up a shield, one of the officers fired a live shot into the sky. It was the first time live ammunition had been used in 12 weeks of protests. In an instant, five other officers drew their guns and advanced on the protesters. That picture - of this small group of police officers, eyes widened in the heat of the moment and guns held aloft - became a defining image of the night. As the police advanced, a middle-aged man wearing a vest and shorts and armed only with an umbrella, was kicked by one of them, as he knelt begging them not to shoot. Lam Yik Fei /NYT/eyevine Lam Yik Fei /NYT/eyevine Within minutes, the image was being shared online and was being described as an example of police brutality. It even drew comparisons with Tank Man of Tiananmen - the iconic image of a lone, unarmed man with shopping bags standing in front of an advancing row of tanks during the bloody Tiananmen Square crack down in Beijing 30 years ago. But a closer look at the footage of the entire incident, from several angles, shows the story of the 25 August 2019 was much more complex than that. In a statement afterwards, police said the officers had no choice but to defend themselves. Even after that stand-off, protesters fanned out to districts further away - they were seen in Sham Shui Po, Tsim Sha Tsui and the Cross-Harbour Tunnel. In doing this, they were putting into action the philosophy “Be Water” - which has emerged as a mantra in these protests. It has been taken from a famous line spoken by martial arts legend Bruce Lee to denote the importance of being fluid and adapting to different circumstances. In Hong Kong, it has become a rallying cry for protesters to be nimble and adapt to fast-changing situations. So, in a bid to outwit the police, protesters move swiftly to other parts of the city. As the evening of violence unfolded in Tsuen Wan, many residents of the housing estates there lined the streets - egging on the protesters and shouting their support. A small of group of protesters vandalised local shops they believed may be pro-Beijing - sparking fears that triad gangs, known to be in the area, may get involved again. At the end of July, white-shirted men, thought to be triads, attacked black-shirted protesters in the district of Yuen Long. In Tsuen Wan itself, there was a knife attack on black-shirted protesters just weeks ago. Meanwhile, in the district of Sham Shui Po, a solitary man was seen defiantly waving a Chinese flag outside a police station - two of the symbols most hated by protesters - provoking abuse from black-clad protesters. For his own protection - it appeared - police swiftly pulled him inside the station. The movement still has mass support in Hong Kong despite the routine disruption to the lives of those who support it. There is an understanding between the two types of protester. The more peaceful ones feel they must come out in large numbers because those who are more extreme are risking so much. Even though his peaceful march was marred by the violence that followed, organiser Potter said he wouldn’t distance himself from the more hardcore protesters because they share the same goals. “If we don’t have the courage to escalate our resistance, we will lose faith and be overwhelmed by a sense of helplessness.”      Publication date: 30 August 2019 "
YouTube restores far-right channels after appealThe video-sharing site said it had been wrong to cut off access to the white nationalist channels.,"Mr Sellner protested about the removal of his channel from YouTube The channels of two prominent far-right YouTubers have been re-instated after the video-sharing site said it made a mistake in removing them. Initially, YouTube gave no reason for changing its decision and just said it had made a ""wrong call"". Later, it said that while many people found the channels ""deeply offensive"", they had not broken its rules. The decision came days after YouTube's chief executive said YouTube had to be open to hosting ""controversial"" ideas. YouTube removed several channels and accounts this week, claiming they had broken its hate speech policies. Among them was a channel run by white nationalist Martin Sellner and an anonymous British YouTuber known as The Iconoclast. Mr Sellner was reportedly in contact with the man who allegedly carried out the Christchurch mosque shootings in March this year that killed 51 people.Austrian police are investigatinghis links to the attack. He denies any involvement in the shooting. Mr Sellneris also banned from enteringthe UK, with authorities saying his presence would not be ""conducive to the public good"". Both men protested about the closure of their YouTube channels on social media. They shared information sent to them from YouTube, which said they had ""repeatedly"" broken its guidelines. On Thursday, YouTube reversed its decision and reinstated the two channels. Several other far-right channels that YouTube banned this week remain unavailable. An explanation for the change of heart came on Friday. Farshad Shadloo, YouTube's global product policy communications lead, said that after a ""thorough review"" it had decided that the channels had not broken its rules. ""We realise that many may find the viewpoints expressed in these channels deeply offensive,"" he said. Mr Shadloo added that YouTube had recently updated the way it handled ""hateful content"". This had led to it removing ""thousands of accounts and tens of thousands of videos"". InfoWars and its owner Alex Jones were removed from YouTube in 2018 Earlier this weekYouTube boss Susan Wojcicki wrote in a letter,externalto video-makers that YouTube must remain an ""open platform"". She said the desire to welcome all kinds of views had to be balanced against a ""responsibility to protect the community"". ""A commitment to openness is not easy. It sometimes means leaving up content that is outside the mainstream, controversial or even offensive,"" she said. ""Hearing a broad range of perspectives ultimately makes us a stronger and more informed society,"" she claimed. On Thursday, a previously banned channel called the War Room returned to YouTube. The War Room is a programme produced by right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' Infowars brand. Infowars was removed from YouTube in 2018 for repeatedly breaking the site's rules on harassment and hate speech. In a new video, the War Room quoted Ms Wojcicki's letter, suggesting it meant the Infowars ban was over. But the War Room channel has since been closed by YouTube with no explanation.

"'Costs soar at hotel of mum and dad'Offspring returning to the parental home increasingly enjoy free meals, laundry and lifts, a survey has found.Business","Bethany Osborne moved back in to her parents' house with her children Oliver, 1, and Evelyn, 5, last Christmas Bethany Osborne left home at 19, but now, at 22, she's back in her parents' home in Romford, using their washing machine, eating food from the fridge and watching TV on her dad's Netflix account. ""I do my own washing if I get to the machine first. But my mum generally does it,"" she admits. The pile of dirty clothes is not just hers. She has a five-year-old and a one-year-old too. ""Buying the kids' clothes and food - I do it sometimes,"" she adds, but most of the time her mum's got there first. About a quarter of young adults in the UK aged 20-34 live at home, a figure which,according to the Office for National Statistics,external, has been growing steadily for 15 years. Many returning adult children enjoy home comforts such as cooked meals, a full fridge and cleaning, as well as their bills being covered by the ""hotel of mum and dad"", according to a survey by price comparison website MoneySuperMarket. The average cost to the hoteliers - mum and dad - has gone up sharply, meaning parents are sacrificing luxuries and holidays, the survey found. Mum and dad 'one of UK's biggest mortgage lenders' Housemates from hell - me and my 23-year-old son MoneySuperMarket found that last year, adult offspring were returning for an average of 9.7 months, while parents were incurring costs of around Â£895. This year, the ""kidults"" were staying longer - just over 10 months - and costing their parents Â£1,640 as the householders shouldered the water, heating and electricity bills, as well as paying for takeaway meals, toiletries and food. The price comparison site surveyed 500 adults who had moved back into their parents' home and 500 parents who had adult children back living with them. MoneySuperMarket's spokeswoman, Emma Craig, says parents are under huge emotional pressure to help children struggling with their finances. ""I think what we're seeing is more young people with more debt, so when they're going back to their parents', they're coming with higher student loans, probably credit card debt, maybe payday loans."" ""So the reason parents are paying more is they're trying to look after their children more. If your child comes home and you see them struggling financially, you feel more awkward asking them for rent or to contribute. It tugs on your heartstrings more."" Parents often end up doing the laundry of grown up children The survey found that 18% of adult children said they were moving back home because of debt, compared with 8% last year. Moreover, 12% said it was because they had lost their job, compared with 7% last year. This year, 27% said it was because they couldn't afford their rent, compared with 25% last year. On top of the day-to-day spending, parents reported forking out Â£1,886 on redecorating, buying new furniture and upgrading their wi-fi to accommodate returning offspring. In Bethany's case, she doesn't have any extra debt on top of her student loans, but her relationship with her partner broke down and as a trainee nurse she couldn't afford to rent an apartment on her own. With seven of them in her parents' house (including a 20-year-old sister home from university and an 18-year-old brother still at college), there is friction over the one bathroom and who should unload the dishwasher. But her parents seem willing, determined even, to shoulder the costs and help out, says Bethany. ""My mum feels obliged to, because it's like when we were little. She feels the three of us - me, my brother and sister - are like her little kids still,"" she says.

Inaction on widowed parent benefits 'shameful',"This video can not be played Siobhan McLaughin has not received any payment one year on from her Supreme Court win A mother who won a major court case on bereavement benefits has said it is ""shameful"" no progress has been made one year on. Siobhan McLaughlin, from County Antrim, was denied the Widowed Parent's Allowance because she was not married to the father of her children. Shesuccessfully challenged the decision in the Supreme Court,but has not received any payment. The government is ""actively considering options following the ruling"". Siobhan McLaughlin's partner John Adams died in 2014. They had lived together for 23 years and had four children together. John Adams had four children with Siobhan McLaughlin When she discovered parents who were not married or in a civil partnership were unable to claim the allowance - which is aimed at supporting children - she decided to challenge the criteria in court. The case went to the highest court in the UK, which ruled in August 2018 thatdenying the benefit to unmarried parents breached human rights law.,external ""The Supreme Court decided that the government was discriminating against these children, but nothing has changed,"" Ms McLaughlin said. ""You would like to think that somebody would have decided to move quickly on this."" It is five years since she began her legal battle. Her children were 19, 17, 13 and 11 when Mr Adams died from cancer. ""They lost their daddy, but then they also lost out because I had to go out more to work,"" she said. Ms McLaughlin took on three jobs to support her family. ""Had I been able to work one job, then I still would have been there for them coming in from school with the dinner ready for them - but that just went,"" she said. She said she took the legal challenge mainly not for herself, but for the children of other unmarried parents who lose a mother or father. Bereavement charities said more than 2,000 families a year are in the same situation. Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster, Georgia Elms, who works for the Widowed and Young charity said marital status made no difference to grieving. ""Families are trying to bring up their children without this financial support which is really needed,"" she said. ""These children, just because their parents aren't married, their grief is no different, their needs are no different."" Ms McLaughlin is pressing for the government to change the eligibility for Widowed Parents' Allowance, to bring it in line with the judgement. ""How can they not? It really is shameful that they haven't. We are talking about children who have lost a parent,"" she said. The Department for Work and Pensions has said it is ""committed to supporting people during bereavement and have widened the support available"". A spokesperson added: ""This is in addition to help provided for co-habiting couples through the wider welfare system."" The Supreme Court judgement did not automatically change the law. But by declaring the current law was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, it put pressure on politicians to act. Siobhan McLaughlin's solicitor Laura Banks may go to the European Court of Human Rights Other bereaved families from around the UK have contacted Ms McLaughlin's solicitor, Laura Banks. ""The Supreme Court has said the restriction amounts to unlawful discrimination,"" Ms Banks said. ""The government should be treating this as a priority. ""This is pushing families into poverty, sometimes into debt - and that's unacceptable."" Ms Banks has not ruled out taking the issue to the European Court of Human Rights in the future. ""We would like to think the government would act on this,"" she said. ""But absolutely, if there is no progress we will have to consider other options."" The matter was raised in the Work and Pensions Committee at Westminster last month. The Minister for Family Support and Child Maintenance, Will Quince, gave evidence to the committee's inquiry into support for the bereaved. He told MPs: ""Because of the complexity, every time I think I am looking at a potential solution, there are more unintended consequences that then lead to more issues."" But he added: ""I desperately want to find a solution to this as quickly as possible."" Asked by the Conservative MP Nigel Mills if the options included ""do nothing"", Mr Quince replied they did not. He said: ""I am determined to find a resolution, but it has to be the right one.""

"Prisoner swap with Russia under way, Ukraine says","Film-maker Oleg Sentsov received a 20-year jail sentence in Russia in 2015 Ukrainian efforts to swap high-profile prisoners with Russia are ""ongoing"" but will not happen on Friday, officials in Kiev say, rejecting reports that the swaps had taken place. A statement from the presidency denied that the process had been completed. Ukraine's prosecutor general had earlier shared a Facebook post suggesting filmmaker Oleg Sentsov and 24 Ukrainian sailors, had been freed. There was no immediate comment on the swaps from Russia. But a lawyer for Russian prisoners held in Ukraine said none of the prisoners were flying anywhere on Friday. Ukraine's deadliest day Relatives of some of the detainees were reported to be gathering at airports in Kiev. Rumours that a prisoner swap was imminent spread in recent days after Sentsov was moved to Moscow from a prison in Russia's Arctic north and a Ukrainian court freed a Russian journalist. But the Ukrainian presidency sought to play down the reports, warning against ""misinformation"" and urging people not to ""play with society's emotions"". A spokesman for Ukraine's SBU security agency then told the BBC that the exchange was not going to take place on Friday. Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told the Tass news agency only that ""interaction on this subject is taking place behind closed doors, but I can of course confirm some progress"". Sentsov was arrested during a protest against Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and found guilty of plotting terrorist acts. He denied the charges andhis trial was denounced by the US, EU and others as politically motivated. This video can not be played Footage of the Russia-Ukraine sea clash The sailors detained were seized along with three naval ships as they attempted to pass through the Kerch Strait, the only access to Ukrainian ports on the Sea of Azov. In May an international tribunal ordered Russia torelease the sailors and vessels. A lawyer for three Russian prisoners thought to be involved in the swap said no-one had left. ""Nobody is flying anywhere. All Russian citizens as well as Ukrainian citizens, who planned to take part in the prisoner exchange, are either at assembly points, detention centres or wherever they were serving their sentence,"" ValentynÂ Rybin said in a video posted on Facebook. Ukraine's new President, Volodymyr Zelensky, said when he took office earlier this year that ending the conflict with Russian-backed rebels in the east would be his top priority as president. Mr Zelensky is set to meet President Vladimir Putin as part of a summit next month with the leaders of Germany and France. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday he had spoken with the Russian and Ukrainian presidents and said ""conditions are ripe"" for a meeting. The Russian presidential aide said progress towards a prisoner release was ""very important for the whole atmosphere surrounding a settlement of the Ukrainian crisis"".

Inaction on widowed parent benefits 'shameful'A County Antrim mother won a major court case a year ago but the government has not taken action.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played Siobhan McLaughin has not received any payment one year on from her Supreme Court win A mother who won a major court case on bereavement benefits has said it is ""shameful"" no progress has been made one year on. Siobhan McLaughlin, from County Antrim, was denied the Widowed Parent's Allowance because she was not married to the father of her children. Shesuccessfully challenged the decision in the Supreme Court,but has not received any payment. The government is ""actively considering options following the ruling"". Siobhan McLaughlin's partner John Adams died in 2014. They had lived together for 23 years and had four children together. John Adams had four children with Siobhan McLaughlin When she discovered parents who were not married or in a civil partnership were unable to claim the allowance - which is aimed at supporting children - she decided to challenge the criteria in court. The case went to the highest court in the UK, which ruled in August 2018 thatdenying the benefit to unmarried parents breached human rights law.,external ""The Supreme Court decided that the government was discriminating against these children, but nothing has changed,"" Ms McLaughlin said. ""You would like to think that somebody would have decided to move quickly on this."" It is five years since she began her legal battle. Her children were 19, 17, 13 and 11 when Mr Adams died from cancer. ""They lost their daddy, but then they also lost out because I had to go out more to work,"" she said. Ms McLaughlin took on three jobs to support her family. ""Had I been able to work one job, then I still would have been there for them coming in from school with the dinner ready for them - but that just went,"" she said. She said she took the legal challenge mainly not for herself, but for the children of other unmarried parents who lose a mother or father. Bereavement charities said more than 2,000 families a year are in the same situation. Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster, Georgia Elms, who works for the Widowed and Young charity said marital status made no difference to grieving. ""Families are trying to bring up their children without this financial support which is really needed,"" she said. ""These children, just because their parents aren't married, their grief is no different, their needs are no different."" Ms McLaughlin is pressing for the government to change the eligibility for Widowed Parents' Allowance, to bring it in line with the judgement. ""How can they not? It really is shameful that they haven't. We are talking about children who have lost a parent,"" she said. The Department for Work and Pensions has said it is ""committed to supporting people during bereavement and have widened the support available"". A spokesperson added: ""This is in addition to help provided for co-habiting couples through the wider welfare system."" The Supreme Court judgement did not automatically change the law. But by declaring the current law was incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, it put pressure on politicians to act. Siobhan McLaughlin's solicitor Laura Banks may go to the European Court of Human Rights Other bereaved families from around the UK have contacted Ms McLaughlin's solicitor, Laura Banks. ""The Supreme Court has said the restriction amounts to unlawful discrimination,"" Ms Banks said. ""The government should be treating this as a priority. ""This is pushing families into poverty, sometimes into debt - and that's unacceptable."" Ms Banks has not ruled out taking the issue to the European Court of Human Rights in the future. ""We would like to think the government would act on this,"" she said. ""But absolutely, if there is no progress we will have to consider other options."" The matter was raised in the Work and Pensions Committee at Westminster last month. The Minister for Family Support and Child Maintenance, Will Quince, gave evidence to the committee's inquiry into support for the bereaved. He told MPs: ""Because of the complexity, every time I think I am looking at a potential solution, there are more unintended consequences that then lead to more issues."" But he added: ""I desperately want to find a solution to this as quickly as possible."" Asked by the Conservative MP Nigel Mills if the options included ""do nothing"", Mr Quince replied they did not. He said: ""I am determined to find a resolution, but it has to be the right one.""

Russia swaps prisoners with Ukraine - prosecutor,"Film-maker Oleg Sentsov received a 20-year jail sentence in Russia in 2015 Ukrainian efforts to swap high-profile prisoners with Russia are ""ongoing"" but will not happen on Friday, officials in Kiev say, rejecting reports that the swaps had taken place. A statement from the presidency denied that the process had been completed. Ukraine's prosecutor general had earlier shared a Facebook post suggesting filmmaker Oleg Sentsov and 24 Ukrainian sailors, had been freed. There was no immediate comment on the swaps from Russia. But a lawyer for Russian prisoners held in Ukraine said none of the prisoners were flying anywhere on Friday. Ukraine's deadliest day Relatives of some of the detainees were reported to be gathering at airports in Kiev. Rumours that a prisoner swap was imminent spread in recent days after Sentsov was moved to Moscow from a prison in Russia's Arctic north and a Ukrainian court freed a Russian journalist. But the Ukrainian presidency sought to play down the reports, warning against ""misinformation"" and urging people not to ""play with society's emotions"". A spokesman for Ukraine's SBU security agency then told the BBC that the exchange was not going to take place on Friday. Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told the Tass news agency only that ""interaction on this subject is taking place behind closed doors, but I can of course confirm some progress"". Sentsov was arrested during a protest against Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and found guilty of plotting terrorist acts. He denied the charges andhis trial was denounced by the US, EU and others as politically motivated. This video can not be played Footage of the Russia-Ukraine sea clash The sailors detained were seized along with three naval ships as they attempted to pass through the Kerch Strait, the only access to Ukrainian ports on the Sea of Azov. In May an international tribunal ordered Russia torelease the sailors and vessels. A lawyer for three Russian prisoners thought to be involved in the swap said no-one had left. ""Nobody is flying anywhere. All Russian citizens as well as Ukrainian citizens, who planned to take part in the prisoner exchange, are either at assembly points, detention centres or wherever they were serving their sentence,"" ValentynÂ Rybin said in a video posted on Facebook. Ukraine's new President, Volodymyr Zelensky, said when he took office earlier this year that ending the conflict with Russian-backed rebels in the east would be his top priority as president. Mr Zelensky is set to meet President Vladimir Putin as part of a summit next month with the leaders of Germany and France. French President Emmanuel Macron said on Monday he had spoken with the Russian and Ukrainian presidents and said ""conditions are ripe"" for a meeting. The Russian presidential aide said progress towards a prisoner release was ""very important for the whole atmosphere surrounding a settlement of the Ukrainian crisis"". Fighting in eastern Ukraine has claimed about 13,000 lives since 2014, amid a failed ceasefire deal. Mr Zelensky is a political novice who was a comedian before taking power. This week, Ukraine's parliament sat for the first time since the vote, with Mr Zelensky picking 35-year-old lawyer Oleksiy Honcharuk as his prime minister.
