Harry 'very glad' to join Diana funeral,"This video can not be played Prince Harry criticises the paparazzi for taking pictures of his mother ""while she was still dying"" Prince Harry has said he is ""very glad"" he joined the funeral cortege for his mother, Princess Diana. Harry had previously said walking behind her coffin aged 12 was something no child ""should be asked to do"". He has now told the BBC he doesn't ""have an opinion whether that was right or wrong"", but ""looking back on it"", he is glad to have been part of the day. The prince also paid tribute to his father for the way he took care of them after Diana's death in a car crash. ""One of the hardest things for a parent to have to do is to tell your children that your other parent has died,"" Harry said. ""How you deal with that I don't know but, you know, he was there for us."" Harry and his brother, Prince William, have spoken in a series of interviews leading up to the 20th anniversary of their mother's death on 31 August. Princess Diana was killed in a crash in Paris, aged 36, as the car she was in sped through the Pont de l'Alma tunnel followed by paparazzi photographers. At herinquest in 2008,externalit was ruled that the gross negligence of her driver, Henri Paul, who was drunk, and the paparazzi were to blame for the crash. Prince Harry said: ""One of the hardest things to come to terms with is the fact that the people that chased her into the tunnel were the same people that were taking photographs of her while she was still dying on the back seat of the car."" Prince William told Sunday's 90-minute documentary, Diana, 7 Days, walking behind his mother's coffin was ""one of the hardest things I've ever done"". The Duke of Cambridge, who was 15, recalled using his fringe as a ""safety blanket"" during the ""very long, lonely walk"". ""I felt if I looked at the floor and my hair came down over my face, no-one could see me,"" he said. ""It wasn't an easy decision and it was a sort of collective family decision to do that... there is that balance between duty and family and that's what we had to do."" The balance, he added, was ""between me being Prince William and having to do my bit, versus the private William who just wanted to go into a room and cry, who'd lost his mother"". William and Harry were joined by their father, the Prince of Wales, grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, and uncle, Earl Spencer, in the procession through London. This video can not be played Prince William says he wouldn't let the death of his mother break him In June this year, PrinceHarry was quoted in US magazine Newsweeksaying he did not think the same situation ""would happen today"", adding that no child should be expected to do the same ""under any circumstances"". But speaking to the BBC, Harry echoed his brother, describing the move as ""a group decision"", and one that, in hindsight, he was happy with. Earl Spencer, Diana's brother, recently described the decision to include the young princes in the procession as ""bizarre and cruel"". Royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams said the change in tone from Prince Harry over his involvement in the funeral reflected the realisation that him taking part had provided comfort to millions of people at the time. ""This latest documentary is trying to put what happened into context. (Harry's comments) puts it in a perspective that he is glad he did something - even if it didn't help him at the time - that clearly brought a tremendous comfort to the millions that were watching,"" he told the BBC. ""The fact they were there, there's no question that helped others."" Analysis by Sarah Campbell, BBC News royal correspondent: It is hard to look at the pictures of 15-year-old William and 12-year-old Harry walking behind their mother's coffin and not wonder what was going through their young minds - and now we know. Harry said he was glad he had never cried in public. William constantly referred to ""duty"" - that was why he had to walk behind the coffin when a part of him just wanted to go away and cry. In this latest documentary marking Diana's death, the two princes describe being in a state of shock as people grabbed and wailed at them. There are revealing insights throughout - William describing his thankfulness that they stayed in Balmoral with the Queen, ensuring they had ""privacy to mourn"". In all the coverage in the lead-up to the anniversary, very little has been said about Prince Charles. But Harry shed some light on his father's role, saying: ""He was there for usâ¦ he tried to do his best."" The princes also described seeing their mother deeply distressed in the years before her death after run-ins with photographers, who waited in ""a pack"" for her ""every single time she went out"". ""And I mean a pack, like a pack of dogs, followed her, chased her, harassed her, called her names, spat at her, tried to get a reaction to get that photograph of her lashing out, get her upset,"" William said. The Duke of Cambridge said he had struggled with the outpouring of grief from the public, when they ""didn't even know her"" The documentary also includes interviews with Diana's sister, Lady Sarah McCorquodale, and former Prime Minister Tony Blair. Mr Blair recalled being woken on the day Diana died by a policeman at the foot of his bed, and described his ""shock"" at learning the ""most famous person in the world"" had died. He said the Queen was ""obviously very sad"" when he first spoke to her, but that she also seemed to be aware, as he put it, ""there was going to be a risk that the country's sense of loss turned to a sense of anger and grievance, and then turned against the monarchy"". ""She was concerned about the monarchy herself because the Queen has a very strong instinct about public opinion and how it plays,"" he said. Diana, 7 Days, will be broadcast on BBC One at 19:30 BST on Sunday, 27 August. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Did you meet Princess Diana?

Tillerson piles pressure on Pakistan,"Mr Tillerson suggested Pakistan could lose some privileges American Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has increased pressure on Pakistan over its perceived backing for the Taliban in Afghanistan. Pakistan denies sheltering the Taliban, but Mr Tillerson suggested it could lose US privileges if the government failed ""to change their posture"". He was speaking a day after President Donald Trump unveiled a new strategy, vowing to commit US forces to back Afghan forces fighting the insurgents. The US is a key ally of Pakistan. The country enjoys a special status as a non-Nato alliance partner and has received billions of dollars in aid. Trump rhetoric versus Afghan reality Viewpoint: Why the US should withdraw from Afghanistan Taliban letter to Trump urges withdrawal But Mr Tillerson said this ""could be on the table for discussion if in fact they are unwilling to change their posture or change their approach to how they are dealing with the numerous terrorist organisations that find safe haven in Pakistan. ""It is in Pakistan's interest to take those actions."" Mr Tillerson also stressed that having a stable Pakistan was in US and other countries' interests. ""They are a nuclear power and we have concerns about the security of their weapons. This is not a situation where the US is saying 'this is us and you'."" Mr Tillerson said the Taliban must be made to understand that they could not win a battlefield victory in Afghanistan. But he suggested the US might not either. ""We may not win one but neither will you,"" as he put it, adding that negotiation was the way to bring the conflict to an end. Pakistan has for years deflected US criticism over the issue of safe havens for Taliban and other militants active in Afghanistan. That's partly because Islamabad sees the groups as leverage to prevent its arch-rival India from gaining influence there. It's unlikely that the Trump administration will be able to change Islamabad's strategic calculations, especially as the president has now encouraged India to play a greater role in Afghanistan. Rex Tillerson did mention ways that Washington could press Pakistan, such as withholding military aid and reassessing its status as a major non-Nato US ally. But he also acknowledged concern that too much pressure could destabilise Islamabad. He offered US help to deal with any blowback from a crackdown on the militants. And he suggested that India take some ""steps of rapprochement"" to ease Pakistan's concerns. On Monday night, Mr Trump unveiled a new Afghan strategy, committing the US Army to the open-ended conflict, despite previously advocating its withdrawal. President Trump warned a hasty US withdrawal from Afghanistan would leave a vacuum for terrorists to fill and said he had decided to keep troops there to ""fight to win"" to avoid the mistakes made in Iraq. This video can not be played ""We are not nation building again. We are killing terrorists,"" President Trump said He said his new approach would be more pragmatic and based on conditions on the ground rather than idealistic and time-based, and would switch from nation building to ""killing terrorists"". But Mr Trump refused to be drawn on how many extra troops, if any, would be deployed and gave no timeline for ending the US presence in the country. Washington is thought to be ready to send up to 4,000 additional troops. Mr Trump also, for the first time, left the door open for an eventual peace deal with the Taliban, saying: ""Someday, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban in Afghanistan.""

""Instead of relying on the false narrative of safe havens, the US needs to work with Pakistan to eradicate terrorism,"" a statement said. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani thanked the US for supporting ""the joint struggle against the threat of terrorism"" in Afghanistan. The Taliban promised to make Afghanistan a ""graveyard"" for US forces.

"European court not necessary, says UK","This video can not be played Why the fuss about the European Court of Justice? Theresa May has insisted the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK will come to an end with Brexit. As the governmentpublished new details of its position,external, the PM said the UK would ""take back control of our laws"". But critics say it will be impossible to avoid European judges having a role in enforcing new agreements drawn up with the EU. Ministers say the two sides will keep ""half an eye"" on each other's rulings. Reality Check: What is the European Court of Justice? UK seeks 'close co-operation' on legal disputes The ECJ is in charge of ensuring member states abide by EU law. Its rulings are binding on all member states, and it also settles disputes between countries and EU institutions. In its new policy paper, the government: Does not rule out ECJ keeping its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019 Promises to work with the EU on the ""arrangements for judicial supervision"" during this period Makes clear that the rights of EU citizens living in the UK after Brexit will only be subject to British law - a sticking point in the negotiations with the EU Says giving the ECJ authority over UK-EU disputes would be unprecedented and not ""fair and neutral"" The promise to end ""direct jurisdiction"" in recent policy papers - a phrase not used by Mrs May - has raised questions about what ""indirect"" jurisdiction the EU court could be left with. In the latest publication, about how to enforce disputes after Brexit, the government has outlined several models used by other countries that it says show there is no need for the ECJ to be the final arbiter. But some of these involve the ECJ having an influence on the outcome of disputes, for example by interpreting EU law in a way that binds a disputes panel, or for its past rulings to be taken into account. Today's paper does not pin the government's colours to any particular mast. It throws out a number of possible models for how a trade agreement with the EU would work in terms of resolving disputes. All of the models make it clear that the ECJ will no longer have sole jurisdiction over disputes. The key question is how much influence the ECJ would retain under a bilateral agreement with the UK. The EU will not sign up to an agreement which allows to UK to depart from EU law to the UK's advantage and the EU's disadvantage on things like state aid to companies, or emissions standards. It will want a level playing field in trade and that will mean a lot of EU law as part of the agreement. The reality is that the more closely the Brexit trade agreement replicates EU law, the greater the influence of the ECJ will be. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government was ""clearly backtracking on its earlier red lines and saying there has to be some form of dispute resolution through some form of judicial process"". He added: ""We have said that all along."" Asked if Labour would vote against the government's key piece of Brexit legislation, the repeal bill, when MPs returned from their summer break, Mr Corbyn said: ""We will make that decision just before the vote."" The pro-EU Open Britain campaign group said the government's policy paper was a ""climbdown camouflaged in jingoistic rhetoric"". The group called it ""frustratingly vague"", adding that in almost every example it provides, the ECJ would have ""substantial direct or indirect power over the proposed new relationship between Britain and the EU"". The government said it was not committing to following any of the arrangements set out, ruling out an ""off the shelf"" model. And sources played down the significance of the word ""direct"", saying it meant ECJ rulings would no longer automatically apply to the UK and that the court would no longer be able to strike down domestic UK laws. This video can not be played John Redwood and Chuka Umunna clash over ECJ Asked about her government's position, Mrs May said: ""What we will be able to do is to make our own laws - Parliament will make our laws - it is British judges that will interpret those laws, and it will be the British Supreme Court that will be the ultimate arbiter of those laws."" Earlier Justice Minister Dominic Raab said there would be ""divergence"" between UK and EU case law after Brexit, adding: ""It is precisely because there will be that divergence as we take back control that it makes sense for the UK to keep half an eye on the case law of the EU, and for the EU to keep half an eye on the case law of the UK."" In response, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's lead negotiator, tweeted that the ECJ had to ""keep both eyes open"" to protect citizens' rights. The ECJ's remit extends into many of the areas where the UK is hoping to draw up new arrangements with the EU, including trade and citizens' rights. Mr Raab said ""some form of arbitration"" would be needed, but that this would not be akin to a European court. Arbitration is where disputes are settled by a neutral third party. The UK and the EU could each appoint arbitrators and agree on a third, Mr Raab suggested. Decides whether the institutions of the EU are acting legally, and settles disputes between them Ensures that the member states of the EU are complying with their legal obligations as set out in the EU treaties; and allows member states to challenge EU legislation Interprets EU law at the request of national courts The SNP said the government had accepted the UK must continue to take account of judgements from the ECJ so it now needed to ""ditch their previous so-called red lines to ensure a deal can be found"". SNP External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the best option for Scotland and the rest of the UK was to stay in the EU single market. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said Mrs May's ""red lines are becoming more blurred by the day"", saying the ECJ had ""served Britain's interests well"" and should not be ""trashed"". The European Commission, which is leading the negotiations for the EU, did not comment in response to the government's publication.

Barcelona cell 'planned to hit key sites',"This video can not be played The four suspects were transferred to a Madrid jail on Monday night The cell behind the Barcelona van attack had planned to use explosives against monuments including the city's famous Sagrada Familia church, a suspect has told a Madrid court. Mohamed Houli Chemlal is one of four surviving suspects who gave evidence. He and Driss Oukabir have both been charged with membership of a terrorist organisation and murder. Salah al-Karib has been detained pending further investigations, while Mohammed Aallaa was released on bail. According to Houli Chemlal, the group's plans - which he had known of ""for at least two months - were scaled back when a house packed with bomb-making equipment blew up the day before. He was injured in the accidental blast that reduced the house to rubble in the town of Alcanar. The Alcanar explosion came the day before Thursday's Barcelona attack in which a van was driven at speed down the main Las Ramblas boulevard, killing 13 and injuring more than 100. Judicial sources quoted Houli Chemlal as telling the court a much bigger series of attacks had been planned. Assailants killed a total of 15 people in the van attack, the stabbing of a driver whose car was commandeered shortly afterwards, and a car attack in the resort of Cambrils hours later. Eight members of the cell are dead - two were killed in the Alcanar explosion, and six were later shot by police, including five after the Cambrils attack. The four suspects in court were (L-R) Mohammed Aallaa, Mohamed Houli Chemlal, Sahal al-Karib and Driss Oukabir The last suspect to be killed was Moroccan-born Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, believed to be the driver of the Las Ramblas van. Wearing a fake explosives belt and armed with knives, he was shot dead by police in a vineyard west of Barcelona on Monday. The surviving suspects were moved, under high security, from Barcelona to Madrid for Tuesday's hearing. The court session, a preliminary hearing to gather evidence for a future trial, took place behind closed doors. Who are the suspects? Barcelona and Cambrils attacks: What we know so far Hugs and defiance on Las Ramblas Houli Chemlal was the first to testify, wearing hospital pyjamas. He is still being treated for his injuries from the blast in Alcanar. Oukabir, whose brother Moussa was among suspects killed after the Cambrils attack, has also given evidence to the Madrid court. According to judicial sources, he has changed his story to say that he admits renting the van used in the Las Ramblas attack but thought it was to be used for a house-move. Under earlier police interrogation, he is said to have maintained that his brother Moussa hired the van using documents stolen from him. Both have been held in jail. Gaudi's famous church was allegedly viewed as a target by the suspects Two other suspects were killed in the Alcanar explosion, including Abdelbaki Es Satty, the Moroccan imam from the town of Ripoll thought to have been a radicalising influence on the suspects. The two other suspects appearing in court were: Aallaa, 27, alleged owner of the Audi car used in the Cambrils attack. He has been released on bail, but must attend court every Monday. Salah al-Karib, 34, accused of running an internet cafe in Ripoll used to send money to Morocco. He has been held for a further 72 hours. All four suspects giving evidence are reported to have testified that Es Satty was the ringleader of the group. This video can not be played Spanish police release footage of raids on three homes in the town of Ripoll One victim of the attacks last week, Ana Maria SuÃ¡rez, was buried in Zaragoza as the suspects went to court Meanwhile, in the Italian capital relatives mourned as the bodies of Luca Russo and Bruno Gulotta were flown home As Tuesday's Madrid hearing took place, Ana SuÃ¡rez, a Spanish woman in her 60s killed in Cambrils, was buried in a private ceremony in Zaragoza. Forty-five companies in a Catalonia association of undertakers and funeral companies have offered to perform funerals for the victims without charge.

Identity theft 'at epidemic levels',"Identity theft is reaching ""epidemic levels"", according to a fraud prevention group, with people in their 30s the most targeted group. ID fraudsters obtain personal information before pretending to be that individual and apply for loans or store cards in their name. A total of 89,000 cases were recorded in the first six months of the year by UK anti-fraud organisation Cifas. That is a 5% rise on the same period last year and a new record high. ""We have seen identity fraud attempts increase year on year, now reaching epidemic levels, with identities being stolen at a rate of almost 500 a day,"" said Simon Dukes, chief executive of Cifas. ""These frauds are taking place almost exclusively online. The vast amounts of personal data that is available either online or through data breaches is only making it easier for the fraudster."" The curious case of Leah Palmer Unmasking the fraudsters ID theft accounts for more than half of fraud recorded by Cifas, a not-for-profit organisation that shares fraud prevention tips between businesses and public bodies. More than four in five of these crimes were committed online, it said, with many victims unaware that they had been targeted until they received a random bill or realised their credit rating had slumped. This would prevent them getting a loan of their own. Fraudsters steal identities by gathering information such as their name and address, date of birth and bank account details. They get hold of such information by stealing mail, hacking computers, trawling social media, tricking people into giving details or buying data through the ""dark web"". I got a worrying insight into how our online activity can leave us open to identity theft when a security company offered to examine my digital footprint. Its 30-page report showed that a lot of personal details that might be useful to a criminal were out there on public websites - but if you choose to have an online presence, that is quite hard to avoid. Far more worrying was the presence in hidden corners of the web of some of my passwords for various accounts, harvested in some of the many hacking attacks on major online firms. Luckily I had already changed those passwords, but the security researchers told me that anyone in the Western world who used the internet reasonably often was likely to have their details held in one of these data dumps. That information is up for sale on a number of criminal marketplaces. Identity theft is big business and it is thriving on the dark web. This video can not be played How you can check if your identity has been stolen Victims are more likely to be in their 30s and 40s, often because a good deal of information about them has been gathered online. The stereotypical image of a fraud victim is someone who is elderly and vulnerable, but the over-60s are the only age group that has seen cases fall this year compared with the first half of the year, according to Cifas. The age group which has seen the biggest rise is 21 to 30-year-olds. This finding was mirrored in separate research by credit checking company Experian. It said that since 2014, it was increasingly likely that victims were male, aged in their 20s and living in London. Cifas said it was important that employers needed to be alert to fraud, rather than just consumers. There had been a sharp rise in ID fraudsters applying for loans, online retail, telecoms and insurance products, it added. ""For smaller and medium-sized businesses in particular, they must focus on educating staff on good cyber-security behaviours and raise awareness of the social engineering techniques employed by fraudsters. Relying solely on new fraud prevention technology is not enough,"" Mr Dukes said. Katy Worobec, from UK Finance, which represents the banking industry, said: ""Tackling fraud and financial crime is a top priority for the industry. Banks have sophisticated controls in place to safeguard the financial system from fraudsters, and work closely with enforcement agencies and government to identify and disrupt criminal activity."" Anil Sharma found out the hard way that fraudsters had enough information about him to obtain new smartphones in his name. Not one but two mobile phone contracts taken out through a well-known high street retailer were posted to his Liverpool home. He says the chain was quite dismissive of his plight and he was forced to contact the mobile networks to resolve the situation. One was more helpful than the other, Mr Sharma says, but ultimately both accepted that the contracts were taken out fraudulently and cancelled them. As well as taking a good deal of phone bashing to resolve, the identity theft was also stressful - and affected his credit score as well. ""It's very very worrying."" But how did the fraudsters obtain his details? Initially Mr Sharma thought it was the result of losing his wallet a couple of years ago, but Action Fraud says an online breach is the more likely culprit.

US hits Chinese firms over North Korea,"North Korea insists it is entitled to have a nuclear and missile programme for self defence The US has imposed sanctions on a dozen Russian and Chinese companies and individuals it accuses of helping North Korea's nuclear weapons programme. It comes after the UN Security Council, including Russia and China, voted for further sanctions against Pyongyang. The US Treasury said its actions would ""increase pressure"" on North Korea, but the move has angered China. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, meanwhile, praised North Korea for ""a level of restraint"" in recent days. ""We have had no missile launches or provocative acts on the part of North Korea since theunanimous adoption of the UN Security Council resolution,"" he said. This, he said, could pave the way for talks between the two sides ""sometime in the near future"". The US Office of Foreign Assets Control designated 10 companies and six individuals in its sanctions. How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? What does North Korea really want? North Korea-US tension: Should you worry? ""[The] Treasury will continue to increase pressure on North Korea by targeting those who support the advancement of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes, and isolating them from the American financial system,"" said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The action means American individuals and companies are no longer permitted to do business with these firms. China responded swiftly, calling on the US to ""immediately correct its mistake"" of punishing its firms. North Korea objects to US-South Korea joint military training, which concludes at the end of August South Korea says the exercises, known as the Ulchi Freedom Guardian, are purely defensive A series of missile tests by North Korea in recent months - along with its repeated threats to carry out a sixth test of a nuclear device - have increased tensions between Pyongyang and the US. North Korea has been angered, as it is every year, by scheduled US-South Korea military drills, and threatened to launch missiles near the US island of Guam in the South Pacific. US President Donald Trump, meanwhile, threatened the isolated regime with ""fire and fury like the world has never seen"".

Vice-president Mike Pence is also pictured engulfed in flames. Guam: A conflicted island at the centre of a political firestorm North Korea threats unsettle Guam islanders Mr Tillerson's comments on Tuesday appeared to strike a more conciliatory tone.

""We hope that this is the beginning of this signal that we've been looking for - that they are ready to restrain their level of tensions, they're ready to restrain their provocative acts and that perhaps we are seeing our pathway to sometime in the near future having some dialogue."" However, speaking at UN-backed disarmament conference in Geneva on Tuesday, a North Korean diplomat insisted that the weapons programme was ""justifiable and a legitimate option for self-defence"". ""As long as the U.S. hostile policy and nuclear threat remains unchallenged, the DPRK will never place its self-defensive nuclear deterrence on the negotiating table or step back an inch from the path it took to bolster the national nuclear force,"" he said.

Princes speak out about Diana's death,"The Princes defend their father, Prince Charles, for his actions after Princess Diana died Interviews by Princes William and Harry for a BBC documentary on the death of Princess Diana - to be shown this weekend - make the lead for several of Wednesday's newspapers. ""He was there for us"", is the headline in theDaily Express,external, which has a picture of the Prince of Wales alongside his sons as they walked behind Princess Diana's coffin during her funeral procession. TheDaily Mail,externaland theDaily Mirror,externaluse similar headlines, with the former saying ""Moment daddy told us mummy was dead"".  The newspaper says the Princes speak with raw honesty about their emotions at the time. The government's paper setting out its position on what influence the European Court of Justice should have on the UK after Brexit is the lead for the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian. TheGuardian,externalsays the document appears to leave open the possibility that the court could retain an influence over the UK - and the government has been accused of a U-turn. TheDaily Telegraph,externalreports that Eurosceptic Tory MPs fear the government's approach raises concerns that Britain could be bound by the decisions of the court for years to come. ""Europe under threat"", is the headline in theTimes,external. It says the Libyan prime minister has warned that Europe will be increasingly at risk from terrorists posing as migrants unless western capitals help his country to stem the numbers crossing the Mediterranean. In an interview for the paper, he says Europe's response does not match the challenges Libya is facing over the flow of illegal migrants crossing its open southern borders. The i,externalhighlights US President Donald Trump's decision to send more troops to Afghanistan - and Britain's backing for the policy. The paper's correspondent, Kim Sengupta, writes that there can be no illusions about the cost of ignoring Afghanistan. He says US and UK forces left in 2014, declaring that Afghan troops were now fully capable of defending their country. But, he adds, the insurgents have since taken over swathes of the country, attacking Kabul seemingly at will. There are currently almost 600 British troops in Afghanistan For its main story,the Sun,externalreports that a British man has been detained in Turkey over a few coins he found while snorkelling on holiday. It says 52-year-old Tony Robyns, from West Sussex, was arrested at Bodrum airport last Friday as he and his family were preparing to return home. According to the newspaper, security staff found the coins in his hand luggage and deemed them historical treasures. It says the father of five is being held on suspicion of ""finding Turkish artefacts without notifying the authorities"". A friend of the family is quoted as saying Mr Robyns had not been aware of the coins' significance and had decided to take them home as a souvenir of his holiday. A number of papers report that there has been an 183% increase in planning applications for basement extensions in England, Scotland and Wales. The Guardian,externalsays that homeowners - unable to climb the housing ladder because of high prices - have decided to burrow down instead. A London-based property agent tells the newspaper that many people are doing whatever they can to improve their homes rather than move, with punching up into the attic or digging down to create more space now a viable alternative.

Forbes rich list exposes Hollywood pay gap,"Left-right: Mark Wahlberg, Emma Stone, Dwayne Johnson, Jennifer Aniston The size of the gender pay gap in the movie industry has been laid bare in new estimates of stars' pay packets. The world's 10 best-paid actors earned a total of $488.5m (Â£380.5m) in the past year,Forbes magazine calculated,external. That's almost three times more than their female counterparts, who took home $172.5m (Â£134m) between them. Transformers star Mark Wahlberg tops the male list with $68m (Â£53m) - compared with $26m (Â£20m) for the best-paid woman, La La Land's Emma Stone. Another 13 men earned more than Stone between June 2016 and June 2017, according to Forbes - including Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Jackie Chan and her La La Land co-star Ryan Gosling. Stonerecently saidsome of her male co-stars have taken pay cuts so she can ""have parity with them"".

Asda 'hangs head' over island bag gaffe,"The supermarket giant blamed a printing error for the gaffe The opening of Asda's first store on the Isle of Wight made an impression for all the wrong reasons after special bags produced to mark the occasion included the spelling ""Isle of White"". The retailer opened the doors to its Newport store on Monday and offered shoppers the chance to buy 10,000 bags designed by two island children. Bosses obviously did not check them properly as they included the mistake. Asda said it was ""hanging our heads"" and promised to get the bags reprinted.

China relaunches world's fastest train,"A high-speed train crash led to an investigation which found widespread corruption in the railway ministry China's fleet of high-speed trains is set once again to become the world's fastest. The top speed of the Fuxing or ""rejuvenation"" bullet trains was capped at 300km/h (186mph) in 2011 following two crashes that killed 40 people. From next week, some of the trains will once again be allowed to run at a higher speed of about 350 km/h. The higher maximum speed should cut about an hour off the journey time between Beijing and Shanghai. By 21 September, seven of China's bullet trains will be permitted to travel at the increased maximum speed. To mark the return of the higher-speed service, the trains have been named ""Fuxing"" - Chinese for rejuvenation - in line with a national government slogan and development plan. All the trains have been fitted with an improved monitoring system that will slow and stop the trains automatically in the event of an emergency. The nation's rail operator is believed to be looking into ways to upgrade track to let the engines run even faster - perhaps at speeds approaching 400km/h. China is believed to have about 19,960km (12,400 miles) of high-speed rail tracks. The 2011 crashes of the high-speed trains led to a state investigation into the railways ministry which uncovered widespread corruption. The probe meant many officials were charged with corruption and abuse of power. Two senior officials were given suspended death sentences.

Denmark torso 'deliberately mutilated',"Kim Wall (pictured) was researching a feature about submarines before she disappeared A headless and limbless corpse found in waters off Denmark was deliberately mutilated, say Copenhagen police. But they say it is still too early to say whether it is the remains of Swedish journalist Kim Wall. She was last seen alive on 10 August as she departed on a trip with submarine inventor Peter Madsen. He initially said he had dropped her off safely near Copenhagen, but has since said she died in an accident and that he had ""buried"" her at sea. The body has been sent for DNA analysis, but the results will not be available until Thursday morning. Divers continue to search the waters near where the torso was discovered, but, despite some reported sightings, other remains have not been found. Military divers are continuing the search for remains ""The current situation is that there is a torso in which arms, legs and head have been removed off as a result of deliberate cutting,"" said Jens Moller Jensen of the Copenhagen police. ""There is nothing about the length of the torso to indicate that it is not Kim Wall, but we do not yet know."" Kim Wall: What we know and what we don't Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Ms Wall, 30, was a freelance journalist who had graduated from the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism. She was based between New York and Beijing and had written for The Guardian and The New York Times. She was reported missing by her boyfriend after she failed to return from what should have been a short trip to research a feature about Mr Madsen and his submarine, the Nautilus. The submarine sank hours after the search for the journalist began, and Mr Madsen was charged with negligent manslaughter. Danish police believe the 40-tonne vessel was deliberately sunk by Mr Madsen, who was rescued before being arrested. The torso was found on Monday in shallows off the densely populated Danish island of Amager, on which the Danish capital of Copenhagen is partly situated. Mr Madsen denies any wrongdoing.

European court 'not necessary' says UK,"This video can not be played Why the fuss about the European Court of Justice? Theresa May has insisted the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in the UK will come to an end with Brexit. As the governmentpublished new details of its position,external, the PM said the UK would ""take back control of our laws"". But critics say it will be impossible to avoid European judges having a role in enforcing new agreements drawn up with the EU. Ministers say the two sides will keep ""half an eye"" on each other's rulings. Reality Check: What is the European Court of Justice? UK seeks 'close co-operation' on legal disputes The ECJ is in charge of ensuring member states abide by EU law. Its rulings are binding on all member states, and it also settles disputes between countries and EU institutions. In its new policy paper, the government: Does not rule out ECJ keeping its jurisdiction during the Brexit transition period that is planned after March 2019 Promises to work with the EU on the ""arrangements for judicial supervision"" during this period Makes clear that the rights of EU citizens living in the UK after Brexit will only be subject to British law - a sticking point in the negotiations with the EU Says giving the ECJ authority over UK-EU disputes would be unprecedented and not ""fair and neutral"" The promise to end ""direct jurisdiction"" in recent policy papers - a phrase not used by Mrs May - has raised questions about what ""indirect"" jurisdiction the EU court could be left with. In the latest publication, about how to enforce disputes after Brexit, the government has outlined several models used by other countries that it says show there is no need for the ECJ to be the final arbiter. But some of these involve the ECJ having an influence on the outcome of disputes, for example by interpreting EU law in a way that binds a disputes panel, or for its past rulings to be taken into account. Today's paper does not pin the government's colours to any particular mast. It throws out a number of possible models for how a trade agreement with the EU would work in terms of resolving disputes. All of the models make it clear that the ECJ will no longer have sole jurisdiction over disputes. The key question is how much influence the ECJ would retain under a bilateral agreement with the UK. The EU will not sign up to an agreement which allows to UK to depart from EU law to the UK's advantage and the EU's disadvantage on things like state aid to companies, or emissions standards. It will want a level playing field in trade and that will mean a lot of EU law as part of the agreement. The reality is that the more closely the Brexit trade agreement replicates EU law, the greater the influence of the ECJ will be. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government was ""clearly backtracking on its earlier red lines and saying there has to be some form of dispute resolution through some form of judicial process"". He added: ""We have said that all along."" Asked if Labour would vote against the government's key piece of Brexit legislation, the repeal bill, when MPs returned from their summer break, Mr Corbyn said: ""We will make that decision just before the vote."" The pro-EU Open Britain campaign group said the government's policy paper was a ""climbdown camouflaged in jingoistic rhetoric"". The group called it ""frustratingly vague"", adding that in almost every example it provides, the ECJ would have ""substantial direct or indirect power over the proposed new relationship between Britain and the EU"". The government said it was not committing to following any of the arrangements set out, ruling out an ""off the shelf"" model. And sources played down the significance of the word ""direct"", saying it meant ECJ rulings would no longer automatically apply to the UK and that the court would no longer be able to strike down domestic UK laws. This video can not be played John Redwood and Chuka Umunna clash over ECJ Asked about her government's position, Mrs May said: ""What we will be able to do is to make our own laws - Parliament will make our laws - it is British judges that will interpret those laws, and it will be the British Supreme Court that will be the ultimate arbiter of those laws."" Earlier Justice Minister Dominic Raab said there would be ""divergence"" between UK and EU case law after Brexit, adding: ""It is precisely because there will be that divergence as we take back control that it makes sense for the UK to keep half an eye on the case law of the EU, and for the EU to keep half an eye on the case law of the UK."" In response, Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's lead negotiator, tweeted that the ECJ had to ""keep both eyes open"" to protect citizens' rights. The ECJ's remit extends into many of the areas where the UK is hoping to draw up new arrangements with the EU, including trade and citizens' rights. Mr Raab said ""some form of arbitration"" would be needed, but that this would not be akin to a European court. Arbitration is where disputes are settled by a neutral third party. The UK and the EU could each appoint arbitrators and agree on a third, Mr Raab suggested. Decides whether the institutions of the EU are acting legally, and settles disputes between them Ensures that the member states of the EU are complying with their legal obligations as set out in the EU treaties; and allows member states to challenge EU legislation Interprets EU law at the request of national courts The SNP said the government had accepted the UK must continue to take account of judgements from the ECJ so it now needed to ""ditch their previous so-called red lines to ensure a deal can be found"". SNP External Affairs Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the best option for Scotland and the rest of the UK was to stay in the EU single market. Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable said Mrs May's ""red lines are becoming more blurred by the day"", saying the ECJ had ""served Britain's interests well"" and should not be ""trashed"". The European Commission, which is leading the negotiations for the EU, did not comment in response to the government's publication.

Bowls club refuses to lift ban on women,"Chesterfield Bowling Club used to have an annual day where women could play, according to records seen by a former member A bowling club said to be the world's oldest has been accused of being ""stuck in its ways"" after refusing to lift its ban on female members. Chesterfield Bowling Club in Derbyshire is believed to date back to 1294. But a former member said the club was losing money because of its ageing and dwindling membership, and warned it would close without female members. The club denied being ""chauvinistic"" or in financial difficulty, adding it has traditionally been male-only. The former club membercontacted the Derbyshire Times,externalafter leaving in frustration. He said the members were ""traditionalists"" rather than being ""sexist"". Updates on this story and more from the East Midlands Bowls is said to have been played on the same site, next to New Beetwell Street, since 1294 ""Some of the members are old school and they have been there for 20 or 30 or 40 years and don't want to change traditions,"" he said. ""Some were frightened to death that I wanted to introduce ladies. ""I'm 66 and I was one of the youngest. Most are in their 70s and 80s and there are even a couple of 90-year-olds."" In a statement the club said it was ""a small and ancient private members club which has traditionally been single gender"". ""The reported chauvinistic attitudes are denied,"" it added. Chesterfield Bowling Club, pictured here around 1910, said it ""has traditionally been single gender"" Chesterfield Bowling Club has since taken a vote on the matter and decided to stay as it is but said it could allow women to join in future. ""The possibility of admitting female members has been the subject of committee discussion after being raised by an active member of the club,"" it said. ""As a result the opinion of the present membership was recently canvassed. The subject is not closed and is set for review."" The former member has since joined a club that admits females. ""They are very good players,"" he said. ""They beat me every time, which I don't mind at all.""

Hospital refuses fancy dress donation,"The chief executive of Shropshire Community Health NHS Trust said the behaviour was ""insulting"" A hospital has turned down a Â£2,500 donation from a group of men dressed up as nurses after bosses said the outfits were ""demeaning"". The group, which was supporting Ludlow Hospital in Shropshire, raised the money by pushing a bed around the town. Jan Ditheridge, chief executive of Shropshire Community Health NHS Trust, said the behaviour was ""insulting"". The hospital's friends group said it was a ""sad day for public support for our health services"". See more stories from across Shropshire here A letter to Peter Corfield, chair of Ludlow Hospital League of Friends, from Ms Ditheridge and chair of the trust Mike Ridley, said: ""The presentation of men dressed as female nurses in a highly-sexualised and demeaning way is wrong, very outdated and insulting to the profession."" This video can not be played Ludlow fancy dress nurses 'never set out to cause offence' Mr Corfield said the bed-push fundraiser had taken place every summer for decades involving men from the local community and was ""light-hearted"". He said proceeds from this year's event had been earmarked to provide ECG machines for the outpatients and minor injuries departments at Ludlow. ""We have therefore now had to withdraw the funding for those items,"" he added. Alison Hiles, whose husband took part in the event, said: ""Nobody's complained, everybody seems to enter into the spirit of it, locals know that it's going on, those that aren't local really enjoy the event and always have a chat with the lads and willingly give money, nobody forces them. ""I really don't know why all of a sudden that it's a problem."" The money had been earmarked to provide ECG machines for the outpatients and minor injuries departments Ms Ditheridge said: ""We have previously asked that this doesn't happen and therefore don't think it's right to accept any money associated with this activity."" Many people, including nurses, havetaken to social media,externalto voice their support for the fundraisers. Tracy Morgan Jones wrote on Facebook: ""It's money raised in a fun way in a costume meant to draw attention to the worthy cause not insult the hard-working doctors and nurses."" Gemma Davies said: ""I'm a nurse and am not at all insulted. How stupid!"", while Hannah Holt added: ""Refusing the money is an insult to the profession. I love being a nurse and I love people dressing up as nurses.... it's a sign of admiration."" Others suggested the money would be welcome elsewhere, including Ann Lanham who said: ""I'm sure there are plenty of other good causes in the area who will be willing to accept the money.""

Man dead at hedonist festival site,"Flamefest describes itself as bringing ""kink to the foreground of festival culture"" A man has been found dead at a campsite that hosted a hedonist festival over the weekend. Emergency services were called to the campsite in Powder Mill Lane, Tunbridge Wells, at 06:14 BST. The man was pronounced dead at the scene and an unconscious woman was airlifted to hospital. Kent Police is treating the death as unexplained. Flamefest, which boasts a ""discreet"" adult play area and outdoor dungeon, was at the site on Saturday and Sunday. Get more Kent news here The two-day festival was in a field in Powder Mill Lane, Tunbridge Wells Described on its website as a ""festival for kinky, quirky, creative hedonists"", it showcases musicians and DJs as well as circus-style performers with sword-swallowing and fire. Its adult ""play area"" allows festival-goers to ""explore kinks"" and ""play within the boundaries of our common-sense rules"" with dominatrices and monitors. Organiser Helen Smedley created the festival but declined to comment on the unexplained death. Tunbridge Wells council said the event was authorised by a temporary event notice and it has ""no discretion to select the type of events held providing they meet the requirements of the relevant legislation"".

What do the critics make of C4's GBBO?,"Viewers still have a week to wait before The Great British Bake Off returns to our screens, on a different channel with a 75% new line-up of judges and presenters. But the critics have had a chance to see Channel 4's eagerly anticipated cake-over and have already given their verdicts. We thought of serving up their reviews in full but decided instead to give you a slice of each - just to give you a taste. We'll let them make the puns from now on, so knead on at your own whisk (sorry). 33 things to know about the new Bake Off According toThe Guardian,external's Mark Lawson, both Channel 4 and programme maker Love Productions are ""having their cake and eating it"". ""The eighth series of the extreme patisserie challenge manages to seem exactly the same but also just different enough,"" he writes. Mel and Sue's replacements, comedian Noel Fielding and broadcaster Sandi Toksvig, ""set their own distinctive flavour in the kitchen,"" Lawson goes on. ""To me the first episode for Channel 4 is as strong - in terms of both bakers and the cakes they attempt - as any previously made."" Writing in theDaily Mail,external, reviewer Sarah Rainey says that the show ""hasn't changed a bit"" in its move from the BBC to Channel 4. ""Sure, the people - with the exception of steely-eyed Paul Hollywood - are different,"" she writes. ""But if you squint a little, they could be the same old familiar faces, making the same innuendo-laden jokes."" While expressing admiration for Fielding's ""ridiculous bird-print shirt"", though, Rainey suggests his ""dippy comedy act"" may ""quickly start to grate"". According toThe Telegraph,external's Michael Hogan, the first instalment of the Channel 4 series gives viewers ""the same flavoursome confection"" - with ""extra spice"". ""There was tension, there were tears and one nervous hopeful forgot to turn her oven on,"" he goes on. ""Mary, Mel and Sue might be gone, but the show's recipe remains as winning as ever."" ""The moment that Mary, Mel and Sue requested their P45s, we knew that Bake Off would never be what it was,"" writes Frances Taylor of theRadio Times,external. According to her online review, however, Channel 4 ""have done the best they can with the ingredients they were given"". ""We'll always mourn the BBC era of the baking behemoth, but this is what we've got now,"" Taylor concludes. ""It's a bit rough around the edges, a little burnt on the outside. But it's still our Bake Off."" The Great British Bake Off begins on Channel 4 at 20:00 BST on 29 August.

Green man road crossings 'too fast',"The green man walking sign on pedestrian crossings may be too fast for elderly people to cross the road safely, suggestnew draft guidelines,externalfor local councils. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence wants to make it easier for people with limited mobility to get out and about. Most crossings allow between four and seven seconds before the green man starts flashing. But many people are slower than this. The average walking speed for older men has been estimated,externalat 3ft (0.9m) per second, and 2.6ft per second for older women. The speed for crossings recommended by the Department for Transport is around 4ft (1.2m) per second, but local councils can adjust the timing to suit their residents' needs. The draft NICE guidelines also recommend that councils move bins, hanging baskets and any other obstacles that might get in the way of disabled pedestrians and others who may struggle to get around, such as parents with prams. Prof Mark Baker, director of the centre for guidelines at NICE, said: ""It should not matter whether you are on foot, in a wheelchair, have a visual impairment or if you're a parent pushing a pram. ""If streets, parks and other open spaces are well planned, everyone should be able to get around their local area easily. ""Safe, accessible streets and well-maintained parks can help people to get active and live longer, healthier lives."" Dr Justin Varney from Public Health England said: ""Physical activity benefits everyone at all stages of life. ""People living with impairments are less active, and this can be due to the way the built environment, including public spaces and transport systems, is designed. ""Making physical activity accessible to everyone when planning spaces benefits communities in terms of health, environmental sustainability and economic regeneration."" The NICE recommendations are out for consultation until October.

Lidl trumps Waitrose in grocery league,"Lidl has beaten Waitrose to become the UK's seventh largest supermarket chain, according to latest grocery market share figures. The German discount food retailer has increased its market share to 5.2%, up by 0.7% year-on-year,Kantar Worldpanel,externalreports. Families are driving its sales as they tend to buy more items in one supermarket visit, Kantar said. With 5.1% market share, Waitrose has been pushed into eighth place. ""Ten million households visited [Lidl's] expanding network of stores during the past 12 weeks, with alcohol and fresh produce performing particularly well as the retailer increased sales by 18.9% overall,"" said Fraser McKevitt, head of retailer and consumer insight at Kantar Worldpanel. ""Lidl is growing sales 40% faster with families than with households without children."" The biggest supermarket chains in the UK, by market share are: Tesco(27.8%) Sainsbury's(15.8%) Asda(15.3%) Morrisons(10.4%) Aldi(7%) Co-op(6.3%) Lidl(5.2%) Waitrose(5.1%) Iceland(2.1%) Ocado(1.4%) Since the financial crisis in 2008, the four biggest grocers Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons have faced increasing pressure from luxury supermarket brands like Waitrose, as well as German discount chains like Aldi and Lidl. Grocery market share figures from March 2017 onwards show that UK supermarkets are now experiencing theirbest sales growthin five years. ""All four of Britain's biggest grocers managed to grow sales for the fifth consecutive period, a run of collective success not seen since 2013,"" said Mr McKevitt. ""However, this welcome period of sustained growth hasn't been enough to entirely offset pressure from the discounters: the big four now account for just 69.3% of the UK grocery market - down from 76.3% five years ago - and that looks set to fall further in the coming months.""

Barcelona suspect admits 'bigger plot',"This video can not be played The four suspects were transferred to a Madrid jail on Monday night The cell behind the Barcelona van attack had planned to use explosives against monuments including the city's famous Sagrada Familia church, a suspect has told a Madrid court. Mohamed Houli Chemlal is one of four surviving suspects who gave evidence. He and Driss Oukabir have both been charged with membership of a terrorist organisation and murder. Salah al-Karib has been detained pending further investigations, while Mohammed Aallaa was released on bail. According to Houli Chemlal, the group's plans - which he had known of ""for at least two months - were scaled back when a house packed with bomb-making equipment blew up the day before. He was injured in the accidental blast that reduced the house to rubble in the town of Alcanar. The Alcanar explosion came the day before Thursday's Barcelona attack in which a van was driven at speed down the main Las Ramblas boulevard, killing 13 and injuring more than 100. Judicial sources quoted Houli Chemlal as telling the court a much bigger series of attacks had been planned. Assailants killed a total of 15 people in the van attack, the stabbing of a driver whose car was commandeered shortly afterwards, and a car attack in the resort of Cambrils hours later. Eight members of the cell are dead - two were killed in the Alcanar explosion, and six were later shot by police, including five after the Cambrils attack. The four suspects in court were (L-R) Mohammed Aallaa, Mohamed Houli Chemlal, Sahal al-Karib and Driss Oukabir The last suspect to be killed was Moroccan-born Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, believed to be the driver of the Las Ramblas van. Wearing a fake explosives belt and armed with knives, he was shot dead by police in a vineyard west of Barcelona on Monday. The surviving suspects were moved, under high security, from Barcelona to Madrid for Tuesday's hearing. The court session, a preliminary hearing to gather evidence for a future trial, took place behind closed doors. Who are the suspects? Barcelona and Cambrils attacks: What we know so far Hugs and defiance on Las Ramblas Houli Chemlal was the first to testify, wearing hospital pyjamas. He is still being treated for his injuries from the blast in Alcanar. Oukabir, whose brother Moussa was among suspects killed after the Cambrils attack, has also given evidence to the Madrid court. According to judicial sources, he has changed his story to say that he admits renting the van used in the Las Ramblas attack but thought it was to be used for a house-move. Under earlier police interrogation, he is said to have maintained that his brother Moussa hired the van using documents stolen from him. Both have been held in jail. Gaudi's famous church was allegedly viewed as a target by the suspects Two other suspects were killed in the Alcanar explosion, including Abdelbaki Es Satty, the Moroccan imam from the town of Ripoll thought to have been a radicalising influence on the suspects. The two other suspects appearing in court were: Aallaa, 27, alleged owner of the Audi car used in the Cambrils attack. He has been released on bail, but must attend court every Monday. Salah al-Karib, 34, accused of running an internet cafe in Ripoll used to send money to Morocco. He has been held for a further 72 hours. All four suspects giving evidence are reported to have testified that Es Satty was the ringleader of the group. This video can not be played Spanish police release footage of raids on three homes in the town of Ripoll One victim of the attacks last week, Ana Maria SuÃ¡rez, was buried in Zaragoza as the suspects went to court Meanwhile, in the Italian capital relatives mourned as the bodies of Luca Russo and Bruno Gulotta were flown home As Tuesday's Madrid hearing took place, Ana SuÃ¡rez, a Spanish woman in her 60s killed in Cambrils, was buried in a private ceremony in Zaragoza. Forty-five companies in a Catalonia association of undertakers and funeral companies have offered to perform funerals for the victims without charge. Most of the 12 suspects lived in Ripoll, north of Barcelona close to the French border. All were young men of North African descent. Police have been conducting new raids -  at an internet cafÃ© in Ripoll and at an apartment in Vilafranca, south-west of Barcelona.

Remains found in hunt for missing sailors,"The collision was reported at 05:24 local time on Monday east of the Strait of Singapore Human remains have been found in the hunt for 10 US sailors missing after their destroyer collided with a tanker near Singapore, the navy says. The discovery came when divers were sent down to search inside the USS John S McCain, now berthed at Singapore's Changi naval base. The collision with a Liberian-flagged ship happened before dawn on Monday as the US vessel made a routine port call. The US has since ordered a worldwide ""operational pause"" of its navy fleet. It was the fourth crash involving a US Navy ship in a year, and the second in the past two months. The collision ripped open the port side of the US vessel, flooding parts of the ship including crew compartments. Admiral Scott Swift, commander of the US Pacific Fleet, said divers ""were able to locate some remains in those sealed compartments during their search today"". The navy was also examining whether a body found by the Malaysian navy was one of the missing sailors, he said. Ships, equipment and aircraft from the American, Indonesian, Malaysian and Singapore navies have been involved in the search for the missing sailors. The USS John S McCain was east of Singapore when the collision occurred. It was reported before dawn at 05:24 local time on Monday (21:24 GMT on Sunday). The destroyer sustained damage to her port side, which is the left-hand side of the vessel facing forward. Five sailors were injured, four of whom were medically evacuated to a Singapore hospital. The tanker it collided with, Alnic MC, sustained damage to a tank near the front of the ship 7m (23ft) above the waterline, but none of its crew were injured and there were no oil spills. The Alnic MC, carrying oil from Taiwan to Singapore, is currently at the Raffles Reserved Anchorage in Singapore. The cause of the collision is not yet known, but Navy Admiral John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, has ordered fleet commanders to stop what they are doing for a day or two over the next week to ""assess and review with their commands the fundamental practice to safe and effective operations"". This video can not be played The timing of this incident is awkward for the United States He has also ordered a more comprehensive review ""to find the contributing factors and root causes of the incidents"". ""My hope is that we will learn, continue to improve in the short term, validating that we are sound on the fundamentals and if not then we'll take action to correct that, and then look at broader, more systemic issues that we may find through this comprehensive review,"" he saidin a statement.,external He also said on Twitter that he would not rule out the possibility of some kind of outside interference or cyber-attack being behind the collision.

This is the fourth time in a year that a US navy vessel has been involved in an accident. Just two months ago, seven US sailors were killed when the USS Fitzgerald collided with a container ship in Japanese waters near the port city of Yokosuka. In pictures: USS Fitzgerald crash Those who died were found in flooded berths on board the ship after the collision caused a gash under the warship's waterline.

First July budget surplus for 15 years,"The government recorded a budget surplus last month for the first time since 2002 as more money came in from self-employed tax receipts. July saw a surplus of Â£0.2bn, compared with last year's deficit of Â£0.3bn. For the four months so far this year, though, public sector net borrowing - which leaves out support for public sector banks - was Â£1.9bn higher than last year's at Â£22.8bn. The figures come from the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS). July is the second most important month, apart from January, for tax revenue paid for by those completing self-assessment forms, such as the self-employed, In both months, accrued receipts are higher because of receipts from self-assessed income tax. This month, those receipts were the highest since records began in 1999. July's receipts increased by Â£0.8bn, to Â£8bn, compared with July 2016. A Treasury spokesperson said: 'We are making good progress in strengthening our public finances and living within our means. ""Our national debt, at Â£65,000 for every UK household, is still too high. That is why we have a clear fiscal plan to reduce our debts and build a stronger economy for every household."" But Ruth Gregory, economist at Capital Economics, said the figures were probably just a blip, as the deadline fell on a different day of the week from last year. ""Self-assessment receipts were boosted by the 31 July deadline falling on a Monday this year, but Sunday in 2016, meaning that some receipts were recorded in August last year,"" she said. She pointed out that so far, borrowing was still some 9% higher than the Â£20.9bn seen last year, with the OBR expecting this to worsen further. ""As such, despite July's strength, the chancellor may still find that he has little scope for any easing back on the planned fiscal squeeze in his November Budget."" The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has forecast that public sector net borrowing will be Â£58.3bn during the financial year ending March 2018. The ONS data showed that total government debt, excluding public sector banks, stood at Â£1.758 trillion at the end of July, which is equivalent to 87.5% of gross domestic product (GDP).

Watchdog to prosecute BHS ex-owner,"The Pensions Regulator is to prosecute Dominic Chappell, the former boss of retail chain BHS. He is charged with failing to provide information and documents the regulator requested during its investigation into the sale of BHS. Chappell's Retail Acquisitions (RAL) bought BHS for just Â£1 in 2015 from billionaire retailer Sir Philip Green. The collapse of BHS led to the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. RAL was put into liquidation earlier this year. Mr Chappell has been summonsed to appear at Brighton Magistrates' Court on 20 September to face three charges of neglecting or refusing to provide information and documents, without a reasonable excuse. Warning notices were sent out to Sir Philip and Mr Chappell in November last year, setting out the arguments and evidence as to why the regulator believed they should support the BHS pension schemes. In February, Sir Philip Green agreed in a settlement with the Pensions Regulator to hand over Â£363m in cash to the BHS pension scheme. The investigation into Dominic Chappell is continuing. Dave Gill, national officer for shop workers' union Usdaw, said: ""It is frankly quite shocking that Mr Chappell has apparently not made the requested information available. We would expect all involved in the BHS scandal to co-operate fully with all investigations. ""Whilst the Pension Regulator has been successful in striking a deal with Sir Philip Green, the fact remains that the full buyout cost to secure 100% of members' benefits has not been met. ""There is still a lot of uncertainty for members and hopefully this will be addressed over the coming months when they receive more information about their options."" Frank Field, who chairs the Parliamentary Work and Pensions Committee, said: ""If the Pensions Regulator is frightened of landing the whale, I suppose going after the sprat is the next best thing. ""Why was Sir Philip Green allowed to get away with an inadequate settlement, in which pensions have been cut, yet Dominic Chappell is going to be sued? ""I'll be consulting the House of Commons' lawyers on when I can begin to unlock that puzzle, so that Mr Chappell has a fair trial."" Meanwhile, the Insolvency Service, the government department that investigates bankrupt companies, is also investigating Mr Chappell. It has the power to ban anyone from being a company director in the UK. In a statement, it said: ""The Insolvency Service is aware of the Pension Regulator's action against Mr Chappell. Our investigation into BHS is ongoing and we will continue to work closely with other interested regulators.""

Barcelona suspect: 'Bigger attack planned',"This video can not be played The four suspects were transferred to a Madrid jail on Monday night The cell behind the Barcelona van attack had planned to use explosives against monuments including the city's famous Sagrada Familia church, a suspect has told a Madrid court.

33 things to know about the new Bake Off,"After a year of channel hopping, line-up changes and way more drama than should ever be caused by some fairy cakes, we are so ready for the new series of The Great British Bake Off. And by the sounds of it, so are the contestants. ""I just want to get on with it now, and burn my first cake,"" one says in the opening episode. So, we've been to a press screening of the series opener and spoken to Paul Hollywood, Prue Leith, Sandi Toksvig, Noel Fielding and Channel 4's chief creative officer Jay Hunt. Here's what you can expect from the new series. 1. Channel 4 have avoided any icing controversy. Remember when the BBC gave the male contestants blue icing and the female contestants pink icinglast year,externalin the promo shots? Yeah, Channel 4 have cleverly avoided that by using some rainbow cake. Flo (far left) is the oldest-ever contestant at 71 2. It's weird having new presenters to start with. ""Visually, it's scary that Mel has been replaced by a vampire,"" joked Noel after the press screening. But you get used to it pretty quickly to be fair. Some of the opening jokes feel a little forced and awkward - but then so were some of Mel and Sue's, and it becomes more natural as the episode goes on. 3. Prue has some advice for those who hate the thought of adverts during Bake Off. ""You don't have to watch it in real time,"" she says, championing the joy of services which let you skip the ads. Jay Hunt (jokingly) put her head in her hands at this point. 4. There are 12 contestants. And their names are Liam, Stacey, Yan, Steven, Tom, Flo, Kate, Julia, James, Chris, Sophie and Peter. Please don't ask us who's who in the below photo because we haven't learned them off by heart yet. 5. They're definitely not dialling down the innuendo. ""I don't know what it is but I want to dip my finger in it,"" is just one of several glorious lines in the first episode. 6. The ad breaks are well placed. There's one between the first challenge and the judging of it. One after the judging of the technical. And another between the showstopper and the judging. Hunt said she makes ""no apology"" for the ad breaks because they pay for the show, adding: ""We've been careful about thinking where the ad breaks sit and how the format works with it, so it's quite seamless."" 7. Prue is planning to steal from the contestants. ""After 25 years of not writing cookery books because I was writing novels, I thought right, now I'm on Bake Off I'll do a cookery book,"" Prue said. ""And you know what I'm doing is just keeping notes of what the bakers are doing. There are some off-the-wall contributions which work brilliantly, so I'm quietly cribbing them."" Don't worry, she was kidding (we think). 8. Noel and Sandi are an unlikely double act. ""There's a lot of repressed sexual tension,"" Sandi joked at the screening. 9. But it seemed to win over the audience. ""When we did our chemistry test we made love straight away,"" said Noel. He's talking about the screen tests presenters do to make sure they work well together on camera. ""Sandi is the quickest comedian I've ever worked with,"" he added. 10. Prue hates to watch herself on TV. ""I'm so vain, I can't bear it,"" she said. ""I'm thinking, why is that cameraman going round the back of my head or filming close up and getting my double chin?"" 11. Sandi also can't stand watching herself back. At this rate the viewing figures are going to be pretty low. 12. There are some brilliantly dreadful jokes in the first episode. At one point, Sandi gives Noel a bowl, at which point he falls on the ground. ""He's bowled over,"" says Sandi. Amazing. 13. Paul has a new nickname. ""We're all newbies here, except for ol' blue-eyes,"" Noel says (speaking about Paul, obvs) as he tries to put everyone at ease during the opening challenge. 14. Jay Hunt is hopeful about the viewing figures. ""We're expecting a strong performance,"" she said. Noel was a little more specific. 15. ""I think it will get between five viewers and 17 million viewers,"" he said. So actually, not that much more specific. 16. Paul ""won't be looking at Twitter"" when the show goes out. So don't @ him. 17. The standard is ridiculously high this year. Seriously, look out for the watermelon cake. 18. So high, in fact, that there are TWO Hollywood handshakes in the first episode. Blimey. 19. But it's also not short on disasters. One contestant forgets to actually turn the oven on. Another literally bins all the sponge she's baked so far and starts over. 20. Noel and Sandi are taking hosting duties to new heights. The pair are seen in a hot air balloon during the show's opening shots. 21. Prue Leith will be firm but fair as a judge, because she wants the bakers to be their very best. ""I'll be firm but fair as a judge, because I want the bakers to be their very best,"" Prue Leith said. Probably didn't need an explainer on this one. 22. Also, Prue doesn't like too many accessories. One contestant puts actual flowers on the side of their cake to make it look prettier. ""I always have a problem with things you're not going to eat, and nobody is going to eat a marigold,"" Prue says. At this point, Noel brilliantly proves her wrong, stuffing it in his mouth. 23. Noel was ""staggered"" to be asked to present the show. Adding that it was ""too big an opportunity"" to turn down. 24. He even got some advice about it from his friend Serge from Kasabian. Who Sandi has never heard of. 25. Jay Hunt says the format is fundamentally the same. But adds the show has a ""more surreal, comedic take"" and a ""uniquely Channel 4 tone"". 26. GBBO is LGBT friendly. ""This is like my wedding day all over again, except my wife isn't here,"" says one female contestant right at the top of the show. A woman being gay is obviously not a thing in 2017, and we've had LGBT contestants before, but it's telling that Channel 4 gave this line such a prominent placing at the beginning of the episode. 27. It doesn't take itself too seriously. ""No-one's going to die,"" one contestant correctly observes. 28. Noel is sweetly supportive to the contestants. ""Everything is redeemable, you can do this,"" he tells one, in a nice Mel-and-Sue kind of way. 29. One dish is described as ""the Peter Beardsley of cakes"". ie Displaying skill, but not much to look at. 30. They've messed with one crucial Mel and Sue catchphrase. Perkins and Giedroyc used to alternate the ""On your marks"" / ""Get set"" / ""Bake"" bit. But for their first time uttering the famous phrase, Noel and Sandi say it TOGETHER. Hugely controversial. But stay calm everyone, they then revert to alternating for the rest of the episode. The new series of The Great British Bake-Off starts next week 31. The showstoppers really are showstopping. In the first episode there are cakes shaped as everything from a Russian doll to a champagne bottle and ice bucket. And they all look incredible. If Instagram was a TV show, it would be this episode. 32. One contestant makes an extremely shrewd observation. ""I've never made aminichocolate roll. Why would I?"" Well said. Why would you make a mini version of ANYTHING so delicious indeed. 33. There is one moment that will definitely make you giggle. But if you really think the top of that champagne bottle cake is phallic-shaped then it says more about your filthy state of mind, you disgusting individual.

Eclipse 2017: Chasing the moon's shadow,"The view from over the Pacific ""It's a complex math problem,"" said the pilot over coffee and doughnuts at 5am, in what sounded a lot like an understatement. We would be travelling at 520mph, he explained, while the moon's shadow would be moving at nearly eight times that speed. In essence, went on Captain Brian Holm, we were going to try to sideswipe a car travelling at 4,000mph. To do so we would need to fly a total of 2,300 miles from Portland, Oregon, on the US west coast out over the Pacific Ocean and back. Americans gaze at sky spectacular When is the next eclipse in my country? Why are eclipses so rare? That was the plan as we set off early on Monday morning, not long after the sun's rays had crept over the horizon for a sunrise which drew rather more attention than usual. There were two reasons for a lengthy trip over sea to hit the tiny eclipse bullseye rather than a short one over land. First, this would be the lowest point in the sky of the eclipse, giving us the best chance for a decent view from the aircraft windows before the sun rose too high. Secondly, it would mean we didn't have to worry about the traffic. Those on the flight included competition winners and experts In 1979, when a total eclipse touched the states of Oregon and Washington, hundreds of aircraft took to the skies, causing chaos for air traffic controllers. Many hopeful eclipse watchers were disappointed. Alaska Airlines could not afford for that to happen and this time they had experience on their side. Two years ago Joe Rao, a TV meteorologist, space columnist and umbraphile (literally a shadow lover, or eclipse enthusiast), emailed the airline asking them to delay flight 870 from Anchorage to Honolulu by half an hour on 8 March 2016 so it would intercept a total eclipse 700 miles north of Hawaii. The idea was bounced around for months among sceptical executives before Mr Rao and his friends finally convinced the right person, Captain Holm, the Boeing 737 fleet captain for Alaska. For once, the passengers were delighted about the delay. This time, flight 9671 - or Solar One as it was dubbed by the cabin crew - was by invitation only; the passengers were a mixture of media, competition winners and scientists, as well as senior staff from the airline and their guests. The plane took off early to avoid traffic in the skies The first couple of hours of the flight passed uneventfully but as the moment of totality ticked closer the tension rose. We were on track to hit the sweet spot, said the pilots, give or take two seconds. At first the light seemed to dim almost imperceptibly but soon it was undeniable: day was turning to night. When the total eclipse was nearly upon us time seemed to speed up. Meet the man addicted to eclipses Tips on viewing eclipses Cameras clicked frantically; solar glasses were pulled on and off and then on again; faces of strangers were suddenly cheek to cheek, pressed against any window with a view. And suddenly we were there. ""Totality! Totality!"" came the excited announcement on the intercom and through the thick plastic windows on the right hand side of the aircraft the moon looked as if it were a tiny spherical pebble which had been hurled, with beautiful accuracy, straight into the gaping, glaring mouth of our star. ""It's incredible. It's almost indescribable,"" said Hannah Winit, struggling to put into words the glory and wonder that was unfolding in front of her. The plane filled with cheers when the eclipse finally happened ""It's really vibrant,"" she added, ""like a sun but not a sun, almost like a flower."" Ms Winit and her husband Matt, who both work for Alaska Airlines, said they had won a ticket on the flight in an internal company competition. And now, suddenly, there was so much to look at and so little time. From 40,000 feet we could see the enormous curving shadow of our only satellite blotting out the dappled white clouds which blanketed the ocean. There were gasps and cheers as a flash burst from the side of the moon. ""Diamond ring!"" came the shout. Reuben Dragushan, 10, said it was ""awesome"" to be one of the first people in the world to witness the spectacle. ""It was amazing. It looked like a dark disc and then light coming out of all the sides. It was really cool."" This video can not be played Watch the eclipse in 60 seconds For 103 seconds it was an eerie and ethereal sight which for some passengers, including Reuben's mum Evgenya Shkolnik, a professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University, was accompanied by a wave of emotion. ""Beautiful and poetic,"" was her description. ""Way more beautiful than any photo I've ever seen. It was brighter. It was richer and the colours were even more exciting."" ""It was just too short. Oh my goodness, I need another few minutes!"" Maria Rao, from Westchester, New York, on board with her father Joe, the meteorologist, agreed. ""It's breathtaking, it's truly breathtaking and it goes by so fast,"" she said. ""We had a minute and 34 seconds of totality and I swear to God it was only ten seconds!

Electric cars and cups of tea: Can we have both?,"Electric vehicles are now a reality, but boiling a kettle at the same time as charging your car may not be, according to insights published bythe National Grid,external. In July, the government announced that all sales of new petrol and diesel cars in the UK will cease by 2040. Volvo, meanwhile, has said every vehicle it launches from 2019will have an electric motor. The National Grid predicts that by 2050, there could be up to 26 million electric vehicles (EVs) on the road in the UK. They'll all need charging regularly if we're to stay on the move, so how might our homes, roads and forecourts adapt to this exhaust-free future? The short answer from the National Grid is yes. How you access that electricity is what requires some thinking. A top-of-the-range electric car will have a battery capacity of 90kWh. Using an average sized charger (3.5kW) it would take around 19 hours to go from 25% to fully charged. That's a long time to wait to nip to the shops, but charging time can be cut dramatically by using a larger charger - ideally, you'd plug in something hefty with up to 50kW to reduce the time to about 80 minutes. However, chargers that big aren't suitable for an average home - a more likely option would be a charger of about 11kW, (although many EV owners today also use 7kW chargers). Ford announces Â£2,000 scrappage scheme for pre-2010 cars New diesel and petrol vehicles to be banned from 2040 in UK Petrol and diesel ban: How will it work? A typical home is fitted with a main fuse of 60-80 amps, and the National Grid points out that an 11kW car charger would require 48 amps. According to the National Grid, that means using a kettle, oven or immersion heater during charging would cause the main fuse to trip. So no cuppa while you wait? Well, one solution could be to increase the amperage of your main fuse. Only the distribution network operators can do this - as opposed to an electrician or your supplier - and the cost can vary depending on the age of a property. With a 100 amp fuse, a 22kW charger could be used which would have a faster charge time of around three hours. This would, however, still require all other electrical appliances in the house to be turned off during charging. The National Grid predicts that by 2050, if there are 20 million electric cars on the road, about 8.5 million of them will not have the facilities to charge at home. And for the aforementioned reasons - primarily the need for a cuppa or a hot bath - home charging won't always be the preferred option. There are currently more than 4,700 locations with charging points around the UK, according to websiteZap-Map.com,external. New locations are being added daily - with an increase of 480 in the past 30 days alone. This trend looks set to continue, with petrol stations and motorway services due to be made to install charge points, under the government'sAutomated and Electric Vehicles Bill. Electric charging companyUbitricity has begun installing charge points in adapted lamp posts,externalin parts of London. The posts are fitted with with a charging point which uses the electricity source for the lamp. This provides on-street parking for electric car users - and uses an established electricity network. Ubitricity argues it reduces the cost of installing an electric charging point by 90%. The company charges 13p per killowatt hour. Suppliers such as Ecotricity - who currently have 300 ""pumps"" in the UK - also offer faster charging points. And car manufacturers themselves areworking togetherto create charging networks. Smart charging, which intelligently controls when vehicles draw electricity from the grid to avoid peaks and troughs, is one way of managing consumption. This will be vital, according to think tank Green Alliance, who are warning of potentiallocalised ""brown-outs"",external- a drop in voltage of supply - in wealthier areas where initial electric vehicle take-up will be higher. It cites an example of ""responsive charging"" in California, where internet connected chargers respond to signals by reducing or cutting off car charging if the grid is unstable. Petrol forecourts could be transformed into super charging stations The National Grid has set out how it thinks the UK's infrastructure could be reconfigured to cope with a world in which almost all cars will be electric. We could see: Super chargers:A 350kW charger would take less than five minutes to charge the average electric car of today, mimicking the fuelling time consumers are used to on conventional forecourts. Current batteries, however, cannot support this level of charging. Strategically-placed charging points:While the focus is likely to remain on reducing charging times, the National Grid concedes that lengthy charges will only be acceptable if there are other activities, like shopping, which drivers could do while they wait. High powered forecourts:In order to support vehicles that can travel long distances, ""a few thousand"" super charging stations of more than 3MW each could be required. That's equivalent to 1,000 homes' energy supply, per station, according to industry regulator Ofgem.

Trump rhetoric runs into Afghan reality,"Donald Trump did not say how many additional troops he would send to Afghanistan After some 16 years, the battle for Afghanistan - America's longest running war - is going to get a whole lot longer. This was the essential message from President Donald Trump's address. His stress on abandoning timetables and moving to a ""conditions-based approach"" as he called it, means that US troops will be in Afghanistan for a considerable time to come. The decision on a new Afghan strategy was much delayed, but after much prevarication he has essentially followed the line of his senior military advisers. He refused to give any numbers as to additional troops and so on, but the plan backed by his generals is thought to involve the despatch of some 3,800 additional military trainers and advisers to the country - so it is likely that this is part of what will happen. US air support  - crucial in helping Afghan government forces to withstand Taliban pressure on the battlefield - may also be stepped up, but here too President Trump was playing his cards close to his chest. Taliban letter to Trump urges withdrawal Trump vows to 'fight to win' in Afghanistan How Trump might break Afghan stalemate In rejecting some of the less conventional policy options like a total US withdrawal from Afghanistan, or the turning over of the mission lock, stock and barrel to a private contractor, President Trump has effectively taken ownership of America's longest running war. Mr Trump admitted that his instinct was to withdraw US forces from Afghanistan altogether. But having grappled with the self-same problems as his predecessor Barack Obama he has come up with a broadly similar answer - more training and assistance for the Afghan forces to help them resist Taliban advances. More than 2,300 US soldiers have died in Afghanistan since 2001 Of course Mr Trump inevitably tried to present this policy as a new departure. A conditions-based strategy means the US is involved for the long haul. Things are not going well for government forces. The Taliban hold almost half of the country and the Afghan military's performance - other than its elite special forces - is patchy at best. So there is a lot to do just to stabilise the situation before even thinking about the Afghan government forces going back onto the offensive. It was all wrapped up in typical Trump rhetoric - the talk of ""victory"", the insistence that the war in Afghanistan was not about nation-building but about ""killing terrorists"" as he put it. This was no doubt an effort to reassure his political base who are as sceptical about foreign military adventures as Mr Trump has always been. Mr Trump proposed an integrated approach - military, political and diplomatic. He had tough words for Pakistan who he said ""had much to lose by continuing to harbour terrorists. That will change and change immediately,"" he asserted. But just how much pressure is he able to exert on Islamabad? Some US security assistance funds have already been suspended. But Pakistan - half-ally, half-problem for Washington - is also the prime intermediary  with the Taliban - a group at least parts of which, Mr Trump hoped one day, possibly, to bring to the negotiating table. This video can not be played The BBC is given rare access to see life under the Taliban Mr Trump's stress on building up the US-Indian relationship and on what India might offer Afghanistan in terms of economic development was at least a stab at a wider regional approach - but one also intended to ring alarm bells in Pakistan. There were tough words too for the Afghan authorities. Riven by factionalism and corruption, the Afghan government is no poster-child for democratic values. Mr Trump said that he wasn't going to dictate how the Afghans should rule themselves. But in almost the same breath he said Washington was not offering the Kabul government a blank cheque. ""Our support is not unlimited,"" he said. ""Americans expect,"" he said, ""real reforms, real progress and real results."" President Trump's decision has implications for a number of other countries, not least Washington's Nato allies. The call already went out to Nato capitals before the summer for them to increase their contributions to the US-led force. Britain, which already has some 500 troops in Afghanistan - mainly in and around Kabul - has already agreed to despatch a further 85 personnel. Like the other international forces and the bulk of the US troops they are not engaged in combat but in supporting, training and mentoring the fledgling Afghan forces. The UK is offering more troops to help support the Afghan national army UK Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon welcomed the Trump announcement noting ""we have to stay the course in Afghanistan to help build up its fragile democracy"". Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg similarly welcomed the Trump speech noting that the alliance currently has over 12,000 troops in the country and that over recent weeks some 15 allies have pledged additional contributions. In his address President Trump - a longstanding critic of Nato - had some rare words of praise for the alliance noting that ""we told them to contribute more and they have done so"". So these then are the broad lines of the Trump vision for an Afghan policy. The details? Well, they will become apparent later.  It is the moment when the Trump rhetoric came up against the Afghan reality, and the Afghan reality has probably won. Afghanistan has now become Mr Trump's war. He faced the same set of bad options faced by his predecessors. And whatever the rhetoric he seems to have set a broadly similar course, except that he insists he will be tougher and that he will get results.

Will analysing jam help me be a nurse?,"Polina Ralutin thinks the language test is too difficult Polina Ralutin was an experienced nurse in the Philippines and keen to take up a post in the NHS, at the Lister hospital, in Stevenage. First, she had to pass an exam testing her knowledge of the English language.  But she was surprised to find she had to analyse a text on jam-making for the exam. She told the BBC's World Tonight programme: ""I had to look at a diagram of the process and describe how to make it - there was a time limit, and it was very difficult to achieve in almost perfect English - how to make jam."" Polina passed the exam and took up her post in April 2016.  But she knows several other nurses who failed, and she believes the test is too difficult. ""I have good friends who had to take it three times,"" she says. ""I know plenty of others who struggled so much with it."" EU nurse applicants drop by 96% since Brexit vote More than 86,000 NHS posts vacant, says report The exam is set under the International English Language Testing System (IELTS), run by the British Council, and used by many employers around the world. It consists of four sections - listening, reading, writing and speaking - and the maximum mark is nine. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) uses it to assess overseas applicants to work in the UK and requires a minimum score of seven. Some NHS employers say the bar is too high and it is hindering the process of recruitment at a time when it is hard to fill vacancies. The East and North Hertfordshire NHS Trust runs four hospitals, including the Lister. Management says it has found 140 nurses in the Philippines who are keen to come to the UK to work for the trust but who failed to get the required seven out of nine by half a mark. Tom Simons, who is chief people officer at the trust, says he himself tried the test and passed but not with top marks. ""One section had a very heavy academic test - analysing a play and the light and shade - I found that quite challenging,"" he says. He believes the test should be amended to focus on language relevant in a care setting. ""The language test has certainly had a significant impediment on our ability to bring nurses into the organisation quickly,"" he says. The debate intensified last year, when the NMC extended the language test to applicants from the European Union. Recent NMC figures showed the number of EU nurses applying to register to work in the UK had plunged by 96% between July 2016 and April 2017. The NMC said the language test may have been a factor. Others pointed out the fall coincided with the aftermath of the Brexit vote. The NMC is now looking at whether a different type of test might be required. Chief executive Jackie Smith says: ""We are working with organisations and agencies and asking them what they think might be a viable alternative. ""We will put that back to the council to see if that is something that could be offered without compromising public protection."" But she is adamant it is not a question of watering down the existing test. ""Communication is the thing that patients worry most about,"" she says. ""Patients will say, 'I want to know that person listening or examining me understands me.' ""There is no prospect of us simply lowering the score in response to this."" Dame Donna Kinnair, of the Royal College of Nursing, says the fundamental problem is not the language test, but the failure to train enough nurses. ""We know that a good position to be in is to have nurses trained in this country,"" she says. ""So, while we are using nurses from overseas to solve our short-term supply, we need to plan for the long term."" Few would disagree with the need for long-term planning. Some NHS employers, though, are for now focusing on the short-term challenge of finding more nurses like Polina to boost their staff numbers and provide high quality care to patients.

Maggie O'Farrell's 17 brushes with death,"Maggie O'Farrell's brushes with death are detailed in her new memoir Acclaimed author Maggie O'Farrell has had 17 experiences that brought her close to death. But these were no dramatic visions of bright lights, accompanied by the sound of celestial angels. And nor is she particularly unlucky. Instead, she believes these near-misses are all part and parcel of the human experience - and she wants to ""normalise"" them for the sake of her young daughter, whose severe allergies necessitate hospital dashes several times a year. That's not to say that some of O'Farrell's brushes with death - as recollected in her unconventional memoir I Am, I Am, I Am - don't leave your heart in your mouth as you read about them. They included: A jump off a harbour wall into the sea, where her teenage self was trapped underwater A lorry that passed a fraction of a millimetre from her head A birth in an understaffed hospital A plane journey that saw passengers flung to the ceiling when it started plummeting towards the earth They also leave you feeling that it could have been you. Or, that things could have been very different for O'Farrell. The fact that they weren't is why she wanted to tell her story, having previously vowed to never write about her private life. And when she did decide she wanted to write I Am, I Am, I Am (its title comes from a Sylvia Plath poem), she refused to take an advance, settling on a token Â£1 when her agent insisted for legal reasons. She jokes she spent it all on a supermarket trolley. ""In a way, the format I chose - to describe a life through this one type of experience - allowed me to reveal almost as much as I conceal,"" she says from her home in Edinburgh, where she lives with her husband and three children. ""There's a lot I don't say in the book - even if I can join the dots between those things, others can't."" O'Farrell won the Costa Novel Award in 2010 for The Hand That First Held Mine The best-selling author has published seven novels to date. She has been nominated for the Costa Novel Award three times and won it in 2010 for her book The Hand that First Held Mine. Meanwhile, her novel The Distance Between Us won a Somerset Maugham Award. ""I'm in my 40s now. And I don't like the phrase mid-life crisis, but I do think that when you reach that point, you start to look back at things you didn't think about at the time, especially when you are bringing up children and what they're going to experience."" It was especially the experiences of her middle child that sparked the idea for I Am, I Am, I Am. ""The book started as a project for her. She has a life-threatening medical condition. She has a lot of brushes with death herself. ""She has this very extreme allergic reaction which we can usually allay but sometimes we can't. She has an awful lot to cope with for someone her age. ""I wanted to make sense of it for her and for myself - the challenges of parenting a child. You have to metabolise the trauma and give it back to them in an acceptable form."" O'Farrell says she wanted to tell her eight-year-old daughter: ""You can have a full life and be all you want to be, even with all this happening."" And as to why she chose to write it as a memoir, she says there is a ""human need for narrative - a need to explain the inexplicable"". So when her daughter was in hospital, O'Farrell told her about the time she was in hospital as a child, with encephalitis - a condition the doctors feared would kill her, or at least leave her in a wheelchair. The author was born in Northern Ireland and now lives in Edinburgh So does she think she has more near-death experiences than other people? Because 17 does sound like a lot. ""I think I've probably had more than most people,"" she muses. ""I thought it was quite normal but when I've told people the title (the full title being I Am, I Am, I Am - Seventeen Brushes With Death), they've said 'what??'. ""So maybe it's not normal after all. ""A lot of them are linked to the illness I had."" She opens up about the aftermath of the condition, which caused issues relating to balance and perception. One that wasn't linked to the encephalitis, though, and which opens the memoir, is shocking - an encounter on a secluded path with a man who she feels has been waiting for her, who looms forward with his binocular straps. Before writing this book, she had only ever told her husband about it. ""It's a strange one - and it came out of a conversation with my daughter. She said she wanted to go walking, just her and me. ""At that point, I thought I'm going to have to tell her the story, to say I'd prefer you not to go hiking alone.

'We should give back art looted by the Nazis',"The German food firm has done more than many others to face up to its Nazi-era heritage Joerg Schillinger is showing me around the extravagant foyer of the head office of frozen pizza and processed foods firm, Dr Oetker - complete with a winding marble staircase and Victorian grandfather clock - when he points to a former chief executive's bronze bust. ""This is Dr Richard Kaselowsky,"" says the manager, before adding, with a hint of embarrassment: ""Unfortunately, he was a strong Nazi."" The 126-year-old company, a household name in Germany and beyond, has done more than most to face up to what Mr Schillinger calls the ""dark shadow"" of its activities in the 1930s and 1940s. A few years ago, the family-owned firm enlisted prominent historians to write a book chronicling the relationship between former bossRudolf-August Oetker- a member of the Waffen SS - and the Third Reich. It revealed how Dr Oetker had supported the war effort by providing pudding mixes and munitions to Nazi troops, and how the business had used slave labour in some of its facilities. Dr Oetker made howitzer shells and machine gun parts as well as foodstuffs for Hitler's regime Now, in a rarer move, the company is turning its attention to a more tangible reminder of former sins - its vast private art collection. In a floor-to-ceiling library at Dr Oetker's sprawling headquarters in the North-Rhine Westphalian city of Bielefeld, Dr Monika Bachtler reveals one of its treasures - a resplendent 17th Century silver goblet. ""It's a typical German silversmith's piece,"" says the white-gloved curator of the Oetker collection, ""made in Augsburg in 1612"". The goblet originally belonged to Emma Budge, a wealthy Jewish socialite, philanthropist and art-lover from Hamburg. It was part of an impressive collection forcibly auctioned off by the Nazis in the early 1930s, including porcelain figures by Kaendler and paintings by van Loo. This particular piece of silverware's troubling provenance was discovered as a consequence of a voluntary audit of Dr Oetker's own collection. The collection, which includes some some 4,500 priceless pieces, scattered across several, secret locations, was mostly purchased by Rudolf-August Oetker, who was a renowned art enthusiast. Nazi leaders like Hermann Goering looted art from all over Europe during the Second World War The company's board, which includes members of the Oetker family, commissioned the audit in 2015. So far, just four artworks have been restored to their rightful owners - including the windmill-shaped goblet. Dr Oetker is tight-lipped about the precise value of the goblet - for which the Budge estate elected to receive financial compensation - but other items in the Budge collection are worth as much as Â£270,000, according to Lothar Fremy, one of just a dozen or so lawyers in Germany who represent heirs of Nazi confiscated art. Mr Fremy, a Berliner who represents the Budge heirs, says few cases are carried out this smoothly. ""Sometimes it's like a big puzzle you have to put together,"" he explains. ""Between 1933 and 1945, hundreds of thousands of items were sold, the market was flooded with artefacts."" Tracing their origin is a process which will take ""10, 20 or 30 years easily"", he says. Private collectors have generally not wanted to look too closely at the provenance of some of their artworks, says Lothar Fremy In this case, thanks to the meticulous paperwork left behind by Nazi bureaucrats, a comprehensive catalogue of the forced auction of the Budge collection exists, complete with images of most items. This allowed Mr Fremy to enter the details of more than 1,000 items from the catalogue ontolootedart.com,external, an online registry for the return of stolen cultural objects. But although many items from the Budge collection have been found in galleries, including Meissen porcelain figures at the V&A in London, it is rarer for private collections - let alone those owned by corporations - to voluntarily examine their inventory for a match to an artefact on the online database. More than 70 years after the end of the war, the return of looted items is becoming more commonplace The widely-followed principles for returning Nazi-confiscated art, outlined after a conference in Washington in 1998, are largely focused on public institutions. Private collectors, Mr Fremy says, have generally not felt inclined to look too closely into the origins of their prized possessions. Yet the return of stolen items from the Budge collection and beyond, he says, is becoming more common. ""Ten or 12 years ago, it wasn't a warm or co-operative reception,"" says Mr Fremy, reminiscing about early approaches to individuals who may have been in possession of stolen art, ""but in general it's getting better."" Dr Oetker's Joerg Schillinger hopes other firms will follow his company's lead Back in Bielefeld, Dr Oetker's researchers say it may take decades to determine how many more items in its collection are due for restitution. But Joerg Schillinger hopes that other German companies, among which huge art collections are not uncommon, will follow the frozen food firm's lead. ""It's a pity that there are still some companies that haven't stepped into their history,"" he says. ""We were quite late, 70 years after the war, but we are very happy that we did it."" His recommendation to other businesses? ""Just do it, for the sake of your company and for the sake of the stakeholders.""

Sensor tracks who is driving in your neighbourhood,"The sensor device on display at Y Combinator's demo day A start-up that lets residents monitor who drives in and out of their neighbourhood was among the companies revealed at a Silicon Valley event on Monday. Flock's sensor, which it offers for $50 a year per house, logs the number plates of every car that drives into a street and takes a picture. The sensor could eventually provide facial recognition. Residents of monitored neighbourhoods can opt-out of being tracked - but visitors, or people passing through, cannot. Flock is backed by Y Combinator, a start-up âincubatorâ which in the past has funded successes including Dropbox, Reddit and AirBnB. A privacy expert said he believed the data collection to be legal according to US law, but that the idea could ignite a debate about the ""right to be left alone in publicâ. âOne of the great weaknesses in US privacy law is that we only protect against intrusions into private areas, not public spaces,â said Albert Gidari, director of privacy at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society. ""Public roads through neighbourhoods, licence plates, pedestrians on public sidewalks etc all are fair game,"" he said. The data is only made available to âneighbourhood leadersâ, Flock says, and is a tool that could be used to fight crime. To date, one person has been convicted thanks to evidence captured by the device. âAn unfortunate individual drove into one of our [monitored] neighbourhoods,â explained Garret Langley, chief executive and co-founder of Flock. Residents can opt out of having their data collected - but visitors cannot ""He put a nice road bike in the back of his car, and drove off with both the window down and the trunk open. ""Not only do we have footage of his licence plate, we have a picture of his face and a picture of the bike in the back.â The technology was shown off at Y Combinatorâs Demo Day, the twice-yearly event at which entrepreneurs pitch their companies to several hundred investors. Flockâs devices are being trialled in seven neighbourhoods in and around Atlanta, with more locations across the US currently being considered.

It expects to have approval from the US Federal Drug Administration within the next year. A second day of presentations takes place on Tuesday Residents in neighbourhoods being trialled by Flock can opt-out of being tracked, but visitors to those locations - or simply people passing through - have no way of stopping the technology from logging their movements. âShould there be? I would leave that up to the neighbourhood to decide,â Mr Langley told the BBC. âWe believe that our job is to provide the neighbourhoods with the technology to protect themselves as they see fit. ""We donât want into get into the business of making decisions about privacy and how this technology is used beyond the original use case. âIt's not our data - itâs the neighbourhoodâs data - and we delete it after 30 days.â Stanfordâs Mr Gidari said the technology perhaps highlighted one instance where long-existing laws may not have taken into consideration the types of technology on offer today. ""As these systems become more available and new platforms for capturing imagery become cheaper to deploy, we may yet revisit the issue of whether there is a right to be left alone in public, to be obscure or anonymous, or to be free from collection and storage in other's systems."" He added: âA few states have laws that prohibit the collection of biometric information - facial recognition would raise the issue.â Pay your fare using a 3D face map.

Barcelona attack suspects face judge,"This video can not be played The four suspects were transferred to a Madrid jail on Monday night The cell behind the Barcelona van attack had planned to use explosives against monuments including the city's famous Sagrada Familia church, a suspect has told a Madrid court. Mohamed Houli Chemlal is one of four surviving suspects who gave evidence. He and Driss Oukabir have both been charged with membership of a terrorist organisation and murder. Salah al-Karib has been detained pending further investigations, while Mohammed Aallaa was released on bail. According to Houli Chemlal, the group's plans - which he had known of ""for at least two months - were scaled back when a house packed with bomb-making equipment blew up the day before. He was injured in the accidental blast that reduced the house to rubble in the town of Alcanar. The Alcanar explosion came the day before Thursday's Barcelona attack in which a van was driven at speed down the main Las Ramblas boulevard, killing 13 and injuring more than 100. Judicial sources quoted Houli Chemlal as telling the court a much bigger series of attacks had been planned. Assailants killed a total of 15 people in the van attack, the stabbing of a driver whose car was commandeered shortly afterwards, and a car attack in the resort of Cambrils hours later. Eight members of the cell are dead - two were killed in the Alcanar explosion, and six were later shot by police, including five after the Cambrils attack. The four suspects in court were (L-R) Mohammed Aallaa, Mohamed Houli Chemlal, Sahal al-Karib and Driss Oukabir The last suspect to be killed was Moroccan-born Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, believed to be the driver of the Las Ramblas van. Wearing a fake explosives belt and armed with knives, he was shot dead by police in a vineyard west of Barcelona on Monday. The surviving suspects were moved, under high security, from Barcelona to Madrid for Tuesday's hearing. The court session, a preliminary hearing to gather evidence for a future trial, took place behind closed doors. Who are the suspects? Barcelona and Cambrils attacks: What we know so far Hugs and defiance on Las Ramblas Houli Chemlal was the first to testify, wearing hospital pyjamas. He is still being treated for his injuries from the blast in Alcanar. Oukabir, whose brother Moussa was among suspects killed after the Cambrils attack, has also given evidence to the Madrid court. According to judicial sources, he has changed his story to say that he admits renting the van used in the Las Ramblas attack but thought it was to be used for a house-move. Under earlier police interrogation, he is said to have maintained that his brother Moussa hired the van using documents stolen from him. Both have been held in jail. Gaudi's famous church was allegedly viewed as a target by the suspects Two other suspects were killed in the Alcanar explosion, including Abdelbaki Es Satty, the Moroccan imam from the town of Ripoll thought to have been a radicalising influence on the suspects. The two other suspects appearing in court were: Aallaa, 27, alleged owner of the Audi car used in the Cambrils attack. He has been released on bail, but must attend court every Monday. Salah al-Karib, 34, accused of running an internet cafe in Ripoll used to send money to Morocco. He has been held for a further 72 hours. All four suspects giving evidence are reported to have testified that Es Satty was the ringleader of the group. This video can not be played Spanish police release footage of raids on three homes in the town of Ripoll One victim of the attacks last week, Ana Maria SuÃ¡rez, was buried in Zaragoza as the suspects went to court Meanwhile, in the Italian capital relatives mourned as the bodies of Luca Russo and Bruno Gulotta were flown home As Tuesday's Madrid hearing took place, Ana SuÃ¡rez, a Spanish woman in her 60s killed in Cambrils, was buried in a private ceremony in Zaragoza. Forty-five companies in a Catalonia association of undertakers and funeral companies have offered to perform funerals for the victims without charge. Most of the 12 suspects lived in Ripoll, north of Barcelona close to the French border. All were young men of North African descent. Police have been conducting new raids -  at an internet cafÃ© in Ripoll and at an apartment in Vilafranca, south-west of Barcelona.

How your digital self could 'live' on after you die,"What if you could ""talk"" digitally to your descendants, not just appear in photo albums? The death and funerals industry is due for a shake-up, a growing number of tech start-ups believe. After you die, how do you fancy springing back to life in the form of a digital avatar? Your digital ghost could jump onto Facebook and join in a light-hearted argument about Friends, or  post Instagram updates reminiscing about that Italian road trip you took with an ex-lover. Living a digital afterlife might sound strange - a possible episode of satirical TV show Black Mirror perhaps - but some start-ups are investing serious time and money in the concept. Eternime, for example, plans to combine your online footprint - made up of everything you've ever posted on social media, your thoughts, smartphone pictures and so on - with artificial intelligence to create a digital version of yourself. Back-up brains: The era of digital immortality This digital representative could interact with your loved ones - and your descendants - long after you've died. ""Depending on the facts it has collected, the avatar will be able to offer anything from basic biographical data to being an engaging conversational partner,"" says Marius Ursache, Eternime's founder. An avatar of a loved one could be ""an engaging conversational partner"", says Marius Ursache It is set to launch next year, and according to Eternime, more than 37,000 people have already signed up for the service. But if you feel such a digital imprint might be a step too far - not to mention creepy - you could always schedule a few social media messages via DeadSocial.org to be published online after you've died. It might be best to pre-warn your nearest and dearest of your intentions, though. More pragmatically, technology is also helping people organise their funerals before they die. Rebekah Doran is only 28, but the Los Angeles-based travel consultant has already planned her funeral through a firm called Cake. On the day, guests will be served chicken and waffles and glasses of French wine, while listening to classic folk music. ""Having an end-of-life plan is even more important for young people, because should the unthinkable happen, we are the least likely group to be prepared,"" she says. Chicken and waffles will be on the menu at Rebekah Doran's funeral Boston-based Cake lets consumers plan their end-of-life preferences, from the funeral to what happens to their Facebook page. All the information is stored, appropriately enough, in the cloud or shared with family or friends. ""As generations of digital natives age, it is inevitable that people will seek a digital solution for end-of-life planning,"" says Cake co-founder Suelin Chen. ""Your end-of-life plans are exactly the type of information that should live securely in the cloud, where they can be accessed and updated from anywhere, and not just on pieces of paper stuck in a drawer somewhere,"" she says. The business of death in general has not been known for its technological innovation. Yes, we've had ashes being blasted into space, and biodegradable coffins and urns - some containing seeds - but a growing number of start-ups around the world believe this is an industry needing to be shaken up. In the UK, two companies - Co-operative Funeralcare and Dignity - dominate the Â£1.7bn funerals market, with shares of 25.2% and 18.4% respectively. This video can not be played Two Silicon Valley start-ups seek to help users prepare for death That's bad for competition, thought Funeralbooker, so it developed a marketplace that lets people compare the prices of funerals across the UK. ""Until we launched, there was zero transparency of pricing online,"" says Funeralbooker chief executive Ian Strang. ""Your only way to compare prices was to go round town and bargain with different funeral directors, all of whom have different pricing schemes."" Not only does Funeralbooker enable customers to shop around from the comfort of their own homes, he says, but it provides independent funeral directors with ""a collective presence online to counter the spending power of the large chains"". Since the company launched last November, ""several thousand"" people have used its service, says Mr Strang. In the US, Parting allows users to search for funeral directors by zip code (the US equivalent of postcode), while Stockholm-based online funeral planner Fenix organises funerals across Sweden online or by phone. An online will writing service can be a ""pragmatic organisational tool"", says Alice Walsh Making a will is also one of those unwelcome tasks too many of us put off. But Alice Walsh, 37, used Farewill, a website offering will preparation and funeral-planning services for just Â£50. ""My husband and I had been meaning to do a will for about five years, but we never got round to it,"" says Ms Walsh, who runs her own accessories and jewellery brand. ""A will, to me, was always a slow, serious document that needed to be done with a lawyer. Instead, we found a pragmatic organisational tool that we can manage and update as our life develops. ""If I'm happy to bank online, shop online and run my business online, then having my will online is a given,"" she says. Of course, such simple online will-preparation services may not be suitable for people with complex estates and children from multiple marriages, but as Mr Walsh says, it helped her cross off an unpleasant task from her list quickly and easily. Is 'tap and go' a better way to give to charity? Can hi-res music hit the right note? Better drugs, faster: The potential of AI-powered humans Electric trucks and vans cut pollution faster than cars Dan Garrett, Farewill's founder and chief executive, says one of his clients ""insisted his wife wore his green crocs to his funeral because of how intensely she hated them. ""That's real love to me, the kind of wish that makes you cry and laugh at the same time when you get it in real life,"" he says. From live-streaming of funerals to after-life digital avatars, it's clear that technology is infiltrating this most staid of sectors. ""Technology is coming in and making the industry more transparent in many ways, from finding a funeral director, to end-of-life thinking,"" says Louise Winter, funeral director at Poetic Endings and the former editor of the Good Funeral Guide. But she believes further innovation is needed. And Mr Strang agrees, saying: ""Other sectors such as healthcare and artificial intelligence are more interesting to investors right now. ""Death is less sexy and far more difficult to disrupt due to the slow pace of change.""

Third brother freed from Italy quake,"This video can not be played The moment baby Pasquale is rescued from the rubble Rescuers have freed the last of three brothers who were trapped under rubble after a deadly earthquake on the Italian holiday island of Ischia. The fire service confirmed they had rescued the 11-year-old at 14:12 local time (12:12 GMT), some 16 hours after the quake struck. His baby brother was the first to be pulled out, in the early hours; then his eight-year-old sibling mid morning. At least two women died and 39 people were injured in the quake. The 4.0 magnitude quake struck in the mid-evening, at a depth of around 5km (3 miles), just north of the Casamicciola commune. Ischia, off the coast of Naples, has a population of about 50,000 and is hugely popular with tourists, many of whom were out in bars and restaurants when the shaking started. Ciro, 11, was the last of his three brothers to be freed from the rubble His brother, Mattias, 8, was rescued mid-morning ""A horrible experience, everything was shaking, plunged into darkness, houses were collapsing... a nightmare,"" one person wrote on Twitter. Another said: ""I was on the couch watching TV. Blackout, shaking, something fell on my head. I scream, my mother grabs me and we ran outside."" Some buildings completely collapsed in the earthquake There were huge cheers when 11-year-old Ciro was pulled free from the rubble of his family home. He was credited with saving his brothers by pushing them under the bed when the shaking first started. His seven-month-old brother Pasquale was the first to be brought out, at 04:00. Rescuers were able to pass water through a tube to Ciro, and his eight-year-old brother Mattias, as they worked to get them out. ""I promised them that after this was all over we would all go get a pizza together,"" one rescuer told Italian television. The boys' parents and another woman had managed to escape from the building earlier, and raised the alarm about their children. Hotels, a church, hospital and homes were damaged Hotels, homes and a hospital were among a number of buildings damaged. One elderly woman was reportedly killed by debris falling from a church, while another body was found in the rubble of another collapsed building. Civil Protection Department head Angelo Borrelli said some 2,600 people were unable to re-enter their homes while safety checks were being carried out around the island. Extra ferries, from Naples to Ischia, were laid on during the night to bring more rescue workers to the island and allow holidaymakers to leave. Dozens of people are said to have ended their holidays early and Italian media said some tourists were sleeping on benches waiting for boats to arrive. An emergency response team was quickly on the scene, partly because additional numbers were already on the island to fight localised bush fires. Ischia, about an hour's ferry ride from Naples, is no stranger to earthquakes. Its worst came in July 1883 when a 5.8-magnitude quake killed more than 2,000 people.

There were already obligatory classes on religion. But now, the introduction of the concept of jihad is just horrendous."" From September Turkey will have a new education curriculum and this 38-year-old mother is among many parents who are worried. The changes affect first, fifth- and ninth-grade students, and the main controversy surrounds the exclusion of the theory of evolution from secondary education. ""In classes, nine- and 10-year-old students have been memorising prayers from the Koran. I believe religious education should be given at home, not in schools,"" said the woman, who did not want to be named, due to security concerns. Other controversial changes include shortening the time allocated to studying the life of Turkey's secularist founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, an introduction to the concept of jihad and more classes on religion. Less time will be spent on the life of Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey The coup attempt that took place last year also features prominently in the proposed curriculum. The secular opposition in Turkey says President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the governing AK party are trying to move the country away from its founding values, and make society more Islamic and conservative. Mr Erdogan has repeatedly expressed his ambition to raise pious generations. Education Minister Ismet Yilmaz told the BBC that they had excluded only ""unnecessary, archaic and repetitive subjects"" from the curriculum and that it was not fair to have a debate over a few issues, when more than 100,000 changes had been made. Mr Yilmaz denied that evolution theory was being completely omitted from secondary education. ""We are not against evolution. If science says something, it is impossible to resist it. Also, the subjects on inheritance, mutation, modification and adaptation are still present in the curriculum. These are all within the theory of evolution,"" Mr Yilmaz argued. ""We only say this: Let's not teach this subject at this level, but delay it to undergraduate study,"" he added. Passions flare as Turkey excludes evolution from textbooks Charles Darwin: Evolution and the story of our species Evolution v Creationism in modern-day faith But critics have argued that the initial chapter on the origins of man has been excluded from the curriculum. Excluding that, but retaining further concepts from the evolution theory, is unhelpful, they say. ""Students need to understand the theory of evolution before they can make sense of concepts such as mutation or adaptation. If you do not teach them what evolution is, but talk to them about these subjects, they will be inclined to just memorise, without learning,"" said Aysel Madra from the non-profit think tank Education Reform Initiative. Head of Egitim-Is, one of the biggest teachers' unions in Turkey, says the most crucial chapter in the theory of evolution has been dropped. ""They want to teach about the origins of man as it is written in religious texts, as if we all descended from Adam and Eve,"" Orhan Yildirim said. He also criticised the introduction of the concept of jihad in secondary school education. ""Ask anyone coming out of a mosque today what he understands by the word jihad - 99% would say that they see jihad as the main reason for war in the Middle East. We will not let the government put a spin on the word and normalise the concept of jihad,"" he said. According to the dictionary of the Institute of Turkish Language, jihad is an Arabic word meaning ""a religious war"". Meaning of jihad What is jihadism? Erdogan's Turkey Education Minister Ismet Yilmaz argued that the word was misinterpreted and what it actually meant was to serve the community, to increase welfare, to secure peace and understanding of one another. The education ministry says the curriculum was changed through consultation with more than 180,000 people, who shared their comments on the draft. But the opposition teachers' unions say they were not consulted, and that preparation of the draft curriculum was not transparent. Orhan Yildirim argued the changes to the curriculum were ideological. ""This curriculum is a coup d'etat targeting education in Turkey. You don't have to have guns to make a coup. If you strike a country's education as such, then it will be impossible for it to catch up with prosperous nations,"" he said.

Barcelona suspects appear in court,"This video can not be played The four suspects were transferred to a Madrid jail on Monday night The cell behind the Barcelona van attack had planned to use explosives against monuments including the city's famous Sagrada Familia church, a suspect has told a Madrid court. Mohamed Houli Chemlal is one of four surviving suspects who gave evidence. He and Driss Oukabir have both been charged with membership of a terrorist organisation and murder. Salah al-Karib has been detained pending further investigations, while Mohammed Aallaa was released on bail. According to Houli Chemlal, the group's plans - which he had known of ""for at least two months - were scaled back when a house packed with bomb-making equipment blew up the day before. He was injured in the accidental blast that reduced the house to rubble in the town of Alcanar. The Alcanar explosion came the day before Thursday's Barcelona attack in which a van was driven at speed down the main Las Ramblas boulevard, killing 13 and injuring more than 100. Judicial sources quoted Houli Chemlal as telling the court a much bigger series of attacks had been planned. Assailants killed a total of 15 people in the van attack, the stabbing of a driver whose car was commandeered shortly afterwards, and a car attack in the resort of Cambrils hours later. Eight members of the cell are dead - two were killed in the Alcanar explosion, and six were later shot by police, including five after the Cambrils attack. The four suspects in court were (L-R) Mohammed Aallaa, Mohamed Houli Chemlal, Sahal al-Karib and Driss Oukabir The last suspect to be killed was Moroccan-born Younes Abouyaaqoub, 22, believed to be the driver of the Las Ramblas van. Wearing a fake explosives belt and armed with knives, he was shot dead by police in a vineyard west of Barcelona on Monday. The surviving suspects were moved, under high security, from Barcelona to Madrid for Tuesday's hearing. The court session, a preliminary hearing to gather evidence for a future trial, took place behind closed doors. Who are the suspects? Barcelona and Cambrils attacks: What we know so far Hugs and defiance on Las Ramblas Houli Chemlal was the first to testify, wearing hospital pyjamas. He is still being treated for his injuries from the blast in Alcanar. Oukabir, whose brother Moussa was among suspects killed after the Cambrils attack, has also given evidence to the Madrid court. According to judicial sources, he has changed his story to say that he admits renting the van used in the Las Ramblas attack but thought it was to be used for a house-move. Under earlier police interrogation, he is said to have maintained that his brother Moussa hired the van using documents stolen from him. Both have been held in jail. Gaudi's famous church was allegedly viewed as a target by the suspects Two other suspects were killed in the Alcanar explosion, including Abdelbaki Es Satty, the Moroccan imam from the town of Ripoll thought to have been a radicalising influence on the suspects. The two other suspects appearing in court were: Aallaa, 27, alleged owner of the Audi car used in the Cambrils attack. He has been released on bail, but must attend court every Monday. Salah al-Karib, 34, accused of running an internet cafe in Ripoll used to send money to Morocco. He has been held for a further 72 hours. All four suspects giving evidence are reported to have testified that Es Satty was the ringleader of the group. This video can not be played Spanish police release footage of raids on three homes in the town of Ripoll One victim of the attacks last week, Ana Maria SuÃ¡rez, was buried in Zaragoza as the suspects went to court Meanwhile, in the Italian capital relatives mourned as the bodies of Luca Russo and Bruno Gulotta were flown home As Tuesday's Madrid hearing took place, Ana SuÃ¡rez, a Spanish woman in her 60s killed in Cambrils, was buried in a private ceremony in Zaragoza. Forty-five companies in a Catalonia association of undertakers and funeral companies have offered to perform funerals for the victims without charge. Most of the 12 suspects lived in Ripoll, north of Barcelona close to the French border. All were young men of North African descent. Police have been conducting new raids -  at an internet cafÃ© in Ripoll and at an apartment in Vilafranca, south-west of Barcelona.

Race to free third brother in Italy quake,"This video can not be played The moment baby Pasquale is rescued from the rubble Rescuers have freed the last of three brothers who were trapped under rubble after a deadly earthquake on the Italian holiday island of Ischia. The fire service confirmed they had rescued the 11-year-old at 14:12 local time (12:12 GMT), some 16 hours after the quake struck. His baby brother was the first to be pulled out, in the early hours; then his eight-year-old sibling mid morning. At least two women died and 39 people were injured in the quake. The 4.0 magnitude quake struck in the mid-evening, at a depth of around 5km (3 miles), just north of the Casamicciola commune. Ischia, off the coast of Naples, has a population of about 50,000 and is hugely popular with tourists, many of whom were out in bars and restaurants when the shaking started. Ciro, 11, was the last of his three brothers to be freed from the rubble His brother, Mattias, 8, was rescued mid-morning ""A horrible experience, everything was shaking, plunged into darkness, houses were collapsing... a nightmare,"" one person wrote on Twitter. Another said: ""I was on the couch watching TV. Blackout, shaking, something fell on my head. I scream, my mother grabs me and we ran outside."" Some buildings completely collapsed in the earthquake There were huge cheers when 11-year-old Ciro was pulled free from the rubble of his family home. He was credited with saving his brothers by pushing them under the bed when the shaking first started. His seven-month-old brother Pasquale was the first to be brought out, at 04:00. Rescuers were able to pass water through a tube to Ciro, and his eight-year-old brother Mattias, as they worked to get them out. ""I promised them that after this was all over we would all go get a pizza together,"" one rescuer told Italian television. The boys' parents and another woman had managed to escape from the building earlier, and raised the alarm about their children. Hotels, a church, hospital and homes were damaged Hotels, homes and a hospital were among a number of buildings damaged. One elderly woman was reportedly killed by debris falling from a church, while another body was found in the rubble of another collapsed building. Civil Protection Department head Angelo Borrelli said some 2,600 people were unable to re-enter their homes while safety checks were being carried out around the island. Extra ferries, from Naples to Ischia, were laid on during the night to bring more rescue workers to the island and allow holidaymakers to leave. Dozens of people are said to have ended their holidays early and Italian media said some tourists were sleeping on benches waiting for boats to arrive. An emergency response team was quickly on the scene, partly because additional numbers were already on the island to fight localised bush fires. Ischia, about an hour's ferry ride from Naples, is no stranger to earthquakes. Its worst came in July 1883 when a 5.8-magnitude quake killed more than 2,000 people.

Doorstep lender Provident's shares dive,"Shares in Provident Financial lost two thirds of their value on Tuesday after the doorstep lender issued its second profit warning in three months. The FTSE 100 company now expects tomake losses of Â£80m to Â£120m,externalafter its debt collection rates fell to 57%, compared with a 90% rate in 2016. Bradford-based Provident recently changed the way it collected its loans, replacing self-employed agents with ""customer experience managers"". Its chief executive has resigned. The company has some 2.5 million customers, many of whom would not qualify for a standard bank loan and are therefore categorised as ""sub-prime"". Tuesday's 66% fall left Provident shares at just 598.5p. Three months ago they were worth Â£31 apiece. Invesco Asset Management and Woodford Investment Management own about 40% of the group between them. Neil Woodford, of investment at Woodford Investment Management, said he was ""hugely disappointed"" but believed that it would ultimately get back on track. ""This business has been around for more than a century and I believe it will be around for many decades to come,"" he added. Invesco declined to comment. The BBC has been contacted by a number of former Provident agents. All of them left when the collection system was changed and many are angry. They say they had a strong relationship with their borrowers, One former manager, Mike Thompson, said: ""The previous Home Credit model, using local self-employed agents who were friends and relatives of the customers, ensures affordable appropriate borrowing. ""Drafting in customer experience managers working on phone apps has meant that the all-important relationship between agent and customer has been broken."" Provident had already flagged up problems with its new system in June. At the time, Provident said not enough of its self-employed debt collectors had applied to become employed by the company. It had also been less effective at collecting money and selling new loans, and a greater number of agents than normal had left. The company said then it expected profits to be Â£60m at its consumer credit division. Provident is undertaking ""a thorough and rapid review of home credit's performance"", and will not now pay the interim dividend it promised just a month ago. Its other divisions - Vanquis Bank, sub-prime car loan business Moneybarn and consumer credit brand Satsuma - are trading in line with expectations. However, Vanquis has been under investigation by watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority, which had concerns about one of its products. Provident agreed to suspend all sales and is awaiting the outcome of that probe. Manjit Wolstenholme was appointed as executive chairman, taking over the company from former chief executive Peter Crook. She said: ""I am very disappointed to have to announce the rapid deterioration in the outlook for the home credit business."" She added it there was unlikely to be a full-year dividend paid. Neil Wilson, from ETX Capital, said: ""There is no easy way out from this hole. Management will take a long time to regain credibility... The performance is abysmal and significantly worse than management ever could have imagined... Is this the end? There must be some sense that things cannot get any worse."" However, rhe slump in Provident's shares has proved lucrative for some hedge funds, which had been building short positions in recent days. The biggest shorts were held by AQR Capital, Lansdowne Partners and Systematica, filings showed.

India court bans Islamic instant divorce,"Five Muslim women asked the Supreme Court to declare instant divorce unconstitutional India's top court has ruled the practice of instant divorce in Islam unconstitutional, marking a major victory for women's rights activists. In a 3-2 majority verdict, the court called the practice ""un-Islamic"". India is one of a handful of countries where a Muslim man can divorce his wife in minutes by saying the word talaq (divorce) three times. The landmark court decision came in response to petitions challenging the so-called ""triple talaq"" custom. The cases were filed by five Muslim women who had been divorced in this way and two rights groups. Women's rights campaigners have hailed the court's decision as a historic win. There have been cases in which Muslim men in India have divorced their wives by issuing the so-called triple talaq by letter, telephone and, increasingly, by text message, WhatsApp and Skype.  A number of these cases made their way to the courts as women contested the custom. How Muslim women won the battle The women who challenged triple talaq The fight against instant divorce Triple talaq divorce has no mention in Sharia Islamic law or the Koran, even though the practice has existed for decades. Islamic scholars say the Koran clearly spells out how to issue a divorce - it has to be spread over three months, allowing a couple time for reflection and reconciliation. Most Islamic countries, including Pakistan and Bangladesh, have banned triple talaq, but the custom has continued in India, which does not have a uniform set of laws on marriage and divorce that apply to every citizen. This video can not be played Triple talaq: Why I fought instant divorce Three of the five Supreme Court judges called the controversial practice ""un-Islamic, arbitrary and unconstitutional"". One of the judges, Justice Kurien Joseph, said the practice was not an essential part of Islam and enjoyed no protection. The judges also said it was ""manifestly arbitrary"" to allow a man to ""break down (a) marriage whimsically and capriciously"". Chief Justice JS Khehar, in a differing opinion, said that personal law could not be touched by a constitutional court of law. The opposing judgements also recommended that parliament legislate on the issue. However this is not binding and is up to parliament to take up. The Indian government, led by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), has supported ending the practice. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has brought up the issue several times including in his Independence Day address on 15 August. Activists are hailing the decision as a major step forward for the rights of Muslim women The judgement is a huge victory for Muslim women. For decades, they have had to live with the threat of instant divorce dangling over their heads like a sword. Campaigners say over the years thousands of women, especially those from poor families, have been discarded by their husbands in this manner. Many have been rendered destitute, with nowhere to go, or have been forced to return to their parental homes or fend for themselves. The top court has also sent a very strong message to Muslim clergy. India's Muslim personal law board had called the practice ""reprehensible"" but said that it was not an issue for the courts and government to interfere in. With this latest ruling, this will no longer be the case. The judgement is being widely hailed as a major win for Muslim women and women's rights. The prime minister praised the ""historic"" ruling.

Shayara Bano, one of the main petitioners, said she appealed to people to accept the ruling and not politicise the issue. ""I have felt the pain when family breaks. I hope no one has to go through this situation in future,"" she told reporters. Hasina Khan, founder of the Beebak Collective which fought against triple talaq, called the verdict ""historic"". ""We are extremely happy. Muslim women have struggled for years,"" she told the BBC. Shayara Bano petitioned the Supreme Court to declare triple talaq unconstitutional Zakia Soman, an activist from Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan, another of the groups which contested the practice, said Indian women of many religions had supported them. ""It's a historic day for us, but it doesn't end here,"" she said. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB), which had maintained that the court had no jurisdiction over the matter, has yet to make an official statement on the ruling, but has convened a meeting to decide what its response should be, a report in Indian newspaperThe Hindu,externalsaid. However, it quoted an executive member as saying that the judgement would have ""wide ramifications"" as it affected the religious rights of minority groups. But the All India Muslim Women Personal Law Board (AIWPB), which had opposed the stand of the AIMPLB, said the judgment ""could not have been better"". ""It will change the entire landscape of Muslim families. It's now in the mainstream and will protect not only women, but children. Families will be more stable because children will also be protected,"" Chandra Rajan, an advocate for the group, told the BBC. On social media the hashtags #TripleTalaq and #SupremeCourt began trending on Twitter India even as the verdict was being announced. The hashtag #Tripletalaq is also trending globally on Twitter. Dating from the 8th Century AD and not mentioned in the Koran, triple talaq divorces often conflict with countries' legal systems. India has become the 23rd country to outlaw them, joining places as far apart as Egypt, Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates and Malaysia. In countries including China and the UK a couple must go through the official channels to be legally divorced but there have been cases of individuals considering themselves divorced after the triple talaq has been said. In Saudi Arabia the law leaves room for various interpretations of religious custom, and triple talaq is practised. This type of verbal divorce is practiced around the world but as it is illegal in so many countries, it is hard to say exactly how common it is. Why must ""talaq"" be said three times? Under some interpretations of Islamic law, a man can divorce his wife and get back together with her - but only twice. After the third divorce, the marriage is completely over and cannot be started again without an intervening marriage to someone else. Scholars are divided on whether it counts as a full and final divorce to say the word three times, or whether it needs to be said on three separate occasions.

Trump rules out Afghan troops withdrawal,"This video can not be played ""We are not nation building again. We are killing terrorists,"" President Trump said President Donald Trump has said a hasty US withdrawal from Afghanistan would leave a vacuum for terrorists to fill. He said his original instinct was to pull US forces out, but had instead decided to stay and ""fight to win"" to avoid the mistakes made in Iraq. He said he wanted to shift from a time-based approach in Afghanistan to one based on conditions on the ground, adding he would not set deadlines. However, the US president warned it was not a ""blank cheque"" for Afghanistan. ""America will work with the Afghan government, so long as we see commitment and progress,"" he said. The Taliban responded by saying that Afghanistan would become ""another graveyard"" for the US if it did not withdraw its troops. Trump rhetoric versus Afghan reality Taliban letter to Trump urges withdrawal President Trump has committed to stepping up the US military's engagement in Afghanistan, but details were few and far between. He said his new approach would be more pragmatic than idealistic, and would switch from nation building to ""killing terrorists"". But he refused to get drawn on how many extra troops, if any, would be deployed and gave no timeline for ending the US presence in the country. Washington is expected to send up to 4,000 additional troops, but Mr Trump did not comment on this. The president did, however, put pressure on neighbouring Pakistan, warning that the US would no longer tolerate it offering ""safe havens"" to extremists - an accusation swiftly dismissed by a Pakistani army spokesman. Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, wife Melania and Vice-President Mike Pence watch the speech The president also, for the first time, left the door open for an eventual peace deal with the Taliban, saying: ""Someday, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban in Afghanistan."" However, Mr Trump said there would be an escalation in the battle against groups like al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic State. ""[They] need to know they have nowhere to hide - that no place is beyond the reach of American arms,"" he said. Meanwhile, Mr Trump made it clear he expects his existing allies - singling out India - to support him in his new strategy, and urged them to raise their countries' contributions ""in line with our own"". Read more on Trump's presidency: It's not the first time Trump has taken a very different line from his campaign So how does Trump the campaigner compare to Trump the president? His comments follow great upheaval at the White House The spirit of Steve Bannon, an opponent of interventionism, lives on By Secunder Kermani, BBC correspondent in Kabul Even with a few thousand extra US soldiers in Afghanistan - deployment levels would remain far lower than their peak in 2010/11 when there were around 100,000 US personnel in the country. So what is different this time? Firstly, that there is no deadline by which the US will begin to scale operations back. Critics of President Obama's surge say that because he made it clear it was temporary - the Taliban were encouraged to wait the Americans out. President Trump's announcement was watched closely by Afghans in Kabul The second difference is that the US will put more pressure on Pakistan to end ""safe havens"" for the Taliban, according to President Trump. One analyst told me that the key to solving the conflict lies in Islamabad not in Afghanistan. But it is not clear how much leverage the US still has over Pakistan - or how Pakistan will respond to the accusations, given its consistent denial that it operates a ""good terrorist, bad terrorist"" policy. Pakistan has grown increasingly close to China, and has already had millions of dollars of US aid withheld for allegedly not taking enough action against the Taliban-allied Haqqani network. Before his presidency, Mr Trump was not shy about criticising his predecessors on their Afghanistan policy. He previously supported pulling US troops out of the conflict, which began under President George W Bush in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks. Allow Twitter content?

Early on in his presidential campaign, however,he did acknowledge,externalthat US troops would have to stay in order to avoid the total collapse of the Afghan government. And this long-awaited announcement came after a months-long review, with the president himself acknowledging that his original instinct to pull-out had been reversed after discussions with national security advisers. BBC correspondent Aleem Maqbool in Washington says the people who might object to Mr Trump's strategy are the very ones who voted for him. They were told the president would focus on a policy of ""America First"", but he now says he wants a win in Afghanistan to make all the sacrifice worthwhile, our correspondent adds. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani welcomed the plan, saying: ""The US-Afghan partnership is stronger than ever in overcoming the threat of terrorism that threaten us all."" He said the new strategy would enhance the training of Afghan security forces. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg also praised the move and said the alliance, which has about 12,000 troops in Afghanistan, would not allow the country to become ""a safe haven for terrorists who would attack our own countries"". This video can not be played The BBC is given rare access to see life under the Taliban General John Nicholson, the head of both US and international forces in Afghanistan, said it ""means the Taliban cannot win militarily"". But Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid dismissed Mr Trump's strategy as ""nothing new"", telling the US to think of an exit strategy ""instead of continuing the war"".

Civil partnership ruling faces challenge,"Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan lost their case for heterosexual civil partnerships in the Court of Appeal in February 2017 A heterosexual couple who want to enter a civil partnership instead of getting married have been granted the right to take their case to the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeal in February rejected the claim brought by Rebecca Steinfeld, 36, and Charles Keidan, 40. TheCivil Partnership Act 2004,externalonly applies to same-sex couples. The couple, from west London, argue the government's position is ""incompatible with equality law"" and there is still ""everything to fight for"". Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan, who have a daughter and another child on the way, argue that not all families are comfortable with marriage, but want the ""financial and legal protection"" that a civil partnership provides. If the Supreme Court overturns the previous judgement, heterosexual couples would be allowed to enter the secular partnership, which came into law for same-sex couples in 2005. In a civil partnership, a couple is entitled to the same legal treatment in terms of inheritance, tax, pensions and next-of-kin arrangements. It also provides both parties with protection if a partnership ends. Why choose civil partnership over marriage? Couple lose civil partnership challenge The Equal Civil Partnerships Campaign argues marriage comes with religious connotations and notions of patriarchy. Ms Steinfeld said: ""We hope the Supreme Court will deliver a judgment that will finally provide access to civil partnerships for thousands of families across the country."" His solicitor Louise Whitfield said: ""This is a very significant achievement for my clients as the Supreme Court only gives permission for a very small number of cases each year - those that are the most important for the court to consider."" The couple's case was first rejected by the High Court in January 2016. The Court of Appeal later said,externalthere was a potential breach of their human rights, but the government should have more time to decide the future of civil partnerships. A government spokesman had welcomed the ruling but said it would take the judgement into account during its evaluation of civil partnerships.

Plot to hide plane bomb in Barbie revealed,"Raids were carried out in Sydney suburbs in July after officials discovered an ""advanced"" plane bomb plot Lebanon's interior minister has claimed a terror cell attempted to blow up a flight from Australia with bombs hidden in a Barbie doll and a meat grinder. He said Amer Khayyat planned to detonate an improvised explosive device 20 minutes into an Abu-Dhabi bound flight with 400 passengers onboard. The plan was allegedly only aborted after the luggage containing the devices was deemed overweight. Four men were arrested in Sydney counter-terrorism raids in July. Two were released but Lebanese-Australian brothers Khaled Khayat, 49, and Mahmoud Khayat, 32 were charged with ""preparing for, or planning, a terrorist attack"". Australian authorities at the time confirmed the arrests related to a credible plot to bring down an aeroplane. It then emerged the target was anEtihad flightfrom Sydney on 15 July. Australian Federal Police (AFP) Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan described the plan as ""one of the most sophisticated plots that has ever been attempted on Australian soil"". Mr Phelan described the IEDs as ""high military-grade explosives"" He said components for the IED were sent through international cargo from IS members to the men in Australia. It is claimed a fourth brother, Tarek, is a senior member of the so-called Islamic State in Raqqa. Does a surge in airport security help? At a news conference on Monday, the Lebanese Interior Minister Nohad Machnouk said Amer Khayyat was forced to abandon the plan and to travel to Lebanon without the luggage after the bag was deemed overweight. His story contradicts Australian authorities who previously claimed the travelling brother had the bombplanted on him unknowingly. The minister said his country co-ordinated extensively with the Australian government over the plot. He also claimed the brothers had been under surveillance for over a year since their brother travelled to Syria. The arrested brothers were then said to beginplanning an attack with an ""improvised chemical dispersion device""after the initial bomb plot failed.

Two dead in quake on Italy tourist island,"This video can not be played The moment baby Pasquale is rescued from the rubble Rescuers have freed the last of three brothers who were trapped under rubble after a deadly earthquake on the Italian holiday island of Ischia. The fire service confirmed they had rescued the 11-year-old at 14:12 local time (12:12 GMT), some 16 hours after the quake struck. His baby brother was the first to be pulled out, in the early hours; then his eight-year-old sibling mid morning. At least two women died and 39 people were injured in the quake. The 4.0 magnitude quake struck in the mid-evening, at a depth of around 5km (3 miles), just north of the Casamicciola commune. Ischia, off the coast of Naples, has a population of about 50,000 and is hugely popular with tourists, many of whom were out in bars and restaurants when the shaking started. Ciro, 11, was the last of his three brothers to be freed from the rubble His brother, Mattias, 8, was rescued mid-morning ""A horrible experience, everything was shaking, plunged into darkness, houses were collapsing... a nightmare,"" one person wrote on Twitter. Another said: ""I was on the couch watching TV. Blackout, shaking, something fell on my head. I scream, my mother grabs me and we ran outside."" Some buildings completely collapsed in the earthquake There were huge cheers when 11-year-old Ciro was pulled free from the rubble of his family home. He was credited with saving his brothers by pushing them under the bed when the shaking first started. His seven-month-old brother Pasquale was the first to be brought out, at 04:00. Rescuers were able to pass water through a tube to Ciro, and his eight-year-old brother Mattias, as they worked to get them out. ""I promised them that after this was all over we would all go get a pizza together,"" one rescuer told Italian television. The boys' parents and another woman had managed to escape from the building earlier, and raised the alarm about their children. Hotels, a church, hospital and homes were damaged Hotels, homes and a hospital were among a number of buildings damaged. One elderly woman was reportedly killed by debris falling from a church, while another body was found in the rubble of another collapsed building. Civil Protection Department head Angelo Borrelli said some 2,600 people were unable to re-enter their homes while safety checks were being carried out around the island. Extra ferries, from Naples to Ischia, were laid on during the night to bring more rescue workers to the island and allow holidaymakers to leave. Dozens of people are said to have ended their holidays early and Italian media said some tourists were sleeping on benches waiting for boats to arrive. An emergency response team was quickly on the scene, partly because additional numbers were already on the island to fight localised bush fires. Ischia, about an hour's ferry ride from Naples, is no stranger to earthquakes. Its worst came in July 1883 when a 5.8-magnitude quake killed more than 2,000 people.

Sensor tracks who's driving in your neighbourhood,"The sensor device on display at Y Combinator's demo day A start-up that lets residents monitor who drives in and out of their neighbourhood was among the companies revealed at a Silicon Valley event on Monday. Flock's sensor, which it offers for $50 a year per house, logs the number plates of every car that drives into a street and takes a picture. The sensor could eventually provide facial recognition. Residents of monitored neighbourhoods can opt-out of being tracked - but visitors, or people passing through, cannot. Flock is backed by Y Combinator, a start-up âincubatorâ which in the past has funded successes including Dropbox, Reddit and AirBnB. A privacy expert said he believed the data collection to be legal according to US law, but that the idea could ignite a debate about the ""right to be left alone in publicâ. âOne of the great weaknesses in US privacy law is that we only protect against intrusions into private areas, not public spaces,â said Albert Gidari, director of privacy at Stanford Law School's Center for Internet and Society. ""Public roads through neighbourhoods, licence plates, pedestrians on public sidewalks etc all are fair game,"" he said. The data is only made available to âneighbourhood leadersâ, Flock says, and is a tool that could be used to fight crime. To date, one person has been convicted thanks to evidence captured by the device. âAn unfortunate individual drove into one of our [monitored] neighbourhoods,â explained Garret Langley, chief executive and co-founder of Flock. Residents can opt out of having their data collected - but visitors cannot ""He put a nice road bike in the back of his car, and drove off with both the window down and the trunk open. ""Not only do we have footage of his licence plate, we have a picture of his face and a picture of the bike in the back.â The technology was shown off at Y Combinatorâs Demo Day, the twice-yearly event at which entrepreneurs pitch their companies to several hundred investors. Flockâs devices are being trialled in seven neighbourhoods in and around Atlanta, with more locations across the US currently being considered.

""As these systems become more available and new platforms for capturing imagery become cheaper to deploy, we may yet revisit the issue of whether there is a right to be left alone in public, to be obscure or anonymous, or to be free from collection and storage in other's systems.""

News Daily: Trump's Afghanistan vow and Brexit legal plan,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: President Donald Trump gave a speech on Monday night in which he saidUS forces would stay in Afghanistan and ""fight to win"". He said his original instinct had been to pull US forces out, but a hasty withdrawal from Afghanistan would leave a vacuum for terrorists to fill and risk repeating the same mistakes made in Iraq. He spelled out that he wanted to shift from a time-based approach in Afghanistan to one based on conditions on the ground, adding he would not set out deadlines. He also warned Pakistan that the US would no longer tolerate the country offering ""safe havens"" to extremists, an accusation quickly dismissed by the Pakistani army. By Jonathan Marcus, diplomatic correspondent After some 16 years, the battle for Afghanistan - America's longest running war - is going to get a whole lot longer. This was the essential message from President Donald Trump's address. His stress on abandoning timetables and moving to a ""conditions-based approach"" as he called it, means that US troops will be in Afghanistan for a considerable time to come. The decision on a new Afghan strategy was much delayed, but after much prevarication he has essentially followed the line of his senior military advisers. Read Jonathan's full article Get our morning briefing in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The government is to publish its latest position paper on Brexit, calling for ""close co-operation"" with the EU toresolve cross-border legal disputes after UK withdrawal. An agreement needs to be reached on how divorces, commercial disputes and consumer claims that span multiple countries are handled - currently EU regulations specify how the appropriate court is chosen. Lawyers and MPs have warned that the UK's status as a ""global legal centre"" for commercial contracts could come under threat from rival countries unless clear arrangements are put in place for after Brexit. A 4.0 magnitude earthquake on the Italian island of Ischia has leftat least one person dead and 25 more injured. Italian media say up to 10 others are unaccounted for after buildings in the town of Casamicciola, off the coast of Naples, collapsed. Local reports say a hospital has been evacuated and emergency workers are attempting to free people from collapsed structures. Areas of the island are said to be without power, and relief workers are being transported by ferry and helicopter from the mainland. Ford is offeringUK customers Â£2,000 off a new model if they trade in carsthat are over seven years old. Unlike schemes by BMW and Mercedes, which are only for diesels, Ford will also accept petrol cars from any manufacturer. All of the part-exchanged vehicles will be scrapped, Ford said, which would have an ""immediate positive effect on air quality"". The BBC's transport correspondent, Richard Westcott, says the move is also designed to boost new car sales, which have been slipping in recent months. There are two contrasting stories on the front pages - many focus onthe shooting of the Barcelona terror suspect, who police had been hunting since Thursday's attack, and there are plenty of previews of the return of the Great British Bake-off on Channel 4. The Sun reports on the number of adverts - taking up 16 minutes and 42 seconds of the show's 58 minutes and 18 seconds - saying it breaks the record for any programme in the channel's history.

The fire service confirmed they had rescued the 11-year-old at 14:12 local time (12:12 GMT), some 16 hours after the quake struck. His baby brother was the first to be pulled out, in the early hours; then his eight-year-old sibling mid morning. At least two women died and 39 people were injured in the quake. The 4.0 magnitude quake struck in the mid-evening, at a depth of around 5km (3 miles), just north of the Casamicciola commune. Ischia, off the coast of Naples, has a population of about 50,000 and is hugely popular with tourists, many of whom were out in bars and restaurants when the shaking started. Ciro, 11, was the last of his three brothers to be freed from the rubble His brother, Mattias, 8, was rescued mid-morning ""A horrible experience, everything was shaking, plunged into darkness, houses were collapsing... a nightmare,"" one person wrote on Twitter. Another said: ""I was on the couch watching TV. Blackout, shaking, something fell on my head. I scream, my mother grabs me and we ran outside."" Some buildings completely collapsed in the earthquake There were huge cheers when 11-year-old Ciro was pulled free from the rubble of his family home. He was credited with saving his brothers by pushing them under the bed when the shaking first started. His seven-month-old brother Pasquale was the first to be brought out, at 04:00. Rescuers were able to pass water through a tube to Ciro, and his eight-year-old brother Mattias, as they worked to get them out. ""I promised them that after this was all over we would all go get a pizza together,"" one rescuer told Italian television. The boys' parents and another woman had managed to escape from the building earlier, and raised the alarm about their children. Hotels, a church, hospital and homes were damaged Hotels, homes and a hospital were among a number of buildings damaged. One elderly woman was reportedly killed by debris falling from a church, while another body was found in the rubble of another collapsed building. Civil Protection Department head Angelo Borrelli said some 2,600 people were unable to re-enter their homes while safety checks were being carried out around the island. Extra ferries, from Naples to Ischia, were laid on during the night to bring more rescue workers to the island and allow holidaymakers to leave. Dozens of people are said to have ended their holidays early and Italian media said some tourists were sleeping on benches waiting for boats to arrive. An emergency response team was quickly on the scene, partly because additional numbers were already on the island to fight localised bush fires. Ischia, about an hour's ferry ride from Naples, is no stranger to earthquakes. Its worst came in July 1883 when a 5.8-magnitude quake killed more than 2,000 people.

Trump vows 'fight to win' in Afghanistan,"This video can not be played ""We are not nation building again. We are killing terrorists,"" President Trump said President Donald Trump has said a hasty US withdrawal from Afghanistan would leave a vacuum for terrorists to fill. He said his original instinct was to pull US forces out, but had instead decided to stay and ""fight to win"" to avoid the mistakes made in Iraq. He said he wanted to shift from a time-based approach in Afghanistan to one based on conditions on the ground, adding he would not set deadlines. However, the US president warned it was not a ""blank cheque"" for Afghanistan. ""America will work with the Afghan government, so long as we see commitment and progress,"" he said. The Taliban responded by saying that Afghanistan would become ""another graveyard"" for the US if it did not withdraw its troops. Trump rhetoric versus Afghan reality Taliban letter to Trump urges withdrawal President Trump has committed to stepping up the US military's engagement in Afghanistan, but details were few and far between. He said his new approach would be more pragmatic than idealistic, and would switch from nation building to ""killing terrorists"". But he refused to get drawn on how many extra troops, if any, would be deployed and gave no timeline for ending the US presence in the country. Washington is expected to send up to 4,000 additional troops, but Mr Trump did not comment on this. The president did, however, put pressure on neighbouring Pakistan, warning that the US would no longer tolerate it offering ""safe havens"" to extremists - an accusation swiftly dismissed by a Pakistani army spokesman. Mr Trump's daughter Ivanka, wife Melania and Vice-President Mike Pence watch the speech The president also, for the first time, left the door open for an eventual peace deal with the Taliban, saying: ""Someday, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban in Afghanistan."" However, Mr Trump said there would be an escalation in the battle against groups like al-Qaeda and so-called Islamic State. ""[They] need to know they have nowhere to hide - that no place is beyond the reach of American arms,"" he said. Meanwhile, Mr Trump made it clear he expects his existing allies - singling out India - to support him in his new strategy, and urged them to raise their countries' contributions ""in line with our own"".

His comments follow great upheaval at the White House The spirit of Steve Bannon, an opponent of interventionism, lives on By Secunder Kermani, BBC correspondent in Kabul Even with a few thousand extra US soldiers in Afghanistan - deployment levels would remain far lower than their peak in 2010/11 when there were around 100,000 US personnel in the country. So what is different this time? Firstly, that there is no deadline by which the US will begin to scale operations back. Critics of President Obama's surge say that because he made it clear it was temporary - the Taliban were encouraged to wait the Americans out. President Trump's announcement was watched closely by Afghans in Kabul The second difference is that the US will put more pressure on Pakistan to end ""safe havens"" for the Taliban, according to President Trump. One analyst told me that the key to solving the conflict lies in Islamabad not in Afghanistan. But it is not clear how much leverage the US still has over Pakistan - or how Pakistan will respond to the accusations, given its consistent denial that it operates a ""good terrorist, bad terrorist"" policy. Pakistan has grown increasingly close to China, and has already had millions of dollars of US aid withheld for allegedly not taking enough action against the Taliban-allied Haqqani network. Before his presidency, Mr Trump was not shy about criticising his predecessors on their Afghanistan policy. He previously supported pulling US troops out of the conflict, which began under President George W Bush in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks. Allow Twitter content?

UK seeks Brexit legal disputes deal,"The UK is calling for ""close co-operation"" with the EU to resolve cross-border legal disputes after Brexit. An agreement will be needed on how divorces, commercial disputes and consumer claims that span multiple countries are handled. Currently EU regulations specify how the appropriate court is chosen. Lawyers have warned that clarity will be needed once the UK has left the organisation in March 2019. A guide to the Brexit negotiations UK proposes 'untested' customs model with EU What do lawyers think about Brexit? In the latest in a series of papers setting out its Brexit negotiating plans, the government says disputes need to be resolved ""in a clear and sensible way"", saying it is determined to agree new arrangements. Justice Secretary David Lidington told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more people than ever before were ""living their lives across borders"". A ""good, effective system of EU law"" was currently in operation to decide which law was used, but this would no longer apply in the UK after Brexit, he said. Giving examples of cases that would be affected, he said the agreement would help avoid bureaucracy ""if you are a German wife divorcing a British husband, if you are a British parent whose kids have been taken to Greece, if you are a Swede who's bought from a British company online and think you've been diddled in the deal"". The ""future partnership paper on civil judicial cooperation,external"" follows publications on the customs union, the Irish border and the trading of goods after Brexit. A paper on the key issue of the role of the European Court of Justice is expected on Wednesday. The publications are part of the UK government's attempts to persuade the EU to move the Brexit talks on to the next phase, which will include trade negotiations. Brussels says this cannot happen until sufficient progress has been made on citizens' rights, the UK's ""divorce bill"" and the Northern Ireland border. Labour accused the government of publishing ""bland, non-committal papers as a smokescreen to mask their failure to make any meaningful progress"" on the initial negotiations. The EU has already published its ownposition paper,externalon judicial co-operation. Tuesday's paper from the UK side will promise to ""build on the existing foundation of co-operation and respect for the rule of law"" with the EU. It will propose a replacement for the UK's membership of the EU's judicial co-operation system, which sets out how cross-border disputes are handled. The system decides which country's legal system takes the lead, and means member states respect each other's judgements. Lawyers and MPs have warned that the UK's status as a ""global legal centre"" for commercial contracts could come under threat from rival countries unless clear arrangements are put in place for after Brexit. Pro-EU campaign group Open Britain said the government had made an ""appalling error"" by ruling out a role for the European Court of Justice in regulating disputes.

Osborne urges 'HS3' for northern England,"Former Chancellor George Osborne has urged Theresa May to commit to building high-speed rail lines across the north of England, from Liverpool to Hull. Mr Osborne said ""HS3"", which he had approved in government, would help the prime minister to ""relaunch her premiership"". A ""full-blown attempt to rebalance the economy of Britain"" was needed, he added. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham welcomed Mr Osborne's intervention. What is the Northern Powerhouse? What next for northern England's rail schemes? May backs Osborne's Northern Powerhouse HS3 rail link needs 'kick-starting' But he added northern England would ""speak for itself"" on Wednesday at a transport summit for political and business leaders, in Leeds. And a rail union accused the former chancellor of having presided over ""cash-starved"" services in the north of England during his time in government. Mr Osborne launched the Northern Powerhouse project during his time at the Treasury, promising new funding and powers for cities, including Manchester, Liverpool and Leeds. But, in Tuesday'sFinancial Times,external, he wrote there had since been a ""systematic attempt"" by Mrs May's advisers to ""eradicate all mention of the initiative"". The Northern Powerhouse Partnership, which former Tatton MP Mr Osborne chairs, is launching a campaign for the new-high speed connection, starting with a line across the Pennines. It was given the green light by Mr Osborne in his final Budget in 2016. More than 70,000 people have signed a petition calling for Transport Secretary Chris Grayling to back the rail improvements, also called Northern Powerhouse Rail, and to give transport authorities in northern England the same powers as they have in London. This video can not be played George Osborne tells Today the international markets have made Britain poorer post the Brexit vote Mr Osborne admitted the project ""will not be cheap"", but said it would ""transform"" the economy. Plans for ""HS3"" would follow on from the existing HS2 scheme - a planned line linking London and Birmingham that will split into two branches to Manchester and Leeds. The partnership wants the government to redesign the second phase of HS2 to ""remodel"" four junctions, which could then be used for further connections under their proposals. Mr Osborne said the new railway would ""bring seven million extra people - and three times the number of businesses - within a 90-minute journey time of one of the northern cities"". He said the estimated cost of the Pennines line had been put as high as Â£7bn, but argued the investment could be spread over many years and the transport budget was built to take in such large projects. The next stage of high speed rail should be across the north of England, according to George Osborne ""There is no geographical reason why this cannot happen,"" wrote Mr Osborne. ""The distance between Manchester and Leeds is shorter than the length of the Central line on the London Underground."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said the Northern Powerhouse idea was still ""thriving"". ""Now the idea is not just dependant on the political career of one chancellor or one prime minister, it exists and it breathes and it lives in the north of England."" Mr Osborne was sacked by Mrs May when she took office and has been a frequent critic of her government through the London Evening Standard newspaper, which he now edits. In his FT article, he wrote: ""Far be it from me to offer advice to the prime minister on how to relaunch her premiership this autumn, but making this big commitment to the North, at the Conservative conference in Manchester, would not be a bad place to start.""

Last year, the prime minister vowed to press ahead with the project. Writing in the Yorkshire Post,external, Mrs May promised to ""help the great cities and towns of the North pool their strengths and take on the world"". However, last month the governmentscrapped the planned electrification of railway linesin Wales, the Midlands and the north of England, prompting anger from local authorities and businesses. Days later, Transport Secretary Chris Graylingbacked proposals for Crossrail 2- a north-east to south-west railway in London - sparking anger from political leaders outside the capital. A spokesman for the Department for Transport said the government had already made a commitment to Northern Powerhouse Rail, giving Â£60m to Transport for the North to develop plans, adding: ""[We] look forward to working with them once proposals are submitted later this year."" ""We are also investing billions of pounds across the north of England to better connect communities, build the Northern Powerhouse, and deliver improved journeys right across the region,"" the spokesman said. Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Cash accused Mr Osborne of ""hypocrisy"" over his comments. He said: ""This is a man who was the key player in governments which presided over fragmented, cash-starved and privatised rail across the North and which put profiteering first while passengers were left rammed into clapped-out, lashed-up Pacer trains."" Labour's shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald added: ""Even George Osborne recognises that the Tories' chronic underinvestment in transport is holding the North back.""

He previously supported pulling US troops out of the conflict, which began under President George W Bush in 2001 after the 9/11 attacks. Allow Twitter content?

Early on in his presidential campaign, however,he did acknowledge,externalthat US troops would have to stay in order to avoid the total collapse of the Afghan government. And this long-awaited announcement came after a months-long review, with the president himself acknowledging that his original instinct to pull-out had been reversed after discussions with national security advisers. BBC correspondent Aleem Maqbool in Washington says the people who might object to Mr Trump's strategy are the very ones who voted for him. They were told the president would focus on a policy of ""America First"", but he now says he wants a win in Afghanistan to make all the sacrifice worthwhile, our correspondent adds. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani welcomed the plan, saying: ""The US-Afghan partnership is stronger than ever in overcoming the threat of terrorism that threaten us all."" He said the new strategy would enhance the training of Afghan security forces. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg also praised the move and said the alliance, which has about 12,000 troops in Afghanistan, would not allow the country to become ""a safe haven for terrorists who would attack our own countries"".

Are Turkeyâs schools dropping evolution and teaching jihad?,"The new curriculum will affect five-year-olds, 10-year-olds and teenagers in year nine (file pic) ""In Turkey, education was never secular. There were already obligatory classes on religion. But now, the introduction of the concept of jihad is just horrendous."" From September Turkey will have a new education curriculum and this 38-year-old mother is among many parents who are worried. The changes affect first, fifth- and ninth-grade students, and the main controversy surrounds the exclusion of the theory of evolution from secondary education. ""In classes, nine- and 10-year-old students have been memorising prayers from the Koran. I believe religious education should be given at home, not in schools,"" said the woman, who did not want to be named, due to security concerns. Other controversial changes include shortening the time allocated to studying the life of Turkey's secularist founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, an introduction to the concept of jihad and more classes on religion. Less time will be spent on the life of Ataturk, the founder of modern Turkey The coup attempt that took place last year also features prominently in the proposed curriculum. The secular opposition in Turkey says President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and the governing AK party are trying to move the country away from its founding values, and make society more Islamic and conservative. Mr Erdogan has repeatedly expressed his ambition to raise pious generations. Education Minister Ismet Yilmaz told the BBC that they had excluded only ""unnecessary, archaic and repetitive subjects"" from the curriculum and that it was not fair to have a debate over a few issues, when more than 100,000 changes had been made. Mr Yilmaz denied that evolution theory was being completely omitted from secondary education. ""We are not against evolution. If science says something, it is impossible to resist it. Also, the subjects on inheritance, mutation, modification and adaptation are still present in the curriculum. These are all within the theory of evolution,"" Mr Yilmaz argued. ""We only say this: Let's not teach this subject at this level, but delay it to undergraduate study,"" he added. Passions flare as Turkey excludes evolution from textbooks Charles Darwin: Evolution and the story of our species Evolution v Creationism in modern-day faith But critics have argued that the initial chapter on the origins of man has been excluded from the curriculum. Excluding that, but retaining further concepts from the evolution theory, is unhelpful, they say. ""Students need to understand the theory of evolution before they can make sense of concepts such as mutation or adaptation. If you do not teach them what evolution is, but talk to them about these subjects, they will be inclined to just memorise, without learning,"" said Aysel Madra from the non-profit think tank Education Reform Initiative. Head of Egitim-Is, one of the biggest teachers' unions in Turkey, says the most crucial chapter in the theory of evolution has been dropped. ""They want to teach about the origins of man as it is written in religious texts, as if we all descended from Adam and Eve,"" Orhan Yildirim said. He also criticised the introduction of the concept of jihad in secondary school education. ""Ask anyone coming out of a mosque today what he understands by the word jihad - 99% would say that they see jihad as the main reason for war in the Middle East. We will not let the government put a spin on the word and normalise the concept of jihad,"" he said. According to the dictionary of the Institute of Turkish Language, jihad is an Arabic word meaning ""a religious war"". Meaning of jihad What is jihadism? Erdogan's Turkey Education Minister Ismet Yilmaz argued that the word was misinterpreted and what it actually meant was to serve the community, to increase welfare, to secure peace and understanding of one another. The education ministry says the curriculum was changed through consultation with more than 180,000 people, who shared their comments on the draft. But the opposition teachers' unions say they were not consulted, and that preparation of the draft curriculum was not transparent. Orhan Yildirim argued the changes to the curriculum were ideological. ""This curriculum is a coup d'etat targeting education in Turkey. You don't have to have guns to make a coup. If you strike a country's education as such, then it will be impossible for it to catch up with prosperous nations,"" he said.
