EA Sports to stop making Fifa video game,"Video games publisher Electronic Arts says it is going to stop making Fifa branded football titles. It is one of the most profitable brands in gaming history, but the cost of the licence was one reason why the decision was made to ditch the partnership. EA will continue to make football video games, but from 2023 they will come under a new banner, EA Sports FC. Fifa says it plans to release its own rival games, saying: ""The Fifa name is the only global, original title."" EA Sports made the first Fifa game in 1993 and has been in charge of the franchise ever since. While the gameplay mechanics and core modes of play will be similar to what players have come to expect in recent years, this change will likely see the title offer a broader range of other experiences, beyond just the ability to play. Speaking to the BBC, David Jackson, vice president at EA Sports, explained that the studio thinks it's time to move in a different direction in order to build a ""brand for the future"". Although the details of those experiences are vague at the moment, it's fair to assume that being able to watch real-life matches, experienceFortnite style live in-game eventsand have access to a broader range of branded in-game items are the kind of things EA would like to be able to offer. For more on this story listen to BBC Sounds podcast Press X to Continue, EA say that 19,000 athletes and their likenesses will be included in EA Sports FC Jackson says: ""The world of football and the world of entertainment are changing, and they clash within our product. ""In the future our players will demand of us the ability to be more expansive in that offering. At the moment, we engage in play as a primary form of interactive experience. Soon, watching and creating content are going to be equally as important for fans. ""Under the licensing conventions that we had agreed with Fifa 10 years ago, there were some restrictions that weren't going to allow us to be able to build those experiences for players."" The Fifa franchise has been so successful in part down to detailed licensing agreements, that allowed for accurate representations of team kits, players faces and stadia to be seen on screen. Players have been able to play as Premier League teams like Liverpool for years whereas competing games like Pro Evolution Soccer, offered fictional teams like Merseyside Red. EA say they will continue to offer real-world experiences, having signed up 19,000 athletes, 700 teams, 100 stadiums and over 30 leagues for future games. They include the Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga and Uefa. However, the move means that games released to tie-in with the World Cup, such as Fifa: Road to World Cup 98, will no longer be made by EA. There will be one final Fifa release, with this year's edition - Fifa 23 - on sale this autumn as usual. EA Sports FC will hit the shelves in late 2023. Fifa International Soccer was the first game in franchise history - released in 1993 EA is one of the games companies that has facedfan backlash over its approach to in-game purchases.No doubt some of the questions about their new franchise will surround the financial model and plans for monetisation, which are yet to be revealed. The move is a gamble for EA, whose fortunes have been closely tied with Fifa for decades, and Jackson accepts that, saying: ""It's a big moment for the organisation. Interactive football experiences have been central to what has made EA Sports successful over the last 30 years."" Making sure the majority of the millions of current Fifa players switch to the new title will be vital for the company to be able to maintain important licensing partnerships in the future. They are an essential part of its success. Electronic Arts struck the last licensing deal with Fifa in 2013 and it has been reported thatfootball's governing body had put the price of the licence,externalup significantly - this time to more than $1billion dollars per four-year world cup cycle. When asked if moving away from Fifa was purely a financial decision, Jackson said ""it wasn't ultimately down to money"" but accepted it did play a crucial role in the decision-making process. ""Money plays a critical role in most negotiations, but the reason we are doing this is to create the very best experiences we can for both players and partners. As part of that you consider whether or not your investment in one place is better or worse than an investment in another. ""On balance, over time, we felt that our investments were better suited in spaces that were most important to players, like the different experiences we can now build in the game. For our partners, it's the way we can welcome and engage them into a platform that talks to 150 million young football fans around the world."" The move means that games released to tie-in with the World Cup, like this one from 1998, will no longer be made by EA In a longstatement on its website,,externalFifa says it will launch new football video games developed with a range of third-party studios and publishers, providing more choice for football and gaming fans in the lead-up to the World Cup in Qatar and beyond. As well as launching new games during 2022 and 2023, Fifa says it is working with leading game publishers, media companies and investors to develop of a major new Fifa simulation game title in 2024. Gianni Infantino, the President of Fifa says in the statement:""I can assure you that the only authentic, real game that has the Fifa name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans."" ""The constant is the Fifa name and it will remain forever and remain the best."" EA Sports seem confident that their approach is right: ""Change is always going to be concerning for people at first,"" says David Jackson. ""In terms of things that they'll miss, players will notice only two things: The name and a World Cup piece of content every four years. Outside of that, very little will change about the things they know, and love about the current Fifa products. ""Probably the easiest thing that we could have done would have been to maintain the status quo. Fifa has been an incredibly successful game over time, but there are moments when you need to consider what the future looks like and we feel like building our own brand is the best for us.""

Rise in reports of children abusing other children,"The NSPCC made almost 600 referrals to external agencies, including the police and social services The number of calls to a children's helpline about harmful sexual behaviour between young people increased by 29% over the last year. The NSPCC received 2,365 calls and staff made almost 600 referrals to external agencies, including the police and social services. The charity says the relationship and sex education curriculum in schools needs to be properly resourced. The Department for Education says it is producing new guidance this year. It says it will help schools teach topics such as sexual abuse and harassment with confidence. The NSPCC says the rise in reporting is partly down to the thousands of testimonies that were posted on the websiteEveryone's Invitedlast year from young people and children as young as nine, which highlighted the issue. This prompted anOfsted review,externalwhich found that sexual harassment has become ""normalised"" among school-age children. The watchdog warned that students often do not see the point of reporting abuse. Sexual violence typically occurred in unsupervised spaces outside of school, like parties or parks. Girls asked for nudes by 11 boys a night - Ofsted Schools abuse helpline and review launched BBC Bitesize: Let's talk about child mental health Jasmine - not her real name - was 16 when she began a relationship with a boy she met online. She told the BBC that from the beginning, there was a lot of controlling and manipulative behaviour, and she was expected to exchange intimate photographs and videos. When they broke up, he shared them online without her consent. ""When it was happening, I felt very alone, there was a lack of information. I didn't know it was illegal until my friend suggested it was. ""I felt like a 'one in a million' person, that nobody had ever experienced this. I didn't know where to go or who to speak to."" The boy was arrested but Jasmine dropped the charges as she did not feel she had the support to go through a court case. She dropped out of university as a result, but is now in her ""dream job"" after getting the help she needed. ""It took me ages to process what had actually happened. I want to help other people understand that it happens and that you shouldn't feel embarrassed or scared to speak to someone."" The NSPCC said calls to its helpline showed young people had being exposed to sexual name-calling, unwanted sexual touching and sharing nude images without consent, along with serious sexual assault and rape. One father rang looking for advice after his 12-year-old son was asked by his friend to see his private parts. Another called about a girl who was regularly groped by a group of boys in school, including touching her breasts, but no action was taken by teachers. The NSPCC says too many teachers still lack confidence to deliver the relationships and sex education (RSE) curriculum. Sir Peter Wanless, the NSPCC's chief executive, said the conversation sparked by the Everyone's Invited testimonies last year was ""a watershed moment, as an unprecedented number of young people came forward to challenge unacceptable peer-on-peer sexual abuse"". ""It is vital for the government to urgently ensure each and every school has the support to deliver a high-quality curriculum,"" he added. A DfE spokesperson told us it had updated safeguarding guidance and is increasing resources for teachers, following last year's Ofsted review. ""Earlier this year we partnered with charities to launch a new harmful sexual behaviour support service, which is further helping teachers and safeguarding professionals to tackle instances of abuse,"" the spokesperson said.

Voyeur nurse who secretly filmed patients jailed,"Grayson preyed on his unconscious victims while in hospital, a court heard A nurse ""fixated by sex"" who filmed up the gowns of unconscious hospital patients has been jailed for 12 years. Paul Grayson videoed four women as they recovered from surgery at Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital. The 51-year-old also recorded four female nurses and a support worker using the toilet at the hospital. Jailing Grayson, who admitted 23 offences, Judge Jeremy Richardson QC said he had ""brought shame on an honourable profession"". Grayson was also told he would be subject to an extended licence period of four years when he is eventually released. Passing sentence at Sheffield Crown Court, Judge Richardson said he had ""betrayed every ounce of trust reposed in you"". ""You have already been stripped of your status as a nurse by your professional body. So you should be,"" he added. Referring to a pre-sentence report, Judge Richardson said Grayson had been described as a ""dangerous offender"" who was ""fixated by sex"" and who satisfied that fixation by committing the crimes. Many of the offences took place at Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital The nurse, who had more than 25 years' experience, also filmed two other young women not connected to the hospital with hidden cameras. His crimes came to light after one victim launched an investigation into Grayson and uncovered computer files documenting the offences. She previously told the court she had been ""torn into pieces"" as a result of his ""sick and disgusting perversions"". Grayson was arrested in December 2020 and was immediately suspended from work, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals previously said in a statement. Video showed Grayson, wearing his scrubs and with a name badge, installing the hidden cameras, South Yorkshire Police said. One of the filmed patients has never been identified, while other women in the toilet footage remain unknown. Grayson, of Woodstock Road, Sheffield, pleaded guilty to charges including: 14 charges of voyeurism three charges of sexual assaults one charge of upskirting one charge of taking indecent images of a child one charge of installing recording equipment for the purposes of sexual gratification three charges of possessing indecent images of children Prof Chris Morley, chief nurse at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said what Grayson did was ""truly despicable"" and ""unforgivable"". ""While this was an incredibly rare occurrence, we never want it to happen to anyone else and as a result we are examining all of the information now available to determine if there are any further measures, we can take to limit the opportunity for someone to do this in the future,"" he added. Det Sgt Sarah Dolby, of South Yorkshire Police, said instead of taking care of the unconscious women who were the victims of his filming, Grayson instead committed ""utterly horrendous acts"". She added: ""In interview, Grayson admitted having an insatiable addiction to voyeurism and pornography. I have no doubt had he not been caught, his offending would have continued.""

The Pentagon believes that Russia has used about 10 to 12 of its hypersonic weapons since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a senior defence official. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the official said the US does not have ""a perfect count"" of the deployment of the weapon. Russia claims the Kinzhal missile - which can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h - was first fired at a target in Ukraine in March. More recently, Ukrainian officials have claimed that the weapon was fired at targets in Odesa over the weekend. The US official, however, said that he doesn't ""have anything to indicate"" that they were used against targets in the city. Learn more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

Fuel supplies in Europe face possible disruption after Ukraine vowed to suspend an important route for Russian gas. Operators of the Ukrainian gas system said they would switch off the Sokhranivka route from 07:00 local time on Wednesday. The route accounts for a third of Russia's supply to Europe. They claim to be unable to operate a gas station through the Luhansk region due to Russian occupation, and so plan to switch to an entry point in Ukrainian-held territory. But Russian state-owned gas firm Gazprom said it was not feasible to make such a switch - and questioned the Ukrainian justification. Ukraine remains a major supply route for Russian gas to Europe - despite the war. Volodymyr Zelensky and Leonid Kravchuk at a meeting in Ukraine's parliament 2020 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's former leader who died at 88 on Tuesday, as a man who ""always stayed with Ukraine"".

""As a child, he survived World War Two, survived the occupation,"" Zelensky said. ""[He] knew what freedom costs"". ""With all his heart he wanted peace for Ukraine,"" Zelensky added.

A photograph of Vladimir Putin on a cross depicting his tomb in Dnipro The Ukrainian city of Dnipro has emerged as a crucial hub for the Ukrainian military and humanitarian operations as the war in Ukraine's east grinds on. After repeated airstrikes that struck the city in March and early April, an uneasy calm has fallen over Dnipro, the fourth largest city in Ukraine. During a recent visit, the author David Patrikarakosdescribed a,externalcity largely defended by volunteer militias that lie between ""Ukraineâs two worlds: West and East; Europe and Russia."" ""Its geographical location makes it vital to the country's war effort,"" he wrote. ""Dniproâs central location makes it the countryâs most important logistical hub.""

Welcome to our latest coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you're just joining us - or are in need of a recap - here are some of the latest headlines. Millions of tonnes cannot be exported from Ukraine due to a Russian blockade The war in Ukraine has made Syria's problems even worse than before, the UN's high commissioner for refugees has told the BBC. Speaking to the World Service's Newshour programme, Filippo Grandi said the humanitarian situation inside Syria had become ""quite catastrophic"". Food insecurity caused by the Ukraine crisis has had a ""terrible impact"" on Syria and its neighbours, he added. Russia's blockade along the Black Sea coast has meant millions of tonnes of grain cannot be sent overseas. Ukraine is one of the world's top exporters of wheat. Grandi also acknowledged that there could be a double-standard at work in Europe's treatment of refugees. He said it was ""unacceptable, racist and discriminatory"" that Ukrainians were sometimes seen as ""real"" refugees while others - including those from the Middle East - were not. Leonid Kravchuk and Vitaly Klitschko in March 2021 The first president of the modern state of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, has passed away at 88, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko. On his Telegram channel, Klitschko said that Kravchuk was a man who embodied ""talent, strong character and knowledge"". Kravchuk, who was formerly chairman of Ukraine's rada - or parliament - and the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR during the waning days of the Soviet Union, became president in December 1991 and remained in office until July 1994. A second campaign to be president ended with an electoral loss to his former prime minister, Leonid Kuchma. Among his most consequential decisions was signing the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, pledging to give up the nuclear arsenal Ukraine was left with after the Soviet Union's collapse. In his post, Klitschko said that Kravchuk's legacy was particularly important at a time when Ukraine is fighting Russia. ""We will preserve the sovereignty and will that we got more than 30 years ago,"" Klitschko wrote. ""We will not retreat."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In the US, two of the nationâs senior intelligence officials, National Intelligence Director Avril Haines and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Scott Berrier, have painted a sobering picture of the war in Ukraine. The two officials spoke before the Senate armed services committee about global threats to the US on Tuesday, and they highlighted their concerns about Russia. âWe assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine,â said Haines. âHe is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse.â Berrier explained that the two enemies, the Russians and the Ukrainians, had reached an impasse. Said Berrier: âThe Russians arenât winning, and the Ukrainians arenât winning, and weâre at a bit of a stalemate.â Their presentations were significant because of the situation they described in Ukraine and also because parts of the hearing were open to the public. Intelligence officials have argued in the past that these hearings should be held behind closed doors. But their presentation provides one of the only chances for the public to hear directly from them about security issues. Their assessment of the war is particularly important as people in the US evaluate the ongoing conflict, the role of the US and the impact of the war on gas prices and other aspects of everyday life. A destroyed Russian tank pictured on 6 May Russian forces are several weeks behind where Vladimir Putin expected them to be after shifting the focus of military operations to Ukraine's eastern Donbas, according to a senior US defence official. Speaking in a briefing call with reporters on Tuesday, the official said that Putin is ""easily two weeks, or maybe even more, behind where he wanted to be in the east"". At the end of April, a US defence official said that Russia was ""several days"" behind schedule. Additionally on Tuesday, the official noted that sanctions are making it more difficult to replenish stocks of guided munitions. The official said that since the sinking of the Moskva in the Black Sea, Russian naval vessels have stayed ""well south"" of the port city of Odesa. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko pictured in an undisclosed location in Ukraine The city council of Mariupol, one of Ukraine's most attacked cities, has collected over 800 reports of war crimes from residents who have managed to flee the besieged city. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko told Media Center Ukraine that all of the information regarding the alleged war crimes has been passed on to the region's prosecutor's office. The mayor said residents provided testimonies of key attacks in the city, including ""the maternity ward of Mariupol destroyed by the enemy plane, and the Drama Theatre, where a lot of women and children died, and hospital 1, where Mariupol residents with severe injuries burnt alive"". All of the evidence will be part of a wider criminal proceeding into the genocide of Mariupol residents, he said. ""There are numerous examples of war crimes of Russian occupation army led by their main criminal, Putin,"" the mayor added.

Cherkasy Tyshky, Ruski Tyshky, Rubizhne and Bayrak were all snatched back from Russia, said the latest update from the armed forces. Russia was continuing to intensify its offensive in Ukraine's east, the update said. The greatest activity was observed in the directions ofSlobozhanskeandDonetsk. Russian troops were reportedly replenishing ammunition and logistics while a battle forIzyumrages on. But their advances in multiple other areas were said to be proving unsuccessful. The update also confirmed that Russian efforts inMariupolwere focused on assaulting the Azovstal metal works, where more than 1,000 Ukrainian fighters are thought to be sheltering. It was not possible for the BBC to independently confirm the armed forces' claims. The devastated Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's southern city Mariupol has been surrounded and bombarded for weeks. Russian forces backed by tanks are currently conducting ""storming operations"" at Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, according to Ukraine's defence ministry. The ""Azov - Mariupol"" channel on messaging app Telegram has posted what appears to be photos of the wounded soldiers holding out in the plant. ""The whole civilised world must see the conditions in which the wounded, crippled defenders of Mariupol are and act!"", says a Telegram message from the fighters posted alongside the photos. There are more than 1,000 troops trapped in the plant, including hundreds who are injured, the Ukrainian deputy PM says. In the Telegram message the fighters appeal to the UN and the Red Cross to ""show their humanity"" and rescue the wounded, who are ""no longer combatants"". ""We demand the immediate evacuation of the wounded servicemen to the territories controlled by Ukraine,"" the fighters have said. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has thanked UN members for electing his country to the UN Human Rights Council, replacing Russia - which was suspended from the body in April over its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Lipavsky expressed his gratitude at the trust placed in the Czech Republic and said his country would immediately get to work, as part of Thursday's session on human rights abuses caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. The foreign minister said human rights remained a priority for both his party and the Czech government, which he said was returning to the legacy of Vaclav Havel. ""We belong on the Human Rights Council. Russia does not,"" he told Czech news server Novinky.cz The Czech Republic will serve out the remainder of Russia's three-year term on the council. The city's mayor has confirmed that the bodies of 44 civilians were pulled from the rubble The bodies of 44 civilians have been found in the rubble of a collapsed building in the Ukrainian city of Izyum, as the battle for control of the area rages. The five-storey building collapsed in March as residents hid in the basement from Russian shelling. But rescuers have only just been able to reach the building, one local official told the BBC. And there are fears the death toll could rise further, as another building in the same street was also targeted. Read more on this story here. It's approaching 19:00 in Kyiv. Here's a quick roundup of the latest events in Ukraine. US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines Vladimir Putin is preparing for a long war in Ukraine, the US is warning, and a Russian victory in the eastern region of Donbas might not end its attack. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines tells a Senate hearing the next few months could see Russian actions escalate and become more unpredictable. ""The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means,"" Haines says. She warns Russia could seek a land bridge to the breakaway Moldovan territory of Transnistria and says it's likely President Putin will seek to impose martial law in Russia. Haines says Putin is counting on the resolve of the US and of Ukraine's European allies to
weaken over time. But she thinks the Kremlin will only authorise the use of nuclear weapons if Putin perceives an ""existential threat"" to Russia. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Warning millions could struggle to pay bills,"Faith Angwet told the BBC there was no support to help her pay rising food and energy bills Single mum Faith Angwet struggled to make ends meet during the pandemic but says the cost of living crisis has hit her even harder. ""I was starting to feel like I was getting to a good place but now the price of everything has gone up it has pushed me right back,"" she said. Ms Angwet is one of an estimated 1.5m UK households that will struggle to pay food and energy bills in the next year. That's according to research which also predicts a UK recession in 2022. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has also warned that a combination of rising prices andmeasures announced in the Chancellor's Spring Statement- such as the decision not to scrap a planned rise in National Insurance tax - are hitting the poorest households hardest. Ms Angwet, 36, from Southwark in south London, is a single mother-of-two who has been unemployed since having her daughter two years ago. ""In the pandemic if you couldn't afford something you could shop around or buy in bulk. But now you can't afford it everywhere. And if I am able to buy in bulk, if the kids see it they want to eat it now. So I find myself hiding things from them so I can bring it out another day like magic."" Faith Angwet said plans to take her children to the beach would have to be pushed back due to rising costs Things have got so bad that Ms Angwet sometimes forgoes her prescription for blood pressure medication so she can afford to buy formula and nappies for her daughter. As she is unemployed, she cannot get any other form of benefit or financial help from the government so has turned to food banks for support. She said her five-year-old son's free school meals were a ""huge help"" and that she was grateful for nappies and clothes from Little Village baby bank. ""It's got to the point that I turned to a payday loan, but they want you to borrow more than you need. We can't always go to the food bank, it's a vicious cycle,"" she said. Why are prices rising so quickly? Warning of economic downturn as interest rates rise Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 30-year high, as the Ukraine war drives up fuel and energy prices. The Bank of England has warned inflation might reach 10% within months. The think tank urged the government to raise Universal Credit by Â£25 per week between May and October, which would cost around Â£1.35bn, and give Â£250 each to 11.3 million lower income households. ""Without this targeted support we expect a further increase in extreme poverty,"" the think tank said, with about a quarter of a million households sliding into extreme poverty, taking the number to about a million. About half a million households would ""face the choice between eating and heating"" without these payments, it said, adding that the chancellor had a reported Â£20bn of ""headroom"" for government spending that could be used to cushion the shock to income. The think tank predicted that inflation would average 7.8% in 2022 and will remain above 3% until 2024 - above the Bank of England's 2% target. At the same time, economic growth is set to slow. While NIESR forecast that UK economic growth in 2022 would increase by 3.5% on average, it predicted a fall in the final two quarters of the year. This would push the UK into a recession, which is two consecutive quarters of economic decline. Meanwhile, government policies are set to leave households with even less disposable income, according to NIESR. It forecasts household income when adjusted for inflation will fall by 2.4% in 2022, along with a small rise in unemployment next year. Tony Danker, director general of the CBI, which represents big businesses, told the BBC's Today programme that companies were suffering too. He said inflation, higher energy prices, labour shortages and the war in Ukraine had made firms ""pause before investing"", and that this was stopping them ""creating jobs and paying good wages"". He said the government needed to create ""reasons to invest"" such as subsidising the shift to clean energy or cutting business rates for shops. ""If we wait... the economy will end up in more trouble,"" he added. ""Get firms investing now because that will stop us facing dire consequences later on."" Fears as energy hike hits disabled families Money tips: How to cut spending as energy bills rise Professor Stephen Millard, NIESR's deputy director for macroeconomics, said: ""Although the war in Ukraine is fundamentally a human tragedy, it has resulted in another supply shock for the UK economy: pushing down growth and pushing up on inflation."" He added: ""We need fiscal policy to loosen and monetary policy to tighten if the UK economy is going to sail safely through these treacherous seas."" A Treasury spokesperson said the country has had a ""strong economic recovery"" from the pandemic but acknowledged that these are ""anxious times"", and said the government is taking action to support households. ""This includes a tax cut of over Â£330 a year for the typical employee, lowering the Universal Credit taper rate to help people keep more of the money they earn, and providing millions of households with up to Â£350 each to help with rising energy bills,"" the spokesperson said. ""Public debt is at the highest levels since the 1960s and rising inflation is pushing up our debt interest costs, which means we must manage public finances sustainably to avoid saddling future generations with further debt."" Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the government should bring in an emergency budget ""urgently"", adding: ""With a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits we can cut household bills by up to Â£600 and support businesses through the cost of living storm."" It comes as NIESR separately forecast that global economic growth would be 1% lower, or about $1.5tn, at the end of 2022, due to the Ukraine war.

"We can't spend our way out of trouble, says PM","This video can not be played Queen's speech: Five traditions that changed The government has promised to tackle sharp rises in the cost of living by boosting the economy, as it set out its plans in the Queen's Speech. But Boris Johnson warned that the government could not ""shield everyone"" from the effect of global inflation. Labour has called for an emergency budget to address the cost of living and a windfall tax on energy companies to fund more support for households. This year's Queen's Speech contained 38 bills and draft bills. In the speech, delivered by Prince Charles in the Queen's absence, the government set out the new laws it plans to bring in over the coming year. Priorities included energy security, carbon emissions and post-Brexit economic arrangements - but the opposition parties, and some Tories, said it should have contained more on living costs. Queen's Speech at-a-glance Backlash as workers' rights bill sidelined Government tries again to ban 'guerrilla' protests TheBank of England is warning,externalthat inflation could hit around 10% later this year. The three main opposition parties are all demanding an emergency Budget, with tax cuts and benefit rises to help struggling households. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the legislative agenda set out in the Queen's Speech was ""bereft of ideas"" and ""without a guiding principle or a road map for delivery"". Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said millions of households would be ""bitterly disappointed"" with the government plans. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused ministers of a ""deafening silence"" over potential rises in poverty. In response, Mr Johnson argued wider economic reforms would help households, telling MPs: ""However great our compassion and commitment, we cannot simply spend our way out of problems. ""We need to grow our economy out of these problems by creating hundreds of thousands of high-waged, high-skilled jobs across the country."" He also hinted at an announcement on the cost of living in the coming days, although Downing Street said the PM was referring to the wider work being done in departments to address the pressures households face. Prince William was among the senior royals at the Palace of Westminster The political parties will spend several days debating the contents of the Queen's Speech. It includes seven bills that ministers say will help deliver the benefits of Brexit, while a Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill is expected to change planning rules in England. The government said its Energy Security Bill would ""accelerate our transition to more secure, more affordable and cleaner homegrown energy supplies"". Meanwhile, a Public Order Bill would create a criminal offence, with a maximum sentence of 12 months, of ""interfering with key national infrastructure"" such as airports, railways and printing presses. How will the Police and Crime Bill change protests? What is levelling up and how is it going? The Liberal Democrats called the proposed changes ""dangerous and draconian"", but Home Secretary Priti Patel argued they were needed to deal with a ""self-indulgent minority who seem to revel in causing mayhem and misery"". The speech also pledged support for Ukraine and to reduce regional inequality, but trade unions and charities complained about thelack of an Employment Billaimed at improving workers' rights.

Queen's Speech at-a-glance,"Prince Charles stood in for the Queen, who missed the ceremony for the first time since 1963 Prince Charles has outlined the government's priorities for the year ahead, as he delivered the Queen's Speech. He stood in for the Queen at the ceremony to officially reopen Parliament, after she dropped out due to health issues. The speech highlighted some of the 38 laws that ministers intend to pass in the coming year.

Government drops planning reforms after Tory angerFresh proposals to change planning laws will be published in the new Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill.,"This video can not be played Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove casts doubt on 300,000 homes target Neighbours could be allowed to vote on whether planning permission should be given for developments - such as house extensions - on their street. The ""street votes"" would be an alternative to traditional forms of planning permission. It comes as Michael Gove ditched most of the government's reforms of the planning system in England. Downing Street insisted it was still committed to building 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s. Mr Gove earlier told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more homes were needed. But, he added, hitting a ""statistical target"" was not the only measure of success, particularly ""if the homes that are built are shoddy, in the wrong place, don't have the infrastructure required, and are not contributing to beautiful communities"". Is the government meeting its new-homes target? The 300,000 target was a key Conservative pledge at the 2019 general election. Mr Gove's predecessor as Communities Secretary, Robert Jenrick, aimed to meet it by forcing councils to accept new housing developments in designated areas. But the plans sparked a significant Tory backlash,including from former Prime Minister Theresa May, who called them ""ill-conceived"". Some in the party said the policy had contributed to by-election losses in former Conservative heartlands - includingChesham and Amersham- fears that would only have been exacerbated bylast week's local elections results. Now Mr Jenrick's proposals will be dropped in favour of a new Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill,published on Wednesday,external. Other new policies will include: Design codes to let local communities set rules about the layout of new developments and materials which could be used A new infrastructure levy - to be determined locally - to increase funds for projects such as schools, hospitals and roads, by basing the sum on the value of the property when it is sold, rather than when it gets planning permission Digitising the planning system, making plans more accessible online rather than relying on notices on lampposts Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""Under the Conservatives housing has become less affordable, spending on rent has sky-rocketed, and homeownership has gone down."" She said the party could ""no longer claim to be the party of homeownership"". Planning reforms paused amid Tory MP anger Why do ministers face a backlash on planning rules? Archaeologists dig in over planning reforms row Michael Gove was confronted by fury inside his own party over planning reforms put forward by his predecessor. So he's junked them. Instead, there's a set of measures designed to give people more say over development in their areas. Mr Gove has suggested communities will be more open to new housing if it's not imposed on them - if it's ""beautiful"" and ""democratic"". But having ditched more radical reforms, the government may well struggle to meet its own target for building new homes. All the while, there are tens of thousands of people on housing waiting lists, families living in unsuitable or temporary accommodation, and many others unable to afford to get on the property ladder. There are other measures in the Queen's Speech designed to improve the housing market - giving renters more protection and suggestions of a clampdown on empty second homes. It's a complex problem of which the planning system is only one part. But the reality is that the country is facing a housing crisis, and so far successive governments have failed to find a solution. In Boris Johnson's first year in office, only 243,000 new homes were supplied,according to the House of Commons Library,external- falling to 216,000 in 2020/21, partly because of the disruption caused by the pandemic. Research conducted by the BBC in 2020found the difference between the housing stock in England and the number of homes needed was more than one million. Robert Jenrick told MPs the government was likely to continue missing its target by a ""country mile"" without more action. The Conservatives pledged to build 300,000 homes a year in England by the mid-2020s as part of its 2019 manifesto Mr Gove said communities had been ""understandably resistant"" to new developments when factors like the appearance of the buildings and the supporting infrastructure - like GP surgeries and schools - were not included in the plans. But he believed more people would be in favour of new housing under his proposals, adding: ""It shouldn't be a case that we impose. It is important that even as we seek to improve housing supply, we also seek to build communities that people love and are proud of."" Labour MP Clive Betts - who chairs the housing select committee - called the ""street vote"" plan a gimmick, telling the BBC it was not possible for communities to ""decide absolutely everything"" about urban planning in their area. He told the BBC the process of building new housing should be simplified, with local people involved in decisions about where homes might be placed much earlier than at the planning permission stage. Before proposals can be put to a local vote, they will be examined against a set of nationally prescribed development rules, which are to be agreed in due course, the government said. Development will go ahead only if the proposal is endorsed by a ""supermajority"" of residents in a referendum. The precise thresholds for approval would be set out in regulations in due course, the government added. Around 340,000 new homes are needed in England each year - 145,000 of them should be affordable, research for the National Housing Federation in 2019 said In 2020, the Affordable Housing Commission found that more than half of 18 to 24 year-olds still lived with family members; 18% continuing to do so when aged 25 to 34 From 2010 to 2020, more than 464,000 affordable homes were built; 114,000 of these were social homes (housing provided for people on low incomes or with particular needs) In England, an average house cost Â£292,000 (March 2022, ONS) The latest official figure for median monthly rent (for 2021) was Â£755, the highest ever recorded Are you struggling to get on the housing ladder?

EA Sports to stop making Fifa video gameElectronic Arts will instead produce new football games under the banner EA Sports FC.Entertainment & Arts,"Video games publisher Electronic Arts says it is going to stop making Fifa branded football titles. It is one of the most profitable brands in gaming history, but the cost of the licence was one reason why the decision was made to ditch the partnership. EA will continue to make football video games, but from 2023 they will come under a new banner, EA Sports FC. Fifa says it plans to release its own rival games, saying: ""The Fifa name is the only global, original title."" EA Sports made the first Fifa game in 1993 and has been in charge of the franchise ever since. While the gameplay mechanics and core modes of play will be similar to what players have come to expect in recent years, this change will likely see the title offer a broader range of other experiences, beyond just the ability to play. Speaking to the BBC, David Jackson, vice president at EA Sports, explained that the studio thinks it's time to move in a different direction in order to build a ""brand for the future"". Although the details of those experiences are vague at the moment, it's fair to assume that being able to watch real-life matches, experienceFortnite style live in-game eventsand have access to a broader range of branded in-game items are the kind of things EA would like to be able to offer. For more on this story listen to BBC Sounds podcast Press X to Continue, EA say that 19,000 athletes and their likenesses will be included in EA Sports FC Jackson says: ""The world of football and the world of entertainment are changing, and they clash within our product. ""In the future our players will demand of us the ability to be more expansive in that offering. At the moment, we engage in play as a primary form of interactive experience. Soon, watching and creating content are going to be equally as important for fans. ""Under the licensing conventions that we had agreed with Fifa 10 years ago, there were some restrictions that weren't going to allow us to be able to build those experiences for players."" The Fifa franchise has been so successful in part down to detailed licensing agreements, that allowed for accurate representations of team kits, players faces and stadia to be seen on screen. Players have been able to play as Premier League teams like Liverpool for years whereas competing games like Pro Evolution Soccer, offered fictional teams like Merseyside Red. EA say they will continue to offer real-world experiences, having signed up 19,000 athletes, 700 teams, 100 stadiums and over 30 leagues for future games. They include the Premier League, Bundesliga, La Liga and Uefa. However, the move means that games released to tie-in with the World Cup, such as Fifa: Road to World Cup 98, will no longer be made by EA. There will be one final Fifa release, with this year's edition - Fifa 23 - on sale this autumn as usual. EA Sports FC will hit the shelves in late 2023. Fifa International Soccer was the first game in franchise history - released in 1993 EA is one of the games companies that has facedfan backlash over its approach to in-game purchases.No doubt some of the questions about their new franchise will surround the financial model and plans for monetisation, which are yet to be revealed. The move is a gamble for EA, whose fortunes have been closely tied with Fifa for decades, and Jackson accepts that, saying: ""It's a big moment for the organisation. Interactive football experiences have been central to what has made EA Sports successful over the last 30 years."" Making sure the majority of the millions of current Fifa players switch to the new title will be vital for the company to be able to maintain important licensing partnerships in the future. They are an essential part of its success. Electronic Arts struck the last licensing deal with Fifa in 2013 and it has been reported thatfootball's governing body had put the price of the licence,externalup significantly - this time to more than $1billion dollars per four-year world cup cycle. When asked if moving away from Fifa was purely a financial decision, Jackson said ""it wasn't ultimately down to money"" but accepted it did play a crucial role in the decision-making process. ""Money plays a critical role in most negotiations, but the reason we are doing this is to create the very best experiences we can for both players and partners. As part of that you consider whether or not your investment in one place is better or worse than an investment in another. ""On balance, over time, we felt that our investments were better suited in spaces that were most important to players, like the different experiences we can now build in the game. For our partners, it's the way we can welcome and engage them into a platform that talks to 150 million young football fans around the world."" The move means that games released to tie-in with the World Cup, like this one from 1998, will no longer be made by EA In a longstatement on its website,,externalFifa says it will launch new football video games developed with a range of third-party studios and publishers, providing more choice for football and gaming fans in the lead-up to the World Cup in Qatar and beyond. As well as launching new games during 2022 and 2023, Fifa says it is working with leading game publishers, media companies and investors to develop of a major new Fifa simulation game title in 2024. Gianni Infantino, the President of Fifa says in the statement:""I can assure you that the only authentic, real game that has the Fifa name will be the best one available for gamers and football fans."" ""The constant is the Fifa name and it will remain forever and remain the best."" EA Sports seem confident that their approach is right: ""Change is always going to be concerning for people at first,"" says David Jackson. ""In terms of things that they'll miss, players will notice only two things: The name and a World Cup piece of content every four years. Outside of that, very little will change about the things they know, and love about the current Fifa products. ""Probably the easiest thing that we could have done would have been to maintain the status quo. Fifa has been an incredibly successful game over time, but there are moments when you need to consider what the future looks like and we feel like building our own brand is the best for us.""

Rebekah Vardy tells court she didn't leak stories,"Courtroom sketch of Wayne Rooney and Coleen Rooney watching on as Rebekah Vardy gave evidence Rebekah Vardy has denied leaking information to newspapers as she gave evidence in her libel case against Coleen Rooney at the High Court. The wife of ex-footballer Wayne Rooney is being sued for libel after claiming Vardy, the wife of striker Jamie, leaked her private information. ""I didn't give any information to a newspaper,"" Mrs Vardy said on Tuesday, ""I have been called a leak and it's not nice."" Under questioning from Mrs Rooney's barrister David Sherborne on day one of the trial, Mrs Vardy agreed it was ""upsetting"" and ""wrong"" for someone to secretly pass on another person's information, adding that she respected people's privacy. Mr Sherborne then questioned Mrs Vardy about a story she had once given to the News Of The World about her alleged sexual encounter with singer Peter Andre. Asked whether it was ""respectful"" of Andre's ""right not to share this information"" with the paper, she replied: ""I was forced into a situation by my ex-husband to do this"". She added: ""It is something that I deeply regret"". Coleen Rooney was accompanied at the High Court by husband and former footballer Wayne Earlier on Tuesday,Mrs Rooney's barrister told the court there had been a ""widespread and significant destruction or loss of evidence""in the case. The loss of Mrs Vardy's documents ""must be concealment"", Mr Sherborne said. But Mrs Vardy's barrister Hugh Tomlinson described the claim as ""completely baseless"". The court has heard that Mrs Vardy's agent, Caroline Watt, had lost her phone in the North Sea after it was hit by a wave before Mrs Rooney's team could see WhatsApp messages that could potentially help her case. Mr Sherborne told the court on the trial's opening day there had been ""a concerted effort to ensure highly relevant and incriminating"" documents didn't make it to court. He said a series of ""most improbable events"" had affected the disclosure of evidence, including Ms Watt's ""poor unfortunate phone"" falling into the sea ""within days"" of the court ordering that it should be searched for disclosure. ""What terrible luck,"" Mr Sherborne said. In a written submission, he added: ""To borrow from Wilde, to lose one significant set of documents may be regarded as a misfortune, to lose two, carelessness, but to lose 10? That must be concealment."" Rebekah Vardy arriving at the High Court Mr Tomlinson countered that it had not been suggested ""that Mrs Vardy was anywhere near the North Sea at the time"" nor that she ""knew anything about it"". He added that there was a ""credible, ordinary, boring explanation"" behind media files on Mrs Vardy's WhatsApp account no longer being available. ""It's a very well-known and common feature in everyone's life that from time to time electronic documents are lost for all kinds of reasons,"" he said, adding: ""This is something that happens to us all, that sometimes documents are lost."" The row dates back to 2019, when Mrs Rooney said she had posted fake stories online that she claimed could only have been seen by Mrs Vardy's Instagram account, and that had been leaked to The Sun newspaper. Wayne Rooney and Jamie Vardy played together for England She was later dubbed Wagatha Christie after saying she had carried out an investigation to find out who was behind the leaks. Mrs Vardy strenuously denied being the source of the leaks and said a number of people had access to her accounts. In a pre-trial hearing less than two weeks before the trial began, Mrs Rooney's barrister said Mrs Vardy now ""appears to accept"" that Ms Watt was the source of leaked stories. Ms Watt has denied being the source of the leaks and has been deemed too ill to testify. Mrs Rooney's barrister compared Mrs Vardy's connection with Ms Watt in relation to the leaks as ""like hiring a hit man or woman"". He said: ""Just because you're not the person who gets their hands dirty, doesn't mean you're not equally responsible."" Mrs Vardy, he stressed, ""is just as responsible"" for the stories being leaked even ""if she doesn't pull the trigger"". He said there had also been ""numerous examples of the claimant and Ms Watt conspiring to pass private and personal information on to the press about other individuals"". Coleen Rooney was wearing a protective boot as she attended court But Mr Tomlinson said that if Ms Watt was the source of leaked stories, ""that's not something that Mrs Vardy knew anything about"" and she did not ""approve of or authorise"" her to do so. He told the court that Mrs Vardy ""had no choice"" but to bring the libel claim against Mrs Rooney because she needed to ""establish her innocence and vindicate her reputation"". Mr Tomlinson said on Tuesday that, if information had been leaked, ""this was not something that was done with Mrs Vardy's knowledge or authority"". He said there was ""no information"" in any evidence to demonstrate that Mrs Vardy had even viewed Mrs Rooney's Instagram posts during the alleged ""sting operation"". Wagatha case: What to know as the trial starts Wagatha Christie: A uniquely British feud Coleen Rooney in Twitter row with Rebekah Vardy Rebekah Vardy âappears to acceptâ PR leaked stories The fake stories posted by Mrs Rooney included planning her return to TV, travelling to Mexico for a ""gender selection"" procedure and her basement flooding. Mr Tomlinson said the affair and subsequent libel case had garnered huge press coverage and had become a source of ""entertainment"" in the media. But he added: ""This is far from being an entertaining case. It has been profoundly distressing and disturbing."" Mr Tomlinson added: ""[Mrs Vardy] needs to be able to clear her name through this case, so she can move on from this terrible episode."" He said that as a result of Mrs Rooney's post, Mrs Vardy - who was seven months pregnant at the time - and her family were subjected to abuse, including posts saying she should die. With pride and reputations at stake on both sides, the onus is on the defendant, Mrs Rooney, to prove that it was in fact Mrs Vardy who leaked the stories. Mr Sherborne, for Mrs Rooney, told the court: ""She's not here because she wants to be, she's here because she has to be."" Her investigation into the leaks was ""deeply upsetting"" for Mrs Rooney and made her feel ""paranoid"", he told the court. Coleen Rooney (left) and Rebekah Vardy, pictured at a Euro 2016 match in France The celebrity civil trial - which will be decided by a judge, not a jury - is set to run for seven days. Mrs Rooney arrived at court in a surgical boot alongside her husband - reminiscent of when Wayne injured his foot before the 2006 World Cup, the same tournament where the England ""Wags"" (wives and girlfriends) first exploded on to the scene. Journalists queued to get inside a packed courtroom for this most intriguing of cases. Mrs Vardy sat at the front left bench with her hair in a bun, wearing a blue dress, while Mrs Rooney, wearing a black jacket, sat at the front right bench.

Government drops planning reforms after Tory anger,"This video can not be played Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove casts doubt on 300,000 homes target Neighbours could be allowed to vote on whether planning permission should be given for developments - such as house extensions - on their street. The ""street votes"" would be an alternative to traditional forms of planning permission. It comes as Michael Gove ditched most of the government's reforms of the planning system in England. Downing Street insisted it was still committed to building 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s. Mr Gove earlier told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more homes were needed. But, he added, hitting a ""statistical target"" was not the only measure of success, particularly ""if the homes that are built are shoddy, in the wrong place, don't have the infrastructure required, and are not contributing to beautiful communities"". Is the government meeting its new-homes target? The 300,000 target was a key Conservative pledge at the 2019 general election. Mr Gove's predecessor as Communities Secretary, Robert Jenrick, aimed to meet it by forcing councils to accept new housing developments in designated areas. But the plans sparked a significant Tory backlash,including from former Prime Minister Theresa May, who called them ""ill-conceived"". Some in the party said the policy had contributed to by-election losses in former Conservative heartlands - includingChesham and Amersham- fears that would only have been exacerbated bylast week's local elections results. Now Mr Jenrick's proposals will be dropped in favour of a new Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill,published on Wednesday,external. Other new policies will include: Design codes to let local communities set rules about the layout of new developments and materials which could be used A new infrastructure levy - to be determined locally - to increase funds for projects such as schools, hospitals and roads, by basing the sum on the value of the property when it is sold, rather than when it gets planning permission Digitising the planning system, making plans more accessible online rather than relying on notices on lampposts Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""Under the Conservatives housing has become less affordable, spending on rent has sky-rocketed, and homeownership has gone down."" She said the party could ""no longer claim to be the party of homeownership"". Planning reforms paused amid Tory MP anger Why do ministers face a backlash on planning rules? Archaeologists dig in over planning reforms row Michael Gove was confronted by fury inside his own party over planning reforms put forward by his predecessor. So he's junked them. Instead, there's a set of measures designed to give people more say over development in their areas. Mr Gove has suggested communities will be more open to new housing if it's not imposed on them - if it's ""beautiful"" and ""democratic"". But having ditched more radical reforms, the government may well struggle to meet its own target for building new homes. All the while, there are tens of thousands of people on housing waiting lists, families living in unsuitable or temporary accommodation, and many others unable to afford to get on the property ladder. There are other measures in the Queen's Speech designed to improve the housing market - giving renters more protection and suggestions of a clampdown on empty second homes. It's a complex problem of which the planning system is only one part. But the reality is that the country is facing a housing crisis, and so far successive governments have failed to find a solution. In Boris Johnson's first year in office, only 243,000 new homes were supplied,according to the House of Commons Library,external- falling to 216,000 in 2020/21, partly because of the disruption caused by the pandemic. Research conducted by the BBC in 2020found the difference between the housing stock in England and the number of homes needed was more than one million. Robert Jenrick told MPs the government was likely to continue missing its target by a ""country mile"" without more action. The Conservatives pledged to build 300,000 homes a year in England by the mid-2020s as part of its 2019 manifesto Mr Gove said communities had been ""understandably resistant"" to new developments when factors like the appearance of the buildings and the supporting infrastructure - like GP surgeries and schools - were not included in the plans. But he believed more people would be in favour of new housing under his proposals, adding: ""It shouldn't be a case that we impose. It is important that even as we seek to improve housing supply, we also seek to build communities that people love and are proud of."" Labour MP Clive Betts - who chairs the housing select committee - called the ""street vote"" plan a gimmick, telling the BBC it was not possible for communities to ""decide absolutely everything"" about urban planning in their area. He told the BBC the process of building new housing should be simplified, with local people involved in decisions about where homes might be placed much earlier than at the planning permission stage. Before proposals can be put to a local vote, they will be examined against a set of nationally prescribed development rules, which are to be agreed in due course, the government said. Development will go ahead only if the proposal is endorsed by a ""supermajority"" of residents in a referendum. The precise thresholds for approval would be set out in regulations in due course, the government added. Around 340,000 new homes are needed in England each year - 145,000 of them should be affordable, research for the National Housing Federation in 2019 said In 2020, the Affordable Housing Commission found that more than half of 18 to 24 year-olds still lived with family members; 18% continuing to do so when aged 25 to 34 From 2010 to 2020, more than 464,000 affordable homes were built; 114,000 of these were social homes (housing provided for people on low incomes or with particular needs) In England, an average house cost Â£292,000 (March 2022, ONS) The latest official figure for median monthly rent (for 2021) was Â£755, the highest ever recorded Are you struggling to get on the housing ladder?

"We can't spend our way out of trouble, says PMBoris Johnson says planned new laws will boost living standards - but critics say families need help now.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Queen's speech: Five traditions that changed The government has promised to tackle sharp rises in the cost of living by boosting the economy, as it set out its plans in the Queen's Speech. But Boris Johnson warned that the government could not ""shield everyone"" from the effect of global inflation. Labour has called for an emergency budget to address the cost of living and a windfall tax on energy companies to fund more support for households. This year's Queen's Speech contained 38 bills and draft bills. In the speech, delivered by Prince Charles in the Queen's absence, the government set out the new laws it plans to bring in over the coming year. Priorities included energy security, carbon emissions and post-Brexit economic arrangements - but the opposition parties, and some Tories, said it should have contained more on living costs. Queen's Speech at-a-glance Backlash as workers' rights bill sidelined Government tries again to ban 'guerrilla' protests TheBank of England is warning,externalthat inflation could hit around 10% later this year. The three main opposition parties are all demanding an emergency Budget, with tax cuts and benefit rises to help struggling households. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the legislative agenda set out in the Queen's Speech was ""bereft of ideas"" and ""without a guiding principle or a road map for delivery"". Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said millions of households would be ""bitterly disappointed"" with the government plans. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused ministers of a ""deafening silence"" over potential rises in poverty. In response, Mr Johnson argued wider economic reforms would help households, telling MPs: ""However great our compassion and commitment, we cannot simply spend our way out of problems. ""We need to grow our economy out of these problems by creating hundreds of thousands of high-waged, high-skilled jobs across the country."" He also hinted at an announcement on the cost of living in the coming days, although Downing Street said the PM was referring to the wider work being done in departments to address the pressures households face. Prince William was among the senior royals at the Palace of Westminster The political parties will spend several days debating the contents of the Queen's Speech. It includes seven bills that ministers say will help deliver the benefits of Brexit, while a Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill is expected to change planning rules in England. The government said its Energy Security Bill would ""accelerate our transition to more secure, more affordable and cleaner homegrown energy supplies"". Meanwhile, a Public Order Bill would create a criminal offence, with a maximum sentence of 12 months, of ""interfering with key national infrastructure"" such as airports, railways and printing presses. How will the Police and Crime Bill change protests? What is levelling up and how is it going? The Liberal Democrats called the proposed changes ""dangerous and draconian"", but Home Secretary Priti Patel argued they were needed to deal with a ""self-indulgent minority who seem to revel in causing mayhem and misery"". The speech also pledged support for Ukraine and to reduce regional inequality, but trade unions and charities complained about thelack of an Employment Billaimed at improving workers' rights.

"Warning millions could struggle to pay billsRising prices and higher taxes are squeezing budgets, according to NIESR.Business","Faith Angwet told the BBC there was no support to help her pay rising food and energy bills Single mum Faith Angwet struggled to make ends meet during the pandemic but says the cost of living crisis has hit her even harder. ""I was starting to feel like I was getting to a good place but now the price of everything has gone up it has pushed me right back,"" she said. Ms Angwet is one of an estimated 1.5m UK households that will struggle to pay food and energy bills in the next year. That's according to research which also predicts a UK recession in 2022. The National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has also warned that a combination of rising prices andmeasures announced in the Chancellor's Spring Statement- such as the decision not to scrap a planned rise in National Insurance tax - are hitting the poorest households hardest. Ms Angwet, 36, from Southwark in south London, is a single mother-of-two who has been unemployed since having her daughter two years ago. ""In the pandemic if you couldn't afford something you could shop around or buy in bulk. But now you can't afford it everywhere. And if I am able to buy in bulk, if the kids see it they want to eat it now. So I find myself hiding things from them so I can bring it out another day like magic."" Faith Angwet said plans to take her children to the beach would have to be pushed back due to rising costs Things have got so bad that Ms Angwet sometimes forgoes her prescription for blood pressure medication so she can afford to buy formula and nappies for her daughter. As she is unemployed, she cannot get any other form of benefit or financial help from the government so has turned to food banks for support. She said her five-year-old son's free school meals were a ""huge help"" and that she was grateful for nappies and clothes from Little Village baby bank. ""It's got to the point that I turned to a payday loan, but they want you to borrow more than you need. We can't always go to the food bank, it's a vicious cycle,"" she said. Why are prices rising so quickly? Warning of economic downturn as interest rates rise Five ways the Ukraine war could push up prices Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is at a 30-year high, as the Ukraine war drives up fuel and energy prices. The Bank of England has warned inflation might reach 10% within months. The think tank urged the government to raise Universal Credit by Â£25 per week between May and October, which would cost around Â£1.35bn, and give Â£250 each to 11.3 million lower income households. ""Without this targeted support we expect a further increase in extreme poverty,"" the think tank said, with about a quarter of a million households sliding into extreme poverty, taking the number to about a million. About half a million households would ""face the choice between eating and heating"" without these payments, it said, adding that the chancellor had a reported Â£20bn of ""headroom"" for government spending that could be used to cushion the shock to income. The think tank predicted that inflation would average 7.8% in 2022 and will remain above 3% until 2024 - above the Bank of England's 2% target. At the same time, economic growth is set to slow. While NIESR forecast that UK economic growth in 2022 would increase by 3.5% on average, it predicted a fall in the final two quarters of the year. This would push the UK into a recession, which is two consecutive quarters of economic decline. Meanwhile, government policies are set to leave households with even less disposable income, according to NIESR. It forecasts household income when adjusted for inflation will fall by 2.4% in 2022, along with a small rise in unemployment next year. Tony Danker, director general of the CBI, which represents big businesses, told the BBC's Today programme that companies were suffering too. He said inflation, higher energy prices, labour shortages and the war in Ukraine had made firms ""pause before investing"", and that this was stopping them ""creating jobs and paying good wages"". He said the government needed to create ""reasons to invest"" such as subsidising the shift to clean energy or cutting business rates for shops. ""If we wait... the economy will end up in more trouble,"" he added. ""Get firms investing now because that will stop us facing dire consequences later on."" Fears as energy hike hits disabled families Money tips: How to cut spending as energy bills rise Professor Stephen Millard, NIESR's deputy director for macroeconomics, said: ""Although the war in Ukraine is fundamentally a human tragedy, it has resulted in another supply shock for the UK economy: pushing down growth and pushing up on inflation."" He added: ""We need fiscal policy to loosen and monetary policy to tighten if the UK economy is going to sail safely through these treacherous seas."" A Treasury spokesperson said the country has had a ""strong economic recovery"" from the pandemic but acknowledged that these are ""anxious times"", and said the government is taking action to support households. ""This includes a tax cut of over Â£330 a year for the typical employee, lowering the Universal Credit taper rate to help people keep more of the money they earn, and providing millions of households with up to Â£350 each to help with rising energy bills,"" the spokesperson said. ""Public debt is at the highest levels since the 1960s and rising inflation is pushing up our debt interest costs, which means we must manage public finances sustainably to avoid saddling future generations with further debt."" Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the government should bring in an emergency budget ""urgently"", adding: ""With a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits we can cut household bills by up to Â£600 and support businesses through the cost of living storm."" It comes as NIESR separately forecast that global economic growth would be 1% lower, or about $1.5tn, at the end of 2022, due to the Ukraine war.

James was diagnosed in 2016 and gave candid accounts of her treatment on the BBC's You, Me and the Big C podcast. In her final episode she says that even after five years, knowing she is now nearing the end is ""still shocking"". She has also spoken of feeling ""utterly loved"" after more than Â£1m was donated to a cancer research fund she set up. Inthe podcast interview, the 40-year-old said she did not ""feel brave"" afterrevealing on Instagram on Monday,externalthat nobody knows how long she has left to live. She said her liver had stopped working over the past six months and doctors had advised that more treatment was ""fruitless"" because her ""body does not want to play ball"". ""I can't even walk anymore, that's what's really scary about it, I've gone from someone who used to run 5km [3miles] a day to someone who needs her husband to pick her up to walk a step."" My body can't continue, says Big C's Deborah James BBC presenter Rachael Bland dies aged 40 Rachael Bland 'changed my life' The broadcaster said she had gone to her parents' home to spend her remaining time with her family because it was ""where I always wanted to die"". She explained this meant their family home in London could remain home for her children without the ""medical equipment scars"" in their memories. Asked what hosting the podcast meant to her, James said it had given purpose back to her life after being diagnosed, adding the show had made her realise the influence she could have ""saving another life or making someone not feel alone"". ""Yes I would give my cancer up in a second just to have a normal life again. But to be able to do it and feel like you've had an impact is kind of one of the best feelings you can have."" After thanking listeners for their support over the years, she said: ""Please, please just enjoy life because it's so precious. All I want right now is more time and more life."" She ended the show with a customary caution for people to ""check your poo"" for signs of bowel or other cancers, adding: ""Come on, I can't leave on on any other word."" A persistent change in bowel habit - going more often, with looser stools and sometimes tummy pain Blood in the stools without other symptoms, such as piles Abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always brought on by eating Source:NHS UK,external In revealing her prognosis, James also announced the Bowelbabe fund to support research into personalised medicine for cancer patients, and to support campaigns to raise awareness of bowel cancer. The fund, named after her online handle, will work with the charity Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden, to allocate the money. Thousands of donations flooded in after she revealed the news on Monday, with donations already exceeding Â£2.1m. In an interview due to be broadcast on BBC Breakfast on Wednesday, the former deputy head teacher revealed her surprise at the speed at which the smashed through its fundraising goal of Â£250,000. She said: ""I had a figure in my mind of about a quarter of a million, because I thought that would be enough to fund a good couple of projects across the charities that I wanted to fund. ""But in 24 hours to do a million, I'm like absolutely mind blown and I just cannot thank people enough for their generosity. ""Because it just means so much to me. It makes me feel utterly loved. ""It makes me feel like we're all kind of in it at the end together and we all want to make a difference."" This video can not be played Watch: Deborah James speaks about her diagnosis to raise awareness (May 2019) After the opening day's whirlwind fundraising efforts - which has seen donations from more than 85,000 people - James told the BBC that her dying wish was to help raise money for the ""things that gave me life"". She explained that were it not for experimental treatments she would have died at least two years ago, adding that she wanted other people to be given the same opportunities. James said: ""Ultimately what I really want to happen is I don't want any other Deborahs to have to go through this. ""We know that when we catch cancer early, we can cure it. We know that much more investment needs to take place in cancer."" She added it was clear the UK had ""skills and the passion"" to develop new cancer therapies, but sometimes a reminder was needed to get a ""boost"" for funding.

James began co-presenting You, Me and the Big C alongside Lauren Mahon and BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland in 2018, with the show earning praise for its frank discussion of cancer. They spoke to celebrity guests and addressed practical matters including hair loss, tips for dealing with finances and telling your nearest and dearest. Bland died at the age of 40 six months after the show launched. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer two years earlier. Speaking about her friend on their podcast, James said she she was ""always in my mind actually, even now"". ""I just don't know how brave she must have been to do what she did, because I don't feel that brave. ""I think I'm still in awe of how she just seemed to just take it in her stride and, quite frankly, I'm a quivering mess half the time. But I think if she can do it, I can do it and I'll go and party with her."" James has been praised for her no-nonsense approach to talking about cancer online, and has shared her experiences of treatment and daily life with her social media followers since her diagnosis. She has worked to remove the embarrassment factor from bowel cancer, and even shared a video of herself walking down the street dressed as a poo emoji to encourage people to watch out for changes to their bowel movements.

Ukraine secure passage to Eurovision final,"Kalush Orchestra were given special permission to leave Ukraine while the war continues. Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra are through to the final of the Eurovision Song Contest, cementing their position as favourites to win the competition. The folk-rap band jumped to their feet, waving the Ukrainian flag as it was announced they had qualified from the first semi-final in Turin. Earlier, they gave an energetic performance of their song Stefania. ""Thank you for supporting Ukraine,"" said founder member Oleh Psiuk as they finished their performance. The audience at the Pala Alpitour responded with a mixture of joy and emotion. Deafening applause was accompanied by genuine tears. This video can not be played Watch: Ukrainian fans celebrate in Turin as the Kalush Orchestra qualify for Eurovision final Support for the band has swelled since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. Speaking to the BBC before the semi-final, Psiuk said a victory would send a message of support to the country's besieged citizens, and the estimated 12 million people who have fled the country. ""For our country it is so important to have victories in all ways,"" he said. ""So if we win, it will be another opportunity to show Ukraine to the world, to remind people about Ukraine, and to increase morale in the whole country."" When a president tried to intervene in Eurovision... Who will win Eurovision? And other questions answered How Eurovision is bringing Europe together again Sam Ryder to represent UK at Eurovision 2022 Watch the first semi-final on BBC iPlayer But the band were at pains to point out that their success isn't just an expression of solidarity. ""Even before the war, we were in fifth position according to bookmakers,"" they said in a press conference last week, ""which means this Ukrainian song is already enjoyed by Europeans."" Their song, Stefania, was written in tribute to Psiuk's mother, but emotive lyrics like ""I will always walk to you by broken roads"" have been re-interpreted as a rallying cry. Speaking after the semi-final, Psiuk thanked everyone who voted and said Lakush Orchestra were ""totally focused"" on the final, ""because we are here to show that Ukrainian culture is alive"". Russia, meanwhile,has been banned from competingin this year's contest, with organisers saying the country's participation could ""bring the competition into disrepute"". Sibling trio Systur qualified for the final for Iceland Tuesday's semi-final allowed 10 acts to progress to Saturday's final. They were (in no particular order): Switzerland - Marius Bear: Boys Do Cry Armenia - Rosa Linn: Snap Iceland - Systur: MeÃ° hÃ¦kkandi sÃ³l Lithuania - Monika Liu: Sentimental Portugal - Maro: Saudade, Saudade Norway - Subwoolfer: Give That Wolf A Banana Greece - Amanda Tenfjord: Die Together Ukraine - Kalush Orchestra: Stefania Moldova - Zdob Èi Zdub and Advahov Brothers: TrenuleÈul Netherlands - S10: De Diepte That meant popular songs like Latvia's ""vegetarian anthem"" Eat Your Salad and Austria's EDM banger Halo failed to make the cut. The other countries whose journey ended on Tuesday were Albania, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Croatia and Denmark. Ten more acts will progress to the main competition after Thursday's second semi-final. The ""Big Five"" countries, who contribute the most financially to the competition (France, Germany, Spain, the UK and Italy) qualify automatically. Ronela Hajati had been expected to progress to the final, but Eurovision watchers say acts that perform earlier in the show are often at a disadvantage The first semi-final opened with a set-piece song and dance number called The Sound of Beauty which incorporated elements of Puccini's Nessun Dorma and last year's winning song Zitti E Buoni, by Italian rock band MÃ¥neskin. But the competition kicked off in earnest with Ronela Hajati - Albania's answer to Madonna, whose song Sekret was about a romantic tryst with a boy ""who came from the mountains"". Her high-octane routine, full of hair whipping and shirtless male dancers, was a suitably bombastic opening, but failed to attract enough votes to progress. The same fate befell Latvia's technicolour whirlwind Citi ZÄni, whose song attempted to convince viewers that ""being green is sexy"". BBC Three hosts Scott Mills and Rylan Clark were forced to apologise for the band, after fans in the arena shouted out swear words that had been censored from the song during their performance. Citi ZÄni's failure to qualify suggested fans had grown tired of novelty... until Norway secured a place in the final Maro's delicate song of grief proved popular, with a simple but effective staging Portugal's Maro, who brought a delicate intimacy to the competition with her touching ballad Saudade, Saudade, which is dedicated to her late grandfather. The chorus of the song featured a mournful, meditative repetition of the word ""saudade"" - which doesn't have a direct translation in English, but which the singer says represents ""the desire to have someone back when you know you can't"". Voters were obviously in the mood for a ballad, with the similarly chilled-out Icelandic folk act Systur, unexpectedly gaining a place in the final. The band, whose song MeÃ° HÃ¦kkandi SÃ³l translates as ""with the rising sun"", is formed of three sisters SigrÃ­Ã°ur, ElÃ­sabet and ElÃ­n EyÃ¾Ã³rsdÃ³ttir, making them the Haim of Eurovision 2022. ""We're a small nation, we get lost in Europe, so it means the world to us,"" said SigrÃ­Ã°ur in a press conference after the semi-final. ""We were just focusing on the message of the song, and we wanted to bring hope to people that are going through hard times, like Ukraine, and all of us that have been struggling through Covid."" Subwoolfer's banana-based song has built a cult following But perhaps the best reaction in the arena went to Norway's Subwoolfer - a group formed ""4.5 billion years ago on the moon"", whose brilliantly deranged Give That Wolf A Banana brought a much-needed dose of Eurovision madness. The band, who are rumoured to include Ben Adams from the British boyband A1, hide their identities behind giant yellow wolf masks. Equally in keeping with Eurovision's comical side were Moldovan act Zdob Èi Zdub and Advahov Brothers, whose song TrenuleÈul is about the rail link between the Moldovan capital, ChiÈinÄu, and Bucharest in Romania. (No, really.) The folk-punk curio was another surprise qualifier for Saturday's final, although it's worth bearing in mind that Zdob Èi Zdub have prior form at Eurovision, coming sixth in 2005 and 12th in 2011. The UK's Sam Ryder will make his debut during Thursday's second semi-final... although he is guaranteed his place in the final. The TikTok star has risen to become second favourite to win the competition after a series of impressive rehearsals in Turin, but almost any position would be an improvement on the last two contests, where the UK came last.

Government drops planning reforms after Tory angerFresh proposals to change planning laws will be published in the new Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove casts doubt on 300,000 homes target Neighbours could be allowed to vote on whether planning permission should be given for developments - such as house extensions - on their street. The ""street votes"" would be an alternative to traditional forms of planning permission. It comes as Michael Gove ditched most of the government's reforms of the planning system in England. Downing Street insisted it was still committed to building 300,000 homes a year by the mid-2020s. Mr Gove earlier told BBC Radio 4's Today programme more homes were needed. But, he added, hitting a ""statistical target"" was not the only measure of success, particularly ""if the homes that are built are shoddy, in the wrong place, don't have the infrastructure required, and are not contributing to beautiful communities"". Is the government meeting its new-homes target? The 300,000 target was a key Conservative pledge at the 2019 general election. Mr Gove's predecessor as Communities Secretary, Robert Jenrick, aimed to meet it by forcing councils to accept new housing developments in designated areas. But the plans sparked a significant Tory backlash,including from former Prime Minister Theresa May, who called them ""ill-conceived"". Some in the party said the policy had contributed to by-election losses in former Conservative heartlands - includingChesham and Amersham- fears that would only have been exacerbated bylast week's local elections results. Now Mr Jenrick's proposals will be dropped in favour of a new Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill,published on Wednesday,external. Other new policies will include: Design codes to let local communities set rules about the layout of new developments and materials which could be used A new infrastructure levy - to be determined locally - to increase funds for projects such as schools, hospitals and roads, by basing the sum on the value of the property when it is sold, rather than when it gets planning permission Digitising the planning system, making plans more accessible online rather than relying on notices on lampposts Labour's shadow levelling up secretary Lisa Nandy said: ""Under the Conservatives housing has become less affordable, spending on rent has sky-rocketed, and homeownership has gone down."" She said the party could ""no longer claim to be the party of homeownership"". Planning reforms paused amid Tory MP anger Why do ministers face a backlash on planning rules? Archaeologists dig in over planning reforms row Michael Gove was confronted by fury inside his own party over planning reforms put forward by his predecessor. So he's junked them. Instead, there's a set of measures designed to give people more say over development in their areas. Mr Gove has suggested communities will be more open to new housing if it's not imposed on them - if it's ""beautiful"" and ""democratic"". But having ditched more radical reforms, the government may well struggle to meet its own target for building new homes. All the while, there are tens of thousands of people on housing waiting lists, families living in unsuitable or temporary accommodation, and many others unable to afford to get on the property ladder. There are other measures in the Queen's Speech designed to improve the housing market - giving renters more protection and suggestions of a clampdown on empty second homes. It's a complex problem of which the planning system is only one part. But the reality is that the country is facing a housing crisis, and so far successive governments have failed to find a solution. In Boris Johnson's first year in office, only 243,000 new homes were supplied,according to the House of Commons Library,external- falling to 216,000 in 2020/21, partly because of the disruption caused by the pandemic. Research conducted by the BBC in 2020found the difference between the housing stock in England and the number of homes needed was more than one million. Robert Jenrick told MPs the government was likely to continue missing its target by a ""country mile"" without more action. The Conservatives pledged to build 300,000 homes a year in England by the mid-2020s as part of its 2019 manifesto Mr Gove said communities had been ""understandably resistant"" to new developments when factors like the appearance of the buildings and the supporting infrastructure - like GP surgeries and schools - were not included in the plans. But he believed more people would be in favour of new housing under his proposals, adding: ""It shouldn't be a case that we impose. It is important that even as we seek to improve housing supply, we also seek to build communities that people love and are proud of."" Labour MP Clive Betts - who chairs the housing select committee - called the ""street vote"" plan a gimmick, telling the BBC it was not possible for communities to ""decide absolutely everything"" about urban planning in their area. He told the BBC the process of building new housing should be simplified, with local people involved in decisions about where homes might be placed much earlier than at the planning permission stage. Before proposals can be put to a local vote, they will be examined against a set of nationally prescribed development rules, which are to be agreed in due course, the government said. Development will go ahead only if the proposal is endorsed by a ""supermajority"" of residents in a referendum. The precise thresholds for approval would be set out in regulations in due course, the government added. Around 340,000 new homes are needed in England each year - 145,000 of them should be affordable, research for the National Housing Federation in 2019 said In 2020, the Affordable Housing Commission found that more than half of 18 to 24 year-olds still lived with family members; 18% continuing to do so when aged 25 to 34 From 2010 to 2020, more than 464,000 affordable homes were built; 114,000 of these were social homes (housing provided for people on low incomes or with particular needs) In England, an average house cost Â£292,000 (March 2022, ONS) The latest official figure for median monthly rent (for 2021) was Â£755, the highest ever recorded Are you struggling to get on the housing ladder?

Flight aborted as passengers get plane crash picsThe Turkish plane was about to take off from Israel when passengers' phones were sent the images.Middle East,"The Anadolujet (library image) was carrying 160 passengers when it was forced to abort The captain of a Turkish AnadoluJet flight aborted its take-off at Israel's main airport after passengers received plane crash images on their phones. Israel's aviation authority said the aircraft was taxiing at Ben Gurion Airport when the incident happened. Passengers and crew were taken off and the luggage reinspected. Several young Israelis were identified as suspects and are being questioned. The plane departed five hours late after being cleared to leave. The AnadoluJet Boeing 737, with 160 passengers on board, was on its way to the take-off position when passengers alerted crew that they had received the photos. The captain was informed and decided to return to the terminal. The Hebrew Ynet news site reported that the images were shared via AirDrop, an Apple service which enables users to send files from one Apple device to another across short distances. All the images were received on iPhones, it said. The pictures included images of a Turkish Airlines plane which crashed in the Netherlands in 2009 and another plane crash in the United States in 2013, Ynet said. Passengers were told they could reboard the reinspected plane, which was headed to Istanbul, or stay in Israel. The incident comes two weeks after another security scare at Ben Gurion Airport. It happened whena family from the US produced a live artillery shell at check-in, which they had planned to take home as a souvenir. There was pandemonium as travellers fled the area, with one person requiring hospital treatment after falling over a conveyor belt in the rush to escape.

"Elon Musk would reverse Donald Trump's Twitter banHe says Twitter's decision to ban the former US president was ""morally wrong and flat-out stupid"".","Elon Musk says if his bid to buy Twitter is successful he will reverse Donald Trump's ban from the platform. The richest man in the world agreed a $44bn (Â£34.5bn) takeover bid with the Twitter board last month. But he said it was not a done deal and that ideally it would be completed in the next two to three months. Twitter's decision to ban the former US president was ""morally wrong and flat-out stupid"", Mr Musk told the Financial Times Future of the Car summit. Who is Elon Musk? In January 2021, Twitter said Mr Trump's account was ""permanently suspended... due to the risk of further incitement of violence"" following the storming of the Capitol. But the Tesla owner said: ""I would reverse the permanent ban but I don't own Twitter yet so this is not a thing that will definitely happen."" He said the ban had not silenced Mr Trump, but by making him move onto his own Truth Social site, it had amplified his voice among the right. He pointed out that Mr Trump had previously said he would not return to Twitter even if his account was reinstated. Mr Musk said he had spoken to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on the subject of locking users out of their social media accounts in response to offensive tweets. ""He and I are of the same mind that permanent bans should be extremely rare and reserved for accounts that are bots or scam accounts,"" he said. Mr Musk said if someone tweeted something ""illegal or otherwise destructive to the world"" there should be temporary suspension or the post should be made invisible. He said Twitter needed to build more trust by sharing its algorithm and asking people to make suggestions on how to improve it. He said the company had a strong left bias because of its origins in the San Francisco tech community and needed to be ""more even-handed"". ""Victory would be the far right 10% and the far left 10% are equally upset,"" he said. Dr Catherine Flick, an expert in computing and social responsibility at De Montfort University, told the BBC's Today's programme her team had ""very strong evidence to suggest [Mr Musk] is completely wrong"" about the impact of Mr Trump being removed from Twitter. ""Removing Donald Trump from Twitter actually decreased the amount of polarisation,"" she said. ""It removed a platform for him to stoke animosity and division between people within the platform."" Ms Flick added there were a ""lot of people"" who were worried about Mr Musk ""essentially having the keys to this... social media platform to reign over it like a king or an emperor like he seems to want to do at the moment"". Last week activist groups wrote anopen letter,externalto Twitter advertisers warning that under Mr Musk's management, ""Twitter risks becoming a cesspool of misinformation, with your brand attached"". In the US, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the Biden administration wants online platforms to protect freedom of speech but also ensure they are not forums for disinformation. Ms Psaki said allowing Mr Trump back on Twitter or not would be a decision for the private sector company to make. This is the furthest Mr Musk has gone - saying in the strongest terms that he thought Mr Trump's ban was wrong. However, for those anticipating the former President's imminent return to Twitter, think again. To start with, Donald Trump has said that he doesn't want to come back to Twitter, preferring instead to post on his own social media platform, Truth Social. Of course, Mr Trump might revisit that decision if he made a tilt at the US presidency in 2024. But there are other hurdles too. For one the world's richest person made it clear that the deal was far from being done. Mr Musk came across as less confident about the acquisition than previous statements. He emphasised that there hadn't been a shareholder vote on the deal and that lots of questions still needed to be answered. That might reflect the fact that his financial position is looking slightly more precarious than before. Most of Mr Musk's vast fortune is tied to Tesla stock - which has fallen in value by $350bn since he announced he had acquired shares in Twitter on 4 April. The door then is certainly ajar for Mr Trump's return. It is as open as it has been since the Capitol Hill riots. But don't expect him to be tweeting anytime soon. Speaking via video link, the Tesla boss said the company's goal of making 20 million electric vehicles by 2030 was an aspiration not a promise. But he said: ""I'm confident that we will be able to sell all the cars we can make."" He added: ""At the moment the lead time is ridiculously long, so our issue is not demand, it's production."" Mr Musk said Tesla could stop taking orders beyond a certain period of time. Earlier on Tuesday, Twitter shares fell to a level that indicated the stock market believed it was unlikely that Musk would make the acquisition for $44bn, as he originally agreed. Mr Musk's decision to go after Twitter has concerned some Tesla investors and put pressure on the stock. Addressing concerns that his planned takeover of Twitter could distract him from his chief executive job at Tesla, he said he would remain at the car company ""as long as I can be useful."" He said China would account for 25% to 30% of Tesla's sales long term. He said he was not expecting to open any additional plants in China in the near future but would be expanding the Shanghai Factory. Mr Musk has an estimated net worth of around $250bn, mostly due to his Tesla stake. He also has a controlling stake in the rocket company SpaceX, which is estimated to be worth $100bn. He said it was his aim to get an uncrewed vehicle known as Starship to Mars in three to five years with a crewed mission before the end of the decade. Correction 23rd May: This article has been amended to make clear that Elon Musk referred to how Donald Trump's Twitter ban and move to his own Truth Social site had amplified his voice among ""the right"" rather than the ""far-right"". X marks the spot for Musk's Twitter growth plans Elon Musk sells $8.5bn worth of Tesla shares Who is Elon Musk?

UK considers plan to scrap parts of NI Protocol,"Liz Truss says the EU's proposals, released last October, could lead to ""everyday items disappearing from shelves"" The UK has rejected EU plans aimed at reducing the impact of the post-Brexit treaty for Northern Ireland, saying they would make things worse. The EU claims the proposals would reduce paperwork and checks on goods entering NI from Great Britain. But the government says they would ""worsen the current trading arrangements"". The UK verdict is part of an escalating dispute which could soon see the government scrapping parts of the deal. The protocol is an issue under fresh scrutiny following elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly. The elections cemented a majority for assembly members who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, the republican party Sinn FÃ©in. But the second largest party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said it would not nominate ministers to form a new executive in Northern Ireland until its concerns with the protocol were resolved. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said, in a statement released on Tuesday night, that her preference had always been for a ""negotiated solution"" but that she would not shy away from ""taking action to stabilise the situation in Northern Ireland if solutions cannot be found"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? A source close to Ms Truss said she believed the current situation could not ""drag on"", with the foreign secretary now eyeing domestic legislation to start scrapping parts of the treaty. The post-Brexit arrangement for Northern Ireland, known as the Protocol, isa special Brexit deal for Northern Irelanddesigned to prevent the return of a hard land border with the Republic of Ireland. It was agreed between the UK and the EU in 2019, put into domestic law by the UK Parliament and came into force in January 2021. It works by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. This means Northern Ireland continues to follow some EU laws and there are new checks and paperwork for goods which are imported into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The EU acknowledges that it has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and its October proposals were an attempt to ease that burden. Under the protocol, checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK At the time, its chief negotiator, MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, said it was a ""robust package of creative, practical solutions"". Much of that package concernedfood products which are subject to the greatest level of new checks. The EU said it would mean inspections of food products would be reduced far below what is usually required at single-market borders. However, the plan came with caveats and the UK said the EU needed to do more. But this government statement amounts to a public rejection of what the EU was proposing. It focuses on the fact that grace periods mean the protocol is not being fully implemented. It says if the grace periods were replaced with the EU proposals, the checks and controls would increase, and these plans would lead to ""everyday items disappearing off the shelves"". It claims a range of food would likely be unavailable in Northern Ireland shops if it originates from outside the EU, such as Thai green curry ready meals, New Zealand Lamb and Brazilian pork. It also claims ""sending a parcel to Northern Ireland would require more than 50 fields of information for the customs declaration for one parcel"". Earlier, Mr Å efÄoviÄ said that solutions could be found without changing the protocol, and the EU said it was ""bending over backwards"" to find solutions. Maros Sefcovic says solutions offered in October are ""robust and creative"" He pointed to how the EU had changed its laws to ensure medicines could be traded freely from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. He added that with ""political will and genuine commitment joint solutions to legitimate practical issuesâ¦ can be found within the framework of the protocol"". He warned that the protocol, as a cornerstone of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement, was an international agreement and ""it's renegotiation is not an option"". Whitehall sources have suggested that, within government, Ms Truss' position is relatively hard-line. Former PM Theresa May said it was ""not the right move"" for the government to take unilateral action involving the protocol. Previously the UK has threatened to trigger what's known as Article 16. That is the provision within the protocol that could potentially see parts of the agreement suspended if the treaty is causing ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". A source close to the foreign secretary insisted that her ""absolute priority"" was protecting peace in Northern Ireland. ""We can't have the current situation drag on. That is why she's prepared to act if solutions can't be found with the EU, who still aren't prepared to show the requisite flexibility despite the seriousness of the issue,"" they said. The protocol is opposed by unionists, who argue it undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK The UK has demanded fundamental changes to the treaty. It wants to remove checks entirely on goods destined to stay in Northern Ireland as well as overhaul VAT and governance arrangements. There is scepticism in Brussels about whether the UK will really push ahead with ditching parts of the protocol. ""From all her meetings with the EU and member states she knows exactly that this is a no-go for all of them,"" said one EU diplomat. ""So this can only be about catering to a domestic audience."" Another senior diplomat warned that such a move by the UK would only serve to ""delight"" Russian President Vladimir Putin. ""Contemplating to break international law and undermining Western unity at a time when Western democracies have come together to defend international law against Russia would be an utterly irresponsible move,"" they said. On Monday, Mrs May questioned in Parliament what the move to unilaterally scrap parts of the protocol would say about the UK's ""willingness to abide by treaties which it has signed"". And in a rebuke to Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who said the protocol was harming the Good Friday Agreement, Mrs May added: ""I put a deal before this house which actually met the requirements of the Good Friday Agreement and actually enabled us not to have a border down the Irish Sea or to have a border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. ""Sadly, the DUP, and others across this house, chose to reject that, but it was just such an opportunity."" Mrs May, who stepped down in 2019, had proposed an insurance arrangement designed to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It would have kept the UK in a ""single customs territory"" with the EU, and left Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and European Commissioner in charge of Brexit negotiations MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ On Tuesday, the European Commission said it wanted to find practical solutions within the boundaries of the treaty, reiterating that its proposals weren't ""take it or leave it."" However a spokesman insisted there would be no renegotiation. Whitehall sources have indicated that there are divisions within the UK cabinet about unilateral moves to start scrapping parts of the protocol, with concerns it could spark a ""trade war."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak is understood to have given an ""assessment"" on the economic implications - a Downing Street source said that the government would act ""responsibly"" on the issue. The plan to legislate has also been described as just ""an option"" in Whitehall that is yet to formally reach cabinet. Ms Truss was expected to speak with her EU counterpart Mr Å efÄoviÄ in the coming days. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said he had a ""frank and honest"" exchange of views in his telephone call with Prime Minister Boris Johnson earlier on Tuesday about the blockages in restoring an executive. He said what was needed was a proper ""intensification"" of discussions between London and Brussels regarding the implementation of the protocol. The taoiseach said he set out in clear terms his ""serious concerns"" about any unilateral move by London. ""I shared my view that this would be the wrong approach.

Elon Musk would reverse Donald Trump's Twitter ban,"Elon Musk says if his bid to buy Twitter is successful he will reverse Donald Trump's ban from the platform. The richest man in the world agreed a $44bn (Â£34.5bn) takeover bid with the Twitter board last month. But he said it was not a done deal and that ideally it would be completed in the next two to three months. Twitter's decision to ban the former US president was ""morally wrong and flat-out stupid"", Mr Musk told the Financial Times Future of the Car summit. Who is Elon Musk? In January 2021, Twitter said Mr Trump's account was ""permanently suspended... due to the risk of further incitement of violence"" following the storming of the Capitol. But the Tesla owner said: ""I would reverse the permanent ban but I don't own Twitter yet so this is not a thing that will definitely happen."" He said the ban had not silenced Mr Trump, but by making him move onto his own Truth Social site, it had amplified his voice among the right. He pointed out that Mr Trump had previously said he would not return to Twitter even if his account was reinstated. Mr Musk said he had spoken to Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey on the subject of locking users out of their social media accounts in response to offensive tweets. ""He and I are of the same mind that permanent bans should be extremely rare and reserved for accounts that are bots or scam accounts,"" he said. Mr Musk said if someone tweeted something ""illegal or otherwise destructive to the world"" there should be temporary suspension or the post should be made invisible. He said Twitter needed to build more trust by sharing its algorithm and asking people to make suggestions on how to improve it. He said the company had a strong left bias because of its origins in the San Francisco tech community and needed to be ""more even-handed"". ""Victory would be the far right 10% and the far left 10% are equally upset,"" he said. Dr Catherine Flick, an expert in computing and social responsibility at De Montfort University, told the BBC's Today's programme her team had ""very strong evidence to suggest [Mr Musk] is completely wrong"" about the impact of Mr Trump being removed from Twitter. ""Removing Donald Trump from Twitter actually decreased the amount of polarisation,"" she said. ""It removed a platform for him to stoke animosity and division between people within the platform."" Ms Flick added there were a ""lot of people"" who were worried about Mr Musk ""essentially having the keys to this... social media platform to reign over it like a king or an emperor like he seems to want to do at the moment"". Last week activist groups wrote anopen letter,externalto Twitter advertisers warning that under Mr Musk's management, ""Twitter risks becoming a cesspool of misinformation, with your brand attached"". In the US, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said that the Biden administration wants online platforms to protect freedom of speech but also ensure they are not forums for disinformation. Ms Psaki said allowing Mr Trump back on Twitter or not would be a decision for the private sector company to make. This is the furthest Mr Musk has gone - saying in the strongest terms that he thought Mr Trump's ban was wrong. However, for those anticipating the former President's imminent return to Twitter, think again. To start with, Donald Trump has said that he doesn't want to come back to Twitter, preferring instead to post on his own social media platform, Truth Social. Of course, Mr Trump might revisit that decision if he made a tilt at the US presidency in 2024. But there are other hurdles too. For one the world's richest person made it clear that the deal was far from being done. Mr Musk came across as less confident about the acquisition than previous statements. He emphasised that there hadn't been a shareholder vote on the deal and that lots of questions still needed to be answered. That might reflect the fact that his financial position is looking slightly more precarious than before. Most of Mr Musk's vast fortune is tied to Tesla stock - which has fallen in value by $350bn since he announced he had acquired shares in Twitter on 4 April. The door then is certainly ajar for Mr Trump's return. It is as open as it has been since the Capitol Hill riots. But don't expect him to be tweeting anytime soon. Speaking via video link, the Tesla boss said the company's goal of making 20 million electric vehicles by 2030 was an aspiration not a promise. But he said: ""I'm confident that we will be able to sell all the cars we can make."" He added: ""At the moment the lead time is ridiculously long, so our issue is not demand, it's production."" Mr Musk said Tesla could stop taking orders beyond a certain period of time. Earlier on Tuesday, Twitter shares fell to a level that indicated the stock market believed it was unlikely that Musk would make the acquisition for $44bn, as he originally agreed. Mr Musk's decision to go after Twitter has concerned some Tesla investors and put pressure on the stock. Addressing concerns that his planned takeover of Twitter could distract him from his chief executive job at Tesla, he said he would remain at the car company ""as long as I can be useful."" He said China would account for 25% to 30% of Tesla's sales long term. He said he was not expecting to open any additional plants in China in the near future but would be expanding the Shanghai Factory. Mr Musk has an estimated net worth of around $250bn, mostly due to his Tesla stake. He also has a controlling stake in the rocket company SpaceX, which is estimated to be worth $100bn. He said it was his aim to get an uncrewed vehicle known as Starship to Mars in three to five years with a crewed mission before the end of the decade. Correction 23rd May: This article has been amended to make clear that Elon Musk referred to how Donald Trump's Twitter ban and move to his own Truth Social site had amplified his voice among ""the right"" rather than the ""far-right"".

Flight aborted as passengers get plane crash pics,"The Anadolujet (library image) was carrying 160 passengers when it was forced to abort The captain of a Turkish AnadoluJet flight aborted its take-off at Israel's main airport after passengers received plane crash images on their phones. Israel's aviation authority said the aircraft was taxiing at Ben Gurion Airport when the incident happened. Passengers and crew were taken off and the luggage reinspected. Several young Israelis were identified as suspects and are being questioned. The plane departed five hours late after being cleared to leave. The AnadoluJet Boeing 737, with 160 passengers on board, was on its way to the take-off position when passengers alerted crew that they had received the photos. The captain was informed and decided to return to the terminal. The Hebrew Ynet news site reported that the images were shared via AirDrop, an Apple service which enables users to send files from one Apple device to another across short distances. All the images were received on iPhones, it said. The pictures included images of a Turkish Airlines plane which crashed in the Netherlands in 2009 and another plane crash in the United States in 2013, Ynet said. Passengers were told they could reboard the reinspected plane, which was headed to Istanbul, or stay in Israel. The incident comes two weeks after another security scare at Ben Gurion Airport. It happened whena family from the US produced a live artillery shell at check-in, which they had planned to take home as a souvenir. There was pandemonium as travellers fled the area, with one person requiring hospital treatment after falling over a conveyor belt in the rush to escape.

Apple to discontinue the iPod after 21 years,"The late Steve Jobs - then Apple CEO - at the launch of the iPod Touch in 2007 Apple has announced it is discontinuing its music player, the iPod Touch, bringing to an end a device widely praised for revolutionising how people listen to music. When the first iPod was launched in 2001, it could store 1,000 tracks. Today there are more than 90 million songs on Apple's streaming service. The iPod Touch was designed by the same team that later invented the iPhone, which quickly overshadowed the iPod. Apple last updated the iPod in 2019. There have been various iPod models over the years - including the Nano and Shuffle - but the iPod Touch, which was released in 2007 is the last model to be discontinued. Apple says it will remain available to buy ""while stocks last"". The gadget had ""redefined how music is discovered, listened to, and shared"", Greg Joswiak, the senior vice-president of worldwide marketing at Apple said. iPod fans have taken to social media to share their thoughts on the news and their memories connected with the music devices.

The first model of the iPod was revealed by Apple boss Steve Jobs in typical Apple style in 2001 - with much fanfare, anticipation and in his trademark jeans and black turtleneck. There had been rumours the company was going to announce a new music player after the invitation for the launch event read: ""Hint: It's not a Mac."" ""Music's a part of everyone's life. Music's been around forever. It will always be around,"" Jobs said during his hour long presentation. The big headline for the night was simple: ""1,000 songs in your pocket."" Over the years, many celebrities have thrown their star power behind the iPod, including John Mayer, U2 and Oprah Winfrey. BMW introduced the first car entertainment system with a built-in iPod system, and within a few years, most car manufacturers had followed suit. Steve Jobs: Career in pictures The cult of Apple's Steve Jobs But tech analysist say it was inevitable the iPhone would one day replace the iPod. ""When Apple created the iPhone it knew that it would ultimately mean the beginning of the end of the iPod,"" Ben Wood, chief analyst at technology advisory firm CCS Insight, told the BBC. Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies said the decline of iPod sales was connected to the rise of iPhone sales - like the move from digital sales to streaming. ""The demise of the iPod is probably the best example of Apple not being concerned about cannibalising its own products,"" she said. The iPod wasn't the first MP3 player on the market, just like the iPhone wasn't the first smartphone - but that unique Apple design proved to be the push digital music needed to start to tempt people away from CD and cassette players - and file-sharing. In 2001 the music industry was fighting for survival against illegal file-sharing as tunes were ripped and shared on platforms faster than record labels could issue legal threats. The launch of iTunes, and the iPod shortly afterwards, provided it with a lifeline in the form of revenue for legitimately purchased downloads. It also revived the fortunes of Apple, which was languishing in a market dominated by Windows PCs. It was introduced on stage by the late Steve Jobs at an event on 23 October 2001. ""With iPod, listening to music will never be the same again,"" he said. And in many ways, he was right.

Man City 'reach agreement' to sign Â£51m Haaland,"Norway striker Erling Haaland was born in Leeds in July 2000, the same summer his footballer father Alf-Inge left Leeds United to sign for Manchester City Manchester City have reached an agreement to sign Norway striker Erling Haaland from Borussia Dortmund. Haaland, 21, will join in July after City activated a 60m euro (Â£51.2m) release clause in his contract. The deal ends the club's hunt for a successor to their all-time top scorer Sergio Aguero, who joined Barcelonaon a free transferlast summer. ""We can confirm that we have reached an agreement in principle for the transfer of striker Erling Haaland,"" City said. ""The transfer remains subject to the club finalising terms with the player."" This video can not be played The Football News Show: Haaland is 'next level' for Man City fans Watch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayer Live: Reaction to news of Haaland deal 'How Haaland will add a new dimension to Man City' The rise of Haaland - and what happens next Haaland, who passed his City medical in Belgium on Monday, has scored 85 goals in 88 appearances for Dortmund since joining from Red Bull Salzburg in January 2020. La Liga giants Real Madrid and Barcelona also spoke to Haaland about a potential deal, but he opted for a move to Etihad Stadium. Speaking earlier on Tuesday, Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola said he could not discuss the incoming signing for legal reasons. This video can not be played 'Beautiful beyond compare!' - watch five brilliant Haaland goals ""Everybody knows the situation. I shouldn't talk because I don't like to talk about the future or next season,"" he said. When asked what impact a new number nine would have on the Premier League champions, Guardiola said: ""New players always helps to be a stronger team. But not one defender or striker will solve our defensive or scoring problems. ""The club always has to have a vision for the future. The decisions the club makes I am aware and supportive of 100%."" Sports agent Mino Raiola had been involved in the discussions prior to his death on 30 April, with associates taking the process on to its conclusion. Haaland's transfer will be one of the biggest of the summer, and he will score freely for City next season according to Jurgen Klopp, manager of their Premier League title rivals Liverpool. ""City will never be a team who win games because of one player,"" Klopp said. ""They have a specific way to play and I think Erling will realise all of a sudden that he will score a lot of goals on the second post if he just puts a foot on [the ball] and he will love that. We have other situations where he is a real beast. ""He was injured a couple of times at Dortmund but when he was fit, he was a real beast, so unfortunately [it is] a really good signing."" This video can not be played âHeâs a generational talentâ â Why signing Haaland is huge for Manchester City Even though City are within touching distance of a second successive Premier League title achieved without an orthodox centre-forward, Guardiola has always stressed his desire to have one. City tried hard to get Harry Kane from Tottenham last summer but Spurs chairman Daniel Levy refused to sell. And, with Kane having two years left on his contract, Haaland is an easier deal to conclude given his release clause. He has scored 92 league goals in 121 appearances for Molde, Red Bull Salzburg and Dortmund and last year became the youngest player to reach 20 Champions League goals. Haaland's father Alf-Inge played for City between 2000 and 2003 during a career where he also represented Leeds and Nottingham Forest. This video can not be played The Football News Show: What Haaland's Man City move means for the Premier League Watch The Football News Show on BBC iPlayer Simon Stone, BBC Sport City sources say the fee is actually 60m euros (Â£51.2m), not the 75m euros initially thought. And it is not all payable up front. Haaland will sign for five seasons, to 2027, with no optional additional year as is the case with many contracts these days. The wages are believed to be around Â£400,000 a week, roughly in line with what star midfielder Kevin de Bruyne is paid. City maintain this is an exceptional deal for a player they believe is worth 200m euros in the current market and that it vindicates their decision to walk away from negotiations around Spurs striker Kane last summer. BBC Sport has been told many of Europe's top clubs wanted Haaland but a combination of the emotional appeal of playing for the club his father played for, plus the attraction of playing for Guardiola and being part of a squad that has challenged for all the major honours over the past five seasons were the decisive factors.

BMW introduced the first car entertainment system with a built-in iPod system, and within a few years, most car manufacturers had followed suit. Steve Jobs: Career in pictures The cult of Apple's Steve Jobs But tech analysist say it was inevitable the iPhone would one day replace the iPod. ""When Apple created the iPhone it knew that it would ultimately mean the beginning of the end of the iPod,"" Ben Wood, chief analyst at technology advisory firm CCS Insight, told the BBC. Carolina Milanesi from Creative Strategies said the decline of iPod sales was connected to the rise of iPhone sales - like the move from digital sales to streaming. ""The demise of the iPod is probably the best example of Apple not being concerned about cannibalising its own products,"" she said. The iPod wasn't the first MP3 player on the market, just like the iPhone wasn't the first smartphone - but that unique Apple design proved to be the push digital music needed to start to tempt people away from CD and cassette players - and file-sharing. In 2001 the music industry was fighting for survival against illegal file-sharing as tunes were ripped and shared on platforms faster than record labels could issue legal threats. The launch of iTunes, and the iPod shortly afterwards, provided it with a lifeline in the form of revenue for legitimately purchased downloads. It also revived the fortunes of Apple, which was languishing in a market dominated by Windows PCs. It was introduced on stage by the late Steve Jobs at an event on 23 October 2001. ""With iPod, listening to music will never be the same again,"" he said. And in many ways, he was right.

Sri Lankan soldiers told to shoot law-breakers on sightTroops are on the streets after a night of anti-government unrest fuelled by an economic crisis.Asia,"Streets were largely calm on Tuesday but there were signs of the protests everywhere Sri Lankan security forces have been ordered to shoot law-breakers on sight in a bid to quell anti-government protests on the island. Demonstrators are calling for the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa over the island's worst economic crisis in history. On Monday, his brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, stepped down as prime minister amid violent street clashes. But the resignation failed to bring calm and violence continued overnight. On Tuesday, the government ordered troops to open fire on anyone looting public property or causing ""harm to life"". It also deployed tens of thousands of army, navy and air force personnel to patrol the streets of the capital Colombo. Despite their presence, the city's top police officer was assaulted on Tuesday afternoon by a mob accusing him of not doing enough to protect peaceful protesters. At Colombo's Galle Face Green, on the sea front, crowds also continued to gather. Police say eight people have died and the capital's main hospital says more than 200 people have been wounded since Monday. Some were injured by pro-government mobs, others when police fired tear gas into crowds. Lawyers acting for the protesters told the BBC they were filing cases against supporters of the prime minister. An island-wide curfew has been extended to Thursday morning as authorities seek to end the violence. Evidence of last night's rioting is everywhere across Colombo - buses thrown into the lake, others with windows smashed out and tyres still burning. This video can not be played ""I never wanted him"" - people from Sri Lanka's protests on the country's leaders In the north-east, protesters gathered in front of Trincomalee Naval Base after unconfirmed reports that Mahinda Rajapaksa had gone there with family members after escaping from his Colombo residence. More than 50 houses of politicians were burned overnight, reports say. Crowds remain outside the office of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, brother of Mahinda, calling on him to quit. Mahinda (right) served two terms as president before returning as PM under his brother (left) Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo Sri Lankans are still reeling from the violence that has erupted. Many politicians are sheltering in safe houses or avoiding appearing in public. ""It is not at all safe, particularly for politicians on the government side,"" Nalaka Godahewa, until recently media minister, told the BBC. His house was among those torched. Mahinda Rajapaksa, once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a war hero for defeating the Tamil Tiger rebels, has suddenly become a villain. Many blame his supporters for targeting anti-government protesters, which then set off a chain of violent events. The Rajapaksas have always stood together but this time their differences are out in the open. The problem appears to have started after Gotabaya asked the family patriarch Mahinda to ""take one for the team"" and resign. How the family, who have dominated Sri Lankan politics for years, overcome this crisis is now an open question. Since last month Sri Lanka has been gripped by escalating demonstrations over soaring prices and power cuts. On Monday, government supporters clashed violently with protesters in Colombo outside Mahinda Rajapaksa's Temple Trees residence, and then at the main protest site at Galle Face Green. The home of government minister Sananth Nishantha was among several set on fire Police and riot squads were deployed, and tear gas and water cannon were fired at government supporters after they breached police lines and attacked protesters using sticks and poles. Angry demonstrators retaliated, attacking government supporters and targeting ruling party MPs, including one who shot two people after a mob swarmed his car and then killed himself, according to police. As the night went on, mobs of protesters across the country torched houses belonging to the Rajapaksas, various ministers and MPs. This included a house turned into a controversial museum by the Rajapaksas in the family's ancestral village in Hambantota in southern Sri Lanka. Areas near the president's official residence were also set ablaze, according to reports. A municipal lawmaker died in hospital after an attack on his house. Following Mahinda Rajapaksa's resignation,protesters attempted to breach the inner compound of Temple Trees where he was staying along with several loyalists, and set fire to a bus outside the home. Police fired shots in the air and tear gas in an attempt to disperse them. Mr Rajapaksa was flown out of Colombo to an undisclosed location on Tuesday morning. Elsewhere in Colombo, tensions remained high. Men armed with sticks and rods had established road blocks on the routes leading to and from the airport, and police and security forces - usually a common sight in the area - were nowhere to be seen. Vehicles were set alight outside Mahinda Rajapaksa's official residence Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Britain in 1948, and people are furious because the cost of living has become unaffordable. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, and people can no longer afford essential items including food, medicines and fuel. The government has requested emergency financial help. It blames the Covid pandemic, which all but killed off Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners.

Nurse who filmed unconscious patients jailed,"Grayson preyed on his unconscious victims while in hospital, a court heard A nurse ""fixated by sex"" who filmed up the gowns of unconscious hospital patients has been jailed for 12 years. Paul Grayson videoed four women as they recovered from surgery at Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital. The 51-year-old also recorded four female nurses and a support worker using the toilet at the hospital. Jailing Grayson, who admitted 23 offences, Judge Jeremy Richardson QC said he had ""brought shame on an honourable profession"". Grayson was also told he would be subject to an extended licence period of four years when he is eventually released. Passing sentence at Sheffield Crown Court, Judge Richardson said he had ""betrayed every ounce of trust reposed in you"". ""You have already been stripped of your status as a nurse by your professional body. So you should be,"" he added. Referring to a pre-sentence report, Judge Richardson said Grayson had been described as a ""dangerous offender"" who was ""fixated by sex"" and who satisfied that fixation by committing the crimes. Many of the offences took place at Sheffield's Royal Hallamshire Hospital The nurse, who had more than 25 years' experience, also filmed two other young women not connected to the hospital with hidden cameras. His crimes came to light after one victim launched an investigation into Grayson and uncovered computer files documenting the offences. She previously told the court she had been ""torn into pieces"" as a result of his ""sick and disgusting perversions"". Grayson was arrested in December 2020 and was immediately suspended from work, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals previously said in a statement. Video showed Grayson, wearing his scrubs and with a name badge, installing the hidden cameras, South Yorkshire Police said. One of the filmed patients has never been identified, while other women in the toilet footage remain unknown. Grayson, of Woodstock Road, Sheffield, pleaded guilty to charges including: 14 charges of voyeurism three charges of sexual assaults one charge of upskirting one charge of taking indecent images of a child one charge of installing recording equipment for the purposes of sexual gratification three charges of possessing indecent images of children Prof Chris Morley, chief nurse at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, said what Grayson did was ""truly despicable"" and ""unforgivable"". ""While this was an incredibly rare occurrence, we never want it to happen to anyone else and as a result we are examining all of the information now available to determine if there are any further measures, we can take to limit the opportunity for someone to do this in the future,"" he added. Det Sgt Sarah Dolby, of South Yorkshire Police, said instead of taking care of the unconscious women who were the victims of his filming, Grayson instead committed ""utterly horrendous acts"". She added: ""In interview, Grayson admitted having an insatiable addiction to voyeurism and pornography. I have no doubt had he not been caught, his offending would have continued.""

Rebekah Vardy: 'I didn't leak anything to anyone',"Courtroom sketch of Wayne Rooney and Coleen Rooney watching on as Rebekah Vardy gave evidence Rebekah Vardy has denied leaking information to newspapers as she gave evidence in her libel case against Coleen Rooney at the High Court. The wife of ex-footballer Wayne Rooney is being sued for libel after claiming Vardy, the wife of striker Jamie, leaked her private information. ""I didn't give any information to a newspaper,"" Mrs Vardy said on Tuesday, ""I have been called a leak and it's not nice."" Under questioning from Mrs Rooney's barrister David Sherborne on day one of the trial, Mrs Vardy agreed it was ""upsetting"" and ""wrong"" for someone to secretly pass on another person's information, adding that she respected people's privacy. Mr Sherborne then questioned Mrs Vardy about a story she had once given to the News Of The World about her alleged sexual encounter with singer Peter Andre. Asked whether it was ""respectful"" of Andre's ""right not to share this information"" with the paper, she replied: ""I was forced into a situation by my ex-husband to do this"". She added: ""It is something that I deeply regret"". Coleen Rooney was accompanied at the High Court by husband and former footballer Wayne Earlier on Tuesday,Mrs Rooney's barrister told the court there had been a ""widespread and significant destruction or loss of evidence""in the case. The loss of Mrs Vardy's documents ""must be concealment"", Mr Sherborne said. But Mrs Vardy's barrister Hugh Tomlinson described the claim as ""completely baseless"". The court has heard that Mrs Vardy's agent, Caroline Watt, had lost her phone in the North Sea after it was hit by a wave before Mrs Rooney's team could see WhatsApp messages that could potentially help her case. Mr Sherborne told the court on the trial's opening day there had been ""a concerted effort to ensure highly relevant and incriminating"" documents didn't make it to court. He said a series of ""most improbable events"" had affected the disclosure of evidence, including Ms Watt's ""poor unfortunate phone"" falling into the sea ""within days"" of the court ordering that it should be searched for disclosure. ""What terrible luck,"" Mr Sherborne said. In a written submission, he added: ""To borrow from Wilde, to lose one significant set of documents may be regarded as a misfortune, to lose two, carelessness, but to lose 10? That must be concealment."" Rebekah Vardy arriving at the High Court Mr Tomlinson countered that it had not been suggested ""that Mrs Vardy was anywhere near the North Sea at the time"" nor that she ""knew anything about it"". He added that there was a ""credible, ordinary, boring explanation"" behind media files on Mrs Vardy's WhatsApp account no longer being available. ""It's a very well-known and common feature in everyone's life that from time to time electronic documents are lost for all kinds of reasons,"" he said, adding: ""This is something that happens to us all, that sometimes documents are lost."" The row dates back to 2019, when Mrs Rooney said she had posted fake stories online that she claimed could only have been seen by Mrs Vardy's Instagram account, and that had been leaked to The Sun newspaper. Wayne Rooney and Jamie Vardy played together for England She was later dubbed Wagatha Christie after saying she had carried out an investigation to find out who was behind the leaks. Mrs Vardy strenuously denied being the source of the leaks and said a number of people had access to her accounts. In a pre-trial hearing less than two weeks before the trial began, Mrs Rooney's barrister said Mrs Vardy now ""appears to accept"" that Ms Watt was the source of leaked stories. Ms Watt has denied being the source of the leaks and has been deemed too ill to testify. Mrs Rooney's barrister compared Mrs Vardy's connection with Ms Watt in relation to the leaks as ""like hiring a hit man or woman"". He said: ""Just because you're not the person who gets their hands dirty, doesn't mean you're not equally responsible."" Mrs Vardy, he stressed, ""is just as responsible"" for the stories being leaked even ""if she doesn't pull the trigger"". He said there had also been ""numerous examples of the claimant and Ms Watt conspiring to pass private and personal information on to the press about other individuals"". Coleen Rooney was wearing a protective boot as she attended court But Mr Tomlinson said that if Ms Watt was the source of leaked stories, ""that's not something that Mrs Vardy knew anything about"" and she did not ""approve of or authorise"" her to do so. He told the court that Mrs Vardy ""had no choice"" but to bring the libel claim against Mrs Rooney because she needed to ""establish her innocence and vindicate her reputation"". Mr Tomlinson said on Tuesday that, if information had been leaked, ""this was not something that was done with Mrs Vardy's knowledge or authority"". He said there was ""no information"" in any evidence to demonstrate that Mrs Vardy had even viewed Mrs Rooney's Instagram posts during the alleged ""sting operation"". Wagatha case: What to know as the trial starts Wagatha Christie: A uniquely British feud Coleen Rooney in Twitter row with Rebekah Vardy Rebekah Vardy âappears to acceptâ PR leaked stories The fake stories posted by Mrs Rooney included planning her return to TV, travelling to Mexico for a ""gender selection"" procedure and her basement flooding. Mr Tomlinson said the affair and subsequent libel case had garnered huge press coverage and had become a source of ""entertainment"" in the media. But he added: ""This is far from being an entertaining case. It has been profoundly distressing and disturbing."" Mr Tomlinson added: ""[Mrs Vardy] needs to be able to clear her name through this case, so she can move on from this terrible episode."" He said that as a result of Mrs Rooney's post, Mrs Vardy - who was seven months pregnant at the time - and her family were subjected to abuse, including posts saying she should die. With pride and reputations at stake on both sides, the onus is on the defendant, Mrs Rooney, to prove that it was in fact Mrs Vardy who leaked the stories. Mr Sherborne, for Mrs Rooney, told the court: ""She's not here because she wants to be, she's here because she has to be."" Her investigation into the leaks was ""deeply upsetting"" for Mrs Rooney and made her feel ""paranoid"", he told the court. Coleen Rooney (left) and Rebekah Vardy, pictured at a Euro 2016 match in France The celebrity civil trial - which will be decided by a judge, not a jury - is set to run for seven days. Mrs Rooney arrived at court in a surgical boot alongside her husband - reminiscent of when Wayne injured his foot before the 2006 World Cup, the same tournament where the England ""Wags"" (wives and girlfriends) first exploded on to the scene. Journalists queued to get inside a packed courtroom for this most intriguing of cases. Mrs Vardy sat at the front left bench with her hair in a bun, wearing a blue dress, while Mrs Rooney, wearing a black jacket, sat at the front right bench.

Putin has not wrecked Glasgow Climate Pact - Kerry,"This video can not be played John Kerry says countries have to raise ambitions after COP26 US climate envoy John Kerry says the war in Ukraine has not wrecked the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed last year. Russia's invasion has ""presented a challenge"" in the battle against global warming but could be overcome, he said. Large reductions in carbon emissions are required if temperature rises are to be kept below 1.5C. In a BBC interview, Mr Kerry said some countries needed to ""raise ambitions"" if the most dangerous effects of climate change were to be prevented. According to a UN report, the world ison track to warm by 3.2C this centuryif countries only follow through on commitments made before the Glasgow summit. This would lead to ""unprecedented heatwaves, terrifying storms, and widespread water shortages"". To avoid that fate, the world must keep the rise in temperatures at or under 1.5C this century, researchers have said, and reach peak CO2 emissions by 2025. What was agreed at COP26? UN scientists: It's 'now or never' to fix climate change COP26 promises will hold warming under 2C Speaking to BBC Scotland'sNo Hot Air podcast, Mr Kerry said the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow was ""enormously successful in raising ambition"". Around 120 world leaders came to COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021 He said if all the commitments made by nations at the summit were fulfilled, Earth ""would be at 1.8 degrees of warming by 2050"", but there has ""not been enough movement to implement those promises"". ""The bottom line is we're in trouble right now unless we can turn things around faster over the next eight years,"" he said. ""We have to still fight for the 1.5, as hard as it may be. But I remain an optimist, because I think that if we do what we've promised to do, we can have a 45% global cut globally between now and 2030."" COP26 President Alok Sharma said in January that the agreements reached at the Glasgow climate meeting had been a""fragile win"" for the worldbut progress made during the summit was at risk of ""withering on the vine"". Since the climate summit in November, Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, has led to disruption in global fossil fuel supplies and increasinglywidespread sanctions against Russia by Western countries. Mr Kerry said: ""He hasn't wrecked [the climate pact], but he's presented a challenge to it."" He said there remained a question mark over what would happen with Russia's emissions, but the war had forced Europe to act faster. ""What Vladimir Putin has done by using gas energy as a weapon, is to convince Europe that it has to move faster,"" Mr Kerry said. ""So, in fact, Europe is going to try to move to deploy renewable energy, wind, solar, etc, much faster than they originally had planned. ""The key will be finding greater levels of finance on an international basis to accelerate the transition to those renewables so that investment begins to move there faster."" He said hopes for a limit of global warming at 1.5C were weak but ""still existing"". Tens of thousands of people protested during the COP26 summit demanding action on climate change However, Mr Kerry said a 1.5C rise would avoid only the the worst consequences of climate change, not the crisis. ""We need to get to work,"" Mr Kerry said. ""We need to deploy far more renewables. We need to be accelerating research and development. We need to be living up to the promises that we've made. ""We still can do that, and we have to get about the business of enforcing it."" In the US, President Biden hoped to get legislation for a ""very reasonable but appropriately ambitious programme"" through Congress at some point soon, Mr Kerry said, but he had the ability to use an executive order if that did not happen. Mr Kerry said he would continue in his role as climate envoy. ""What motivates me is the fact that we can win this battle,"" he said. ""I must stay at it while I feel like I'm moving it forward and I can be most effective in what I'm trying to do."" He added: ""The downside of not achieving what we have to achieve is that things will happen that are irreversible. ""We pass the tipping point, which some scientists think we may have passed, of the Arctic, of the Antarctic, of coral reefs, of any of them being... disaster and catastrophe."" Lang Banks, of the conservation charity WWF Scotland, said there remained a ""giant gap"" between global action and what science called for to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C. He said the climate promises made in Glasgow had to be heeded, and that ""urgent, ambitious and robust action from industrialised nations"" was needed to limit emissions. The world has changed in the six months since Glasgow hosted the UN climate summit, COP26. Global warming is no less a threat but rising energy prices made worse by the war has shifted political priorities. For some countries, securing alternatives to Russian oil and gas supplies is a more pressing concern than cutting carbon emissions. John Kerry - who describes himself as an optimist - thinks it should be possible to do both. He argues that Vladimir Putin has weaponised Russian energy and in doing so has convinced Europe to speed up a switch to renewables that will help tackle climate change. He also acknowledges Glasgow's wider goal of keeping alive the possibility of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C may be in trouble. That has always required some countries, ideally including China and India, to increase their carbon-cutting ambitions in 2022 and that simply hasn't happened yet to anything like the required degree.

But the sorry consequence of marrying Olena now in case something happens to him if he's called up, is his parents can't be there on his big day. ""Mama don't cry,"" Sasha tells his mum, who has fled to the sanctuary of Wales. Mum, also called Olena, and dad Joseph will watch the wedding on a Skype video call. Sasha's mum was in her home-town of Odesa in the south of the country whenRussia invaded Ukraine in Februarybut she fled afterher husband, originally from the UK, made a mercy dash from Walesto get her. 'Children drank rainwater from puddles to survive' Slow Russian advance continues in the east 'My world was destroyed by a Russian missile' Sasha wasn't able to escape with them because men under 60 aren't allowed to leave Ukraine in case they're needed to help the war effort. So Sasha's parents suffered the heartbreak of leaving their son, a 21-year-old barber withcongenital heart disease,external, behind in Odesa, a major port and Ukraine's third biggest city, which still remains in Ukraine control. Sasha and his girlfriend plan to remain in Ukraine to be with her family Now mum Olena faces the added upset of missing Sasha's wedding on 1 June, two years after meeting his girlfriend online. ""It's very hard,"" said Sasha's mum from her new home in Tredegar in the Gwent Valleys. ""I didn't want to leave him there. If something happened now in Odesa I won't find myself any peace."" Parents Joseph and Olena feel powerless watching the Ukraine war unfold from a flat in south Wales Between regular warning sirens, Sasha shows his parents what daily life looks like for him now, including in the bunker he's built under their garage. ""We're used to the sirens, but you know, when you see a lot of people running and panicking, you do the same,"" said Sasha. Odesa, one of Ukraine's biggest cities, remains in Ukraine control in their war with Russia ""Everyone was pushing, some fell down, it was scary, but I'm still pretty much going to stay here and do what I can."" Joseph is concerned how much water and food Sasha has left and has urged him to stockpile more in case of a biological attack, or water shortages. Ukraine - the narrative the West doesn't hear Where have Ukraine's millions of refugees gone? Families hide in cellars as war in east intensifies ""He's got a heart condition, so with the best will in the world he's not going to last five minutes in those circumstances,"" said his worried father. ""I just want him to live."" While Olena is enjoying the sanctuary of south Wales, her mind is always back with her only child. ""I hate to think of chemical or biological weapons, I don't want my son to suffer because of someone's ambition,"" she said. Sasha and girlfriend Olena's relationship started after a first date out having pizza ""In the morning, first thing, the phone is in my hands... until I go bedâ¦ and I'm watching until I get tired and fall asleep. It's always on your mind... always, you can't let it go."" Joseph is helping his wife apply for a visa to remain in the UK as Olena clings on to hope she'll see her son and soon-to-be daughter-in-law again. Sasha is a hairdresser in Odesa and hopes to see his parents soon ""It's very peaceful here, this is how life should be,"" she said. ""I hope he will be ok, this is what is keeping me going.

PM focus on economic worries as agenda unveiled,"This video can not be played Queen's speech: Five traditions that changed The government has promised to tackle sharp rises in the cost of living by boosting the economy, as it set out its plans in the Queen's Speech. But Boris Johnson warned that the government could not ""shield everyone"" from the effect of global inflation. Labour has called for an emergency budget to address the cost of living and a windfall tax on energy companies to fund more support for households. This year's Queen's Speech contained 38 bills and draft bills. In the speech, delivered by Prince Charles in the Queen's absence, the government set out the new laws it plans to bring in over the coming year. Priorities included energy security, carbon emissions and post-Brexit economic arrangements - but the opposition parties, and some Tories, said it should have contained more on living costs. Queen's Speech at-a-glance Backlash as workers' rights bill sidelined Government tries again to ban 'guerrilla' protests TheBank of England is warning,externalthat inflation could hit around 10% later this year. The three main opposition parties are all demanding an emergency Budget, with tax cuts and benefit rises to help struggling households. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the legislative agenda set out in the Queen's Speech was ""bereft of ideas"" and ""without a guiding principle or a road map for delivery"". Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey said millions of households would be ""bitterly disappointed"" with the government plans. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused ministers of a ""deafening silence"" over potential rises in poverty. In response, Mr Johnson argued wider economic reforms would help households, telling MPs: ""However great our compassion and commitment, we cannot simply spend our way out of problems. ""We need to grow our economy out of these problems by creating hundreds of thousands of high-waged, high-skilled jobs across the country."" He also hinted at an announcement on the cost of living in the coming days, although Downing Street said the PM was referring to the wider work being done in departments to address the pressures households face. Prince William was among the senior royals at the Palace of Westminster The political parties will spend several days debating the contents of the Queen's Speech. It includes seven bills that ministers say will help deliver the benefits of Brexit, while a Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill is expected to change planning rules in England. The government said its Energy Security Bill would ""accelerate our transition to more secure, more affordable and cleaner homegrown energy supplies"". Meanwhile, a Public Order Bill would create a criminal offence, with a maximum sentence of 12 months, of ""interfering with key national infrastructure"" such as airports, railways and printing presses. How will the Police and Crime Bill change protests? What is levelling up and how is it going? The Liberal Democrats called the proposed changes ""dangerous and draconian"", but Home Secretary Priti Patel argued they were needed to deal with a ""self-indulgent minority who seem to revel in causing mayhem and misery"".

"My body can't continue, says Big C's Deborah James","Ms James investigated how the NHS managed cancer care during the pandemic for BBC Panorama Podcast host Deborah James has said she is receiving hospice-at-home care for her bowel cancer and ""nobody knows how long I've got left"". The 40-year-old presenter of the BBC's You, Me and the Big C said she has had a ""heart-breaking"" six months but is ""surrounded by love"". ""My body just can't continue anymore,""she said in a post on Instagram,external. James was diagnosed in 2016 and kept her thousands of followers updated with candid accounts of her treatment. The former deputy head teacher said a Bowelbabe Fund - named after her online handle - was being set up to fund research into personalised medicine for cancer patients, and to support campaigns to raise awareness of bowel cancer. Since going live on Monday evening, the fund has already raised over Â£1m. James told her Instagram followers she was ""utterly blown away"" by the response to her appeal. She wrote: ""I never in my wildest dreams thought we'd be waking up to this total 12 hours later. I'm actually crying!"" In December, the mother-of-two reflected on the five years that had passed since she was told she had incurable cancer, saying: ""I'm fully aware I shouldn't be alive to write this today."" But in a new post on her Instagram page, @bowelbabe, she said she had to deliver ""the message I never wanted to write"". BBC presenter Rachael Bland dies aged 40 Rachael Bland 'changed my life' Big C podcast presenter 'in cancer-free place' James said her cancer was no longer being actively treated and instead the focus was on ensuring she was not in pain - allowing her to spend time with her ""incredible family"", who were all around her. ""Nobody knows how long I've got left but I'm not able to walk, I'm sleeping most of the days, and most things I took for granted are pipe dreams,"" she said. ""I know we have left no stone unturned. But even with all the innovative cancer drugs in the world or some magic new breakthrough, my body just can't continue anymore."" This video can not be played Watch: Deborah James speaks about her diagnosis to raise awareness (May 2019) The presenter was told she was free of cancer in January 2020, with doctors telling her they could ""find no evidence of active disease"", but it returned later the same year. Writing in her column in the Sun newspaper in December 2020, she said: ""I can never relax. I've been blindsided by my cancer too many times for that. I can never feel secure, and that comes with so many challenges. I never really feel at peace with it, and I don't think I ever will."" James began co-presenting You, Me and the Big C alongside Lauren Mahon and BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland in 2018, with the show earning praise for its frank discussion of cancer. They spoke to celebrity guests and addressed practical matters including hair loss, tips for dealing with finances and telling your nearest and dearest. Bland died at the age of 40 six months after the show launched. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer two years earlier. Her husband, Steve Bland, took her place on the podcast after she died. Congratulating James on her fundraiser, Bland wrote on Instagram: ""Just so so so proud of this wonderful, inspirational woman that I get to call one of my best friends."" Bland said the change in James's condition was ""absolutely heartbreaking"" but that he would continue to focus on ""all the amazing things"" she was doing. ""She's still changing lives and she's still creating this incredible legacy so we've still got her, so we'll focus on that,"" he told the BBC. If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visitBBC Action Line. James has been praised for her no-nonsense approach to talking about cancer, and she has shared her experiences of treatment and daily life with her social media followers since her diagnosis. She has worked to remove the embarrassment factor from bowel cancer, and even shared a video of herself walking down the street dressed as a poo emoji to encourage people to watch out for changes to their bowel movements. Genevieve Edwards, chief executive of the charity Bowel Cancer UK (of which James is a patron), said the number of lives that the podcaster has saved and will continue to save with her awareness and fundraising was ""nothing short of incredible"". She told the BBC: ""We're all desperately, desperately sad to have this news and our hearts are with Deborah and her family at this time."" Stacey Heale, 42, was put in touch with James by the charity after her husband Greg was diagnosed with bowel cancer in the same week as the presenter. She says: ""I was young. I was 36 when he was diagnosed. We'd just had two babies. And I was like, 'Who on earth do I talk to?'"" Stacey Heale's husband Greg was diagnosed with bowel cancer in the same week as Deborah James The mother-of-two says she and James began exchanging emails about Greg's treatment and became friends. ""What she's so good at is showing people how tolivewith cancer,"" she says. ""That was always her thing. It was always about living.""

James explained her son and daughter had accessed counselling through their schools but had now paused sessions. ""In true fashion of my children, they went to their first session, went to their second session, I think, and then Eloise was like: 'Mummy, I just wanna play hockey' and Hugo hasn't turned up again,"" she said.

She said: ""I had a figure in my mind of about a quarter of a million, because I thought that would be enough to fund a good couple of projects across the charities that I wanted to fund. ""But in 24 hours to do a million, I'm like absolutely mind blown and I just cannot thank people enough for their generosity. ""Because it just means so much to me. It makes me feel utterly loved. ""It makes me feel like we're all kind of in it at the end together and we all want to make a difference."" This video can not be played Watch: Deborah James speaks about her diagnosis to raise awareness (May 2019) After the opening day's whirlwind fundraising efforts - which has seen donations from more than 85,000 people - James told the BBC that her dying wish was to help raise money for the ""things that gave me life"". She explained that were it not for experimental treatments she would have died at least two years ago, adding that she wanted other people to be given the same opportunities. James said: ""Ultimately what I really want to happen is I don't want any other Deborahs to have to go through this. ""We know that when we catch cancer early, we can cure it. We know that much more investment needs to take place in cancer."" She added it was clear the UK had ""skills and the passion"" to develop new cancer therapies, but sometimes a reminder was needed to get a ""boost"" for funding.

James began co-presenting You, Me and the Big C alongside Lauren Mahon and BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland in 2018, with the show earning praise for its frank discussion of cancer. They spoke to celebrity guests and addressed practical matters including hair loss, tips for dealing with finances and telling your nearest and dearest. Bland died at the age of 40 six months after the show launched. She had been diagnosed with breast cancer two years earlier. Speaking about her friend on their podcast, James said she she was ""always in my mind actually, even now"". ""I just don't know how brave she must have been to do what she did, because I don't feel that brave. ""I think I'm still in awe of how she just seemed to just take it in her stride and, quite frankly, I'm a quivering mess half the time. But I think if she can do it, I can do it and I'll go and party with her."" James has been praised for her no-nonsense approach to talking about cancer online, and has shared her experiences of treatment and daily life with her social media followers since her diagnosis. She has worked to remove the embarrassment factor from bowel cancer, and even shared a video of herself walking down the street dressed as a poo emoji to encourage people to watch out for changes to their bowel movements.

MPs are still debating the speech in the House of Commons. If you want to continue following the action, you can do so by watchingBBC Parliament. But for now, itâs goodbye from us in Westminster! Extravagant pageantry, archaic rituals and feisty debate - Parliament has pulled out all the stops today for its formal opening, which is marked by the Queenâs Speech. As we wind down our live coverage, letâs reflect on the main events of the day: Royal procession: The day started with Prince Charles arriving at Parliament in a motorcade, as he stood in for the Queen,who pulled out with mobility problems. He entered the House of Lords with the Duchess of Cornwall and his son Prince William. Princeâs speech: Inside the Lords, Prince Charles sat centre stage to deliver the Queenâs Speech (but not on the Queenâs throne, which had been removed). In his full regalia, Charles delivered a speech, setting out the legislative priorities of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. Agenda unveiled: In the speech,the government promised to tackle sharp rises in the cost of living by boosting the economy. The speech included proposals for laws including energy security, carbon emissions and post-Brexit economic arrangements. You can read our at-a-glance guidehere. MPs debate: When the Royals left, the politicians became the focus of attention in the House of Commons. They debated the Queenâs Speech, with Johnson, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and other MPs having their say. Timeâs up: Sir Keir told MPs the government had to face up to the cost-of-living crisis and the challenge of a stagnating economy to ""get Britain growing again"". ""We have a government whose time is passed, a cabinet out of ideas and out of energy, led by a prime minister who is entirely out of touch,â Starmer said. Brexit benefits: In reply, Johnson defended his governmentâs plans, which he said would âunleash the benefitsâ of Brexit. He said he would âgrow our way out ofâ the economic doldrums, âby creating hundreds of thousands of new high wage, high skilled jobs all across the countryâ. What now?: Itâs not over yet. MPs will debate the Queenâs Speech over the next few days before it is put to a vote. The speech is expected to pass unopposed, as is custom. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News A national security bill has been long awaited but could
still prove controversial. Government first promised action after the 2018
Salisbury poisonings and then after the 2020 Russia report to deal with new
threats posed by so-called hostile states. An alert this year about Chinese
interference in Parliament, as well as concerns about Russian influence
following its invasion of Ukraine, heightened pressure for action. This will
include updating the Official Secrets Act legislation to cover a wider range of
activity that the security services argue do harm to the country. But one
element which could be controversial is if there is no public interest defence
for journalists and others when it comes to dealing with sensitive information. Also consulted on were plans for those working on behalf of foreign states to
register their activity. This is designed to increase transparency but here, if
part of a final bill, the controversy could be over how broadly it is focused
and who might have to declare their work, for instance lawyers working for
Russian oligarchs linked to the state. Sir Ed Davey says The leader of the Liberal Democrats says today's Queen's Speech should have focused on the cost of living, but ""offered nothing"". Sir Ed Davey points to a hint made by Boris Johnson earlier that more support was in its way in the coming days, which has already been knocked down by the Treasury. ""People desperately need more help from the government,"" says Sir Ed, ""but what have they received instead? ""Tax rises, broken election promises on pension rises, and wages rising far slower than inflation."" Theresa May has warned her successor as PM, Boris Johnson, against taking new powers to tear up the part of the Brexit withdrawal deal relating to Northern Ireland. The UK government has been trying to renegotiate thissection of the dealfor a long time and has been threatening to take unilateral action if the EU does not agree to wider changes. It had been reported a bill would be included in the Queen's Speech to do this. In the end it wasn't - but it is understood a bill could still be introduced. May says to take new powers in this area âwould not be the right move for the governmentâ. She adds that the government needs to consider ""the wider sense of what such a move would say about the UK and its willingness to abide by treaties it has signed"". Reality Check Boris Johnson told MPs that one of the achievements of his
government had been âcreating a tax cut for 30 million workersâ. He is talking about the change in the Spring Statement,
which means that from July, employees will be able to earn Â£12,570 before they
start having to pay National Insurance, which is Â£2,690 more than they were
previously able to earn. That will indeed be a cut in National Insurance for most
workers, but it is not the whole picture. National Insurance went up in April by 1.25p in the pound.
Also, the threshold at which workers start paying income tax has been frozen,
which is effectively a big tax rise, especially at a time of high inflation. If
that is taken into account then many fewer people have had a tax cut overall. And we know from the governmentâs independent forecaster
the Office for Budget Responsibility that the overall tax burden is going to
rise from 33% of GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) in 2019-20 to 36.3%
of GDP in 2026-27, which will be the highest since the late 1940s. You can read more about it here. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent The government says it wants to raise standards not only in schools in England, but also in higher education. Its most radical plan is itsLifelong Loan Entitlement,external, which would allow students at any stage of life to access loans worth the equivalent of four years of post-18 education (that's Â£37,000 in today's fees). Other proposed changes, though, are exactly that - they'reproposals, and have yet to be firmed up. One is theintroduction of minimum grade requirementsfor student loans - such as having English and maths GCSEs, or two A-levels at grade E. The other is to limit the number of university places on some courses in England to ""tackle uncontrolled growth of low-quality courses"". Both plans are subject to a consultation, so we'll have to watch this space. Charities have warned that minimum grade requirements could hit poorer students hardest, while universities said limiting places would be ""placing a cap on aspiration"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Housing announcements in the Queen's Speech have been broadly welcomed by those campaigning for change to the rental sector. But many argue that banning no-fault evictions of private tenants and strengthening rights for those in social housing is long overdue. Theresa May first proposed scrapping so-called ""Section 21"" evictions, where tenants can be evicted with 8 weeks' notice, in April 2019. Boris Johnson then pledged to do the same in his general election manifesto later that year. More than one fifth of renters did not end their last tenancy by choice the government's own figures show. Campaigners argue too many families are ""on the brink"" of homelessness as the cost of living continues to rise. Landlords' groups have welcomed moves to strengthen their ability to evict anti-social tenants and those in persistent rent arrears but argue broader reforms are needed. Along with cautious optimism about the government's plans are warnings from across the housing sector that the detail will be crucial, and that time is of the essence.  Reality Check In the the Queenâs Speech debate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government was âbuilding new hospitals... 48 of them in factâ. The government has three definitions of what constitutes a ""new"" hospital:  Ananalysisby BBC Reality Check and the Nuffield Trust in December 2021, found that of 40 hospital projects announced by the government 22 are rebuilding projects, 12 will be new wings within existing hospitals, three involve rebuilding non-urgent care hospitals and three are entirely new hospitals. The 48 figure mentioned by Mr Johnson includes a âcompetition for 8 further hospitals including new Mental Health Hospitalsâ.  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent It does not seem like the government is building up to
another big announcement on the cost of living, despite Boris Johnson saying in his speech he would have ""more to say"" about it in the coming days. No 10 insiders say the PM was referring to the wider work
being done in departments to ease the cost of living. Ministers held a special cabinet last week looking
at ideas, which included relaxing rules on child care in nurseries and how often cars need an MOT. A cabinet will be held outside London later this week, sources say it will focus on some of the cost of living issues. But don't expect a major policy change soon. Reality Check Sir Keir
Starmer and Boris Johnson clashed in the House of Commons over the growth of
the UK economy. The
Labour leader said that the UK would be: âthe slowest growing economy in the G7
next yearâ. Boris
Johnson said âwe had the fastest economic growth in the G7 last year and will
return to that status, by the way, by 2024. The
G7 is a club of major developed economies. Theyâre
both right and using IMF forecasts and comparisons, but theyâre talking about
different years. It
is correct to say we had the fastest growth last year, are forecast to have
relatively slow growth next year and then relatively fast growth two years
later. If
you look over a longer period, from before the pandemic to forecasts up to
2025, the UK is actually in the middle of the pack. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford says there was a ""gaping hole"" in the speech on energy policy, and accuses the government of ""fleecing"" Scotland of its ""green present and future"". He also accuses ministers of ""refusing to match"" Scottish government funding on renewable energy. He also criticises the proposed Brexit Freedoms Bill - giving ministers new powers to change EU-era laws - as an ""attack"" on the power of devolved governments.  Will this much-trumpeted proposal ever happen? Dominic CascianiLegal Correspondent The governmentâs long-delayed pledge to give victims of crime basic rights about how they will be treated at one of the most vulnerable points in their life has been delayed yet again. Ministers have just consulted on law which would do really simple things: force the police and prosecutors to tell victims, who may be terrified of giving evidence, what is happening to their case, for a start, But the Queenâs Speech only promises a âDraft Victims Billâ - Parliament-speak for an unfinished blueprint that needs working on, rather than something thatâs oven-ready. That means thereâs no certainty at all that the proposed law -first promised eight years and three prime ministerâs ago- will become reality in this Parliamentary session. Thatâs at a time when the government is already defending record delays in the courts thanks to a combination of pandemic backlogs and preceding cuts to judges - delays that have seen many victims, as I have reported,losing faith in ever getting justice. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford uses his speech to highlight the Tories' ""drubbing"" at last week's local elections, adding it shows this government is ""on its last legs"". He contrasts this with the performance of his party, which he says shows people in Scotland demand ""the choice of an independent future"". Like Labour, he criticises the ""lack of immediate action"" in the Queen's Speech to tackle rising living costs, which he calls ""Tory-made"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Opposition parties have been calling for measures like a
windfall tax on energy companies to help with rising bills â and an emergency
budget to address the cost of living. Boris Johnson hinted at an announcement on the cost of
living in the next few days. But the Treasury has been making it clear that it doesnât
want to make concrete plans for support until it knows what the energy price
cap will be. An emergency budget is not going to happen, say my
sources. Nearing the end of his speech, Johnson says âweâll get through the aftershocks of Covid just as we got through Covidâ. He says weâll do so ânot through irresponsible spendingâ, but by âurgently pressing on with our missionâ, which is stimulating the economy. He says thatâs the long-term solution to address the rising cost of living and get our country back on track after the pandemic. âThat is what this Queenâs Speech delivers,â he says. With that, his speech is finished. Labour's Sarah Owen calls on the PM to apologise Earlier, there was an intervention from Labour's Sarah Owen - unusual when the PM is outlining the measures in the Queen's Speech. She says: ""What we haven't heard yet is an apology - an apology to the pensioners that are choosing between heating and eating, an apology to the children that have gone hungry throughout school holidays, and an apology to the hundreds of thousands of family members of Covid victims that were lost during the pandemic."" Johnson says the government is ""doing all we can"" to help people, including pensioners. And he says they have put in Â£9.2bn to help with heating, among other measures. But, he adds: ""Be in no doubt, I think this is what everyone in the country has to understand, what we are doing is making sure that we have a strong economy with high wage, high skilled jobs that will enable us to take our country forward."" The PM says heâs âtaking forward this countryâs energy strategyâ, highlighting the new Energy Security Bill in the Queenâs Speech. His comments are greeted by groans on the Labour benches, but Johnson says the party âdidnât want a single nuclear power stationâ when it was in government. He calls Labour MPs âgreat quivering jellies of indecisionâ and promises âvast new green industriesâ. Now turning to Brexit, he pledges to âunleash the benefitsâ of leaving the EU and make the UK the âbest regulated country in the worldâ. He said the government would use âour new freedoms to control our bordersâ and âfix our broken asylum systemâ. The government will act with urgency to ease âthe burdens on families and businesses across the land"", Johnson says. The rising cost of living - and the governmentâs plans to address it - featured prominently in the Queenâs Speech. Johnson lists some ways in which the government has already helped households with living costs, including Â£9.1bn to assist with energy bills, and a council tax rebate worth Â£150. But, he says, âhowever great our compassion and our ingenuity, we cannot simply spend our way out of this problemâ. He says we need to âgrow our way out of it, by creating hundreds of thousands of new high wage, high skilled jobs all across the countryâ. Now turning to the war in Ukraine, Johnson says he spoke to G7 counterparts and Ukraineâs president on Sunday. He says he urged them to go further and faster in supporting Ukraine, and expressed sorrow at what had been happening in Mariupol, where alleged war crimes had been committed. He says the UK should be proud that it has âled the wayâ, by providing weapons to Ukraine to defend itself against Russia. âLet the message ring out in the chamber today: we will persevere in our in support of Ukraine,â he says.

Flight aborted as passengers get plane crash picsThe Turkish plane was about to take off from Israel when passengers' phones were sent the images.,"The Anadolujet (library image) was carrying 160 passengers when it was forced to abort The captain of a Turkish AnadoluJet flight aborted its take-off at Israel's main airport after passengers received plane crash images on their phones. Israel's aviation authority said the aircraft was taxiing at Ben Gurion Airport when the incident happened. Passengers and crew were taken off and the luggage reinspected. Several young Israelis were identified as suspects and are being questioned. The plane departed five hours late after being cleared to leave. The AnadoluJet Boeing 737, with 160 passengers on board, was on its way to the take-off position when passengers alerted crew that they had received the photos. The captain was informed and decided to return to the terminal. The Hebrew Ynet news site reported that the images were shared via AirDrop, an Apple service which enables users to send files from one Apple device to another across short distances. All the images were received on iPhones, it said. The pictures included images of a Turkish Airlines plane which crashed in the Netherlands in 2009 and another plane crash in the United States in 2013, Ynet said. Passengers were told they could reboard the reinspected plane, which was headed to Istanbul, or stay in Israel. The incident comes two weeks after another security scare at Ben Gurion Airport. It happened whena family from the US produced a live artillery shell at check-in, which they had planned to take home as a souvenir. There was pandemonium as travellers fled the area, with one person requiring hospital treatment after falling over a conveyor belt in the rush to escape.

Ukraine's EU bid will take decades - Macron,"Mr Macron (L) later joined German leader Olaf Scholz in Berlin It will take decades for Ukraine to be accepted into the European Union, France's Emmanuel Macron has said. In a speech to the EU's parliament in Strasbourg, he instead suggested Ukraine could join a ""parallel European community"" while it awaited a decision. This would allow non-EU members to join Europe's security architecture in other ways, said President Macron. His words came as fierce fighting continued in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia is trying to make gains. A senior US defence official characterised the Russian advance as ""single-digit kilometre kind of progress"". A Ukrainian leader in the Luhansk region said serious battles were taking place.

"Ukraine's EU bid will take decades - MacronThe French leader suggests other ways the EU can help Ukraine, other than fast tracking its membership.EuropeComments","Mr Macron (L) later joined German leader Olaf Scholz in Berlin It will take decades for Ukraine to be accepted into the European Union, France's Emmanuel Macron has said. In a speech to the EU's parliament in Strasbourg, he instead suggested Ukraine could join a ""parallel European community"" while it awaited a decision. This would allow non-EU members to join Europe's security architecture in other ways, said President Macron. His words came as fierce fighting continued in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia is trying to make gains. A senior US defence official characterised the Russian advance as ""single-digit kilometre kind of progress"". A Ukrainian leader in the Luhansk region said serious battles were taking place.

LiveLiveStarmer calls for action on cost of living crisis,"The PM and Labour leader Keir Starmer are debating the government's agenda Prince Charles earlier delivered the Queen's Speech in Parliament, setting out the government's agenda for the coming year He said the government's priority ""is to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for familiesâ But Labour says Boris Johnson's administration is not up to the challenge as inflation soars and families struggle In all, 38 bills and draft bills have been announced as Johnson seeks a reboot after disappointing local election results Bills include measures to tackle empty high street premises and address the levelling up agenda There are also proposals to remove EU laws and a public order bill to clamp down on disruptive protests Edited by Brian Wheeler Weâre ending our live coverage of the Queenâs Speech - thanks for joining us. MPs are still debating the speech in the House of Commons. If you want to continue following the action, you can do so by watchingBBC Parliament. But for now, itâs goodbye from us in Westminster! Extravagant pageantry, archaic rituals and feisty debate - Parliament has pulled out all the stops today for its formal opening, which is marked by the Queenâs Speech. As we wind down our live coverage, letâs reflect on the main events of the day: Royal procession: The day started with Prince Charles arriving at Parliament in a motorcade, as he stood in for the Queen,who pulled out with mobility problems. He entered the House of Lords with the Duchess of Cornwall and his son Prince William. Princeâs speech: Inside the Lords, Prince Charles sat centre stage to deliver the Queenâs Speech (but not on the Queenâs throne, which had been removed). In his full regalia, Charles delivered a speech, setting out the legislative priorities of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. Agenda unveiled: In the speech,the government promised to tackle sharp rises in the cost of living by boosting the economy. The speech included proposals for laws including energy security, carbon emissions and post-Brexit economic arrangements. You can read our at-a-glance guidehere. MPs debate: When the Royals left, the politicians became the focus of attention in the House of Commons. They debated the Queenâs Speech, with Johnson, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and other MPs having their say. Timeâs up: Sir Keir told MPs the government had to face up to the cost-of-living crisis and the challenge of a stagnating economy to ""get Britain growing again"". ""We have a government whose time is passed, a cabinet out of ideas and out of energy, led by a prime minister who is entirely out of touch,â Starmer said. Brexit benefits: In reply, Johnson defended his governmentâs plans, which he said would âunleash the benefitsâ of Brexit. He said he would âgrow our way out ofâ the economic doldrums, âby creating hundreds of thousands of new high wage, high skilled jobs all across the countryâ. What now?: Itâs not over yet. MPs will debate the Queenâs Speech over the next few days before it is put to a vote. The speech is expected to pass unopposed, as is custom. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News A national security bill has been long awaited but could
still prove controversial. Government first promised action after the 2018
Salisbury poisonings and then after the 2020 Russia report to deal with new
threats posed by so-called hostile states. An alert this year about Chinese
interference in Parliament, as well as concerns about Russian influence
following its invasion of Ukraine, heightened pressure for action. This will
include updating the Official Secrets Act legislation to cover a wider range of
activity that the security services argue do harm to the country. But one
element which could be controversial is if there is no public interest defence
for journalists and others when it comes to dealing with sensitive information. Also consulted on were plans for those working on behalf of foreign states to
register their activity. This is designed to increase transparency but here, if
part of a final bill, the controversy could be over how broadly it is focused
and who might have to declare their work, for instance lawyers working for
Russian oligarchs linked to the state. Sir Ed Davey says The leader of the Liberal Democrats says today's Queen's Speech should have focused on the cost of living, but ""offered nothing"". Sir Ed Davey points to a hint made by Boris Johnson earlier that more support was in its way in the coming days, which has already been knocked down by the Treasury. ""People desperately need more help from the government,"" says Sir Ed, ""but what have they received instead? ""Tax rises, broken election promises on pension rises, and wages rising far slower than inflation."" Theresa May has warned her successor as PM, Boris Johnson, against taking new powers to tear up the part of the Brexit withdrawal deal relating to Northern Ireland. The UK government has been trying to renegotiate thissection of the dealfor a long time and has been threatening to take unilateral action if the EU does not agree to wider changes. It had been reported a bill would be included in the Queen's Speech to do this. In the end it wasn't - but it is understood a bill could still be introduced. May says to take new powers in this area âwould not be the right move for the governmentâ. She adds that the government needs to consider ""the wider sense of what such a move would say about the UK and its willingness to abide by treaties it has signed"". Reality Check Boris Johnson told MPs that one of the achievements of his
government had been âcreating a tax cut for 30 million workersâ. He is talking about the change in the Spring Statement,
which means that from July, employees will be able to earn Â£12,570 before they
start having to pay National Insurance, which is Â£2,690 more than they were
previously able to earn. That will indeed be a cut in National Insurance for most
workers, but it is not the whole picture. National Insurance went up in April by 1.25p in the pound.
Also, the threshold at which workers start paying income tax has been frozen,
which is effectively a big tax rise, especially at a time of high inflation. If
that is taken into account then many fewer people have had a tax cut overall. And we know from the governmentâs independent forecaster
the Office for Budget Responsibility that the overall tax burden is going to
rise from 33% of GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) in 2019-20 to 36.3%
of GDP in 2026-27, which will be the highest since the late 1940s. You can read more about it here. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent The government says it wants to raise standards not only in schools in England, but also in higher education. Its most radical plan is itsLifelong Loan Entitlement,external, which would allow students at any stage of life to access loans worth the equivalent of four years of post-18 education (that's Â£37,000 in today's fees). Other proposed changes, though, are exactly that - they'reproposals, and have yet to be firmed up. One is theintroduction of minimum grade requirementsfor student loans - such as having English and maths GCSEs, or two A-levels at grade E. The other is to limit the number of university places on some courses in England to ""tackle uncontrolled growth of low-quality courses"". Both plans are subject to a consultation, so we'll have to watch this space. Charities have warned that minimum grade requirements could hit poorer students hardest, while universities said limiting places would be ""placing a cap on aspiration"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Housing announcements in the Queen's Speech have been broadly welcomed by those campaigning for change to the rental sector. But many argue that banning no-fault evictions of private tenants and strengthening rights for those in social housing is long overdue. Theresa May first proposed scrapping so-called ""Section 21"" evictions, where tenants can be evicted with 8 weeks' notice, in April 2019. Boris Johnson then pledged to do the same in his general election manifesto later that year. More than one fifth of renters did not end their last tenancy by choice the government's own figures show. Campaigners argue too many families are ""on the brink"" of homelessness as the cost of living continues to rise. Landlords' groups have welcomed moves to strengthen their ability to evict anti-social tenants and those in persistent rent arrears but argue broader reforms are needed. Along with cautious optimism about the government's plans are warnings from across the housing sector that the detail will be crucial, and that time is of the essence.  Reality Check In the the Queenâs Speech debate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government was âbuilding new hospitals... 48 of them in factâ. The government has three definitions of what constitutes a ""new"" hospital:  Ananalysisby BBC Reality Check and the Nuffield Trust in December 2021, found that of 40 hospital projects announced by the government 22 are rebuilding projects, 12 will be new wings within existing hospitals, three involve rebuilding non-urgent care hospitals and three are entirely new hospitals. The 48 figure mentioned by Mr Johnson includes a âcompetition for 8 further hospitals including new Mental Health Hospitalsâ.  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent It does not seem like the government is building up to
another big announcement on the cost of living, despite Boris Johnson saying in his speech he would have ""more to say"" about it in the coming days. No 10 insiders say the PM was referring to the wider work
being done in departments to ease the cost of living. Ministers held a special cabinet last week looking
at ideas, which included relaxing rules on child care in nurseries and how often cars need an MOT. A cabinet will be held outside London later this week, sources say it will focus on some of the cost of living issues. But don't expect a major policy change soon. Reality Check Sir Keir
Starmer and Boris Johnson clashed in the House of Commons over the growth of
the UK economy. The
Labour leader said that the UK would be: âthe slowest growing economy in the G7
next yearâ. Boris
Johnson said âwe had the fastest economic growth in the G7 last year and will
return to that status, by the way, by 2024. The
G7 is a club of major developed economies. Theyâre
both right and using IMF forecasts and comparisons, but theyâre talking about
different years. It
is correct to say we had the fastest growth last year, are forecast to have
relatively slow growth next year and then relatively fast growth two years
later. If
you look over a longer period, from before the pandemic to forecasts up to
2025, the UK is actually in the middle of the pack. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford says there was a ""gaping hole"" in the speech on energy policy, and accuses the government of ""fleecing"" Scotland of its ""green present and future"". He also accuses ministers of ""refusing to match"" Scottish government funding on renewable energy. He also criticises the proposed Brexit Freedoms Bill - giving ministers new powers to change EU-era laws - as an ""attack"" on the power of devolved governments.  Will this much-trumpeted proposal ever happen? Dominic CascianiLegal Correspondent The governmentâs long-delayed pledge to give victims of crime basic rights about how they will be treated at one of the most vulnerable points in their life has been delayed yet again. Ministers have just consulted on law which would do really simple things: force the police and prosecutors to tell victims, who may be terrified of giving evidence, what is happening to their case, for a start, But the Queenâs Speech only promises a âDraft Victims Billâ - Parliament-speak for an unfinished blueprint that needs working on, rather than something thatâs oven-ready. That means thereâs no certainty at all that the proposed law -first promised eight years and three prime ministerâs ago- will become reality in this Parliamentary session. Thatâs at a time when the government is already defending record delays in the courts thanks to a combination of pandemic backlogs and preceding cuts to judges - delays that have seen many victims, as I have reported,losing faith in ever getting justice. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford uses his speech to highlight the Tories' ""drubbing"" at last week's local elections, adding it shows this government is ""on its last legs"". He contrasts this with the performance of his party, which he says shows people in Scotland demand ""the choice of an independent future"". Like Labour, he criticises the ""lack of immediate action"" in the Queen's Speech to tackle rising living costs, which he calls ""Tory-made"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Opposition parties have been calling for measures like a
windfall tax on energy companies to help with rising bills â and an emergency
budget to address the cost of living. Boris Johnson hinted at an announcement on the cost of
living in the next few days. But the Treasury has been making it clear that it doesnât
want to make concrete plans for support until it knows what the energy price
cap will be. An emergency budget is not going to happen, say my
sources. Nearing the end of his speech, Johnson says âweâll get through the aftershocks of Covid just as we got through Covidâ. He says weâll do so ânot through irresponsible spendingâ, but by âurgently pressing on with our missionâ, which is stimulating the economy. He says thatâs the long-term solution to address the rising cost of living and get our country back on track after the pandemic. âThat is what this Queenâs Speech delivers,â he says. With that, his speech is finished. Labour's Sarah Owen calls on the PM to apologise Earlier, there was an intervention from Labour's Sarah Owen - unusual when the PM is outlining the measures in the Queen's Speech. She says: ""What we haven't heard yet is an apology - an apology to the pensioners that are choosing between heating and eating, an apology to the children that have gone hungry throughout school holidays, and an apology to the hundreds of thousands of family members of Covid victims that were lost during the pandemic."" Johnson says the government is ""doing all we can"" to help people, including pensioners. And he says they have put in Â£9.2bn to help with heating, among other measures. But, he adds: ""Be in no doubt, I think this is what everyone in the country has to understand, what we are doing is making sure that we have a strong economy with high wage, high skilled jobs that will enable us to take our country forward."" The PM says heâs âtaking forward this countryâs energy strategyâ, highlighting the new Energy Security Bill in the Queenâs Speech. His comments are greeted by groans on the Labour benches, but Johnson says the party âdidnât want a single nuclear power stationâ when it was in government. He calls Labour MPs âgreat quivering jellies of indecisionâ and promises âvast new green industriesâ. Now turning to Brexit, he pledges to âunleash the benefitsâ of leaving the EU and make the UK the âbest regulated country in the worldâ. He said the government would use âour new freedoms to control our bordersâ and âfix our broken asylum systemâ. The government will act with urgency to ease âthe burdens on families and businesses across the land"", Johnson says. The rising cost of living - and the governmentâs plans to address it - featured prominently in the Queenâs Speech. Johnson lists some ways in which the government has already helped households with living costs, including Â£9.1bn to assist with energy bills, and a council tax rebate worth Â£150. But, he says, âhowever great our compassion and our ingenuity, we cannot simply spend our way out of this problemâ. He says we need to âgrow our way out of it, by creating hundreds of thousands of new high wage, high skilled jobs all across the countryâ. Now turning to the war in Ukraine, Johnson says he spoke to G7 counterparts and Ukraineâs president on Sunday. He says he urged them to go further and faster in supporting Ukraine, and expressed sorrow at what had been happening in Mariupol, where alleged war crimes had been committed. He says the UK should be proud that it has âled the wayâ, by providing weapons to Ukraine to defend itself against Russia. âLet the message ring out in the chamber today: we will persevere in our in support of Ukraine,â he says.

"NI public cannot be left high and dry, PM told","Jeffrey Donaldson says he will not return to Stormont until he can be sure ""the political institutions in Northern Ireland have a stable foundation"" The DUP leader has said he will not give up his role as MP at Westminster until the NI Protocol is ""resolved"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has been elected as an assembly member for Lagan Valley. Under rules that do not allow MLAs to hold more than one role, he has eight days to decide whether to leave Westminster for Stormont. Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill has warned the prime minister people cannot be left ""high and dry"" by the DUP's refusal to form a government. Ms O'Neill is entitled to become Northern Ireland's first nationalist first minister after Thursday's historic election. Should Sir Jeffrey leave Westminster, it would prompt a by-election for the Lagan Valley Westminster constituency. Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, he said he would not leave Parliament until the protocol is dealt with. His party is refusing to nominate a deputy first minister and re-enter power-sharing in Northern Ireland, in opposition to the post-Brexit trading arrangement. Unionists oppose the protocol as they say it poses a risk to the UK union and damages trade. A simple guide to the Northern Ireland Protocol Michelle O'Neill told Boris Johnson the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was punishing people by not forming an executive Sir Jeffrey said he would not return to Stormont until he could be sure ""the political institutions in Northern Ireland have a stable foundation"". He could instead co-opt another DUP member to fill the Lagan Valley Stormont seat in the interim. NI power sharing requires the largest unionist and nationalist parties to share first and deputy first minister posts. Both Ms O'Neill and DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson spoke to Boris Johnson on Tuesday morning. Ms O'Neill told Mr Johnson the DUP was punishing workers and families. The first sitting of the Northern Ireland Assembly - in whichSinn FÃ©in is now the largest party- is scheduled to take place on Friday. However, there will be no governing executive without the DUP's support as the second largest party. Instead, ministers continue to run their respective departments, but no new decisions, such as agreeing a budget, can be taken. The DUP, which supported Brexit, has protested against the Northern Ireland Protocol, a part of the UK's deal with the EU which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU's single market for goods. This was designed to ensure free trade across an open Irish border, but it has in turn created some new trade barriers for the movement of goods across the Irish Sea. In February, the partyremoved Paul Givan from his role as first ministerin protest against the protocol, triggering the collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive. They said the protocol had undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK. This video can not be played The Democratic Unionist Party says it will not join a power-sharing government without action on the protocol In the Queen's Speech on Tuesday, the government outlined that issues created by the protocol ""continue to stand in the way of an executive being formed"". It said the protocol ""needs to change"" and called for new imagination and flexibility from the EU. Earlier, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said he had stressed the need to intensify EU and UK discussions to avoid any unilateral action during a discussion with Mr Johnson on Tuesday. Sir Jeffrey said he made it clear to the prime minister that he would not be ""moving on the political institutions"" until the government had taken action on the protocol. He said he would not be setting a timeframe for this, but that he was a ""realist and an optimist"". Ms O'Neill said the public could not be a pawn in the British government's game of chicken with the EU. ""Time to form an executive now,"" she said in asocial media post,external. Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol? Donaldson's Brexit trading dilemma A Downing Street source told BBC News that the prime minister spent an hour on the phone to Northern Ireland's political leaders. They added the government would act ""responsibly"" with regards to the protocol and its negotiations with the EU. This video can not be played Michelle O'Neill says the assembly election shows that the public want to see a new Northern Ireland Executive formed. The calls followed meetings held by the Northern Ireland Secretary on Monday with the leaders of Stormont's five largest parties. Sinn FÃ©in won the most seats in the assembly election - 27 out of 90 - after Thursday's vote. This means the party can nominate Northern Ireland's first minister, an unprecedented move for a nationalist party, but it is reliant on the DUP taking up its position as deputy first minister. The roles form a joint office, with equal responsibility, however, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. GOVERNMENT CRISIS:What happens next? HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:What does the party want? THE ASSEMBLY:How power-sharing works in Northern Ireland RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area? Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said the Northern Ireland Protocol should be dealt with as the obstacle to a functioning executive at Stormont. ""We all know what the landing zone is, no checks on goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if they are staying in Northern Ireland. That gets rid of the border down the Irish Sea. ""The EU Commission know this, the UK government know this and all five political parties who would form the executive know this also."" 462 of 462 seats counted.Counting complete. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) has said it will be going into opposition after Thursday's vote in which it returned with eight assembly members (MLAs) after losing four seats. The party will not be replacing its deputy leader Nichola Mallon in her role as infrastructure minister, after she failed to get elected in Belfast North. Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol?

British citizens told BBC News they had not seen their spouses for six months - twice the usual processing time. Some spouses were told only days before the end of the three months there would be a delay so had already quit their jobs or ended rental contracts. The Home Office says the delays are due to the war in Ukraine. ""We are prioritising Ukraine Family Scheme and Homes for Ukraine applications in response to the humanitarian crisis caused by [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's barbaric invasion of Ukraine, so applications for study, work and family visas have taken longer to process,"" an official told BBC News. ""We are working at pace to ensure these are issued as quickly as possible."" But more than 150 people have contacted BBC News to raise the issue of delays. How can I offer a home to Ukrainian refugees? How many Afghan refugees has the UK resettled? And according to a crowdsourced spreadsheet containing the details of more than 200 couples - set up by an applicant in Los Angeles and shared with BBC News - some have been waiting more than double the expected time. Deon Barnard, 49, and Heather, 54, grew up in South Africa and have been together for 13 years. They got married in a Lord of the Rings-themed ceremony five years ago. Before applying for the spousal visa, they had only ever spent two days apart. The couple married five years ago, in a Lord of the Rings-themed ceremony Deon's mother was British, and he was granted British citizenship three years ago. The couple then decided to relocate to the UK for better work opportunities and quality of life. They submitted their application on 23 December 2021 and Deon moved to Uxbridge, west London, to start a new job. ""We were expecting, according to our calculations and according to our [immigration] agents as well, about 28 March would've been our date of receiving our [visa],"" he told BBC News. ""Heather would've been on a plane the next day. ""On about 26 March, we got a letter from the [Home Office] that, due to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine, visa applications were now paused. ""And there was no information, no date, no expectations set, nothing - that was just the end of the story. ""And we've been waiting ever since."" For an initial fiance or spousal visa, the non-British partner in a couple has to apply from their home country, while their British partner has to already be living and working in the UK. Applicants in some countries can usually pay an extra Â£500 to Â£800 for priority services, which allow them to receive a decision within a few weeks. But in March, all priority services were suspended for people applying from abroad. Once granted their visa, the partners have a limited time - 30 days - to move to the UK. Many, including Heather, were told of the delays only after they had given notice to their employers and landlords - and they now face an indefinite wait alone, without a job or a home. Where have Ukraine's millions of refugees gone? Ukraine: Does the Home Office need to get a grip? ""She's living on beds on the floor at her parents', then she'll go spend two weeks at her sister's, then go spend two weeks at her brother's... in a complete state of limbo,"" Deon said. ""She can't start anything, she can't get a job. ""It's an admin issue - but that admin issue has now just stopped life."" The couple also had to sell all of their assets in South Africa to pay for their application, which has cost them several thousand pounds. ""It's an enormous amount of money, a spousal visa,"" Deon says. ""If you're wealthy and you own a business or something, then it's a different situation - but we're just regular working people."" They are supportive of Ukrainians coming to the UK, but say more people should be hired to tackle the extra demand, rather than allowing the backlog to grow.  280,776visas granted for family reasons in 2021 Pakistan:Where most people who were given family visas last year were from 60working days - about three months - is how long a standard spousal visa usually takes to process Over 130working days - or over six months - is how long some applicants have been waiting due to Ukraine-related delays Others who contacted BBC News said the process was ""uniquely cruel and unbearable... we are directly being forced to be apart... with no clear end in sight"". One young woman's fiance missed the birth of their first child. Another, in New York, unable to afford private maternity care in the US, terminated an early pregnancy. An applicant who paid for priority service at the start of the year said the Home Office ""will not allow me any information on ETA [estimated time of arrival] or even confirm I am still in any kind of priority queue"". Mariam Khaliq, immigration head at law firm Bishop and Sewell, was one of several immigration solicitors to tell BBC News the problem was affecting ""the majority"" of clients. ""Whether applicants are applying inside the UK or outside the UK... there just seem to be delays throughout the Home Office,"" she said. Another couple, James and Adriana - who, worried speaking out could jeopardise their application, asked for their names to be changed - also struggled to find the money to apply. They had to take out a loan to pay the fees, which they say has cost them more than Â£5,000. ""When we applied, we were told it would be 60 [working] days,"" James said. ""Now here we are, almost 100 working days later."" Visa rules creating 'price on love' The couple married in November 2021, in Gibraltar. Adriana returned to Brazil to submit her application, while James waited for her at his home in Essex. Both of them moved back in with their parents to save money. And like Heather, Adriana had to give notice to her employer. If they had an idea of how long the delays would be, the process would be ""way easier"", James says. ""We'd be frustrated - but we could deal with it, we could plan."" But because of the stress, James and Adriana, who is having regular anxiety attacks, have both started seeing therapists. ""I honestly feel like I've been punished because I've fallen in love with someone who's not British or European,"" he said.

Warhol painting of Marilyn Monroe sold for $195mThe record-breaking sum is the highest ever paid for either an American or 20th Century work of art.,"Andy Warhol's ""Shot Sage Blue Marilyn"" at an auction preview in April An iconic painting of Marilyn Monroe by Andy Warhol has been auctioned for $195m (Â£158.17m) - making it the most expensive piece of 20th Century art ever sold. The painting, Shot Sage Blue Marilyn, was painted by Warhol in 1964 using a famous photograph as inspiration. The amount is also the highest ever paid for an American work of art. The Christie's auction in New York was widely seen as a symbol of the luxury art market's health. Ahead of the auction, Christie's wrote that the painting is ""one of the rarest and most transcendent images in existence"", with a selling price ""in the region"" of $200m. The auction ended with a sale price of $170m, which rose to $195m with taxes and fees taken into account. The previous record price for a piece of American artwork was $110.5m for a skull painting created in 1982 by Warhol's sometimes friend and sometimes competitor, Jean-Michael Basquiat. The final price also smashes the previous record for a 20th Century work of art, set in 2015 when a 1955 painting by Pablo Picasso - Les Femmes d'Alger (Version O) - sold for $179.4m, including fees. In March, George Frei, the chairman of the board of the Thomas and Doris Amman Foundation, said in a statement that the painting of Monroe ""bears witness to her undiminished visual power in the new millennium"". ""Marilyn the woman is gone; the terrible circumstances of her life and death are forgotten,"" Mr Frei said. ""All that remains is the enigmatic smile that links her to another mysterious smile of a distinguished lady, the Mona Lisa."" Bloomberg reports that the winning bidder was US art dealer Larry Gagosian, who owns a chain of art galleries. According to Christie's, all the proceeds of the sale will go to the Switzerland-based Thomas and Doris Ammann Foundation Zurich, which works to establish healthcare and education programmes for children around the world. The auction on Monday is the first of a series of art auctions planned by Christie's and Sotheby's over the next two weeks, widely considered to be a test of the luxury art market's health in the post-pandemic era. Philip Hoffman, the founder of New York-based advisory company the Fine Art Group, told the New York times that there is a ""huge amount of pent-up demand"" for art. ""Everybody was waiting for the right moment,"" he said. ""And the right moment has come."" Painting believed to be first of Cromwell's mum Artwork brings history of empire to new audiences.

Airlines miss all but one climate target - reportCampaigners say the aviation industry cannot be relied on to tackle their role in climate change.,"Campaigners say people who fly more should pay more because of the damage to the planet UK airlines have missed all climate targets set since 2000 except for one, a new report claims. The aviation industry sets its own goals for cutting its environmental footprint. A representative for the UK aviation industry said it was committed to significantly reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. In 2018 air travel was responsible for7% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions.,external Possible, the charity behind the research, investigated the issue to find out whether airlines can be relied upon to tackle their role in causing emissions that lead to climate change. ""Companies set grand-sounding targets with a lot of fanfare and announcement. They talk about them for a couple of years - then the targets sink without trace, never to be seen again,"" Leo Murray from Possible told BBC News. The research looked at environmental goals airlines have set themselves since 2000. Most of the targets focussed on using greener fuels to power airplanes or making fuel more efficient. EasyJet was the only company named in the research that was found to have met a target. It successfully reduced fuel burn per passenger kilometre by 3% by 2015, Possible says. But Possible claim it missed other goals, including a plan in 2007to build the ""ecoJet"",externalthat would emit 50% less CO2 than its current planes. The ambition was mentioned again in 2009, Possible says, but the company appeared to drop the target and the ecoJet was never built. ""The ecoJet was a prototype concept which was used to urge the industry to produce planes that significantly reduce carbon emissions. Our ultimate ambition today has only strengthened to achieve zero carbon emission flying,"" a spokesperson for EasyJet told BBC News. Possible also points out that between 2010-12 Virgin Atlantic said that10% of its fuel would be biofuel by 2020.,externalPossible says the target wasn't mentioned again. In 2021 Virgin Atlanticannounced it will use 10% alternative fuels,externalby 2030. Representing airlines including Virgin Atlantic, Matt Gorman, chair of Sustainable Aviation Coalition, told BBC News: ""Technology improvements mean growth in passengers no longer means growth in emissions and the industry continues to innovate to reduce emissions further and faster. Whilst decarbonising aviation is a huge challenge, the solutions are real and, more critically, being implemented."" The charity also claims that$3bn promised by Virgin Group founder Sir Richard Branson,externalto fight global warming was not delivered. A spokesperson for the Virgin Group told BBC News: ""For more than 15 years, Virgin has invested in and supported climate solutions which focus on solving the climate crisis through a range of cleantech ventures.  Our investment supports Virgin's target to reach net zero emissions across its whole portfolio by 2050 at the latest"". A really simple guide to climate change A few frequent flyers 'dominate air travel' Climate change 'may curb growth in UK flying' Is the UK's green plan enough to halt climate change? Mr Murray says the industry is ""intrinsically high-carbon"", meaning there are no good alternatives when it comes to technological solutions. Efficiency has been improving but the volume of flights has grown faster, he says. The findings undermine the government's climate change plans that aim to radically reduce the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, according to Mr Murray. The government's upcoming""Jet Zero"" strategy,externalto tackle the role of aviation in climate change is likely to rely on airlines ""decarbonising"". That would mean the industry using technology to fix its emissions problem. ""It's a very high-risk strategy, it's not plausible. The government is putting all its eggs in the basket of aviation meeting their own goals - but their track record is terrible,"" Mr Murray suggests. The government's message is that we can carry on flying and still reach net zero by 2050. Don't worry, it says, innovation will save the day. This report calls that policy into question. If the aviation industry cannot find ways to make planes more efficient or take the carbon out of fuel then the government will need an alternative strategy. The most obvious is to manage demand by making it more expensive to fly often - but that need not mean your annual holiday is under threat. That's because a small number of people do most of the flying.Just 15% of people take 70% of all flights.,external Campaigners want a frequent flier levy -something backed by the public in polls.,external The first flight in a year could incur little or no tax, with the levy ramping up with each additional flight. The government's Climate Change Committee advisory body has previouslyblamed the government for failing to reduce demand for flying. A Department for Transport spokesperson told BBC News: ""This report wilfully ignores this government's historic investment in technology, fuel and market-based measures which will help us reach Jet Zero by 2050 without the need for further taxes. This includes Â£180 million to accelerate sustainable aviation fuel and Â£685 million to develop zero-carbon and low emission aircraft technology"". Mr Murray also says the government should be prioritising making sustainable transport like high-speed rail or ferries more affordable and accessible. One scheme his charity runs encourages employers to give workers extra holiday days to allow them to travel abroad by train or ferry, which has a lower carbon footprint but can take much longer than flying.

The Pentagon believes that Russia has used about 10 to 12 of its hypersonic weapons since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a senior defence official. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the official said the US does not have ""a perfect count"" of the deployment of the weapon. Russia claims the Kinzhal missile - which can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h - was first fired at a target in Ukraine in March. More recently, Ukrainian officials have claimed that the weapon was fired at targets in Odesa over the weekend. The US official, however, said that he doesn't ""have anything to indicate"" that they were used against targets in the city. Learn more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

Fuel supplies in Europe face possible disruption after Ukraine vowed to suspend an important route for Russian gas. Operators of the Ukrainian gas system said they would switch off the Sokhranivka route from 07:00 local time on Wednesday. The route accounts for a third of Russia's supply to Europe. They claim to be unable to operate a gas station through the Luhansk region due to Russian occupation, and so plan to switch to an entry point in Ukrainian-held territory. But Russian state-owned gas firm Gazprom said it was not feasible to make such a switch - and questioned the Ukrainian justification. Ukraine remains a major supply route for Russian gas to Europe - despite the war. Volodymyr Zelensky and Leonid Kravchuk at a meeting in Ukraine's parliament 2020 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's former leader who died at 88 on Tuesday, as a man who ""always stayed with Ukraine"".

A photograph of Vladimir Putin on a cross depicting his tomb in Dnipro The Ukrainian city of Dnipro has emerged as a crucial hub for the Ukrainian military and humanitarian operations as the war in Ukraine's east grinds on. After repeated airstrikes that struck the city in March and early April, an uneasy calm has fallen over Dnipro, the fourth largest city in Ukraine. During a recent visit, the author David Patrikarakosdescribed a,externalcity largely defended by volunteer militias that lie between ""Ukraineâs two worlds: West and East; Europe and Russia."" ""Its geographical location makes it vital to the country's war effort,"" he wrote. ""Dniproâs central location makes it the countryâs most important logistical hub."" Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra - pictured here rehearsing - are this year's favourites Ukrainian entrants Kalush Orchestra have given an energetic performance during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest. The rap/folk band are favourites to win this year's edition of the historic singing competition - thanks to their song Stefania.

Welcome to our latest coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you're just joining us - or are in need of a recap - here are some of the latest headlines. Millions of tonnes cannot be exported from Ukraine due to a Russian blockade The war in Ukraine has made Syria's problems even worse than before, the UN's high commissioner for refugees has told the BBC. Speaking to the World Service's Newshour programme, Filippo Grandi said the humanitarian situation inside Syria had become ""quite catastrophic"". Food insecurity caused by the Ukraine crisis has had a ""terrible impact"" on Syria and its neighbours, he added. Russia's blockade along the Black Sea coast has meant millions of tonnes of grain cannot be sent overseas. Ukraine is one of the world's top exporters of wheat. Grandi also acknowledged that there could be a double-standard at work in Europe's treatment of refugees. He said it was ""unacceptable, racist and discriminatory"" that Ukrainians were sometimes seen as ""real"" refugees while others - including those from the Middle East - were not. Leonid Kravchuk and Vitaly Klitschko in March 2021 The first president of the modern state of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, has passed away at 88, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko. On his Telegram channel, Klitschko said that Kravchuk was a man who embodied ""talent, strong character and knowledge"". Kravchuk, who was formerly chairman of Ukraine's rada - or parliament - and the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR during the waning days of the Soviet Union, became president in December 1991 and remained in office until July 1994. A second campaign to be president ended with an electoral loss to his former prime minister, Leonid Kuchma. Among his most consequential decisions was signing the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, pledging to give up the nuclear arsenal Ukraine was left with after the Soviet Union's collapse. In his post, Klitschko said that Kravchuk's legacy was particularly important at a time when Ukraine is fighting Russia. ""We will preserve the sovereignty and will that we got more than 30 years ago,"" Klitschko wrote. ""We will not retreat."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In the US, two of the nationâs senior intelligence officials, National Intelligence Director Avril Haines and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Scott Berrier, have painted a sobering picture of the war in Ukraine. The two officials spoke before the Senate armed services committee about global threats to the US on Tuesday, and they highlighted their concerns about Russia. âWe assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine,â said Haines. âHe is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse.â Berrier explained that the two enemies, the Russians and the Ukrainians, had reached an impasse. Said Berrier: âThe Russians arenât winning, and the Ukrainians arenât winning, and weâre at a bit of a stalemate.â Their presentations were significant because of the situation they described in Ukraine and also because parts of the hearing were open to the public. Intelligence officials have argued in the past that these hearings should be held behind closed doors. But their presentation provides one of the only chances for the public to hear directly from them about security issues. Their assessment of the war is particularly important as people in the US evaluate the ongoing conflict, the role of the US and the impact of the war on gas prices and other aspects of everyday life. A destroyed Russian tank pictured on 6 May Russian forces are several weeks behind where Vladimir Putin expected them to be after shifting the focus of military operations to Ukraine's eastern Donbas, according to a senior US defence official. Speaking in a briefing call with reporters on Tuesday, the official said that Putin is ""easily two weeks, or maybe even more, behind where he wanted to be in the east"". At the end of April, a US defence official said that Russia was ""several days"" behind schedule. Additionally on Tuesday, the official noted that sanctions are making it more difficult to replenish stocks of guided munitions. The official said that since the sinking of the Moskva in the Black Sea, Russian naval vessels have stayed ""well south"" of the port city of Odesa. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko pictured in an undisclosed location in Ukraine The city council of Mariupol, one of Ukraine's most attacked cities, has collected over 800 reports of war crimes from residents who have managed to flee the besieged city. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko told Media Center Ukraine that all of the information regarding the alleged war crimes has been passed on to the region's prosecutor's office. The mayor said residents provided testimonies of key attacks in the city, including ""the maternity ward of Mariupol destroyed by the enemy plane, and the Drama Theatre, where a lot of women and children died, and hospital 1, where Mariupol residents with severe injuries burnt alive"". All of the evidence will be part of a wider criminal proceeding into the genocide of Mariupol residents, he said. ""There are numerous examples of war crimes of Russian occupation army led by their main criminal, Putin,"" the mayor added.

Cherkasy Tyshky, Ruski Tyshky, Rubizhne and Bayrak were all snatched back from Russia, said the latest update from the armed forces. Russia was continuing to intensify its offensive in Ukraine's east, the update said. The greatest activity was observed in the directions ofSlobozhanskeandDonetsk. Russian troops were reportedly replenishing ammunition and logistics while a battle forIzyumrages on. But their advances in multiple other areas were said to be proving unsuccessful. The update also confirmed that Russian efforts inMariupolwere focused on assaulting the Azovstal metal works, where more than 1,000 Ukrainian fighters are thought to be sheltering. It was not possible for the BBC to independently confirm the armed forces' claims. The devastated Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's southern city Mariupol has been surrounded and bombarded for weeks. Russian forces backed by tanks are currently conducting ""storming operations"" at Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, according to Ukraine's defence ministry. The ""Azov - Mariupol"" channel on messaging app Telegram has posted what appears to be photos of the wounded soldiers holding out in the plant. ""The whole civilised world must see the conditions in which the wounded, crippled defenders of Mariupol are and act!"", says a Telegram message from the fighters posted alongside the photos. There are more than 1,000 troops trapped in the plant, including hundreds who are injured, the Ukrainian deputy PM says. In the Telegram message the fighters appeal to the UN and the Red Cross to ""show their humanity"" and rescue the wounded, who are ""no longer combatants"". ""We demand the immediate evacuation of the wounded servicemen to the territories controlled by Ukraine,"" the fighters have said. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has thanked UN members for electing his country to the UN Human Rights Council, replacing Russia - which was suspended from the body in April over its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Lipavsky expressed his gratitude at the trust placed in the Czech Republic and said his country would immediately get to work, as part of Thursday's session on human rights abuses caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. The foreign minister said human rights remained a priority for both his party and the Czech government, which he said was returning to the legacy of Vaclav Havel. ""We belong on the Human Rights Council. Russia does not,"" he told Czech news server Novinky.cz The Czech Republic will serve out the remainder of Russia's three-year term on the council. The city's mayor has confirmed that the bodies of 44 civilians were pulled from the rubble The bodies of 44 civilians have been found in the rubble of a collapsed building in the Ukrainian city of Izyum, as the battle for control of the area rages. The five-storey building collapsed in March as residents hid in the basement from Russian shelling. But rescuers have only just been able to reach the building, one local official told the BBC. And there are fears the death toll could rise further, as another building in the same street was also targeted. Read more on this story here. It's approaching 19:00 in Kyiv. Here's a quick roundup of the latest events in Ukraine. US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines Vladimir Putin is preparing for a long war in Ukraine, the US is warning, and a Russian victory in the eastern region of Donbas might not end its attack. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines tells a Senate hearing the next few months could see Russian actions escalate and become more unpredictable. ""The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means,"" Haines says. She warns Russia could seek a land bridge to the breakaway Moldovan territory of Transnistria and says it's likely President Putin will seek to impose martial law in Russia. Haines says Putin is counting on the resolve of the US and of Ukraine's European allies to
weaken over time. But she thinks the Kremlin will only authorise the use of nuclear weapons if Putin perceives an ""existential threat"" to Russia. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Extravagant pageantry, archaic rituals and feisty debate - Parliament has pulled out all the stops today for its formal opening, which is marked by the Queenâs Speech. As we wind down our live coverage, letâs reflect on the main events of the day: Royal procession: The day started with Prince Charles arriving at Parliament in a motorcade, as he stood in for the Queen,who pulled out with mobility problems. He entered the House of Lords with the Duchess of Cornwall and his son Prince William. Princeâs speech: Inside the Lords, Prince Charles sat centre stage to deliver the Queenâs Speech (but not on the Queenâs throne, which had been removed). In his full regalia, Charles delivered a speech, setting out the legislative priorities of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. Agenda unveiled: In the speech,the government promised to tackle sharp rises in the cost of living by boosting the economy. The speech included proposals for laws including energy security, carbon emissions and post-Brexit economic arrangements. You can read our at-a-glance guidehere. MPs debate: When the Royals left, the politicians became the focus of attention in the House of Commons. They debated the Queenâs Speech, with Johnson, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and other MPs having their say. Timeâs up: Sir Keir told MPs the government had to face up to the cost-of-living crisis and the challenge of a stagnating economy to ""get Britain growing again"". ""We have a government whose time is passed, a cabinet out of ideas and out of energy, led by a prime minister who is entirely out of touch,â Starmer said. Brexit benefits: In reply, Johnson defended his governmentâs plans, which he said would âunleash the benefitsâ of Brexit. He said he would âgrow our way out ofâ the economic doldrums, âby creating hundreds of thousands of new high wage, high skilled jobs all across the countryâ. What now?: Itâs not over yet. MPs will debate the Queenâs Speech over the next few days before it is put to a vote. The speech is expected to pass unopposed, as is custom. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News A national security bill has been long awaited but could
still prove controversial. Government first promised action after the 2018
Salisbury poisonings and then after the 2020 Russia report to deal with new
threats posed by so-called hostile states. An alert this year about Chinese
interference in Parliament, as well as concerns about Russian influence
following its invasion of Ukraine, heightened pressure for action. This will
include updating the Official Secrets Act legislation to cover a wider range of
activity that the security services argue do harm to the country. But one
element which could be controversial is if there is no public interest defence
for journalists and others when it comes to dealing with sensitive information. Also consulted on were plans for those working on behalf of foreign states to
register their activity. This is designed to increase transparency but here, if
part of a final bill, the controversy could be over how broadly it is focused
and who might have to declare their work, for instance lawyers working for
Russian oligarchs linked to the state. Sir Ed Davey says The leader of the Liberal Democrats says today's Queen's Speech should have focused on the cost of living, but ""offered nothing"". Sir Ed Davey points to a hint made by Boris Johnson earlier that more support was in its way in the coming days, which has already been knocked down by the Treasury. ""People desperately need more help from the government,"" says Sir Ed, ""but what have they received instead? ""Tax rises, broken election promises on pension rises, and wages rising far slower than inflation."" Theresa May has warned her successor as PM, Boris Johnson, against taking new powers to tear up the part of the Brexit withdrawal deal relating to Northern Ireland. The UK government has been trying to renegotiate thissection of the dealfor a long time and has been threatening to take unilateral action if the EU does not agree to wider changes. It had been reported a bill would be included in the Queen's Speech to do this. In the end it wasn't - but it is understood a bill could still be introduced. May says to take new powers in this area âwould not be the right move for the governmentâ. She adds that the government needs to consider ""the wider sense of what such a move would say about the UK and its willingness to abide by treaties it has signed"". Reality Check Boris Johnson told MPs that one of the achievements of his
government had been âcreating a tax cut for 30 million workersâ. He is talking about the change in the Spring Statement,
which means that from July, employees will be able to earn Â£12,570 before they
start having to pay National Insurance, which is Â£2,690 more than they were
previously able to earn. That will indeed be a cut in National Insurance for most
workers, but it is not the whole picture. National Insurance went up in April by 1.25p in the pound.
Also, the threshold at which workers start paying income tax has been frozen,
which is effectively a big tax rise, especially at a time of high inflation. If
that is taken into account then many fewer people have had a tax cut overall. And we know from the governmentâs independent forecaster
the Office for Budget Responsibility that the overall tax burden is going to
rise from 33% of GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) in 2019-20 to 36.3%
of GDP in 2026-27, which will be the highest since the late 1940s. You can read more about it here. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent The government says it wants to raise standards not only in schools in England, but also in higher education. Its most radical plan is itsLifelong Loan Entitlement,external, which would allow students at any stage of life to access loans worth the equivalent of four years of post-18 education (that's Â£37,000 in today's fees). Other proposed changes, though, are exactly that - they'reproposals, and have yet to be firmed up. One is theintroduction of minimum grade requirementsfor student loans - such as having English and maths GCSEs, or two A-levels at grade E. The other is to limit the number of university places on some courses in England to ""tackle uncontrolled growth of low-quality courses"". Both plans are subject to a consultation, so we'll have to watch this space. Charities have warned that minimum grade requirements could hit poorer students hardest, while universities said limiting places would be ""placing a cap on aspiration"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Housing announcements in the Queen's Speech have been broadly welcomed by those campaigning for change to the rental sector. But many argue that banning no-fault evictions of private tenants and strengthening rights for those in social housing is long overdue. Theresa May first proposed scrapping so-called ""Section 21"" evictions, where tenants can be evicted with 8 weeks' notice, in April 2019. Boris Johnson then pledged to do the same in his general election manifesto later that year. More than one fifth of renters did not end their last tenancy by choice the government's own figures show. Campaigners argue too many families are ""on the brink"" of homelessness as the cost of living continues to rise. Landlords' groups have welcomed moves to strengthen their ability to evict anti-social tenants and those in persistent rent arrears but argue broader reforms are needed. Along with cautious optimism about the government's plans are warnings from across the housing sector that the detail will be crucial, and that time is of the essence.  Reality Check In the the Queenâs Speech debate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government was âbuilding new hospitals... 48 of them in factâ. The government has three definitions of what constitutes a ""new"" hospital:  Ananalysisby BBC Reality Check and the Nuffield Trust in December 2021, found that of 40 hospital projects announced by the government 22 are rebuilding projects, 12 will be new wings within existing hospitals, three involve rebuilding non-urgent care hospitals and three are entirely new hospitals. The 48 figure mentioned by Mr Johnson includes a âcompetition for 8 further hospitals including new Mental Health Hospitalsâ.  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent It does not seem like the government is building up to
another big announcement on the cost of living, despite Boris Johnson saying in his speech he would have ""more to say"" about it in the coming days. No 10 insiders say the PM was referring to the wider work
being done in departments to ease the cost of living. Ministers held a special cabinet last week looking
at ideas, which included relaxing rules on child care in nurseries and how often cars need an MOT. A cabinet will be held outside London later this week, sources say it will focus on some of the cost of living issues. But don't expect a major policy change soon. Reality Check Sir Keir
Starmer and Boris Johnson clashed in the House of Commons over the growth of
the UK economy. The
Labour leader said that the UK would be: âthe slowest growing economy in the G7
next yearâ. Boris
Johnson said âwe had the fastest economic growth in the G7 last year and will
return to that status, by the way, by 2024. The
G7 is a club of major developed economies. Theyâre
both right and using IMF forecasts and comparisons, but theyâre talking about
different years. It
is correct to say we had the fastest growth last year, are forecast to have
relatively slow growth next year and then relatively fast growth two years
later. If
you look over a longer period, from before the pandemic to forecasts up to
2025, the UK is actually in the middle of the pack. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford says there was a ""gaping hole"" in the speech on energy policy, and accuses the government of ""fleecing"" Scotland of its ""green present and future"". He also accuses ministers of ""refusing to match"" Scottish government funding on renewable energy. He also criticises the proposed Brexit Freedoms Bill - giving ministers new powers to change EU-era laws - as an ""attack"" on the power of devolved governments.  Will this much-trumpeted proposal ever happen? Dominic CascianiLegal Correspondent The governmentâs long-delayed pledge to give victims of crime basic rights about how they will be treated at one of the most vulnerable points in their life has been delayed yet again. Ministers have just consulted on law which would do really simple things: force the police and prosecutors to tell victims, who may be terrified of giving evidence, what is happening to their case, for a start, But the Queenâs Speech only promises a âDraft Victims Billâ - Parliament-speak for an unfinished blueprint that needs working on, rather than something thatâs oven-ready. That means thereâs no certainty at all that the proposed law -first promised eight years and three prime ministerâs ago- will become reality in this Parliamentary session. Thatâs at a time when the government is already defending record delays in the courts thanks to a combination of pandemic backlogs and preceding cuts to judges - delays that have seen many victims, as I have reported,losing faith in ever getting justice. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford uses his speech to highlight the Tories' ""drubbing"" at last week's local elections, adding it shows this government is ""on its last legs"". He contrasts this with the performance of his party, which he says shows people in Scotland demand ""the choice of an independent future"". Like Labour, he criticises the ""lack of immediate action"" in the Queen's Speech to tackle rising living costs, which he calls ""Tory-made"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Opposition parties have been calling for measures like a
windfall tax on energy companies to help with rising bills â and an emergency
budget to address the cost of living. Boris Johnson hinted at an announcement on the cost of
living in the next few days. But the Treasury has been making it clear that it doesnât
want to make concrete plans for support until it knows what the energy price
cap will be. An emergency budget is not going to happen, say my
sources. Nearing the end of his speech, Johnson says âweâll get through the aftershocks of Covid just as we got through Covidâ. He says weâll do so ânot through irresponsible spendingâ, but by âurgently pressing on with our missionâ, which is stimulating the economy. He says thatâs the long-term solution to address the rising cost of living and get our country back on track after the pandemic. âThat is what this Queenâs Speech delivers,â he says. With that, his speech is finished. Labour's Sarah Owen calls on the PM to apologise Earlier, there was an intervention from Labour's Sarah Owen - unusual when the PM is outlining the measures in the Queen's Speech. She says: ""What we haven't heard yet is an apology - an apology to the pensioners that are choosing between heating and eating, an apology to the children that have gone hungry throughout school holidays, and an apology to the hundreds of thousands of family members of Covid victims that were lost during the pandemic."" Johnson says the government is ""doing all we can"" to help people, including pensioners. And he says they have put in Â£9.2bn to help with heating, among other measures. But, he adds: ""Be in no doubt, I think this is what everyone in the country has to understand, what we are doing is making sure that we have a strong economy with high wage, high skilled jobs that will enable us to take our country forward."" The PM says heâs âtaking forward this countryâs energy strategyâ, highlighting the new Energy Security Bill in the Queenâs Speech. His comments are greeted by groans on the Labour benches, but Johnson says the party âdidnât want a single nuclear power stationâ when it was in government. He calls Labour MPs âgreat quivering jellies of indecisionâ and promises âvast new green industriesâ. Now turning to Brexit, he pledges to âunleash the benefitsâ of leaving the EU and make the UK the âbest regulated country in the worldâ. He said the government would use âour new freedoms to control our bordersâ and âfix our broken asylum systemâ. The government will act with urgency to ease âthe burdens on families and businesses across the land"", Johnson says. The rising cost of living - and the governmentâs plans to address it - featured prominently in the Queenâs Speech. Johnson lists some ways in which the government has already helped households with living costs, including Â£9.1bn to assist with energy bills, and a council tax rebate worth Â£150. But, he says, âhowever great our compassion and our ingenuity, we cannot simply spend our way out of this problemâ. He says we need to âgrow our way out of it, by creating hundreds of thousands of new high wage, high skilled jobs all across the countryâ. Now turning to the war in Ukraine, Johnson says he spoke to G7 counterparts and Ukraineâs president on Sunday. He says he urged them to go further and faster in supporting Ukraine, and expressed sorrow at what had been happening in Mariupol, where alleged war crimes had been committed. He says the UK should be proud that it has âled the wayâ, by providing weapons to Ukraine to defend itself against Russia. âLet the message ring out in the chamber today: we will persevere in our in support of Ukraine,â he says.

Government changes Troubles amnesty plans,"An amnesty from Troubles prosecutions could be conditional upon cooperation with truth recovery investigations, the government has revealed. This would change a key aspect of plans to deal with the conflict's legacy. Details are contained in a paper published after the Queen's Speech on new legislation. Ministers aim to pass the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill in the coming months. The Queen's Speech,which was delivered by the Prince of Wales on Tuesday, is used to set out plans for new laws. The address also included plans for the Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Bill, which commits to delivering on commitments about identity and language negotiated in theNew Decade, New Approach,externalagreement of 2020. This gives recognition and protection to the Irish language and will enhance and develop the Ulster Scots/Ulster British tradition. ""This will recognise and celebrate Northern Ireland's natural and cultural identities and accommodate cultural differences,"" the statement continued. It includes the creation of a new office of identity and cultural expression and two commissioners to be appointed by the first and deputy first ministers. Although not outlined in the papers which accompanied the Queen's Speech, the government has also modified its position on banning all Troubles-related civil cases and inquests. It is understood existing claims could continue to a conclusion, as would any inquests which have started by the time the legislation comes into effect. It is not yet clear when the draft legislation will be introduced into Parliament, or what start date the government has in mind for the new arrangements to come into force. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says he will need to see the draft legislation before judging it Speaking after the speech, the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson,  whose partyhad been opposed to the original amnesty plans, said he would have to wait to see the contents of the bill. ""I am not sure it will reflect the initial proposals,"" he told BBC News NI. ""I want to see does it offer the chance for innocent victims to see those who perpetrated their murderous deeds against loved ones prosecuted? ""What does the process look like? Are we talking about a blanket statute of limitations?"" he asked. ""We are clear and always have been that justice must not be sacrificed,"" he added. ""The innocent victims families have waited for years, some for decades for the opportunity to have justice brought and they have the right to pursue that. ""We will judge what the government proposes against whether the opportunity for justice remains,"" he added. Asked whether he would accept a conditional statute of limitations he said he would have to see the detail of such a plan. ""We must not allow a situation to develop where people are able to rewrite the narrative which suggests that terrorists which committed terrible atrocities across the board are somehow either exonerated or can walk away,"" he said. ""That is not what the people of Northern Ireland want. They want truth but they also want justice,"" he added. It will be a day remembered for who wasn't there and, for unionists, what wasn't included in the government's legislative plan. There was no mention of the much talked about legislation to over ride parts of the Northern Ireland protocol. Instead, buried deep in the Executive summary was a vague reference to protecting the the UK's internal ""economic bonds"". The government steered cleared of any legislative commitment around the protocol, much to the frustration of the DUP. The party says it needs actions and not words. Away from the pomp and ceremony, the state opening of Parliament allows the government to press the reset button at Westminster but there is no sign of a reboot at Stormont anytime soon. Northern Ireland is currently without a first or deputy first minister because the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to nominate to the joint office as part of its protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the part of the UK's Brexit deal with the European Union, which retains free trade across the Irish border but introduced checks on some goods moving across the Irish Sea from the UK to Northern Ireland. Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol? The DUP has said it will not go back into government in Northern Ireland until its concerns over these post-Brexit trading arrangements are resolved. The Queen's Speech referenced the protocol and said it ""needs to change"". Secretary of State Brandon Lewis announced the plan to ban prosecutions last July ""We urge our partners in the EU to work with us, with new imagination and flexibility, to deliver that,"" it outlined. ""We will continue to talk with the EU but we will not let that stand in the way of protecting peace and stability in Northern Ireland."" Legislation on the controversial amnesty proposals have been held up by about six months as the government continues to engage with parties and victims' groups. The plans emerged last July when the government proposed""drawing a line under the Troubles"" by banning any more prosecutions. This would cover all Troubles-related incidents involving paramilitary organisations as well as the police and Army. But the idea has faced widespread opposition in Northern Ireland. Instead of prosecutions, inquests and civil cases,the government has suggested a truth recovery process for bereaved families, including a level of disclosure by the state ""that has never happened before"". In recent months, it has been examining how to make truth recovery a more robust investigative process. What's at stake for PM in the Queen's Speech Plan to end all NI Troubles prosecutions confirmed NI secretary 'didn't deliver' on legacy legislation MLAs back motion to oppose Troubles legacy plans The government has come undermounting pressure from its own back benches to act quickerin order to prevent any further prosecutions of former soldiers. The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) has yet to make decisions on 12 veterans as part of a wider legacy caseload. There are also about1,200 unsolved Troubles-related killings currently with the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which would take 20 years to work through.

The Pentagon believes that Russia has used about 10 to 12 of its hypersonic weapons since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a senior defence official. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the official said the US does not have ""a perfect count"" of the deployment of the weapon. Russia claims the Kinzhal missile - which can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h - was first fired at a target in Ukraine in March. More recently, Ukrainian officials have claimed that the weapon was fired at targets in Odesa over the weekend. The US official, however, said that he doesn't ""have anything to indicate"" that they were used against targets in the city. Learn more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

Fuel supplies in Europe face possible disruption after Ukraine vowed to suspend an important route for Russian gas. Operators of the Ukrainian gas system said they would switch off the Sokhranivka route from 07:00 local time on Wednesday. The route accounts for a third of Russia's supply to Europe. They claim to be unable to operate a gas station through the Luhansk region due to Russian occupation, and so plan to switch to an entry point in Ukrainian-held territory. But Russian state-owned gas firm Gazprom said it was not feasible to make such a switch - and questioned the Ukrainian justification. Ukraine remains a major supply route for Russian gas to Europe - despite the war.

A photograph of Vladimir Putin on a cross depicting his tomb in Dnipro The Ukrainian city of Dnipro has emerged as a crucial hub for the Ukrainian military and humanitarian operations as the war in Ukraine's east grinds on. After repeated airstrikes that struck the city in March and early April, an uneasy calm has fallen over Dnipro, the fourth largest city in Ukraine. During a recent visit, the author David Patrikarakosdescribed a,externalcity largely defended by volunteer militias that lie between ""Ukraineâs two worlds: West and East; Europe and Russia."" ""Its geographical location makes it vital to the country's war effort,"" he wrote. ""Dniproâs central location makes it the countryâs most important logistical hub.""

Welcome to our latest coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you're just joining us - or are in need of a recap - here are some of the latest headlines. Millions of tonnes cannot be exported from Ukraine due to a Russian blockade The war in Ukraine has made Syria's problems even worse than before, the UN's high commissioner for refugees has told the BBC. Speaking to the World Service's Newshour programme, Filippo Grandi said the humanitarian situation inside Syria had become ""quite catastrophic"". Food insecurity caused by the Ukraine crisis has had a ""terrible impact"" on Syria and its neighbours, he added. Russia's blockade along the Black Sea coast has meant millions of tonnes of grain cannot be sent overseas. Ukraine is one of the world's top exporters of wheat. Grandi also acknowledged that there could be a double-standard at work in Europe's treatment of refugees. He said it was ""unacceptable, racist and discriminatory"" that Ukrainians were sometimes seen as ""real"" refugees while others - including those from the Middle East - were not. Leonid Kravchuk and Vitaly Klitschko in March 2021 The first president of the modern state of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, has passed away at 88, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko. On his Telegram channel, Klitschko said that Kravchuk was a man who embodied ""talent, strong character and knowledge"". Kravchuk, who was formerly chairman of Ukraine's rada - or parliament - and the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR during the waning days of the Soviet Union, became president in December 1991 and remained in office until July 1994. A second campaign to be president ended with an electoral loss to his former prime minister, Leonid Kuchma. Among his most consequential decisions was signing the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, pledging to give up the nuclear arsenal Ukraine was left with after the Soviet Union's collapse. In his post, Klitschko said that Kravchuk's legacy was particularly important at a time when Ukraine is fighting Russia. ""We will preserve the sovereignty and will that we got more than 30 years ago,"" Klitschko wrote. ""We will not retreat."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In the US, two of the nationâs senior intelligence officials, National Intelligence Director Avril Haines and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Scott Berrier, have painted a sobering picture of the war in Ukraine. The two officials spoke before the Senate armed services committee about global threats to the US on Tuesday, and they highlighted their concerns about Russia. âWe assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine,â said Haines. âHe is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse.â Berrier explained that the two enemies, the Russians and the Ukrainians, had reached an impasse. Said Berrier: âThe Russians arenât winning, and the Ukrainians arenât winning, and weâre at a bit of a stalemate.â Their presentations were significant because of the situation they described in Ukraine and also because parts of the hearing were open to the public. Intelligence officials have argued in the past that these hearings should be held behind closed doors. But their presentation provides one of the only chances for the public to hear directly from them about security issues. Their assessment of the war is particularly important as people in the US evaluate the ongoing conflict, the role of the US and the impact of the war on gas prices and other aspects of everyday life. A destroyed Russian tank pictured on 6 May Russian forces are several weeks behind where Vladimir Putin expected them to be after shifting the focus of military operations to Ukraine's eastern Donbas, according to a senior US defence official. Speaking in a briefing call with reporters on Tuesday, the official said that Putin is ""easily two weeks, or maybe even more, behind where he wanted to be in the east"". At the end of April, a US defence official said that Russia was ""several days"" behind schedule. Additionally on Tuesday, the official noted that sanctions are making it more difficult to replenish stocks of guided munitions. The official said that since the sinking of the Moskva in the Black Sea, Russian naval vessels have stayed ""well south"" of the port city of Odesa. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko pictured in an undisclosed location in Ukraine The city council of Mariupol, one of Ukraine's most attacked cities, has collected over 800 reports of war crimes from residents who have managed to flee the besieged city. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko told Media Center Ukraine that all of the information regarding the alleged war crimes has been passed on to the region's prosecutor's office. The mayor said residents provided testimonies of key attacks in the city, including ""the maternity ward of Mariupol destroyed by the enemy plane, and the Drama Theatre, where a lot of women and children died, and hospital 1, where Mariupol residents with severe injuries burnt alive"". All of the evidence will be part of a wider criminal proceeding into the genocide of Mariupol residents, he said. ""There are numerous examples of war crimes of Russian occupation army led by their main criminal, Putin,"" the mayor added.

Cherkasy Tyshky, Ruski Tyshky, Rubizhne and Bayrak were all snatched back from Russia, said the latest update from the armed forces. Russia was continuing to intensify its offensive in Ukraine's east, the update said. The greatest activity was observed in the directions ofSlobozhanskeandDonetsk. Russian troops were reportedly replenishing ammunition and logistics while a battle forIzyumrages on. But their advances in multiple other areas were said to be proving unsuccessful. The update also confirmed that Russian efforts inMariupolwere focused on assaulting the Azovstal metal works, where more than 1,000 Ukrainian fighters are thought to be sheltering. It was not possible for the BBC to independently confirm the armed forces' claims. The devastated Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's southern city Mariupol has been surrounded and bombarded for weeks. Russian forces backed by tanks are currently conducting ""storming operations"" at Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, according to Ukraine's defence ministry. The ""Azov - Mariupol"" channel on messaging app Telegram has posted what appears to be photos of the wounded soldiers holding out in the plant. ""The whole civilised world must see the conditions in which the wounded, crippled defenders of Mariupol are and act!"", says a Telegram message from the fighters posted alongside the photos. There are more than 1,000 troops trapped in the plant, including hundreds who are injured, the Ukrainian deputy PM says. In the Telegram message the fighters appeal to the UN and the Red Cross to ""show their humanity"" and rescue the wounded, who are ""no longer combatants"". ""We demand the immediate evacuation of the wounded servicemen to the territories controlled by Ukraine,"" the fighters have said. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has thanked UN members for electing his country to the UN Human Rights Council, replacing Russia - which was suspended from the body in April over its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Lipavsky expressed his gratitude at the trust placed in the Czech Republic and said his country would immediately get to work, as part of Thursday's session on human rights abuses caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. The foreign minister said human rights remained a priority for both his party and the Czech government, which he said was returning to the legacy of Vaclav Havel. ""We belong on the Human Rights Council. Russia does not,"" he told Czech news server Novinky.cz The Czech Republic will serve out the remainder of Russia's three-year term on the council. The city's mayor has confirmed that the bodies of 44 civilians were pulled from the rubble The bodies of 44 civilians have been found in the rubble of a collapsed building in the Ukrainian city of Izyum, as the battle for control of the area rages. The five-storey building collapsed in March as residents hid in the basement from Russian shelling. But rescuers have only just been able to reach the building, one local official told the BBC. And there are fears the death toll could rise further, as another building in the same street was also targeted. Read more on this story here. It's approaching 19:00 in Kyiv. Here's a quick roundup of the latest events in Ukraine. US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines Vladimir Putin is preparing for a long war in Ukraine, the US is warning, and a Russian victory in the eastern region of Donbas might not end its attack. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines tells a Senate hearing the next few months could see Russian actions escalate and become more unpredictable. ""The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means,"" Haines says. She warns Russia could seek a land bridge to the breakaway Moldovan territory of Transnistria and says it's likely President Putin will seek to impose martial law in Russia. Haines says Putin is counting on the resolve of the US and of Ukraine's European allies to
weaken over time. But she thinks the Kremlin will only authorise the use of nuclear weapons if Putin perceives an ""existential threat"" to Russia. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Economic growth billed as focus for Queen's Speech,"Boris Johnson has promised to get the country ""back on track"" as the government unveils its plans for the year ahead in the Queen's Speech. The speech is expected to focus on boosting economic growth, but the PM will say that the UK cannot spend its way out of trouble and will need to grow the economy. In all, 38 parliamentary bills are due to be unveiled. Labour said the Tories were not up to the challenge of growing the economy. A senior government source defended the lack of new direct help with the fast-rising cost of living in the Queen's Speech, telling the BBC: ""There's been enough pain relief. It's time for the surgery the economy needs."" Ministers will also recommit to tougher penalties for protest groups, like Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion, who use disruptive tactics. The Prince of Waleswill deliver the addressto Parliament at 11:30 BST, after the Queen pulled out on Monday, for the first time since 1963, due to what Buckingham Palace called ""episodic mobility problems"". The Queen's throne will remain empty, with Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince William expected to be seated in front of assembled politicians. The Sword of State and the Imperial State Crown have been transported from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster, in order to allow the ceremony to begin. What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? What's at stake for PM in the Queen's Speech What might be in the Queen's Speech? How will the Police and Crime Bill change protests? What is levelling up and how is it going? The speech will open with a promise to grow the economy, ease the financial burden on households and pursue the government's levelling up programme, aimed at tackling regional disparities in the UK. But there will be no bill specifically aimed at tackling the cost of living. In a House of Commons debate following the speech, the prime minister is expected to argue the government ""cannot simply spend our way out of the country's problems"", arguing that the answer lies instead in creating highly paid, highly skilled jobs. The comments will follow a recentprediction from the Bank of England,externalthat inflation is likely to rise to around 10% later this year, with food and energy price rises placing a particularly high burden on households. The Household Cavalry take part in ceremonies Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Times are tough for working people. But they are much tougher than they should be. Some 12 years of the Conservatives have meant low economic growth, high inflation, and high taxes. ""Because the Tories are not up to the challenge of growing the economy, all those tax hikes aren't going into improving public services. Never before have people been asked to pay so much for so little."" Liberal Democrat rural affairs spokesman Tim Farron urged the government to use the speech to help the countryside by protecting farmers from being undercut by global trade deals. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused ministers of a ""deafening silence"" over the cost of living, saying they had to ""deliver desperately needed support to put money into people's pockets"". An activist is led away from the blockade of the Tyburn fuel depot in Birmingham In the Queen's Speech there will be seven bills which ministers argue deliver the benefits of Brexit, and a Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill is expected to change planning rules in England after previous proposals led to a backbench rebellion. A Public Order Bill would create a new criminal offence - aimed at protest groups - with a maximum sentence of 12 months for ""interfering with key national infrastructure"" such as airports, railways and printing press. This would also make it illegal to obstruct major transport works such as HS2. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the powers would clamp down on the ""outrageous behaviour"" of ""disruptive protests carried out by a ""self-indulgent minority who seem to revel in causing mayhem and misery"". But the Liberal Democrats called the plans ""dangerous and draconian"", with home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael arguing that police already had the powers to stop ""guerrilla protesters"". The new police powers were originally announced last autumn, after campaign group Insulate Britain began blocking major roads and motorways. Ministers then tried to add the powers as amendments to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - but failed after Labour and other opposition peers teamed up to oppose them. Because the changes were introduced after the bill had passed all its stages in the Commons, the government did not have another opportunity to add them before the previous session of Parliament ended last month. The government will be confident of getting the measures through Parliament in this session as it has a large majority in the House of Commons.

What's at stake for PM in the Queen's Speech,"The Queen has traditionally travelled by carriage to open Parliament - but not this year After a bruising set of local election results and with questions about the prime minister's leadership lingering, the Queen's Speech is meant to be a relaunch moment for Boris Johnson's government. He will try to convince Conservative MPs - and the country - that he can deliver on his promises, and with the next general election expected within two years it's one of the last chances to set out a legislative plan to do so. The cost of living is said to be at the ""forefront"" of the prime minister's mind - he has promised measures to drive economic growth and ease the burden on families and businesses. There's likely to be announcements about maximising so-called Brexit opportunities; amending or removing EU law that was carried over after Brexit and cutting back on regulation in the hope of energising the economy. That will please some Conservative MPs, not least those who've been concerned about the level of state intervention since the pandemic. What might be in the Queen's Speech? What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? Queen pulls out of State Opening speech One backbencher said: ""It's about time. It's been frustrating that we've not looked at Brexit gains in that way. We've been necessarily big state and big spend for the past two years, but it's becoming increasingly uncomfortable. "" But some fear the Queen's Speech will fall far short on direct measures to tackle the rising cost of living, in particular energy bills. One senior Tory MP said: ""I don't get many get constituents emailing me on Brexit opportunities, but I do get businesses emailing me worried about going bust and individuals emailing about not being able to feed their families. ""The government needs to do something substantial. It's not sustainable not to."" With Labour set to claim the government lacks ideas and action on the cost of living, Boris Johnson's challenge will be persuading his party and voters that in this Queen's Speech, he does have some answers. The prime minister promoted British food at a Downing Street event on Monday Levelling-up is expected to feature heavily; the pledge to address regional inequalities that Levelling-Up Secretary Michael Gove said was even more important with the cost of living crisis set to deepen inequality. Expect plans to tackle empty high street shops and vacant second homes, the possibility of more protection for tenants and a schools bill that's intended to raise standards. For some Conservative MPs the emphasis must be on action as much as ambition. One said: ""We've talked a lot about how much we're investing in disadvantaged areas and levelling-up, but for a lot of people that's quite abstract until they see spades in the ground or physical changes. ""A lot of it is about skills and longer term stuff, but it's a balance between that and people being able to see outcomes, because otherwise they're not going to believe us."" The other challenge for Boris Johnson is holding together the coalition of support that swept him to power in 2019; delivering for voters who turned from Labour in the Midlands and north of England, without alienating the traditional Tory voters in parts of the south. There are nerves in the Conservative Party about the progress the Liberal Democratsmade in the recent local elections. It all adds up to there being a lot riding on this Queen's Speech. With confidence in Boris Johnson dented after the partygate saga and some MPs still contemplating his long-term future, the prime minister needs to convince his party and the country he has a plan - and then prove he can deliver.

Sri Lanka unrest flares despite curfew,"Streets were largely calm on Tuesday but there were signs of the protests everywhere Sri Lankan security forces have been ordered to shoot law-breakers on sight in a bid to quell anti-government protests on the island. Demonstrators are calling for the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa over the island's worst economic crisis in history. On Monday, his brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, stepped down as prime minister amid violent street clashes. But the resignation failed to bring calm and violence continued overnight. On Tuesday, the government ordered troops to open fire on anyone looting public property or causing ""harm to life"". It also deployed tens of thousands of army, navy and air force personnel to patrol the streets of the capital Colombo. Despite their presence, the city's top police officer was assaulted on Tuesday afternoon by a mob accusing him of not doing enough to protect peaceful protesters. At Colombo's Galle Face Green, on the sea front, crowds also continued to gather. Police say eight people have died and the capital's main hospital says more than 200 people have been wounded since Monday. Some were injured by pro-government mobs, others when police fired tear gas into crowds. Lawyers acting for the protesters told the BBC they were filing cases against supporters of the prime minister. An island-wide curfew has been extended to Thursday morning as authorities seek to end the violence. Evidence of last night's rioting is everywhere across Colombo - buses thrown into the lake, others with windows smashed out and tyres still burning. This video can not be played ""I never wanted him"" - people from Sri Lanka's protests on the country's leaders In the north-east, protesters gathered in front of Trincomalee Naval Base after unconfirmed reports that Mahinda Rajapaksa had gone there with family members after escaping from his Colombo residence. More than 50 houses of politicians were burned overnight, reports say. Crowds remain outside the office of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, brother of Mahinda, calling on him to quit. Mahinda (right) served two terms as president before returning as PM under his brother (left) Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo Sri Lankans are still reeling from the violence that has erupted. Many politicians are sheltering in safe houses or avoiding appearing in public. ""It is not at all safe, particularly for politicians on the government side,"" Nalaka Godahewa, until recently media minister, told the BBC. His house was among those torched. Mahinda Rajapaksa, once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a war hero for defeating the Tamil Tiger rebels, has suddenly become a villain. Many blame his supporters for targeting anti-government protesters, which then set off a chain of violent events. The Rajapaksas have always stood together but this time their differences are out in the open. The problem appears to have started after Gotabaya asked the family patriarch Mahinda to ""take one for the team"" and resign. How the family, who have dominated Sri Lankan politics for years, overcome this crisis is now an open question. Since last month Sri Lanka has been gripped by escalating demonstrations over soaring prices and power cuts. On Monday, government supporters clashed violently with protesters in Colombo outside Mahinda Rajapaksa's Temple Trees residence, and then at the main protest site at Galle Face Green. The home of government minister Sananth Nishantha was among several set on fire Police and riot squads were deployed, and tear gas and water cannon were fired at government supporters after they breached police lines and attacked protesters using sticks and poles. Angry demonstrators retaliated, attacking government supporters and targeting ruling party MPs, including one who shot two people after a mob swarmed his car and then killed himself, according to police. As the night went on, mobs of protesters across the country torched houses belonging to the Rajapaksas, various ministers and MPs. This included a house turned into a controversial museum by the Rajapaksas in the family's ancestral village in Hambantota in southern Sri Lanka. Areas near the president's official residence were also set ablaze, according to reports. A municipal lawmaker died in hospital after an attack on his house. Following Mahinda Rajapaksa's resignation,protesters attempted to breach the inner compound of Temple Trees where he was staying along with several loyalists, and set fire to a bus outside the home. Police fired shots in the air and tear gas in an attempt to disperse them. Mr Rajapaksa was flown out of Colombo to an undisclosed location on Tuesday morning. Elsewhere in Colombo, tensions remained high. Men armed with sticks and rods had established road blocks on the routes leading to and from the airport, and police and security forces - usually a common sight in the area - were nowhere to be seen. Vehicles were set alight outside Mahinda Rajapaksa's official residence Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Britain in 1948, and people are furious because the cost of living has become unaffordable. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, and people can no longer afford essential items including food, medicines and fuel. The government has requested emergency financial help. It blames the Covid pandemic, which all but killed off Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. But many experts say economic mismanagement is also to blame.

Warhol painting of Marilyn Monroe sold for $195m,"Andy Warhol's ""Shot Sage Blue Marilyn"" at an auction preview in April An iconic painting of Marilyn Monroe by Andy Warhol has been auctioned for $195m (Â£158.17m) - making it the most expensive piece of 20th Century art ever sold. The painting, Shot Sage Blue Marilyn, was painted by Warhol in 1964 using a famous photograph as inspiration. The amount is also the highest ever paid for an American work of art. The Christie's auction in New York was widely seen as a symbol of the luxury art market's health. Ahead of the auction, Christie's wrote that the painting is ""one of the rarest and most transcendent images in existence"", with a selling price ""in the region"" of $200m. The auction ended with a sale price of $170m, which rose to $195m with taxes and fees taken into account. The previous record price for a piece of American artwork was $110.5m for a skull painting created in 1982 by Warhol's sometimes friend and sometimes competitor, Jean-Michael Basquiat. The final price also smashes the previous record for a 20th Century work of art, set in 2015 when a 1955 painting by Pablo Picasso - Les Femmes d'Alger (Version O) - sold for $179.4m, including fees. In March, George Frei, the chairman of the board of the Thomas and Doris Amman Foundation, said in a statement that the painting of Monroe ""bears witness to her undiminished visual power in the new millennium"". ""Marilyn the woman is gone; the terrible circumstances of her life and death are forgotten,"" Mr Frei said. ""All that remains is the enigmatic smile that links her to another mysterious smile of a distinguished lady, the Mona Lisa."" Bloomberg reports that the winning bidder was US art dealer Larry Gagosian, who owns a chain of art galleries. According to Christie's, all the proceeds of the sale will go to the Switzerland-based Thomas and Doris Ammann Foundation Zurich, which works to establish healthcare and education programmes for children around the world. The auction on Monday is the first of a series of art auctions planned by Christie's and Sotheby's over the next two weeks, widely considered to be a test of the luxury art market's health in the post-pandemic era. Philip Hoffman, the founder of New York-based advisory company the Fine Art Group, told the New York times that there is a ""huge amount of pent-up demand"" for art. ""Everybody was waiting for the right moment,"" he said. ""And the right moment has come."" Painting believed to be first of Cromwell's mum Artwork brings history of empire to new audiences.

Guard dead and inmate captured after manhunt,"Inmate Casey White (L) and corrections officer Vicky White A female prison guard who went on the run with a murder suspect from an Alabama jail has died after shooting herself as the pair were caught, police say. Vicky White, 56, died in hospital after she and Casey White (no relation), 38, were arrested in Indiana following an 11-day manhunt. The two had vanished from a prison in Lauderdale County on 29 April. They are believed to have been romantically involved. According to officials, they were last seen as she was transporting him to a bogus mental health evaluation. It was Ms White's last day at work before retirement. She had recently sold her home and told colleagues she planned to spend more time at the beach. Late on Monday, the Vanderburgh County Coroners Office confirmed that Vicky White died in a local hospital after shooting herself during the arrest. More information on her death is expected to be released on Tuesday following an autopsy. This video can not be played WATCH: CCTV footage of guard and inmate escaping The US Marshals Service said Ms White had been spotted leaving a hotel in Evansville, Indiana with a wig on before getting into a car driven by Casey White. A police chase ensued, ending when a marshal rammed his vehicle into the couple's Cadillac, at which point Casey White surrendered, saying his ""wife"" had shot herself and needed help. ""We got a dangerous man off the street today. He is never going to see the light of day again,"" Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said. At least one gun was found inside the vehicle, police said. According to US Marshals, the two had previously been last seen on Friday driving a copper-coloured Ford Edge with an Alabama registration plate. On Monday, Sheriff Singleton described the 6ft 9in Casey White as ""extremely dangerous"" and advised law enforcement not to ""take any chances"" with him. Meanwhile, Ms White had a spotless record as a prison guard. ""I would have trusted Vicky with my life. I really mean it,"" Lauderdale County District Attorney Chris Connolly told reporters. ""If we needed something from the jail, she was our go-to person, solid employee. That's why it's so shocking."" Casey White was charged in September 2020 with murder over the stabbing of 58-year-old Connie Ridgeway. He was already serving 75 years for a series of violent crimes in 2015, including burglary, vehicle theft and a police chase. He allegedly confessed to the murder, but later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and was awaiting trial at the Lauderdale County Jail when he disappeared, authorities added. He faces execution if convicted. The prisoner also now faces an escape charge and will be returned to the Alabama corrections system.

Economy growth billed as focus for Queen's Speech,"Boris Johnson has promised to get the country ""back on track"" as the government unveils its plans for the year ahead in the Queen's Speech. The speech is expected to focus on boosting economic growth, but the PM will say that the UK cannot spend its way out of trouble and will need to grow the economy. In all, 38 parliamentary bills are due to be unveiled. Labour said the Tories were not up to the challenge of growing the economy. A senior government source defended the lack of new direct help with the fast-rising cost of living in the Queen's Speech, telling the BBC: ""There's been enough pain relief. It's time for the surgery the economy needs."" Ministers will also recommit to tougher penalties for protest groups, like Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion, who use disruptive tactics. The Prince of Waleswill deliver the addressto Parliament at 11:30 BST, after the Queen pulled out on Monday, for the first time since 1963, due to what Buckingham Palace called ""episodic mobility problems"". The Queen's throne will remain empty, with Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince William expected to be seated in front of assembled politicians. The Sword of State and the Imperial State Crown have been transported from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster, in order to allow the ceremony to begin. What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? What's at stake for PM in the Queen's Speech What might be in the Queen's Speech? How will the Police and Crime Bill change protests? What is levelling up and how is it going? The speech will open with a promise to grow the economy, ease the financial burden on households and pursue the government's levelling up programme, aimed at tackling regional disparities in the UK. But there will be no bill specifically aimed at tackling the cost of living. In a House of Commons debate following the speech, the prime minister is expected to argue the government ""cannot simply spend our way out of the country's problems"", arguing that the answer lies instead in creating highly paid, highly skilled jobs. The comments will follow a recentprediction from the Bank of England,externalthat inflation is likely to rise to around 10% later this year, with food and energy price rises placing a particularly high burden on households. The Household Cavalry take part in ceremonies Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Times are tough for working people. But they are much tougher than they should be. Some 12 years of the Conservatives have meant low economic growth, high inflation, and high taxes. ""Because the Tories are not up to the challenge of growing the economy, all those tax hikes aren't going into improving public services. Never before have people been asked to pay so much for so little."" Liberal Democrat rural affairs spokesman Tim Farron urged the government to use the speech to help the countryside by protecting farmers from being undercut by global trade deals. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused ministers of a ""deafening silence"" over the cost of living, saying they had to ""deliver desperately needed support to put money into people's pockets"". An activist is led away from the blockade of the Tyburn fuel depot in Birmingham In the Queen's Speech there will be seven bills which ministers argue deliver the benefits of Brexit, and a Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill is expected to change planning rules in England after previous proposals led to a backbench rebellion. A Public Order Bill would create a new criminal offence - aimed at protest groups - with a maximum sentence of 12 months for ""interfering with key national infrastructure"" such as airports, railways and printing press. This would also make it illegal to obstruct major transport works such as HS2. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the powers would clamp down on the ""outrageous behaviour"" of ""disruptive protests carried out by a ""self-indulgent minority who seem to revel in causing mayhem and misery"". But the Liberal Democrats called the plans ""dangerous and draconian"", with home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael arguing that police already had the powers to stop ""guerrilla protesters"". The new police powers were originally announced last autumn, after campaign group Insulate Britain began blocking major roads and motorways. Ministers then tried to add the powers as amendments to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - but failed after Labour and other opposition peers teamed up to oppose them. Because the changes were introduced after the bill had passed all its stages in the Commons, the government did not have another opportunity to add them before the previous session of Parliament ended last month. The government will be confident of getting the measures through Parliament in this session as it has a large majority in the House of Commons.

"Ukraine's EU bid will take decades - MacronThe French leader suggests other ways the EU can help Ukraine, other than fast tracking its membership.Europe","Mr Macron (L) later joined German leader Olaf Scholz in Berlin It will take decades for Ukraine to be accepted into the European Union, France's Emmanuel Macron has said. In a speech to the EU's parliament in Strasbourg, he instead suggested Ukraine could join a ""parallel European community"" while it awaited a decision. This would allow non-EU members to join Europe's security architecture in other ways, said President Macron. His words came as fierce fighting continued in the eastern Donbas region, where Russia is trying to make gains. A senior US defence official characterised the Russian advance as ""single-digit kilometre kind of progress"". A Ukrainian leader in the Luhansk region said serious battles were taking place. In other developments on Monday: President Vladimir Putin marked Russia's Victory Day by insisting that Russian forces in Ukraine were fighting for their motherland. But he made no major announcements in his speech US President Joe Biden said he was worried that Mr Putin did not have a way out of the war. He said Mr Putin had mistakenly believed the war would break up Nato and the EU Several missiles struck the southern city of Odesa, hitting a shopping centre and a warehouse, local officials said Pro-Ukraine activists sprayed Russia's ambassador to Poland with red liquid while he was visiting a Soviet military cemetery in Warsaw Ukraine began the process of applying to join the EU in February this year, four days after Russia's invasion. ""We all know perfectly well that the process to allow [Ukraine] to join would take several years indeed, probably several decades,"" Mr Macron said. He added: ""That is the truth, unless we decide to lower the standards for accession. And rethink the unity of our Europe."" Fierce fighting continued in eastern Ukraine on Monday Mr Macron said a ""parallel European community"" should be considered instead, rather than suspending the EU's strict membership criteria to fast-track Ukraine's application. He said it would be ""a way of anchoring countries which are geographically in Europe and share our values"". His comments came shortly after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the EU's executive would be publishing its initial opinion on Ukraine's bid for membership in June. Kyiv officials confirmed on Monday that Ukraine had submitted the second part of its EU membership application to Brussels. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It normally takes years for countries to negotiate EU membership, with candidates having to prove that they meet multiple criteria - from respecting democracy and the rule of law to having a robust enough economy. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has suggested the EU use a special procedure to grant Ukraine immediate membership of the bloc, but this has not happened. Later on Monday, the French president made his first foreign visit since re-election to Berlin, for talks with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the EU's response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Speaking at a press conference before the meeting, Mr Scholz said Russia's war of aggression had made co-operation between Paris and Berlin even more important. ""This is something that shocks us but also welds us together because we must act together,"" he said. ""It cannot be the case that borders in Europe can be moved around with violence."" Russians celebrated Victory Day on Monday - Mr Putin insisted his forces in Ukraine were ""fighting for our homeland"" The EU is trying to agree a sixth package of sanctions on Russia, including a phased ban on imports of oil, with longer delays for some landlocked states in Central Europe. However, Hungary has refused to back the oil embargo, describing it as an ""atomic bomb"" for its economy. Ms von der Leyen travelled to Budapest on Monday in an attempt to resolve the deadlock.

Warhol painting of Marilyn Monroe sold for $195mThe record-breaking sum is the highest ever paid for either an American or 20th Century work of art.US & Canada,"Andy Warhol's ""Shot Sage Blue Marilyn"" at an auction preview in April An iconic painting of Marilyn Monroe by Andy Warhol has been auctioned for $195m (Â£158.17m) - making it the most expensive piece of 20th Century art ever sold. The painting, Shot Sage Blue Marilyn, was painted by Warhol in 1964 using a famous photograph as inspiration. The amount is also the highest ever paid for an American work of art. The Christie's auction in New York was widely seen as a symbol of the luxury art market's health. Ahead of the auction, Christie's wrote that the painting is ""one of the rarest and most transcendent images in existence"", with a selling price ""in the region"" of $200m. The auction ended with a sale price of $170m, which rose to $195m with taxes and fees taken into account. The previous record price for a piece of American artwork was $110.5m for a skull painting created in 1982 by Warhol's sometimes friend and sometimes competitor, Jean-Michael Basquiat. The final price also smashes the previous record for a 20th Century work of art, set in 2015 when a 1955 painting by Pablo Picasso - Les Femmes d'Alger (Version O) - sold for $179.4m, including fees. In March, George Frei, the chairman of the board of the Thomas and Doris Amman Foundation, said in a statement that the painting of Monroe ""bears witness to her undiminished visual power in the new millennium"". ""Marilyn the woman is gone; the terrible circumstances of her life and death are forgotten,"" Mr Frei said. ""All that remains is the enigmatic smile that links her to another mysterious smile of a distinguished lady, the Mona Lisa."" Bloomberg reports that the winning bidder was US art dealer Larry Gagosian, who owns a chain of art galleries. According to Christie's, all the proceeds of the sale will go to the Switzerland-based Thomas and Doris Ammann Foundation Zurich, which works to establish healthcare and education programmes for children around the world. The auction on Monday is the first of a series of art auctions planned by Christie's and Sotheby's over the next two weeks, widely considered to be a test of the luxury art market's health in the post-pandemic era. Philip Hoffman, the founder of New York-based advisory company the Fine Art Group, told the New York times that there is a ""huge amount of pent-up demand"" for art. ""Everybody was waiting for the right moment,"" he said. ""And the right moment has come."" Painting believed to be first of Cromwell's mum Artwork brings history of empire to new audiences.

What PM needs from the speech,"The Queen has traditionally travelled by carriage to open Parliament - but not this year After a bruising set of local election results and with questions about the prime minister's leadership lingering, the Queen's Speech is meant to be a relaunch moment for Boris Johnson's government. He will try to convince Conservative MPs - and the country - that he can deliver on his promises, and with the next general election expected within two years it's one of the last chances to set out a legislative plan to do so. The cost of living is said to be at the ""forefront"" of the prime minister's mind - he has promised measures to drive economic growth and ease the burden on families and businesses. There's likely to be announcements about maximising so-called Brexit opportunities; amending or removing EU law that was carried over after Brexit and cutting back on regulation in the hope of energising the economy. That will please some Conservative MPs, not least those who've been concerned about the level of state intervention since the pandemic. What might be in the Queen's Speech? What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? Queen pulls out of State Opening speech One backbencher said: ""It's about time. It's been frustrating that we've not looked at Brexit gains in that way. We've been necessarily big state and big spend for the past two years, but it's becoming increasingly uncomfortable. "" But some fear the Queen's Speech will fall far short on direct measures to tackle the rising cost of living, in particular energy bills. One senior Tory MP said: ""I don't get many get constituents emailing me on Brexit opportunities, but I do get businesses emailing me worried about going bust and individuals emailing about not being able to feed their families. ""The government needs to do something substantial. It's not sustainable not to."" With Labour set to claim the government lacks ideas and action on the cost of living, Boris Johnson's challenge will be persuading his party and voters that in this Queen's Speech, he does have some answers. The prime minister promoted British food at a Downing Street event on Monday Levelling-up is expected to feature heavily; the pledge to address regional inequalities that Levelling-Up Secretary Michael Gove said was even more important with the cost of living crisis set to deepen inequality. Expect plans to tackle empty high street shops and vacant second homes, the possibility of more protection for tenants and a schools bill that's intended to raise standards. For some Conservative MPs the emphasis must be on action as much as ambition. One said: ""We've talked a lot about how much we're investing in disadvantaged areas and levelling-up, but for a lot of people that's quite abstract until they see spades in the ground or physical changes. ""A lot of it is about skills and longer term stuff, but it's a balance between that and people being able to see outcomes, because otherwise they're not going to believe us."" The other challenge for Boris Johnson is holding together the coalition of support that swept him to power in 2019; delivering for voters who turned from Labour in the Midlands and north of England, without alienating the traditional Tory voters in parts of the south. There are nerves in the Conservative Party about the progress the Liberal Democratsmade in the recent local elections. It all adds up to there being a lot riding on this Queen's Speech. With confidence in Boris Johnson dented after the partygate saga and some MPs still contemplating his long-term future, the prime minister needs to convince his party and the country he has a plan - and then prove he can deliver.

The Pentagon believes that Russia has used about 10 to 12 of its hypersonic weapons since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a senior defence official. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the official said the US does not have ""a perfect count"" of the deployment of the weapon. Russia claims the Kinzhal missile - which can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h - was first fired at a target in Ukraine in March. More recently, Ukrainian officials have claimed that the weapon was fired at targets in Odesa over the weekend. The US official, however, said that he doesn't ""have anything to indicate"" that they were used against targets in the city. Learn more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

Fuel supplies in Europe face possible disruption after Ukraine vowed to suspend an important route for Russian gas. Operators of the Ukrainian gas system said they would switch off the Sokhranivka route from 07:00 local time on Wednesday. The route accounts for a third of Russia's supply to Europe. They claim to be unable to operate a gas station through the Luhansk region due to Russian occupation, and so plan to switch to an entry point in Ukrainian-held territory. But Russian state-owned gas firm Gazprom said it was not feasible to make such a switch - and questioned the Ukrainian justification. Ukraine remains a major supply route for Russian gas to Europe - despite the war.

After repeated airstrikes that struck the city in March and early April, an uneasy calm has fallen over Dnipro, the fourth largest city in Ukraine. During a recent visit, the author David Patrikarakosdescribed a,externalcity largely defended by volunteer militias that lie between ""Ukraineâs two worlds: West and East; Europe and Russia."" ""Its geographical location makes it vital to the country's war effort,"" he wrote. ""Dniproâs central location makes it the countryâs most important logistical hub."" Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra - pictured here rehearsing - are this year's favourites Ukrainian entrants Kalush Orchestra have given an energetic performance during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest. The rap/folk band are favourites to win this year's edition of the historic singing competition - thanks to their song Stefania. Ukraine is among 17 countries taking part in this evening's event in the Italian city of Turin - along with the likes of the Netherlands, Portugal and Greece. The second semi takes place on Thursday - ahead of the final on Saturday night. Audiences in the UK can watch tonight's event live on BBC Three. Find out more about this year's competitionhere. Welcome to our latest coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you're just joining us - or are in need of a recap - here are some of the latest headlines. Millions of tonnes cannot be exported from Ukraine due to a Russian blockade The war in Ukraine has made Syria's problems even worse than before, the UN's high commissioner for refugees has told the BBC. Speaking to the World Service's Newshour programme, Filippo Grandi said the humanitarian situation inside Syria had become ""quite catastrophic"". Food insecurity caused by the Ukraine crisis has had a ""terrible impact"" on Syria and its neighbours, he added. Russia's blockade along the Black Sea coast has meant millions of tonnes of grain cannot be sent overseas. Ukraine is one of the world's top exporters of wheat. Grandi also acknowledged that there could be a double-standard at work in Europe's treatment of refugees. He said it was ""unacceptable, racist and discriminatory"" that Ukrainians were sometimes seen as ""real"" refugees while others - including those from the Middle East - were not. Leonid Kravchuk and Vitaly Klitschko in March 2021 The first president of the modern state of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, has passed away at 88, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko. On his Telegram channel, Klitschko said that Kravchuk was a man who embodied ""talent, strong character and knowledge"". Kravchuk, who was formerly chairman of Ukraine's rada - or parliament - and the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR during the waning days of the Soviet Union, became president in December 1991 and remained in office until July 1994. A second campaign to be president ended with an electoral loss to his former prime minister, Leonid Kuchma. Among his most consequential decisions was signing the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, pledging to give up the nuclear arsenal Ukraine was left with after the Soviet Union's collapse. In his post, Klitschko said that Kravchuk's legacy was particularly important at a time when Ukraine is fighting Russia. ""We will preserve the sovereignty and will that we got more than 30 years ago,"" Klitschko wrote. ""We will not retreat."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In the US, two of the nationâs senior intelligence officials, National Intelligence Director Avril Haines and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Scott Berrier, have painted a sobering picture of the war in Ukraine. The two officials spoke before the Senate armed services committee about global threats to the US on Tuesday, and they highlighted their concerns about Russia. âWe assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine,â said Haines. âHe is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse.â Berrier explained that the two enemies, the Russians and the Ukrainians, had reached an impasse. Said Berrier: âThe Russians arenât winning, and the Ukrainians arenât winning, and weâre at a bit of a stalemate.â Their presentations were significant because of the situation they described in Ukraine and also because parts of the hearing were open to the public. Intelligence officials have argued in the past that these hearings should be held behind closed doors. But their presentation provides one of the only chances for the public to hear directly from them about security issues. Their assessment of the war is particularly important as people in the US evaluate the ongoing conflict, the role of the US and the impact of the war on gas prices and other aspects of everyday life. A destroyed Russian tank pictured on 6 May Russian forces are several weeks behind where Vladimir Putin expected them to be after shifting the focus of military operations to Ukraine's eastern Donbas, according to a senior US defence official. Speaking in a briefing call with reporters on Tuesday, the official said that Putin is ""easily two weeks, or maybe even more, behind where he wanted to be in the east"". At the end of April, a US defence official said that Russia was ""several days"" behind schedule. Additionally on Tuesday, the official noted that sanctions are making it more difficult to replenish stocks of guided munitions. The official said that since the sinking of the Moskva in the Black Sea, Russian naval vessels have stayed ""well south"" of the port city of Odesa. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko pictured in an undisclosed location in Ukraine The city council of Mariupol, one of Ukraine's most attacked cities, has collected over 800 reports of war crimes from residents who have managed to flee the besieged city. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko told Media Center Ukraine that all of the information regarding the alleged war crimes has been passed on to the region's prosecutor's office. The mayor said residents provided testimonies of key attacks in the city, including ""the maternity ward of Mariupol destroyed by the enemy plane, and the Drama Theatre, where a lot of women and children died, and hospital 1, where Mariupol residents with severe injuries burnt alive"". All of the evidence will be part of a wider criminal proceeding into the genocide of Mariupol residents, he said. ""There are numerous examples of war crimes of Russian occupation army led by their main criminal, Putin,"" the mayor added. Read more on the attacks in Mariupol: Ukrainian troops map their position in the Kharkiv region Ukraine claims to have liberated four settlements in the north-easternKharkiv region. Cherkasy Tyshky, Ruski Tyshky, Rubizhne and Bayrak were all snatched back from Russia, said the latest update from the armed forces. Russia was continuing to intensify its offensive in Ukraine's east, the update said. The greatest activity was observed in the directions ofSlobozhanskeandDonetsk. Russian troops were reportedly replenishing ammunition and logistics while a battle forIzyumrages on. But their advances in multiple other areas were said to be proving unsuccessful. The update also confirmed that Russian efforts inMariupolwere focused on assaulting the Azovstal metal works, where more than 1,000 Ukrainian fighters are thought to be sheltering. It was not possible for the BBC to independently confirm the armed forces' claims. The devastated Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's southern city Mariupol has been surrounded and bombarded for weeks. Russian forces backed by tanks are currently conducting ""storming operations"" at Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, according to Ukraine's defence ministry. The ""Azov - Mariupol"" channel on messaging app Telegram has posted what appears to be photos of the wounded soldiers holding out in the plant. ""The whole civilised world must see the conditions in which the wounded, crippled defenders of Mariupol are and act!"", says a Telegram message from the fighters posted alongside the photos. There are more than 1,000 troops trapped in the plant, including hundreds who are injured, the Ukrainian deputy PM says. In the Telegram message the fighters appeal to the UN and the Red Cross to ""show their humanity"" and rescue the wounded, who are ""no longer combatants"". ""We demand the immediate evacuation of the wounded servicemen to the territories controlled by Ukraine,"" the fighters have said. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has thanked UN members for electing his country to the UN Human Rights Council, replacing Russia - which was suspended from the body in April over its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Lipavsky expressed his gratitude at the trust placed in the Czech Republic and said his country would immediately get to work, as part of Thursday's session on human rights abuses caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. The foreign minister said human rights remained a priority for both his party and the Czech government, which he said was returning to the legacy of Vaclav Havel. ""We belong on the Human Rights Council. Russia does not,"" he told Czech news server Novinky.cz The Czech Republic will serve out the remainder of Russia's three-year term on the council. The city's mayor has confirmed that the bodies of 44 civilians were pulled from the rubble The bodies of 44 civilians have been found in the rubble of a collapsed building in the Ukrainian city of Izyum, as the battle for control of the area rages. The five-storey building collapsed in March as residents hid in the basement from Russian shelling. But rescuers have only just been able to reach the building, one local official told the BBC. And there are fears the death toll could rise further, as another building in the same street was also targeted. Read more on this story here. It's approaching 19:00 in Kyiv. Here's a quick roundup of the latest events in Ukraine. US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines Vladimir Putin is preparing for a long war in Ukraine, the US is warning, and a Russian victory in the eastern region of Donbas might not end its attack. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines tells a Senate hearing the next few months could see Russian actions escalate and become more unpredictable. ""The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means,"" Haines says. She warns Russia could seek a land bridge to the breakaway Moldovan territory of Transnistria and says it's likely President Putin will seek to impose martial law in Russia. Haines says Putin is counting on the resolve of the US and of Ukraine's European allies to
weaken over time. But she thinks the Kremlin will only authorise the use of nuclear weapons if Putin perceives an ""existential threat"" to Russia. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Economy growth billed as focus for Queen's SpeechThe PM promises to address the cost of living but says the UK cannot spend its way out of trouble.UK PoliticsComments,"Boris Johnson has promised to get the country ""back on track"" as the government unveils its plans for the year ahead in the Queen's Speech. The speech is expected to focus on boosting economic growth, but the PM will say that the UK cannot spend its way out of trouble and will need to grow the economy. In all, 38 parliamentary bills are due to be unveiled. Labour said the Tories were not up to the challenge of growing the economy. A senior government source defended the lack of new direct help with the fast-rising cost of living in the Queen's Speech, telling the BBC: ""There's been enough pain relief. It's time for the surgery the economy needs."" Ministers will also recommit to tougher penalties for protest groups, like Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion, who use disruptive tactics. The Prince of Waleswill deliver the addressto Parliament at 11:30 BST, after the Queen pulled out on Monday, for the first time since 1963, due to what Buckingham Palace called ""episodic mobility problems"". The Queen's throne will remain empty, with Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince William expected to be seated in front of assembled politicians. The Sword of State and the Imperial State Crown have been transported from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster, in order to allow the ceremony to begin. What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? What's at stake for PM in the Queen's Speech What might be in the Queen's Speech? How will the Police and Crime Bill change protests? What is levelling up and how is it going? The speech will open with a promise to grow the economy, ease the financial burden on households and pursue the government's levelling up programme, aimed at tackling regional disparities in the UK. But there will be no bill specifically aimed at tackling the cost of living. In a House of Commons debate following the speech, the prime minister is expected to argue the government ""cannot simply spend our way out of the country's problems"", arguing that the answer lies instead in creating highly paid, highly skilled jobs. The comments will follow a recentprediction from the Bank of England,externalthat inflation is likely to rise to around 10% later this year, with food and energy price rises placing a particularly high burden on households. The Household Cavalry take part in ceremonies Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Times are tough for working people. But they are much tougher than they should be. Some 12 years of the Conservatives have meant low economic growth, high inflation, and high taxes. ""Because the Tories are not up to the challenge of growing the economy, all those tax hikes aren't going into improving public services. Never before have people been asked to pay so much for so little."" Liberal Democrat rural affairs spokesman Tim Farron urged the government to use the speech to help the countryside by protecting farmers from being undercut by global trade deals. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused ministers of a ""deafening silence"" over the cost of living, saying they had to ""deliver desperately needed support to put money into people's pockets"". An activist is led away from the blockade of the Tyburn fuel depot in Birmingham In the Queen's Speech there will be seven bills which ministers argue deliver the benefits of Brexit, and a Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill is expected to change planning rules in England after previous proposals led to a backbench rebellion. A Public Order Bill would create a new criminal offence - aimed at protest groups - with a maximum sentence of 12 months for ""interfering with key national infrastructure"" such as airports, railways and printing press. This would also make it illegal to obstruct major transport works such as HS2. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the powers would clamp down on the ""outrageous behaviour"" of ""disruptive protests carried out by a ""self-indulgent minority who seem to revel in causing mayhem and misery"". But the Liberal Democrats called the plans ""dangerous and draconian"", with home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael arguing that police already had the powers to stop ""guerrilla protesters"". The new police powers were originally announced last autumn, after campaign group Insulate Britain began blocking major roads and motorways. Ministers then tried to add the powers as amendments to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - but failed after Labour and other opposition peers teamed up to oppose them. Because the changes were introduced after the bill had passed all its stages in the Commons, the government did not have another opportunity to add them before the previous session of Parliament ended last month. The government will be confident of getting the measures through Parliament in this session as it has a large majority in the House of Commons.

Guard dead and inmate captured after manhuntCasey White and guard Vicky White were suspected of having struck up a relationship.US & Canada,"Inmate Casey White (L) and corrections officer Vicky White A female prison guard who went on the run with a murder suspect from an Alabama jail has died after shooting herself as the pair were caught, police say. Vicky White, 56, died in hospital after she and Casey White (no relation), 38, were arrested in Indiana following an 11-day manhunt. The two had vanished from a prison in Lauderdale County on 29 April. They are believed to have been romantically involved. According to officials, they were last seen as she was transporting him to a bogus mental health evaluation. It was Ms White's last day at work before retirement. She had recently sold her home and told colleagues she planned to spend more time at the beach. Late on Monday, the Vanderburgh County Coroners Office confirmed that Vicky White died in a local hospital after shooting herself during the arrest. More information on her death is expected to be released on Tuesday following an autopsy. This video can not be played WATCH: CCTV footage of guard and inmate escaping The US Marshals Service said Ms White had been spotted leaving a hotel in Evansville, Indiana with a wig on before getting into a car driven by Casey White. A police chase ensued, ending when a marshal rammed his vehicle into the couple's Cadillac, at which point Casey White surrendered, saying his ""wife"" had shot herself and needed help. ""We got a dangerous man off the street today. He is never going to see the light of day again,"" Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said. At least one gun was found inside the vehicle, police said. According to US Marshals, the two had previously been last seen on Friday driving a copper-coloured Ford Edge with an Alabama registration plate. On Monday, Sheriff Singleton described the 6ft 9in Casey White as ""extremely dangerous"" and advised law enforcement not to ""take any chances"" with him. Meanwhile, Ms White had a spotless record as a prison guard. ""I would have trusted Vicky with my life. I really mean it,"" Lauderdale County District Attorney Chris Connolly told reporters. ""If we needed something from the jail, she was our go-to person, solid employee. That's why it's so shocking."" Casey White was charged in September 2020 with murder over the stabbing of 58-year-old Connie Ridgeway. He was already serving 75 years for a series of violent crimes in 2015, including burglary, vehicle theft and a police chase. He allegedly confessed to the murder, but later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and was awaiting trial at the Lauderdale County Jail when he disappeared, authorities added. He faces execution if convicted. The prisoner also now faces an escape charge and will be returned to the Alabama corrections system.

Queen's speech to commit to Troubles legislationLaws to deal with the legacy of the Troubles have been delayed by about six months.Northern Ireland,"An amnesty from Troubles prosecutions could be conditional upon cooperation with truth recovery investigations, the government has revealed. This would change a key aspect of plans to deal with the conflict's legacy. Details are contained in a paper published after the Queen's Speech on new legislation. Ministers aim to pass the Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill in the coming months. The Queen's Speech,which was delivered by the Prince of Wales on Tuesday, is used to set out plans for new laws. The address also included plans for the Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Bill, which commits to delivering on commitments about identity and language negotiated in theNew Decade, New Approach,externalagreement of 2020. This gives recognition and protection to the Irish language and will enhance and develop the Ulster Scots/Ulster British tradition. ""This will recognise and celebrate Northern Ireland's natural and cultural identities and accommodate cultural differences,"" the statement continued. It includes the creation of a new office of identity and cultural expression and two commissioners to be appointed by the first and deputy first ministers. Although not outlined in the papers which accompanied the Queen's Speech, the government has also modified its position on banning all Troubles-related civil cases and inquests. It is understood existing claims could continue to a conclusion, as would any inquests which have started by the time the legislation comes into effect. It is not yet clear when the draft legislation will be introduced into Parliament, or what start date the government has in mind for the new arrangements to come into force. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says he will need to see the draft legislation before judging it Speaking after the speech, the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson,  whose partyhad been opposed to the original amnesty plans, said he would have to wait to see the contents of the bill. ""I am not sure it will reflect the initial proposals,"" he told BBC News NI. ""I want to see does it offer the chance for innocent victims to see those who perpetrated their murderous deeds against loved ones prosecuted? ""What does the process look like? Are we talking about a blanket statute of limitations?"" he asked. ""We are clear and always have been that justice must not be sacrificed,"" he added. ""The innocent victims families have waited for years, some for decades for the opportunity to have justice brought and they have the right to pursue that. ""We will judge what the government proposes against whether the opportunity for justice remains,"" he added. Asked whether he would accept a conditional statute of limitations he said he would have to see the detail of such a plan. ""We must not allow a situation to develop where people are able to rewrite the narrative which suggests that terrorists which committed terrible atrocities across the board are somehow either exonerated or can walk away,"" he said. ""That is not what the people of Northern Ireland want. They want truth but they also want justice,"" he added. It will be a day remembered for who wasn't there and, for unionists, what wasn't included in the government's legislative plan. There was no mention of the much talked about legislation to over ride parts of the Northern Ireland protocol. Instead, buried deep in the Executive summary was a vague reference to protecting the the UK's internal ""economic bonds"". The government steered cleared of any legislative commitment around the protocol, much to the frustration of the DUP. The party says it needs actions and not words. Away from the pomp and ceremony, the state opening of Parliament allows the government to press the reset button at Westminster but there is no sign of a reboot at Stormont anytime soon. Northern Ireland is currently without a first or deputy first minister because the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to nominate to the joint office as part of its protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the part of the UK's Brexit deal with the European Union, which retains free trade across the Irish border but introduced checks on some goods moving across the Irish Sea from the UK to Northern Ireland. Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol? The DUP has said it will not go back into government in Northern Ireland until its concerns over these post-Brexit trading arrangements are resolved. The Queen's Speech referenced the protocol and said it ""needs to change"". Secretary of State Brandon Lewis announced the plan to ban prosecutions last July ""We urge our partners in the EU to work with us, with new imagination and flexibility, to deliver that,"" it outlined. ""We will continue to talk with the EU but we will not let that stand in the way of protecting peace and stability in Northern Ireland."" Legislation on the controversial amnesty proposals have been held up by about six months as the government continues to engage with parties and victims' groups. The plans emerged last July when the government proposed""drawing a line under the Troubles"" by banning any more prosecutions. This would cover all Troubles-related incidents involving paramilitary organisations as well as the police and Army. But the idea has faced widespread opposition in Northern Ireland. Instead of prosecutions, inquests and civil cases,the government has suggested a truth recovery process for bereaved families, including a level of disclosure by the state ""that has never happened before"". In recent months, it has been examining how to make truth recovery a more robust investigative process. What's at stake for PM in the Queen's Speech Plan to end all NI Troubles prosecutions confirmed NI secretary 'didn't deliver' on legacy legislation MLAs back motion to oppose Troubles legacy plans The government has come undermounting pressure from its own back benches to act quickerin order to prevent any further prosecutions of former soldiers. The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) has yet to make decisions on 12 veterans as part of a wider legacy caseload. There are also about1,200 unsolved Troubles-related killings currently with the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which would take 20 years to work through.

The Queen's Speech,which was delivered by the Prince of Wales on Tuesday, is used to set out plans for new laws. The address also included plans for the Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Bill, which commits to delivering on commitments about identity and language negotiated in theNew Decade, New Approach,externalagreement of 2020. This gives recognition and protection to the Irish language and will enhance and develop the Ulster Scots/Ulster British tradition. ""This will recognise and celebrate Northern Ireland's natural and cultural identities and accommodate cultural differences,"" the statement continued. It includes the creation of a new office of identity and cultural expression and two commissioners to be appointed by the first and deputy first ministers. Although not outlined in the papers which accompanied the Queen's Speech, the government has also modified its position on banning all Troubles-related civil cases and inquests. It is understood existing claims could continue to a conclusion, as would any inquests which have started by the time the legislation comes into effect. It is not yet clear when the draft legislation will be introduced into Parliament, or what start date the government has in mind for the new arrangements to come into force. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says he will need to see the draft legislation before judging it Speaking after the speech, the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson,  whose partyhad been opposed to the original amnesty plans, said he would have to wait to see the contents of the bill. ""I am not sure it will reflect the initial proposals,"" he told BBC News NI. ""I want to see does it offer the chance for innocent victims to see those who perpetrated their murderous deeds against loved ones prosecuted? ""What does the process look like? Are we talking about a blanket statute of limitations?"" he asked. ""We are clear and always have been that justice must not be sacrificed,"" he added. ""The innocent victims families have waited for years, some for decades for the opportunity to have justice brought and they have the right to pursue that. ""We will judge what the government proposes against whether the opportunity for justice remains,"" he added. Asked whether he would accept a conditional statute of limitations he said he would have to see the detail of such a plan. ""We must not allow a situation to develop where people are able to rewrite the narrative which suggests that terrorists which committed terrible atrocities across the board are somehow either exonerated or can walk away,"" he said. ""That is not what the people of Northern Ireland want. They want truth but they also want justice,"" he added. It will be a day remembered for who wasn't there and, for unionists, what wasn't included in the government's legislative plan. There was no mention of the much talked about legislation to over ride parts of the Northern Ireland protocol. Instead, buried deep in the Executive summary was a vague reference to protecting the the UK's internal ""economic bonds"". The government steered cleared of any legislative commitment around the protocol, much to the frustration of the DUP. The party says it needs actions and not words. Away from the pomp and ceremony, the state opening of Parliament allows the government to press the reset button at Westminster but there is no sign of a reboot at Stormont anytime soon. Northern Ireland is currently without a first or deputy first minister because the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to nominate to the joint office as part of its protest against the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol is the part of the UK's Brexit deal with the European Union, which retains free trade across the Irish border but introduced checks on some goods moving across the Irish Sea from the UK to Northern Ireland. Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol? The DUP has said it will not go back into government in Northern Ireland until its concerns over these post-Brexit trading arrangements are resolved. The Queen's Speech referenced the protocol and said it ""needs to change"". Secretary of State Brandon Lewis announced the plan to ban prosecutions last July ""We urge our partners in the EU to work with us, with new imagination and flexibility, to deliver that,"" it outlined. ""We will continue to talk with the EU but we will not let that stand in the way of protecting peace and stability in Northern Ireland."" Legislation on the controversial amnesty proposals have been held up by about six months as the government continues to engage with parties and victims' groups. The plans emerged last July when the government proposed""drawing a line under the Troubles"" by banning any more prosecutions. This would cover all Troubles-related incidents involving paramilitary organisations as well as the police and Army. But the idea has faced widespread opposition in Northern Ireland. Instead of prosecutions, inquests and civil cases,the government has suggested a truth recovery process for bereaved families, including a level of disclosure by the state ""that has never happened before"". In recent months, it has been examining how to make truth recovery a more robust investigative process. What's at stake for PM in the Queen's Speech Plan to end all NI Troubles prosecutions confirmed NI secretary 'didn't deliver' on legacy legislation MLAs back motion to oppose Troubles legacy plans The government has come undermounting pressure from its own back benches to act quickerin order to prevent any further prosecutions of former soldiers. The Public Prosecution Service (PPS) has yet to make decisions on 12 veterans as part of a wider legacy caseload. There are also about1,200 unsolved Troubles-related killings currently with the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), which would take 20 years to work through.

"NI public cannot be left high and dry, PM toldSinn FÃ©in tells Boris Johnson the DUP's refusal to form an executive is punishing workers and families.Northern Ireland","Jeffrey Donaldson says he will not return to Stormont until he can be sure ""the political institutions in Northern Ireland have a stable foundation"" The DUP leader has said he will not give up his role as MP at Westminster until the NI Protocol is ""resolved"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has been elected as an assembly member for Lagan Valley. Under rules that do not allow MLAs to hold more than one role, he has eight days to decide whether to leave Westminster for Stormont. Meanwhile, Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill has warned the prime minister people cannot be left ""high and dry"" by the DUP's refusal to form a government. Ms O'Neill is entitled to become Northern Ireland's first nationalist first minister after Thursday's historic election. Should Sir Jeffrey leave Westminster, it would prompt a by-election for the Lagan Valley Westminster constituency. Speaking in the Commons on Tuesday, he said he would not leave Parliament until the protocol is dealt with. His party is refusing to nominate a deputy first minister and re-enter power-sharing in Northern Ireland, in opposition to the post-Brexit trading arrangement. Unionists oppose the protocol as they say it poses a risk to the UK union and damages trade. A simple guide to the Northern Ireland Protocol Michelle O'Neill told Boris Johnson the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was punishing people by not forming an executive Sir Jeffrey said he would not return to Stormont until he could be sure ""the political institutions in Northern Ireland have a stable foundation"". He could instead co-opt another DUP member to fill the Lagan Valley Stormont seat in the interim. NI power sharing requires the largest unionist and nationalist parties to share first and deputy first minister posts. Both Ms O'Neill and DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson spoke to Boris Johnson on Tuesday morning. Ms O'Neill told Mr Johnson the DUP was punishing workers and families. The first sitting of the Northern Ireland Assembly - in whichSinn FÃ©in is now the largest party- is scheduled to take place on Friday. However, there will be no governing executive without the DUP's support as the second largest party. Instead, ministers continue to run their respective departments, but no new decisions, such as agreeing a budget, can be taken. The DUP, which supported Brexit, has protested against the Northern Ireland Protocol, a part of the UK's deal with the EU which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU's single market for goods. This was designed to ensure free trade across an open Irish border, but it has in turn created some new trade barriers for the movement of goods across the Irish Sea. In February, the partyremoved Paul Givan from his role as first ministerin protest against the protocol, triggering the collapse of the Northern Ireland Executive. They said the protocol had undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK. This video can not be played The Democratic Unionist Party says it will not join a power-sharing government without action on the protocol In the Queen's Speech on Tuesday, the government outlined that issues created by the protocol ""continue to stand in the way of an executive being formed"". It said the protocol ""needs to change"" and called for new imagination and flexibility from the EU. Earlier, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said he had stressed the need to intensify EU and UK discussions to avoid any unilateral action during a discussion with Mr Johnson on Tuesday. Sir Jeffrey said he made it clear to the prime minister that he would not be ""moving on the political institutions"" until the government had taken action on the protocol. He said he would not be setting a timeframe for this, but that he was a ""realist and an optimist"". Ms O'Neill said the public could not be a pawn in the British government's game of chicken with the EU. ""Time to form an executive now,"" she said in asocial media post,external. Why is the DUP against the NI Protocol? Donaldson's Brexit trading dilemma A Downing Street source told BBC News that the prime minister spent an hour on the phone to Northern Ireland's political leaders. They added the government would act ""responsibly"" with regards to the protocol and its negotiations with the EU. This video can not be played Michelle O'Neill says the assembly election shows that the public want to see a new Northern Ireland Executive formed. The calls followed meetings held by the Northern Ireland Secretary on Monday with the leaders of Stormont's five largest parties. Sinn FÃ©in won the most seats in the assembly election - 27 out of 90 - after Thursday's vote. This means the party can nominate Northern Ireland's first minister, an unprecedented move for a nationalist party, but it is reliant on the DUP taking up its position as deputy first minister. The roles form a joint office, with equal responsibility, however, the allocation of the titles is regarded as symbolically important. GOVERNMENT CRISIS:What happens next? HISTORIC MOMENT:From IRA politics to NI's biggest party SINN FEIN:What does the party want? THE ASSEMBLY:How power-sharing works in Northern Ireland RESULTS:The assembly election in maps and charts POSTCODE SEARCH:What are the results in my area? Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said the Northern Ireland Protocol should be dealt with as the obstacle to a functioning executive at Stormont. ""We all know what the landing zone is, no checks on goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if they are staying in Northern Ireland. That gets rid of the border down the Irish Sea. ""The EU Commission know this, the UK government know this and all five political parties who would form the executive know this also."" 462 of 462 seats counted.Counting complete. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) has said it will be going into opposition after Thursday's vote in which it returned with eight assembly members (MLAs) after losing four seats.

Sri Lanka unrest flares despite curfewTroops are on the streets across Sri Lanka after a night of anti-government unrest fuelled by an economic crisis.Asia,"Streets were largely calm on Tuesday but there were signs of the protests everywhere Sri Lankan security forces have been ordered to shoot law-breakers on sight in a bid to quell anti-government protests on the island. Demonstrators are calling for the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa over the island's worst economic crisis in history. On Monday, his brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, stepped down as prime minister amid violent street clashes. But the resignation failed to bring calm and violence continued overnight. On Tuesday, the government ordered troops to open fire on anyone looting public property or causing ""harm to life"". It also deployed tens of thousands of army, navy and air force personnel to patrol the streets of the capital Colombo. Despite their presence, the city's top police officer was assaulted on Tuesday afternoon by a mob accusing him of not doing enough to protect peaceful protesters. At Colombo's Galle Face Green, on the sea front, crowds also continued to gather. Police say eight people have died and the capital's main hospital says more than 200 people have been wounded since Monday. Some were injured by pro-government mobs, others when police fired tear gas into crowds. Lawyers acting for the protesters told the BBC they were filing cases against supporters of the prime minister. An island-wide curfew has been extended to Thursday morning as authorities seek to end the violence. Evidence of last night's rioting is everywhere across Colombo - buses thrown into the lake, others with windows smashed out and tyres still burning. This video can not be played ""I never wanted him"" - people from Sri Lanka's protests on the country's leaders In the north-east, protesters gathered in front of Trincomalee Naval Base after unconfirmed reports that Mahinda Rajapaksa had gone there with family members after escaping from his Colombo residence. More than 50 houses of politicians were burned overnight, reports say. Crowds remain outside the office of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, brother of Mahinda, calling on him to quit. Mahinda (right) served two terms as president before returning as PM under his brother (left) Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo Sri Lankans are still reeling from the violence that has erupted. Many politicians are sheltering in safe houses or avoiding appearing in public. ""It is not at all safe, particularly for politicians on the government side,"" Nalaka Godahewa, until recently media minister, told the BBC. His house was among those torched. Mahinda Rajapaksa, once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a war hero for defeating the Tamil Tiger rebels, has suddenly become a villain. Many blame his supporters for targeting anti-government protesters, which then set off a chain of violent events. The Rajapaksas have always stood together but this time their differences are out in the open. The problem appears to have started after Gotabaya asked the family patriarch Mahinda to ""take one for the team"" and resign. How the family, who have dominated Sri Lankan politics for years, overcome this crisis is now an open question. Since last month Sri Lanka has been gripped by escalating demonstrations over soaring prices and power cuts. On Monday, government supporters clashed violently with protesters in Colombo outside Mahinda Rajapaksa's Temple Trees residence, and then at the main protest site at Galle Face Green. The home of government minister Sananth Nishantha was among several set on fire Police and riot squads were deployed, and tear gas and water cannon were fired at government supporters after they breached police lines and attacked protesters using sticks and poles. Angry demonstrators retaliated, attacking government supporters and targeting ruling party MPs, including one who shot two people after a mob swarmed his car and then killed himself, according to police. As the night went on, mobs of protesters across the country torched houses belonging to the Rajapaksas, various ministers and MPs. This included a house turned into a controversial museum by the Rajapaksas in the family's ancestral village in Hambantota in southern Sri Lanka. Areas near the president's official residence were also set ablaze, according to reports. A municipal lawmaker died in hospital after an attack on his house. Following Mahinda Rajapaksa's resignation,protesters attempted to breach the inner compound of Temple Trees where he was staying along with several loyalists, and set fire to a bus outside the home. Police fired shots in the air and tear gas in an attempt to disperse them. Mr Rajapaksa was flown out of Colombo to an undisclosed location on Tuesday morning. Elsewhere in Colombo, tensions remained high. Men armed with sticks and rods had established road blocks on the routes leading to and from the airport, and police and security forces - usually a common sight in the area - were nowhere to be seen. Vehicles were set alight outside Mahinda Rajapaksa's official residence Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Britain in 1948, and people are furious because the cost of living has become unaffordable. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, and people can no longer afford essential items including food, medicines and fuel. The government has requested emergency financial help. It blames the Covid pandemic, which all but killed off Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. But many experts say economic mismanagement is also to blame.

LiveLivePrince Charles to deliver Queen's speech,"The PM and Labour leader Keir Starmer are debating the government's agenda Prince Charles earlier delivered the Queen's Speech in Parliament, setting out the government's agenda for the coming year He said the government's priority ""is to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for familiesâ But Labour says Boris Johnson's administration is not up to the challenge as inflation soars and families struggle In all, 38 bills and draft bills have been announced as Johnson seeks a reboot after disappointing local election results Bills include measures to tackle empty high street premises and address the levelling up agenda There are also proposals to remove EU laws and a public order bill to clamp down on disruptive protests Edited by Brian Wheeler Weâre ending our live coverage of the Queenâs Speech - thanks for joining us. MPs are still debating the speech in the House of Commons. If you want to continue following the action, you can do so by watchingBBC Parliament. But for now, itâs goodbye from us in Westminster! Extravagant pageantry, archaic rituals and feisty debate - Parliament has pulled out all the stops today for its formal opening, which is marked by the Queenâs Speech. As we wind down our live coverage, letâs reflect on the main events of the day: Royal procession: The day started with Prince Charles arriving at Parliament in a motorcade, as he stood in for the Queen,who pulled out with mobility problems. He entered the House of Lords with the Duchess of Cornwall and his son Prince William. Princeâs speech: Inside the Lords, Prince Charles sat centre stage to deliver the Queenâs Speech (but not on the Queenâs throne, which had been removed). In his full regalia, Charles delivered a speech, setting out the legislative priorities of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. Agenda unveiled: In the speech,the government promised to tackle sharp rises in the cost of living by boosting the economy. The speech included proposals for laws including energy security, carbon emissions and post-Brexit economic arrangements. You can read our at-a-glance guidehere. MPs debate: When the Royals left, the politicians became the focus of attention in the House of Commons. They debated the Queenâs Speech, with Johnson, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and other MPs having their say. Timeâs up: Sir Keir told MPs the government had to face up to the cost-of-living crisis and the challenge of a stagnating economy to ""get Britain growing again"". ""We have a government whose time is passed, a cabinet out of ideas and out of energy, led by a prime minister who is entirely out of touch,â Starmer said. Brexit benefits: In reply, Johnson defended his governmentâs plans, which he said would âunleash the benefitsâ of Brexit. He said he would âgrow our way out ofâ the economic doldrums, âby creating hundreds of thousands of new high wage, high skilled jobs all across the countryâ. What now?: Itâs not over yet. MPs will debate the Queenâs Speech over the next few days before it is put to a vote. The speech is expected to pass unopposed, as is custom. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News A national security bill has been long awaited but could
still prove controversial. Government first promised action after the 2018
Salisbury poisonings and then after the 2020 Russia report to deal with new
threats posed by so-called hostile states. An alert this year about Chinese
interference in Parliament, as well as concerns about Russian influence
following its invasion of Ukraine, heightened pressure for action. This will
include updating the Official Secrets Act legislation to cover a wider range of
activity that the security services argue do harm to the country. But one
element which could be controversial is if there is no public interest defence
for journalists and others when it comes to dealing with sensitive information. Also consulted on were plans for those working on behalf of foreign states to
register their activity. This is designed to increase transparency but here, if
part of a final bill, the controversy could be over how broadly it is focused
and who might have to declare their work, for instance lawyers working for
Russian oligarchs linked to the state. Sir Ed Davey says The leader of the Liberal Democrats says today's Queen's Speech should have focused on the cost of living, but ""offered nothing"". Sir Ed Davey points to a hint made by Boris Johnson earlier that more support was in its way in the coming days, which has already been knocked down by the Treasury. ""People desperately need more help from the government,"" says Sir Ed, ""but what have they received instead? ""Tax rises, broken election promises on pension rises, and wages rising far slower than inflation."" Theresa May has warned her successor as PM, Boris Johnson, against taking new powers to tear up the part of the Brexit withdrawal deal relating to Northern Ireland. The UK government has been trying to renegotiate thissection of the dealfor a long time and has been threatening to take unilateral action if the EU does not agree to wider changes. It had been reported a bill would be included in the Queen's Speech to do this. In the end it wasn't - but it is understood a bill could still be introduced. May says to take new powers in this area âwould not be the right move for the governmentâ. She adds that the government needs to consider ""the wider sense of what such a move would say about the UK and its willingness to abide by treaties it has signed"". Reality Check Boris Johnson told MPs that one of the achievements of his
government had been âcreating a tax cut for 30 million workersâ. He is talking about the change in the Spring Statement,
which means that from July, employees will be able to earn Â£12,570 before they
start having to pay National Insurance, which is Â£2,690 more than they were
previously able to earn. That will indeed be a cut in National Insurance for most
workers, but it is not the whole picture. National Insurance went up in April by 1.25p in the pound.
Also, the threshold at which workers start paying income tax has been frozen,
which is effectively a big tax rise, especially at a time of high inflation. If
that is taken into account then many fewer people have had a tax cut overall. And we know from the governmentâs independent forecaster
the Office for Budget Responsibility that the overall tax burden is going to
rise from 33% of GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) in 2019-20 to 36.3%
of GDP in 2026-27, which will be the highest since the late 1940s. You can read more about it here. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent The government says it wants to raise standards not only in schools in England, but also in higher education. Its most radical plan is itsLifelong Loan Entitlement,external, which would allow students at any stage of life to access loans worth the equivalent of four years of post-18 education (that's Â£37,000 in today's fees). Other proposed changes, though, are exactly that - they'reproposals, and have yet to be firmed up. One is theintroduction of minimum grade requirementsfor student loans - such as having English and maths GCSEs, or two A-levels at grade E. The other is to limit the number of university places on some courses in England to ""tackle uncontrolled growth of low-quality courses"". Both plans are subject to a consultation, so we'll have to watch this space. Charities have warned that minimum grade requirements could hit poorer students hardest, while universities said limiting places would be ""placing a cap on aspiration"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Housing announcements in the Queen's Speech have been broadly welcomed by those campaigning for change to the rental sector. But many argue that banning no-fault evictions of private tenants and strengthening rights for those in social housing is long overdue. Theresa May first proposed scrapping so-called ""Section 21"" evictions, where tenants can be evicted with 8 weeks' notice, in April 2019. Boris Johnson then pledged to do the same in his general election manifesto later that year. More than one fifth of renters did not end their last tenancy by choice the government's own figures show. Campaigners argue too many families are ""on the brink"" of homelessness as the cost of living continues to rise. Landlords' groups have welcomed moves to strengthen their ability to evict anti-social tenants and those in persistent rent arrears but argue broader reforms are needed. Along with cautious optimism about the government's plans are warnings from across the housing sector that the detail will be crucial, and that time is of the essence.  Reality Check In the the Queenâs Speech debate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government was âbuilding new hospitals... 48 of them in factâ. The government has three definitions of what constitutes a ""new"" hospital:  Ananalysisby BBC Reality Check and the Nuffield Trust in December 2021, found that of 40 hospital projects announced by the government 22 are rebuilding projects, 12 will be new wings within existing hospitals, three involve rebuilding non-urgent care hospitals and three are entirely new hospitals. The 48 figure mentioned by Mr Johnson includes a âcompetition for 8 further hospitals including new Mental Health Hospitalsâ.  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent It does not seem like the government is building up to
another big announcement on the cost of living, despite Boris Johnson saying in his speech he would have ""more to say"" about it in the coming days. No 10 insiders say the PM was referring to the wider work
being done in departments to ease the cost of living. Ministers held a special cabinet last week looking
at ideas, which included relaxing rules on child care in nurseries and how often cars need an MOT. A cabinet will be held outside London later this week, sources say it will focus on some of the cost of living issues. But don't expect a major policy change soon. Reality Check Sir Keir
Starmer and Boris Johnson clashed in the House of Commons over the growth of
the UK economy. The
Labour leader said that the UK would be: âthe slowest growing economy in the G7
next yearâ. Boris
Johnson said âwe had the fastest economic growth in the G7 last year and will
return to that status, by the way, by 2024. The
G7 is a club of major developed economies. Theyâre
both right and using IMF forecasts and comparisons, but theyâre talking about
different years. It
is correct to say we had the fastest growth last year, are forecast to have
relatively slow growth next year and then relatively fast growth two years
later. If
you look over a longer period, from before the pandemic to forecasts up to
2025, the UK is actually in the middle of the pack. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford says there was a ""gaping hole"" in the speech on energy policy, and accuses the government of ""fleecing"" Scotland of its ""green present and future"". He also accuses ministers of ""refusing to match"" Scottish government funding on renewable energy. He also criticises the proposed Brexit Freedoms Bill - giving ministers new powers to change EU-era laws - as an ""attack"" on the power of devolved governments.  Will this much-trumpeted proposal ever happen? Dominic CascianiLegal Correspondent The governmentâs long-delayed pledge to give victims of crime basic rights about how they will be treated at one of the most vulnerable points in their life has been delayed yet again. Ministers have just consulted on law which would do really simple things: force the police and prosecutors to tell victims, who may be terrified of giving evidence, what is happening to their case, for a start, But the Queenâs Speech only promises a âDraft Victims Billâ - Parliament-speak for an unfinished blueprint that needs working on, rather than something thatâs oven-ready. That means thereâs no certainty at all that the proposed law -first promised eight years and three prime ministerâs ago- will become reality in this Parliamentary session. Thatâs at a time when the government is already defending record delays in the courts thanks to a combination of pandemic backlogs and preceding cuts to judges - delays that have seen many victims, as I have reported,losing faith in ever getting justice. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford uses his speech to highlight the Tories' ""drubbing"" at last week's local elections, adding it shows this government is ""on its last legs"". He contrasts this with the performance of his party, which he says shows people in Scotland demand ""the choice of an independent future"". Like Labour, he criticises the ""lack of immediate action"" in the Queen's Speech to tackle rising living costs, which he calls ""Tory-made"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Opposition parties have been calling for measures like a
windfall tax on energy companies to help with rising bills â and an emergency
budget to address the cost of living. Boris Johnson hinted at an announcement on the cost of
living in the next few days. But the Treasury has been making it clear that it doesnât
want to make concrete plans for support until it knows what the energy price
cap will be. An emergency budget is not going to happen, say my
sources. Nearing the end of his speech, Johnson says âweâll get through the aftershocks of Covid just as we got through Covidâ. He says weâll do so ânot through irresponsible spendingâ, but by âurgently pressing on with our missionâ, which is stimulating the economy. He says thatâs the long-term solution to address the rising cost of living and get our country back on track after the pandemic. âThat is what this Queenâs Speech delivers,â he says. With that, his speech is finished. Labour's Sarah Owen calls on the PM to apologise Earlier, there was an intervention from Labour's Sarah Owen - unusual when the PM is outlining the measures in the Queen's Speech. She says: ""What we haven't heard yet is an apology - an apology to the pensioners that are choosing between heating and eating, an apology to the children that have gone hungry throughout school holidays, and an apology to the hundreds of thousands of family members of Covid victims that were lost during the pandemic."" Johnson says the government is ""doing all we can"" to help people, including pensioners. And he says they have put in Â£9.2bn to help with heating, among other measures. But, he adds: ""Be in no doubt, I think this is what everyone in the country has to understand, what we are doing is making sure that we have a strong economy with high wage, high skilled jobs that will enable us to take our country forward."" The PM says heâs âtaking forward this countryâs energy strategyâ, highlighting the new Energy Security Bill in the Queenâs Speech. His comments are greeted by groans on the Labour benches, but Johnson says the party âdidnât want a single nuclear power stationâ when it was in government. He calls Labour MPs âgreat quivering jellies of indecisionâ and promises âvast new green industriesâ. Now turning to Brexit, he pledges to âunleash the benefitsâ of leaving the EU and make the UK the âbest regulated country in the worldâ. He said the government would use âour new freedoms to control our bordersâ and âfix our broken asylum systemâ. The government will act with urgency to ease âthe burdens on families and businesses across the land"", Johnson says. The rising cost of living - and the governmentâs plans to address it - featured prominently in the Queenâs Speech. Johnson lists some ways in which the government has already helped households with living costs, including Â£9.1bn to assist with energy bills, and a council tax rebate worth Â£150. But, he says, âhowever great our compassion and our ingenuity, we cannot simply spend our way out of this problemâ. He says we need to âgrow our way out of it, by creating hundreds of thousands of new high wage, high skilled jobs all across the countryâ. Now turning to the war in Ukraine, Johnson says he spoke to G7 counterparts and Ukraineâs president on Sunday. He says he urged them to go further and faster in supporting Ukraine, and expressed sorrow at what had been happening in Mariupol, where alleged war crimes had been committed. He says the UK should be proud that it has âled the wayâ, by providing weapons to Ukraine to defend itself against Russia. âLet the message ring out in the chamber today: we will persevere in our in support of Ukraine,â he says.

LiveLivePrince Charles to deliver Queen's speech12 minutes ago,"The PM and Labour leader Keir Starmer are debating the government's agenda Prince Charles earlier delivered the Queen's Speech in Parliament, setting out the government's agenda for the coming year He said the government's priority ""is to grow and strengthen the economy and help ease the cost of living for familiesâ But Labour says Boris Johnson's administration is not up to the challenge as inflation soars and families struggle In all, 38 bills and draft bills have been announced as Johnson seeks a reboot after disappointing local election results Bills include measures to tackle empty high street premises and address the levelling up agenda There are also proposals to remove EU laws and a public order bill to clamp down on disruptive protests Edited by Brian Wheeler Weâre ending our live coverage of the Queenâs Speech - thanks for joining us. MPs are still debating the speech in the House of Commons. If you want to continue following the action, you can do so by watchingBBC Parliament. But for now, itâs goodbye from us in Westminster! Extravagant pageantry, archaic rituals and feisty debate - Parliament has pulled out all the stops today for its formal opening, which is marked by the Queenâs Speech. As we wind down our live coverage, letâs reflect on the main events of the day: Royal procession: The day started with Prince Charles arriving at Parliament in a motorcade, as he stood in for the Queen,who pulled out with mobility problems. He entered the House of Lords with the Duchess of Cornwall and his son Prince William. Princeâs speech: Inside the Lords, Prince Charles sat centre stage to deliver the Queenâs Speech (but not on the Queenâs throne, which had been removed). In his full regalia, Charles delivered a speech, setting out the legislative priorities of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. Agenda unveiled: In the speech,the government promised to tackle sharp rises in the cost of living by boosting the economy. The speech included proposals for laws including energy security, carbon emissions and post-Brexit economic arrangements. You can read our at-a-glance guidehere. MPs debate: When the Royals left, the politicians became the focus of attention in the House of Commons. They debated the Queenâs Speech, with Johnson, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, and other MPs having their say. Timeâs up: Sir Keir told MPs the government had to face up to the cost-of-living crisis and the challenge of a stagnating economy to ""get Britain growing again"". ""We have a government whose time is passed, a cabinet out of ideas and out of energy, led by a prime minister who is entirely out of touch,â Starmer said. Brexit benefits: In reply, Johnson defended his governmentâs plans, which he said would âunleash the benefitsâ of Brexit. He said he would âgrow our way out ofâ the economic doldrums, âby creating hundreds of thousands of new high wage, high skilled jobs all across the countryâ. What now?: Itâs not over yet. MPs will debate the Queenâs Speech over the next few days before it is put to a vote. The speech is expected to pass unopposed, as is custom. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News A national security bill has been long awaited but could
still prove controversial. Government first promised action after the 2018
Salisbury poisonings and then after the 2020 Russia report to deal with new
threats posed by so-called hostile states. An alert this year about Chinese
interference in Parliament, as well as concerns about Russian influence
following its invasion of Ukraine, heightened pressure for action. This will
include updating the Official Secrets Act legislation to cover a wider range of
activity that the security services argue do harm to the country. But one
element which could be controversial is if there is no public interest defence
for journalists and others when it comes to dealing with sensitive information. Also consulted on were plans for those working on behalf of foreign states to
register their activity. This is designed to increase transparency but here, if
part of a final bill, the controversy could be over how broadly it is focused
and who might have to declare their work, for instance lawyers working for
Russian oligarchs linked to the state. Sir Ed Davey says The leader of the Liberal Democrats says today's Queen's Speech should have focused on the cost of living, but ""offered nothing"". Sir Ed Davey points to a hint made by Boris Johnson earlier that more support was in its way in the coming days, which has already been knocked down by the Treasury. ""People desperately need more help from the government,"" says Sir Ed, ""but what have they received instead? ""Tax rises, broken election promises on pension rises, and wages rising far slower than inflation."" Theresa May has warned her successor as PM, Boris Johnson, against taking new powers to tear up the part of the Brexit withdrawal deal relating to Northern Ireland. The UK government has been trying to renegotiate thissection of the dealfor a long time and has been threatening to take unilateral action if the EU does not agree to wider changes. It had been reported a bill would be included in the Queen's Speech to do this. In the end it wasn't - but it is understood a bill could still be introduced. May says to take new powers in this area âwould not be the right move for the governmentâ. She adds that the government needs to consider ""the wider sense of what such a move would say about the UK and its willingness to abide by treaties it has signed"". Reality Check Boris Johnson told MPs that one of the achievements of his
government had been âcreating a tax cut for 30 million workersâ. He is talking about the change in the Spring Statement,
which means that from July, employees will be able to earn Â£12,570 before they
start having to pay National Insurance, which is Â£2,690 more than they were
previously able to earn. That will indeed be a cut in National Insurance for most
workers, but it is not the whole picture. National Insurance went up in April by 1.25p in the pound.
Also, the threshold at which workers start paying income tax has been frozen,
which is effectively a big tax rise, especially at a time of high inflation. If
that is taken into account then many fewer people have had a tax cut overall. And we know from the governmentâs independent forecaster
the Office for Budget Responsibility that the overall tax burden is going to
rise from 33% of GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) in 2019-20 to 36.3%
of GDP in 2026-27, which will be the highest since the late 1940s. You can read more about it here. Hazel ShearingEducation correspondent The government says it wants to raise standards not only in schools in England, but also in higher education. Its most radical plan is itsLifelong Loan Entitlement,external, which would allow students at any stage of life to access loans worth the equivalent of four years of post-18 education (that's Â£37,000 in today's fees). Other proposed changes, though, are exactly that - they'reproposals, and have yet to be firmed up. One is theintroduction of minimum grade requirementsfor student loans - such as having English and maths GCSEs, or two A-levels at grade E. The other is to limit the number of university places on some courses in England to ""tackle uncontrolled growth of low-quality courses"". Both plans are subject to a consultation, so we'll have to watch this space. Charities have warned that minimum grade requirements could hit poorer students hardest, while universities said limiting places would be ""placing a cap on aspiration"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Housing announcements in the Queen's Speech have been broadly welcomed by those campaigning for change to the rental sector. But many argue that banning no-fault evictions of private tenants and strengthening rights for those in social housing is long overdue. Theresa May first proposed scrapping so-called ""Section 21"" evictions, where tenants can be evicted with 8 weeks' notice, in April 2019. Boris Johnson then pledged to do the same in his general election manifesto later that year. More than one fifth of renters did not end their last tenancy by choice the government's own figures show. Campaigners argue too many families are ""on the brink"" of homelessness as the cost of living continues to rise. Landlords' groups have welcomed moves to strengthen their ability to evict anti-social tenants and those in persistent rent arrears but argue broader reforms are needed. Along with cautious optimism about the government's plans are warnings from across the housing sector that the detail will be crucial, and that time is of the essence.  Reality Check In the the Queenâs Speech debate, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government was âbuilding new hospitals... 48 of them in factâ. The government has three definitions of what constitutes a ""new"" hospital:  Ananalysisby BBC Reality Check and the Nuffield Trust in December 2021, found that of 40 hospital projects announced by the government 22 are rebuilding projects, 12 will be new wings within existing hospitals, three involve rebuilding non-urgent care hospitals and three are entirely new hospitals. The 48 figure mentioned by Mr Johnson includes a âcompetition for 8 further hospitals including new Mental Health Hospitalsâ.  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent It does not seem like the government is building up to
another big announcement on the cost of living, despite Boris Johnson saying in his speech he would have ""more to say"" about it in the coming days. No 10 insiders say the PM was referring to the wider work
being done in departments to ease the cost of living. Ministers held a special cabinet last week looking
at ideas, which included relaxing rules on child care in nurseries and how often cars need an MOT. A cabinet will be held outside London later this week, sources say it will focus on some of the cost of living issues. But don't expect a major policy change soon. Reality Check Sir Keir
Starmer and Boris Johnson clashed in the House of Commons over the growth of
the UK economy. The
Labour leader said that the UK would be: âthe slowest growing economy in the G7
next yearâ. Boris
Johnson said âwe had the fastest economic growth in the G7 last year and will
return to that status, by the way, by 2024. The
G7 is a club of major developed economies. Theyâre
both right and using IMF forecasts and comparisons, but theyâre talking about
different years. It
is correct to say we had the fastest growth last year, are forecast to have
relatively slow growth next year and then relatively fast growth two years
later. If
you look over a longer period, from before the pandemic to forecasts up to
2025, the UK is actually in the middle of the pack. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford says there was a ""gaping hole"" in the speech on energy policy, and accuses the government of ""fleecing"" Scotland of its ""green present and future"". He also accuses ministers of ""refusing to match"" Scottish government funding on renewable energy. He also criticises the proposed Brexit Freedoms Bill - giving ministers new powers to change EU-era laws - as an ""attack"" on the power of devolved governments.  Will this much-trumpeted proposal ever happen? Dominic CascianiLegal Correspondent The governmentâs long-delayed pledge to give victims of crime basic rights about how they will be treated at one of the most vulnerable points in their life has been delayed yet again. Ministers have just consulted on law which would do really simple things: force the police and prosecutors to tell victims, who may be terrified of giving evidence, what is happening to their case, for a start, But the Queenâs Speech only promises a âDraft Victims Billâ - Parliament-speak for an unfinished blueprint that needs working on, rather than something thatâs oven-ready. That means thereâs no certainty at all that the proposed law -first promised eight years and three prime ministerâs ago- will become reality in this Parliamentary session. Thatâs at a time when the government is already defending record delays in the courts thanks to a combination of pandemic backlogs and preceding cuts to judges - delays that have seen many victims, as I have reported,losing faith in ever getting justice. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford uses his speech to highlight the Tories' ""drubbing"" at last week's local elections, adding it shows this government is ""on its last legs"". He contrasts this with the performance of his party, which he says shows people in Scotland demand ""the choice of an independent future"". Like Labour, he criticises the ""lack of immediate action"" in the Queen's Speech to tackle rising living costs, which he calls ""Tory-made"". Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Opposition parties have been calling for measures like a
windfall tax on energy companies to help with rising bills â and an emergency
budget to address the cost of living. Boris Johnson hinted at an announcement on the cost of
living in the next few days. But the Treasury has been making it clear that it doesnât
want to make concrete plans for support until it knows what the energy price
cap will be. An emergency budget is not going to happen, say my
sources. Nearing the end of his speech, Johnson says âweâll get through the aftershocks of Covid just as we got through Covidâ. He says weâll do so ânot through irresponsible spendingâ, but by âurgently pressing on with our missionâ, which is stimulating the economy. He says thatâs the long-term solution to address the rising cost of living and get our country back on track after the pandemic. âThat is what this Queenâs Speech delivers,â he says.

Economy growth billed as focus for Queen's SpeechThe PM promises to address the cost of living but says the UK cannot spend its way out of trouble.,"Boris Johnson has promised to get the country ""back on track"" as the government unveils its plans for the year ahead in the Queen's Speech. The speech is expected to focus on boosting economic growth, but the PM will say that the UK cannot spend its way out of trouble and will need to grow the economy. In all, 38 parliamentary bills are due to be unveiled. Labour said the Tories were not up to the challenge of growing the economy. A senior government source defended the lack of new direct help with the fast-rising cost of living in the Queen's Speech, telling the BBC: ""There's been enough pain relief. It's time for the surgery the economy needs."" Ministers will also recommit to tougher penalties for protest groups, like Insulate Britain and Extinction Rebellion, who use disruptive tactics. The Prince of Waleswill deliver the addressto Parliament at 11:30 BST, after the Queen pulled out on Monday, for the first time since 1963, due to what Buckingham Palace called ""episodic mobility problems"". The Queen's throne will remain empty, with Prince Charles, the Duchess of Cornwall and Prince William expected to be seated in front of assembled politicians. The Sword of State and the Imperial State Crown have been transported from Buckingham Palace to the Palace of Westminster, in order to allow the ceremony to begin. What is the Queen's Speech and why is it important? What's at stake for PM in the Queen's Speech What might be in the Queen's Speech? How will the Police and Crime Bill change protests? What is levelling up and how is it going? The speech will open with a promise to grow the economy, ease the financial burden on households and pursue the government's levelling up programme, aimed at tackling regional disparities in the UK. But there will be no bill specifically aimed at tackling the cost of living. In a House of Commons debate following the speech, the prime minister is expected to argue the government ""cannot simply spend our way out of the country's problems"", arguing that the answer lies instead in creating highly paid, highly skilled jobs. The comments will follow a recentprediction from the Bank of England,externalthat inflation is likely to rise to around 10% later this year, with food and energy price rises placing a particularly high burden on households. The Household Cavalry take part in ceremonies Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Times are tough for working people. But they are much tougher than they should be. Some 12 years of the Conservatives have meant low economic growth, high inflation, and high taxes. ""Because the Tories are not up to the challenge of growing the economy, all those tax hikes aren't going into improving public services. Never before have people been asked to pay so much for so little."" Liberal Democrat rural affairs spokesman Tim Farron urged the government to use the speech to help the countryside by protecting farmers from being undercut by global trade deals. And SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford accused ministers of a ""deafening silence"" over the cost of living, saying they had to ""deliver desperately needed support to put money into people's pockets"". An activist is led away from the blockade of the Tyburn fuel depot in Birmingham In the Queen's Speech there will be seven bills which ministers argue deliver the benefits of Brexit, and a Levelling Up and Regeneration Bill is expected to change planning rules in England after previous proposals led to a backbench rebellion. A Public Order Bill would create a new criminal offence - aimed at protest groups - with a maximum sentence of 12 months for ""interfering with key national infrastructure"" such as airports, railways and printing press. This would also make it illegal to obstruct major transport works such as HS2. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the powers would clamp down on the ""outrageous behaviour"" of ""disruptive protests carried out by a ""self-indulgent minority who seem to revel in causing mayhem and misery"". But the Liberal Democrats called the plans ""dangerous and draconian"", with home affairs spokesman Alistair Carmichael arguing that police already had the powers to stop ""guerrilla protesters"". The new police powers were originally announced last autumn, after campaign group Insulate Britain began blocking major roads and motorways. Ministers then tried to add the powers as amendments to the Police, Crime, Sentencing and Courts Bill - but failed after Labour and other opposition peers teamed up to oppose them. Because the changes were introduced after the bill had passed all its stages in the Commons, the government did not have another opportunity to add them before the previous session of Parliament ended last month. The government will be confident of getting the measures through Parliament in this session as it has a large majority in the House of Commons.

"Sri Lanka leaders' homes torched in night of unrestMobs burnt down homes belonging to the Rajapaksas and MPs, after attacks from government supporters.Asia","Streets were largely calm on Tuesday but there were signs of the protests everywhere Sri Lankan security forces have been ordered to shoot law-breakers on sight in a bid to quell anti-government protests on the island. Demonstrators are calling for the resignation of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa over the island's worst economic crisis in history. On Monday, his brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, stepped down as prime minister amid violent street clashes. But the resignation failed to bring calm and violence continued overnight. On Tuesday, the government ordered troops to open fire on anyone looting public property or causing ""harm to life"". It also deployed tens of thousands of army, navy and air force personnel to patrol the streets of the capital Colombo. Despite their presence, the city's top police officer was assaulted on Tuesday afternoon by a mob accusing him of not doing enough to protect peaceful protesters. At Colombo's Galle Face Green, on the sea front, crowds also continued to gather. Police say eight people have died and the capital's main hospital says more than 200 people have been wounded since Monday. Some were injured by pro-government mobs, others when police fired tear gas into crowds. Lawyers acting for the protesters told the BBC they were filing cases against supporters of the prime minister. An island-wide curfew has been extended to Thursday morning as authorities seek to end the violence. Evidence of last night's rioting is everywhere across Colombo - buses thrown into the lake, others with windows smashed out and tyres still burning. This video can not be played ""I never wanted him"" - people from Sri Lanka's protests on the country's leaders In the north-east, protesters gathered in front of Trincomalee Naval Base after unconfirmed reports that Mahinda Rajapaksa had gone there with family members after escaping from his Colombo residence. More than 50 houses of politicians were burned overnight, reports say. Crowds remain outside the office of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, brother of Mahinda, calling on him to quit. Mahinda (right) served two terms as president before returning as PM under his brother (left) Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo Sri Lankans are still reeling from the violence that has erupted. Many politicians are sheltering in safe houses or avoiding appearing in public. ""It is not at all safe, particularly for politicians on the government side,"" Nalaka Godahewa, until recently media minister, told the BBC. His house was among those torched. Mahinda Rajapaksa, once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a war hero for defeating the Tamil Tiger rebels, has suddenly become a villain. Many blame his supporters for targeting anti-government protesters, which then set off a chain of violent events. The Rajapaksas have always stood together but this time their differences are out in the open. The problem appears to have started after Gotabaya asked the family patriarch Mahinda to ""take one for the team"" and resign. How the family, who have dominated Sri Lankan politics for years, overcome this crisis is now an open question. Since last month Sri Lanka has been gripped by escalating demonstrations over soaring prices and power cuts. On Monday, government supporters clashed violently with protesters in Colombo outside Mahinda Rajapaksa's Temple Trees residence, and then at the main protest site at Galle Face Green. The home of government minister Sananth Nishantha was among several set on fire Police and riot squads were deployed, and tear gas and water cannon were fired at government supporters after they breached police lines and attacked protesters using sticks and poles. Angry demonstrators retaliated, attacking government supporters and targeting ruling party MPs, including one who shot two people after a mob swarmed his car and then killed himself, according to police. As the night went on, mobs of protesters across the country torched houses belonging to the Rajapaksas, various ministers and MPs. This included a house turned into a controversial museum by the Rajapaksas in the family's ancestral village in Hambantota in southern Sri Lanka. Areas near the president's official residence were also set ablaze, according to reports. A municipal lawmaker died in hospital after an attack on his house. Following Mahinda Rajapaksa's resignation,protesters attempted to breach the inner compound of Temple Trees where he was staying along with several loyalists, and set fire to a bus outside the home. Police fired shots in the air and tear gas in an attempt to disperse them. Mr Rajapaksa was flown out of Colombo to an undisclosed location on Tuesday morning. Elsewhere in Colombo, tensions remained high. Men armed with sticks and rods had established road blocks on the routes leading to and from the airport, and police and security forces - usually a common sight in the area - were nowhere to be seen. Vehicles were set alight outside Mahinda Rajapaksa's official residence Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Britain in 1948, and people are furious because the cost of living has become unaffordable. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, and people can no longer afford essential items including food, medicines and fuel. The government has requested emergency financial help. It blames the Covid pandemic, which all but killed off Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. But many experts say economic mismanagement is also to blame.

An island-wide curfew has been extended to Thursday morning as authorities seek to end the violence. Evidence of last night's rioting is everywhere across Colombo - buses thrown into the lake, others with windows smashed out and tyres still burning. This video can not be played ""I never wanted him"" - people from Sri Lanka's protests on the country's leaders In the north-east, protesters gathered in front of Trincomalee Naval Base after unconfirmed reports that Mahinda Rajapaksa had gone there with family members after escaping from his Colombo residence. More than 50 houses of politicians were burned overnight, reports say. Crowds remain outside the office of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa, brother of Mahinda, calling on him to quit. Mahinda (right) served two terms as president before returning as PM under his brother (left) Anbarasan Ethirajan, BBC News, Colombo Sri Lankans are still reeling from the violence that has erupted. Many politicians are sheltering in safe houses or avoiding appearing in public. ""It is not at all safe, particularly for politicians on the government side,"" Nalaka Godahewa, until recently media minister, told the BBC. His house was among those torched. Mahinda Rajapaksa, once celebrated by the majority Sinhalese as a war hero for defeating the Tamil Tiger rebels, has suddenly become a villain. Many blame his supporters for targeting anti-government protesters, which then set off a chain of violent events. The Rajapaksas have always stood together but this time their differences are out in the open. The problem appears to have started after Gotabaya asked the family patriarch Mahinda to ""take one for the team"" and resign. How the family, who have dominated Sri Lankan politics for years, overcome this crisis is now an open question. Since last month Sri Lanka has been gripped by escalating demonstrations over soaring prices and power cuts. On Monday, government supporters clashed violently with protesters in Colombo outside Mahinda Rajapaksa's Temple Trees residence, and then at the main protest site at Galle Face Green. The home of government minister Sananth Nishantha was among several set on fire Police and riot squads were deployed, and tear gas and water cannon were fired at government supporters after they breached police lines and attacked protesters using sticks and poles. Angry demonstrators retaliated, attacking government supporters and targeting ruling party MPs, including one who shot two people after a mob swarmed his car and then killed himself, according to police. As the night went on, mobs of protesters across the country torched houses belonging to the Rajapaksas, various ministers and MPs. This included a house turned into a controversial museum by the Rajapaksas in the family's ancestral village in Hambantota in southern Sri Lanka. Areas near the president's official residence were also set ablaze, according to reports. A municipal lawmaker died in hospital after an attack on his house. Following Mahinda Rajapaksa's resignation,protesters attempted to breach the inner compound of Temple Trees where he was staying along with several loyalists, and set fire to a bus outside the home. Police fired shots in the air and tear gas in an attempt to disperse them. Mr Rajapaksa was flown out of Colombo to an undisclosed location on Tuesday morning. Elsewhere in Colombo, tensions remained high. Men armed with sticks and rods had established road blocks on the routes leading to and from the airport, and police and security forces - usually a common sight in the area - were nowhere to be seen. Vehicles were set alight outside Mahinda Rajapaksa's official residence Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from Britain in 1948, and people are furious because the cost of living has become unaffordable. The country's foreign currency reserves have virtually run dry, and people can no longer afford essential items including food, medicines and fuel. The government has requested emergency financial help. It blames the Covid pandemic, which all but killed off Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. But many experts say economic mismanagement is also to blame.

Electric models drive second-hand car sales higher,"Second-hand car sales have risen this year, boosted by a sharp increase in the number of used electric vehicles on the market. Sales of used cars in the UK rose 5.1% between January and March, compared to the same three months last year. But the market for electric cars, which only makes up a small percentage of the overall second-hand market, more than doubled in size. Electric car sales were ""energising"" the market, the SMMT said. The most popular models overall were the Ford Fiesta, Vauxhall Corsa, and Volkswagen Golf. But consumers appeared keen to snap up more environmentally-friendly cars where possible, the latest figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed. ""Zero emission vehicles [are] starting to filter through in larger numbers to consumers looking forward to driving the latest and greenest vehicles,"" Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said. ""Although there is some way to go before we see the recent growth in new EVs replicated in the used market, a buoyant new car market will be vital to help drive fleet renewal which is essential to the delivery of carbon savings,"" he said. Five questions about electric cars answered Sales of used battery electric vehicles (BEVs), which run purely on electric power, grew from 6,625 to 14,586 in the first three months of the year, a rise of 120.2% from a year earlier. Plug in hybrids (PHEVs) and hybrids (HEVs) which together make up a larger share of the used car market also changed hands in greater numbers, totalling just under 50,000 vehicles. Smaller models continued to be more popular for buyers in the second-hand market. Larger multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) , declined by 7.5%, followed by luxury saloons which were down 3.4%. Black was the most popular colour choice accounting for one in every five cars sold. A shortage of semiconductors and other electronic components was holding back supply in the new car market, said David Leggett, editor of specialist news site Just Auto. He said it was therefore unsurprising that there had been a boom in the second-hand market. ""The prices of used cars soared over last 12 months,"" he said. The ramp up in sales of second-hand electric vehicles in particular was set to continue over the next few years as more new stock fed through to the used car market, Mr Leggett added. ""We are at a fairly early stage still in terms of the impact of BEVs on the new car market and seeping through to the stock of cars out there,"" he said. As challenges within the electric car market over charging and consumer hesitation over adapting to the technology recede, he predicted a ""transformation"" of first the new and then used car markets. Used car prices have risen, generally, by 30-40% in the last two years, according to KPMG. Richard Peberdy, UK Head of Automotive, KPMG, said:  ""Used car prices have been soaring like never seen before."" ""The increasing cost of living is cooling the used car market slightly, but demand still remains high and is likely to continue to until the issues impacting new car production are resolved and more supply enters the used car market.  That is unlikely to be this year,"" he said. Is Europe's computer chip shortage plan too late?

The Pentagon believes that Russia has used about 10 to 12 of its hypersonic weapons since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, according to a senior defence official. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, the official said the US does not have ""a perfect count"" of the deployment of the weapon. Russia claims the Kinzhal missile - which can hit a target up to 2,000km (1,240 miles) away and can fly faster than 6,000 km/h - was first fired at a target in Ukraine in March. More recently, Ukrainian officials have claimed that the weapon was fired at targets in Odesa over the weekend. The US official, however, said that he doesn't ""have anything to indicate"" that they were used against targets in the city. Learn more about the Kinzhal missilehere. Allow Twitter content?

Fuel supplies in Europe face possible disruption after Ukraine vowed to suspend an important route for Russian gas. Operators of the Ukrainian gas system said they would switch off the Sokhranivka route from 07:00 local time on Wednesday. The route accounts for a third of Russia's supply to Europe. They claim to be unable to operate a gas station through the Luhansk region due to Russian occupation, and so plan to switch to an entry point in Ukrainian-held territory. But Russian state-owned gas firm Gazprom said it was not feasible to make such a switch - and questioned the Ukrainian justification. Ukraine remains a major supply route for Russian gas to Europe - despite the war. Volodymyr Zelensky and Leonid Kravchuk at a meeting in Ukraine's parliament 2020 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has praised Leonid Kravchuk, Ukraine's former leader who died at 88 on Tuesday, as a man who ""always stayed with Ukraine"". In his nightly television address, Zelensky said that Kravchuk - the first president of an independent, post-Soviet Ukraine between 1991-94 - ""valued life, and every minute of it"". ""As a child, he survived World War Two, survived the occupation,"" Zelensky said. ""[He] knew what freedom costs"". ""With all his heart he wanted peace for Ukraine,"" Zelensky added.

A photograph of Vladimir Putin on a cross depicting his tomb in Dnipro The Ukrainian city of Dnipro has emerged as a crucial hub for the Ukrainian military and humanitarian operations as the war in Ukraine's east grinds on. After repeated airstrikes that struck the city in March and early April, an uneasy calm has fallen over Dnipro, the fourth largest city in Ukraine. During a recent visit, the author David Patrikarakosdescribed a,externalcity largely defended by volunteer militias that lie between ""Ukraineâs two worlds: West and East; Europe and Russia."" ""Its geographical location makes it vital to the country's war effort,"" he wrote. ""Dniproâs central location makes it the countryâs most important logistical hub."" Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra - pictured here rehearsing - are this year's favourites Ukrainian entrants Kalush Orchestra have given an energetic performance during the first semi-final of the Eurovision Song Contest. The rap/folk band are favourites to win this year's edition of the historic singing competition - thanks to their song Stefania.

Welcome to our latest coverage of the war in Ukraine. If you're just joining us - or are in need of a recap - here are some of the latest headlines. Millions of tonnes cannot be exported from Ukraine due to a Russian blockade The war in Ukraine has made Syria's problems even worse than before, the UN's high commissioner for refugees has told the BBC. Speaking to the World Service's Newshour programme, Filippo Grandi said the humanitarian situation inside Syria had become ""quite catastrophic"". Food insecurity caused by the Ukraine crisis has had a ""terrible impact"" on Syria and its neighbours, he added. Russia's blockade along the Black Sea coast has meant millions of tonnes of grain cannot be sent overseas. Ukraine is one of the world's top exporters of wheat. Grandi also acknowledged that there could be a double-standard at work in Europe's treatment of refugees. He said it was ""unacceptable, racist and discriminatory"" that Ukrainians were sometimes seen as ""real"" refugees while others - including those from the Middle East - were not. Leonid Kravchuk and Vitaly Klitschko in March 2021 The first president of the modern state of Ukraine, Leonid Kravchuk, has passed away at 88, according to Kyiv Mayor Vitaly Klitschko. On his Telegram channel, Klitschko said that Kravchuk was a man who embodied ""talent, strong character and knowledge"". Kravchuk, who was formerly chairman of Ukraine's rada - or parliament - and the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR during the waning days of the Soviet Union, became president in December 1991 and remained in office until July 1994. A second campaign to be president ended with an electoral loss to his former prime minister, Leonid Kuchma. Among his most consequential decisions was signing the Lisbon Protocol in 1992, pledging to give up the nuclear arsenal Ukraine was left with after the Soviet Union's collapse. In his post, Klitschko said that Kravchuk's legacy was particularly important at a time when Ukraine is fighting Russia. ""We will preserve the sovereignty and will that we got more than 30 years ago,"" Klitschko wrote. ""We will not retreat."" Tara McKelveyBBC News, Washington In the US, two of the nationâs senior intelligence officials, National Intelligence Director Avril Haines and Defense Intelligence Agency Director Scott Berrier, have painted a sobering picture of the war in Ukraine. The two officials spoke before the Senate armed services committee about global threats to the US on Tuesday, and they highlighted their concerns about Russia. âWe assess President Putin is preparing for a prolonged conflict in Ukraine,â said Haines. âHe is probably counting on US and EU resolve to weaken as food shortages, inflation and energy prices get worse.â Berrier explained that the two enemies, the Russians and the Ukrainians, had reached an impasse. Said Berrier: âThe Russians arenât winning, and the Ukrainians arenât winning, and weâre at a bit of a stalemate.â Their presentations were significant because of the situation they described in Ukraine and also because parts of the hearing were open to the public. Intelligence officials have argued in the past that these hearings should be held behind closed doors. But their presentation provides one of the only chances for the public to hear directly from them about security issues. Their assessment of the war is particularly important as people in the US evaluate the ongoing conflict, the role of the US and the impact of the war on gas prices and other aspects of everyday life. A destroyed Russian tank pictured on 6 May Russian forces are several weeks behind where Vladimir Putin expected them to be after shifting the focus of military operations to Ukraine's eastern Donbas, according to a senior US defence official. Speaking in a briefing call with reporters on Tuesday, the official said that Putin is ""easily two weeks, or maybe even more, behind where he wanted to be in the east"". At the end of April, a US defence official said that Russia was ""several days"" behind schedule. Additionally on Tuesday, the official noted that sanctions are making it more difficult to replenish stocks of guided munitions. The official said that since the sinking of the Moskva in the Black Sea, Russian naval vessels have stayed ""well south"" of the port city of Odesa. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko pictured in an undisclosed location in Ukraine The city council of Mariupol, one of Ukraine's most attacked cities, has collected over 800 reports of war crimes from residents who have managed to flee the besieged city. Mariupol Mayor Vadym Boichenko told Media Center Ukraine that all of the information regarding the alleged war crimes has been passed on to the region's prosecutor's office. The mayor said residents provided testimonies of key attacks in the city, including ""the maternity ward of Mariupol destroyed by the enemy plane, and the Drama Theatre, where a lot of women and children died, and hospital 1, where Mariupol residents with severe injuries burnt alive"". All of the evidence will be part of a wider criminal proceeding into the genocide of Mariupol residents, he said. ""There are numerous examples of war crimes of Russian occupation army led by their main criminal, Putin,"" the mayor added. Read more on the attacks in Mariupol: Ukrainian troops map their position in the Kharkiv region Ukraine claims to have liberated four settlements in the north-easternKharkiv region. Cherkasy Tyshky, Ruski Tyshky, Rubizhne and Bayrak were all snatched back from Russia, said the latest update from the armed forces. Russia was continuing to intensify its offensive in Ukraine's east, the update said. The greatest activity was observed in the directions ofSlobozhanskeandDonetsk. Russian troops were reportedly replenishing ammunition and logistics while a battle forIzyumrages on. But their advances in multiple other areas were said to be proving unsuccessful. The update also confirmed that Russian efforts inMariupolwere focused on assaulting the Azovstal metal works, where more than 1,000 Ukrainian fighters are thought to be sheltering. It was not possible for the BBC to independently confirm the armed forces' claims. The devastated Azovstal steel plant in Ukraine's southern city Mariupol has been surrounded and bombarded for weeks. Russian forces backed by tanks are currently conducting ""storming operations"" at Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant, according to Ukraine's defence ministry. The ""Azov - Mariupol"" channel on messaging app Telegram has posted what appears to be photos of the wounded soldiers holding out in the plant. ""The whole civilised world must see the conditions in which the wounded, crippled defenders of Mariupol are and act!"", says a Telegram message from the fighters posted alongside the photos. There are more than 1,000 troops trapped in the plant, including hundreds who are injured, the Ukrainian deputy PM says. In the Telegram message the fighters appeal to the UN and the Red Cross to ""show their humanity"" and rescue the wounded, who are ""no longer combatants"". ""We demand the immediate evacuation of the wounded servicemen to the territories controlled by Ukraine,"" the fighters have said. Rob CameronBBC Prague Correspondent The Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky has thanked UN members for electing his country to the UN Human Rights Council, replacing Russia - which was suspended from the body in April over its invasion of Ukraine. Mr Lipavsky expressed his gratitude at the trust placed in the Czech Republic and said his country would immediately get to work, as part of Thursday's session on human rights abuses caused by Russia's war in Ukraine. The foreign minister said human rights remained a priority for both his party and the Czech government, which he said was returning to the legacy of Vaclav Havel. ""We belong on the Human Rights Council. Russia does not,"" he told Czech news server Novinky.cz The Czech Republic will serve out the remainder of Russia's three-year term on the council. The city's mayor has confirmed that the bodies of 44 civilians were pulled from the rubble The bodies of 44 civilians have been found in the rubble of a collapsed building in the Ukrainian city of Izyum, as the battle for control of the area rages. The five-storey building collapsed in March as residents hid in the basement from Russian shelling. But rescuers have only just been able to reach the building, one local official told the BBC. And there are fears the death toll could rise further, as another building in the same street was also targeted. Read more on this story here. It's approaching 19:00 in Kyiv. Here's a quick roundup of the latest events in Ukraine. US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines Vladimir Putin is preparing for a long war in Ukraine, the US is warning, and a Russian victory in the eastern region of Donbas might not end its attack. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines tells a Senate hearing the next few months could see Russian actions escalate and become more unpredictable. ""The current trend increases the likelihood that President Putin will turn to more drastic means,"" Haines says. She warns Russia could seek a land bridge to the breakaway Moldovan territory of Transnistria and says it's likely President Putin will seek to impose martial law in Russia. Haines says Putin is counting on the resolve of the US and of Ukraine's European allies to
weaken over time. But she thinks the Kremlin will only authorise the use of nuclear weapons if Putin perceives an ""existential threat"" to Russia. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Guard dead and inmate captured after manhuntCasey White and guard Vicky White were suspected of having struck up a relationship.,"Inmate Casey White (L) and corrections officer Vicky White A female prison guard who went on the run with a murder suspect from an Alabama jail has died after shooting herself as the pair were caught, police say. Vicky White, 56, died in hospital after she and Casey White (no relation), 38, were arrested in Indiana following an 11-day manhunt. The two had vanished from a prison in Lauderdale County on 29 April. They are believed to have been romantically involved. According to officials, they were last seen as she was transporting him to a bogus mental health evaluation. It was Ms White's last day at work before retirement. She had recently sold her home and told colleagues she planned to spend more time at the beach. Late on Monday, the Vanderburgh County Coroners Office confirmed that Vicky White died in a local hospital after shooting herself during the arrest. More information on her death is expected to be released on Tuesday following an autopsy. This video can not be played WATCH: CCTV footage of guard and inmate escaping The US Marshals Service said Ms White had been spotted leaving a hotel in Evansville, Indiana with a wig on before getting into a car driven by Casey White. A police chase ensued, ending when a marshal rammed his vehicle into the couple's Cadillac, at which point Casey White surrendered, saying his ""wife"" had shot herself and needed help. ""We got a dangerous man off the street today. He is never going to see the light of day again,"" Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said. At least one gun was found inside the vehicle, police said. According to US Marshals, the two had previously been last seen on Friday driving a copper-coloured Ford Edge with an Alabama registration plate. On Monday, Sheriff Singleton described the 6ft 9in Casey White as ""extremely dangerous"" and advised law enforcement not to ""take any chances"" with him. Meanwhile, Ms White had a spotless record as a prison guard. ""I would have trusted Vicky with my life. I really mean it,"" Lauderdale County District Attorney Chris Connolly told reporters. ""If we needed something from the jail, she was our go-to person, solid employee. That's why it's so shocking."" Casey White was charged in September 2020 with murder over the stabbing of 58-year-old Connie Ridgeway. He was already serving 75 years for a series of violent crimes in 2015, including burglary, vehicle theft and a police chase. He allegedly confessed to the murder, but later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and was awaiting trial at the Lauderdale County Jail when he disappeared, authorities added. He faces execution if convicted. The prisoner also now faces an escape charge and will be returned to the Alabama corrections system.

Tougher punishments for animal cruelty crimes,"Courts are set to be given powers to hand out tougher punishments for serious animal cruelty crimes, under proposed new sentencing guidelines. Updated guidance in England and Wales will affect sentences for crimes like causing unnecessary suffering, tail docking and animal fighting. Cruelty for money, as part of organised crime or particularly ""sadistic"" cases, will be considered the most serious. It follows the maximum penalty being raised in 2021 to five years in prison. The Sentencing Council's updated guidance for judges and magistrates will mean ""sadistic or extreme cases"" or those carried out ""in the context of commercial or organised criminal activity"" will be assessed at the ""highest culpability"". Cases that involve multiple incidents or the use of significant force will also increase an offender's responsibility, the council explained. Crimes which lead an animal to die, sustain life-threatening injuries, or experience substantial pain or suffering may also attract a stronger sentence. Five years jail for worst animal cruelty Police dog Finn's law comes into force Puppy farm ban set to be confirmed Wild animals to be 'banned from travelling circuses' The proposals from the Sentencing Council, the body which sets sentencing guidelines for all criminal offences in England and Wales, will be put out for public consultation until August. Sentencing guidelines are designed to ensure judges and magistrates in courts take a consistent approach to sentencing. The courts must follow them in sentencing convicted offenders unless it is in the interests of justice not to do so. Other circumstances which will now be treated as aggravating factors in sentencing include: Cases which affect a significant number of animals Images of the cruelty being shared on social media Crimes committed in the presence of children Sentencing Council member Judge Rosa Dean said animal cruelty is a serious offence which can ""cause great distress"" to those who have been ""ill-treated or neglected or even forced to fight each other for entertainment"". ""Animals are not able to defend themselves or draw attention to their suffering, and it is important that courts have the powers to deliver appropriate sentences to offenders who commit these crimes,"" she added. Chris Sherwood, chief executive of animal welfare charity the RSCPA, welcomed the move to update the sentencing guidelines following ""years of campaigning"" to get the law changed. He said: ""We're pleased that the council is seeking views on the guidelines and that animals will soon have better protection from those who hurt them and exploit them."" The move follows theAnimal Welfare (Sentencing) Bill,externalbeing approved by Parliament in 2021, which raised the maximum sentence for the worst animal cruelty crimes from six months to five years. The harshest sentences will be for dog fighting, abuse of puppies and kittens, or gross neglect of farm animals under the updated law. It was written to complement the so-calledFinn's Law, which provides more protection for service dogs and horses. Courts had previously indicated they wanted to hand down longer sentences in recent years but they were not available.

This video can not be played WATCH: CCTV footage of guard and inmate escaping The US Marshals Service said Ms White had been spotted leaving a hotel in Evansville, Indiana with a wig on before getting into a car driven by Casey White. A police chase ensued, ending when a marshal rammed his vehicle into the couple's Cadillac, at which point Casey White surrendered, saying his ""wife"" had shot herself and needed help. ""We got a dangerous man off the street today. He is never going to see the light of day again,"" Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said. At least one gun was found inside the vehicle, police said. According to US Marshals, the two had previously been last seen on Friday driving a copper-coloured Ford Edge with an Alabama registration plate. On Monday, Sheriff Singleton described the 6ft 9in Casey White as ""extremely dangerous"" and advised law enforcement not to ""take any chances"" with him. Meanwhile, Ms White had a spotless record as a prison guard. ""I would have trusted Vicky with my life. I really mean it,"" Lauderdale County District Attorney Chris Connolly told reporters. ""If we needed something from the jail, she was our go-to person, solid employee. That's why it's so shocking."" Casey White was charged in September 2020 with murder over the stabbing of 58-year-old Connie Ridgeway. He was already serving 75 years for a series of violent crimes in 2015, including burglary, vehicle theft and a police chase. He allegedly confessed to the murder, but later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and was awaiting trial at the Lauderdale County Jail when he disappeared, authorities added. He faces execution if convicted. The prisoner also now faces an escape charge and will be returned to the Alabama corrections system.
