'Mental health crisis' afflicting Irish Travellers,"Members of the community say discrimination is causing a mental health crisis in their home country Irish Travellers suffer some of the worst discrimination and poverty of any ethnic group in Europe, according toEuropean Union research,external. Members of the community have said it is causing a mental health crisis in their home country. In 2021, an Irish parliamentary committee reported that11% of Travellers in Ireland die by suicide,external. It also said that life expectancy among men in the community is up to 15 years shorter than the wider population. Rose Marie Maughan works with the Irish Travellers Movement, a national network of over 40 organisations. ""Our suicide rate is seven times higher than non-travellers,"" she said. ""Only 3% of us live past the age of 65 and 80% of us are unemployed. ""If that was any other community in Ireland, there would be international attention."" This video can not be played Irish Traveller Mags Casey lost 28 family members to suicide Mags Casey is the chair of the Irish Travellers National Mental Health Network. Nearly 30 members of her extended family have died by suicide in the last 10 years. Her sister-in-law died in January 2012, followed two years later by her brother, who, Mags said, never recovered from the grief of losing his wife. ""The first suicide in our family, I thought the world ended,"" she said. ""I didn't know how to sit with four children and tell them your mother's dead, your mother's gone. ""The devastating effects it has on a family - addiction, family breakdown, a spiral of grief, young people not knowing how to deal with that grief."" David Friel, a 24-year-old from County Donegal, is the first Traveller in the north-west of Ireland to achieve a masters degree. Only 1% of Irish Travellers reach third-level education compared to over half of the general population. David said that young Irish Travellers are struggling to balance their sense of identity with the demands of belonging in Irish society. ""It's trying to pass as a member of the settled population,"" he added. David's grandfather kept 100 horses but now he said the family are struggling to maintain one horse ""So, you're not being your true authentic self. That mentally is very, very difficult. ""You're living two lives, and no-one can maintain that."" Irish Travellers have a long history of nomadism, but activists have said laws have seen them forced to assimilate into the ""settled"" population and abandon traditions like living in caravans, keeping horses and specialist trades. They have said their culture is being eroded. David's grandfather kept 100 horses, but now, he said, the family is struggling to maintain one horse. ""The traditional means of employment have been obliterated - tinsmithing, or hawking, or gathering whelks or scrap,"" he explained. ""If you don't have employment, it's very difficult to sustain animals."" Mags Casey highlighted the halting site where she grew up in Limerick. A large wall has been built around the site separating it from the nearby housing estates. ""They deliberately put that wall around us to fence Travellers in completely,"" said Mags. ""Away from society. Out of sight and out of mind."" A large wall has been built around a halting site in Limerick, separating it from the nearby housing estates Campaigners say Travellers have a distinct identity and that their culture is often misconstrued because they are not represented in many aspects of everyday life. They claim that prejudice against Travellers has become socially acceptable and isn't challenged in the same way other forms of discrimination are. ""It is totally embedded in Irish society to accept racism against Travellers,"" said David. ""If we look at the media, if we look at the gardaÃ­ (Irish police), we look at teachers, we look at politics - we're not represented. ""It's about having Travellers at the table, having meaningful dialogue and having the narratives from within the community."" Prof Verene Shepherd is the chair of the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which publishedits most recent major report on Ireland in 2019,external. Travellers say they need more action and support to address the discrimination ""Travellers are 10 times more likely to experience discrimination in seeking work,"" said Prof Shepherd. ""Travellers are more than 22 times more likely than white Irish to experience discrimination in shops, pubs and restaurants."" The Irish government has said it has a range of policies to encourage the inclusion of Travellers in areas like education, employment, health and accommodation. But Irish Travellers have said they need more action and support to address the discrimination creating a mental health crisis in their community. Specific spending on Traveller mental health is â¬250,000 (Â£207,013) a year, and â¬12m (Â£9.9m) went towards Traveller accommodation in 2021. ""We're proud and we're dignified people,"" said Mags. ""We have solutions and we want you to listen to us. We aren't in it for money. ""We're in it to stay alive and keep our young kids alive.""

Households cancel streaming services to cut costs,"The rising cost of living in Britain has led to households cancelling their streaming subscriptions, new research suggests. A total of 1.51 million services were canned in the first three months of 2022, market research firm Kantar said. It said more than half a million cancellations were attributed to ""money saving"", with households budgeting for higher prices and energy bills instead. About 58% of Britain's homes now have at least one paid streaming service. The height of coronavirus pandemic and lockdowns saw surges in subscriptions for platforms such as Netflix, Disney+ and Amazon Prime. But researchers said the proportion of consumers planning to cancel subscriptions stating the primary reason as ""wanting to save money"" had risen to its highest ever level at 38%, up from 29% in final three months of 2021. Kantar said households were ""starting to seriously prioritise where and how their disposable income is spent"". Dominic Sunnebo, global insight director at Kantar's Worldpanel Division, added that the latest research would be ""sobering"" for the industry. ""The evidence from these findings suggests that British households are now proactively looking for ways to save,"" he said. Researchers said Amazon Prime's thriller series Reacher was the most-watched title in the first three months of 2022, followed by Ozark and Inventing Anna on Netflix. They said that although ""churn"" rates increased almost across all streaming platforms, there was a ""clear difference"" in the number of cancellations seen outside of Netflix and Amazon. ""Netflix and Amazon can be seen to be hygiene subscriptions for Brits; the last to go when households are forced to prioritise spend,"" Kantar said. ""Disney, Now TV, Discovery+ and BritBox all saw significant jumps in churn rates quarter-on-quarter."" Besides mounting cancellations, the early months of 2022 saw the lowest ever rate of new subscribers, Kantar said. In January, Netflix said it added 18.2 million members last year - roughly half the number who subscribed in 2020. Investors had hoped that pace would start to pick up again, which sent the company's share price down almost 20% at the time. The company admitted that new competition from the likes of Disney, Apple, Amazon and HBO was starting to have an impact. Kantar said advertising was ""an obvious route for driving revenue growth, but one Netflix has historically strictly shied away from"". ""However, Netflix chief financial officer Spencer Neumann added fuel to the fire by saying in March 'it's not like we have religion against advertising',"" its Entertainment on Demand study said. ""Data across Great Britain shows Netflix subscribers' attitudes to advertising are softening, with 44% now stating they don't mind seeing on streaming services if it makes them cheaper, a significant rise from 38% at the same point in 2021.""

Derby relegated from Championship after QPR defeat,"Derby have been relegated to the third tier for the first time in 36 years Derby County have been relegated from the Championship after suffering a dramatic late defeat at Queens Park Rangers. Luke Amos' 88th-minute winner for QPR, coupled with Reading'sremarkable 4-4 drawagainst Swansea, consigned Wayne Rooney's beleaguered Rams to the drop to League One. Relegation with three games to go means Derby will play in England's third tier for the first time since 1986. Their fight for survival, in a campaign crippled by a 21-point deduction, could only have been prolonged if they equalled or bettered Reading's result. When Amos coolly slipped the ball past goalkeeper Ryan Allsop, their hopes of staying up had taken a major blow but were not over. However, Tom McIntyre's 95th-minute leveller for Reading left the Rams 10 points behind the 21st-placed Royals with three games remaining. Even then, Tom Lawrence was sent off for a second yellow card for a foul on Charlie Austin to compound Derby's misery. Rooney hopes relegation plays on former owner Morris' mind QPR ended a six-match winless run to move up to 10th in the table and to within two points of the top six, although sixth-placed Sheffield United could increase that gap if they beat Bristol City later on Monday. In a nervy first half of the high-stakes game in west London, Amos had an early goal ruled out for offside while Luke Plange skimmed Derby's best chance off the top off the crossbar with a header. A crucial block from Derby full-back Nathan Byrne to foil Lyndon Dykes after the half-hour mark summed up the steadfast determination Rooney's Rams have played with throughout a fraught campaign. If not for the 21-point deduction this season, for entering administration and breaching the EFL's financial regulations, Derby would be 17th in the table and almost as close to the play-off places as the relegation spots. Allsop made two crucial second-half saves, denying Ilias Chair and Dykes, but Amos finished a quick counter attack with two minutes left to break Derby's resistance and ultimately shatter what hopes they had of avoiding the drop. Luke Amos' winner against Derby was his sixth goal of the season Derby's spirited attempt to stay in the Championship is over, but the protracted efforts to sell the club are ongoing. US businessman Chris Kirchner wasconfirmed as the preferred bidderto buy the club earlier this month, but while the sale continues it means Derby remain in administration - having been placed there by former owner Mel Morris 208 days ago. With just five players contracted for next season and the Rams under a transfer embargo, rebuilding the East Midlands club in League One will present significant challenges for whoever is involved. Rooney's future with the Rams is also uncertain, with the 36-year-old linked with the vacant job at Premier League side Burnley. Earlier this season he rejected an approach from boyhood club Everton to speak to them about taking charge at Goodison Park. Analysis - Ed Dawes, BBC Radio Derby's Derby County commentator The effort, energy, creativity, fighting for the cause, camaraderie. It's all been there in recent months. Those relationships have meant this team have taken it to game 43 with a 21-point deduction and that has to be commended. The amount of players that have been introduced and brought through, that's a good starting block for next season. If they can get one or two senior players to sign new contracts and play for Wayne Rooney next season, even in League One, then Derby have a fighting chance. Minus 15 points is a very strong possibility next season, but that's from the off and not in late September. Derby fans should be very proud of their team and I'm sure they are.

Alex Jones' Infowars files for bankruptcy in US,"Companies owned by US radio host Alex Jones, including his right-wing website InfoWars, have filed for bankruptcy. The move comes as he fights defamation suits brought by families of those killed in a 2012 school shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school. Mr Jones, who falsely claimed the shooting was a hoax, has been ordered to pay damages in the lawsuits. Those efforts will be complicated by his decision to seek protection from creditors in bankruptcy court. In the US, declaring bankruptcy provides a route for companies to remain in operation and negotiate their debts, with settlements overseen by the court. It puts a hold on other litigation. Troubles for the radio host and conspiracy theorist stem from his false claims about the 2012 shooting in Connecticut, one of the worst school shootings in US history. He repeatedly claimed the massacre, in which twenty children and six adults were killed, was a ploy to push gun control, staged by actors and the mainstream media. Those claims  were among the most prominent spread on his radio show and Infowars website. BACKGROUND:Sandy Hook: What happened that day LEGAL CASE:Sandy Hook parents sue for defamation In three separate lawsuits, families of those killed at Sandy Hook have said his lies enriched his business, including InfoWars, while leading to their harassment by his followers. They won the lawsuits last year after Mr Jones denied the claims but refused to present evidence such as financial records in court. This month, juries were set to start determining how much he owes the families. He had proposed to pay $120,000 (Â£92,150) to each of the 13 people involved in the lawsuits, but they rejected that offer last month. ""The so-called offer is a transparent and desperate attempt by Alex Jones to escape a public reckoning under oath with his deceitful, profit-driven campaign against the plaintiffs and the memory of their loved ones lost at Sandy Hook,"" the families said in court filings. Since the lawsuits, Mr Jones has acknowledged that the shooting took place. He has said the lawsuits threaten his constitutional rights to free speech. In the bankruptcy filing, InfoWars listed its estimated assets in the range of $0-$50,000 and estimated liabilities in the range of $1m to $10m. He has already been banned by Facebook, Twitter and YouTube in recent years for hate speech and abusive behaviour.

Ukraine round-up: Lviv counts first civilian dead,"This video can not be played Watch: BBC reporter describes witnessing a missile strike in Lviv A Russian missile attack on the western city of Lviv has left at least seven people dead, city officials say, on a day the Russians intensified strikes across Ukraine. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had now started its assault to seize Ukraine's Donbas region in the east. Mr Zelensky's remarks came after Russia said it had hit 300 targets across Ukraine, however. Up until now the picturesque Ukrainian city had escaped largely unscathed from the worst of the Russian invasion. One of the missiles there struck a garage where workers were meeting for coffee before work, officials said. ""Everyone is unsafe,"" Lviv's mayor said. Yury Buran, a 26-year-old IT worker, was one of those killed when a missile struck. ""Humans cannot do such things. They are not humans, they are barbaric invaders."" his father Anatoly said to the BBC. Read Toby Luckhurst and Mariana Maglych's full report from the site of the attack in Lviv. The final Ukrainian fighters preventing Russia from taking full control of Mariupol will not lay down their arms, the country's prime minister has said. ""They will fight until the end. And as for now, they are still in Mariupol,"" Ukrainian PM Denys Shmyhal told a US TV network. Russia's military says it controls almost all of Mariupol, while Ukraine's Azov Battalion is still holding out in Azovstal, a huge steelworks overlooking the Azov Sea. They've been camped out in a network of underground bunkers and tunnels running beneath Mariupol's massive Azovstal steel complex, ignoring multiple Russian ultimatums to surrender. Credible footage of the Moskva warship in the hours before it sank appears to show the missile cruiser listing heavily with black smoke billowing into the sky. Last week Russia blamed the loss of its Black Sea flagship on an unexplained fire, but Ukraine claimed it hit the warship with two missiles. Now the new footage has emerged, the BBC asked military experts what they thought of it. They agreed it probably showed the Moskva and that the damage was consistent with that from a missile strike, but stressed it wasn't possible to draw definitive conclusions from the grainy footage. Aiden Aslin, photographed here in Syria, has been fighting alongside the Ukrainian army Two British men reportedly captured by Russian forces while fighting in Ukraine have appealed on Russian state television for Boris Johnson to help free them,but its unclear whether the pleas were made under duress. Shaun Pinner, 48, and Aiden Aslin, 28, were shown in two separate videos asking to be swapped in a prisoner exchange with a pro-Kremlin politician being detained in Ukraine. Families of both men have appealed for their Russian captors to treat them humanely.

Police speak to Nicola Sturgeon over mask breach,"Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was filmed without a face covering on while in a barber shop Police officers have spoken to Nicola Sturgeon after she was filmed breaching Scotland's face mask rules. They reminded her of the importance of wearing a face covering when there was a legal requirement to do so, Police Scotland said. The force added it was satisfied that no further action was necessary. Footage shared on social media showedthe first minister without a mask in an East Kilbride barber shop. In a statement, Ms Sturgeon said she realised she had forgotten to put her face covering on ""within seconds"" of being in the shop on Saturday. ""I then immediately put it on,"" she added. ""However, I accept that not wearing a face covering even for a few seconds was an error on my part and I am sorry for that."" She said Police Scotland made contact with her after receiving complaints. Ms Sturgeon said: ""This is what they would have done with anyone else in these circumstances, and they were absolutely right to treat me no differently to any other citizen. ""I explained that the error was inadvertent and the police have confirmed that the matter is closed. ""While the law no longer requires face coverings to be worn, I will continue to do so in circumstances where this can help reduce the risk of infection, and I encourage everyone to do likewise.""

The legal requirement to wear face coverings in crowded indoor places, and on public transport was lifted on Monday. However, people are still being strongly advised to wear masks voluntarily while case numbers remain high. It is ironic that on the day Nicola Sturgeon lifted the legal requirement to wear a face covering in shops and on buses, she is in the news for breaking her own rules. For the second time in this pandemic, the first minister has apologised for forgetting to put on her mask when she should have. It was a temporary lapse and the police have judged that reminding Ms Sturgeon of her responsibilities was sufficient to deal with the matter. It is none the less embarrassing for Scotland's principal rule maker to have the police calling her out for being a Covid rule-breaker. Her case is not equivalent to the multiple parties and gatherings held in and around Downing Street over which the prime minister has already been fined. It does however provide Boris Johnson with a comeback to the SNP when he appears in the Commons on Tuesday to explain his behaviour and his previous claim that Covid rules were followed at all times. During the visit to the barber shop on Saturday, Ms Sturgeon shaved a man's beard while journalists took photographs. The SNP leader postedfootage on her own Instagram account,external, describing it as ""surreal"" but one of the best and ""scariest"" things she had done on the campaign trail. Further footage was later posted online showing her interacting with people without her mask on. Police Scotland said its response to the incident was ""in line with our proportionate approach throughout the pandemic"". Nicola Sturgeon has been photographed in a face covering while on the election trail In December 2020 Ms Sturgeonapologised for taking her face mask off at a wakefollowing the funeral of a Scottish government civil servant who died with Covid. Addressing MSPs shortly afterwards, she said: ""I am kicking myself very hard - possibly harder than my worst critic ever could - but more importantly I'll be making sure I don't drop my guard again.""

Beautiful tourist town braces for Russian assault,"Most of Sviatohirsk's residents have fled the town In a picturesque resort town on the northern edge of Ukraine's Donbas region, people can hear the shelling coming closer. The Russians are just five miles to the north. Sviatohirsk was once a staple of the tourist trail but now it is just another place in the Donbas where people flee the fighting. Most of its permanent residents have themselves fled, fearing the war will not stop its ruthless advance here. It was famed for its historic Russian Orthodox church and monastery, set amid the wooded Holy Mountains of the Donbas. That monastery has been damaged by shrapnel from a Russian air strike that hit a target nearby. There is now a gaping hole in the church spire. Just to the north is the city of Izyum where there is already fierce fighting. The residents who had fled Izyum told us they had been bombed day and night, been without running water and electricity for weeks. They also said there were bodies on the streets. The support of religious leaders is helping some cope with the trauma of war ""Everyone is worried,"" the town's mayor, Vladimir, tells me. He says those who have remained regularly call to check he's not leaving. He is not. He is staying put and organising food parcels for the town's dwindling population. These are people who are tired, hungry and scared, too scared sometimes to apportion any blame on Russia. ""I will not talk about it,"" one woman tells me, ""because we still have to go home."" Russia is open about the fact that its renewed focus in the war will be in Ukraine's east, the Donbas. The Russian offensive here is coming from three directions - from the north, south and the east. But the landscape of the town that so charms its visitors also offers some kind of protection to its terrified residents. Unlike most of the Donbas region, which is largely flat open landscape,  Sviatohirsk is set among hills and forests - providing some natural defences - making it harder for an army to manoeuvre with artillery and tanks. The people left in the area find themselves queuing for emergency food parcels The residents who have stayed behind now rub shoulders with soldiers getting a brief respite from the fighting. They grab a coffee from one of the few shops left open. The military's not allowed to speak to us without permission. One man proudly tells us he was trained by British troops before the latest war started. He's confident that Ukraine can win this war. But I meet another soldier who sounds less assured. The unrelenting Russian bombardment is taking its toll. Another soldier tells us that the Russians have been targeting their positions with white phosphorous shells - which burn into the flesh. There is now a real danger that Russia may soon try to encircle Ukrainian forces in the region who have been fighting Russian-backed separatist in the region since 2014. Ukrainian troops there are among the most battle hardened in the Ukrainian Army. But they, too, are  worried that their supply lines could be cut off as Russian forces push in from three different directions. The unit we saw look well trained and well equipped. Their automatic weapons were fitted with suppressors, which are silencers. An officer who agreed to be interviewed says his son, too, was trained - by US and British forces. The Ukrainian army now is better prepared than when separatists took over the Donbas in 2014 Volodomyr told us that the Ukrainian Army is now much better prepared than the one of 2014 - when Russian backed separatists took over part of the Donbas. ""If this war had happened then, I don't know how it would end, but now we know the Russian aggressors will get what they deserve."" Volodomyr says the Russians are using similar tactics they have used elsewhere in Ukraine - ""creating panic among the local population"". He says ""it's inhuman"". It is now happening right across the Donbas. ANALYSIS:What does Putin want? WATCH:The elderly who can't flee their homes DIPLOMACY:Germany's conundrum over ties with Russia READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external From the distance we could see and hear the city of Severodonetsk being pounded. We tried to enter but had to turn back when we heard the whistle of a shell landing nearby. It was a similar scene further south in the city of Avdiivka - where the remnants of a once bustling industrial  city were now hiding in bunkers. Gallina showed the crater caused by a bomb landing in her garden Even a nearby village hadn't been spared. Sixty-year-old Gallina showed us the crater which had landed in her garden - blowing out the windows of her small home the night before. Inside, her granddaughter, Anastasia, was cowering under a table - still too frightened to come out. Gallina told me ""there's nothing funny about this situation"". ""We live here like cannon fodder,"" she added. Anastasia has been hiding under a table since a bomb landed near her home, frightened to come out Ukrainian forces are  trying to slow any Russian advance - as they did in Kyiv. One soldier shows us drone footage of a bridge they recently blew up - to the north of Izyum. It brings a  column of military trucks to a standstill. But more will be coming. What is happening in the Donbas now - the incessant, unrelenting shelling - is the prelude to the long expected offensive. Russia is trying to weaken Ukraine's defences and its people's resolve. There have been also Russian probing attacks across the frontline. Most have been so far repelled by Ukraine forces. But they know more will be coming. Russia is still massing and reconstituting its battered units. There are still questions as to whether Russian forces will perform any better in the east than they did outside the capital Kyiv - where they were forced to retreat. The UK's Ministry of Defence believes Russian commanders will also be concerned by the time it is taking them to subdue the port city of Mariupol - which has diverted men and materiel - slowing the Russian advance elsewhere. Ukraine still fears worse is to come. That's why President Volodymyr Zelensky has once again been calling for more weapons. Until recently Western support has been limited to ""defensive weapons"" - such as anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles. But some countries are now sending heavier weapons. We have seen some of it - such as armoured vehicles - arrive on the frontline. The Czech Republic is providing Ukraine with a dozen T-72 tanks. The latest batch of US military aid will include 18 howitzers. But that will probably not be enough to tip to balance overwhelmingly in favour of Ukraine. Back in Sviatohirsk, Mayor Vladimir says he is still holding out hope that this conflict can be resolved through diplomacy. ""All this is terrible,"" he says. ""This destruction has no future.""

Use the loo before you hike - Snowdonia authority,"Unprepared walkers have been blamed for reports of human faeces on some of Wales' most popular mountain paths. Snowdonia National Park Authority said there were toilets at the bottom of the areas main paths which should be used before starting a hike. Helen Pye, the authority's engagement officer, said reports of faeces on some paths were ""upsetting and alarming"" but there was no need to add more toilets. Visitors have flocked to the area over the Easter weekend. This video can not be played Snowdon is a huge attraction for tourists ""Snowdon is a national nature reserve and so it's really quite a special and fragile environment,"" Ms Pyetold BBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""But also, I think the impression these headlines give to those wanting to visit Wales is the last thing the tourism sector needs at the minute so we we really don't want to see this sort of thing impacting on people's enjoyment of the area."" Ms Pye rejected claims toilets were closed adding there were facilities at the bottom of all the main paths up Snowdon. Mountain path covered in human faeces, says guide Visitors climbing up Snowdon '24-hours-a-day' Snowdonia litter problem condemned Snowdonia communities 'exploited' ""It's an amazing special, beautiful mountain environment. I think the most appropriate thing is to have toilets at the foot of the paths and not be littering the mountain with things like that,"" she added. ""This is unfortunately a small minority that perhaps aren't as well prepared, let's say and get caught short. ""And most of the visitors to Snowdon are fantastic, they come well prepared. ""They're aware that they're off on a mountain hike and they listen to the messages that we put out to kind of go before you hike and use those facilities at the bottom of all the main paths."" Queues have become a regular sight on Snowdon as hundreds of thousands of visitors hike up to the top The call comes after Snowdon guide Gemma Davies said she caught a man defecating on the mountain's railway line. She said she was ""totally disgusted"" at the state of the Llanberis path on Saturday morning with stools in paper cups and under stones. Ms Davies, who led a sunrise hike up Wales' highest mountain on Saturday, said the problem was so bad, she was having to warn people to ""mind the poo"". Snowdon guide Gemma Davies says the Llanberis path was ""covered in human stool"" She claimed toilets at the summit were closed along with the cafe and ""there were no toilets open at the bottom when we got to the bottom after a seven hour hike"". Ms Davies said: ""It is a long hike, so I understand people have got to go but there is a way of going. ""It's like when you go camping. You take a shovel and you dig yourself a hole. ""Doing it in paper cups and leaving it on the main path for everyone to step over, is definitely not the way to go about it. ""It's upsetting to see. We work up there nearly every day and it's just embarrassing.""

Rwanda asylum critics have no solutions - Patel,"Priti Patel and Rwanda Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta said their plan was ""bold and innovative"" Home Secretary Priti Patel has hit back at critics of the government's plan to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, saying they have failed to offer solutions. Writing in the Times,externalwith the Rwandan foreign minister, she said they had proposed an innovative answer to the ""deadly trade"" of people-smuggling. No ""humanitarian nation"" could allow that suffering to continue, they said. It comes after Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said there were""serious ethical questions"" about the plan. To push the scheme through, Ms Patelissued a ministerial direction- meaning she took responsibility for the policy - after her top civil servant questioned whether it offered value for money. Ms Patel and Vincent Biruta, Rwanda's foreign minister, said the global asylum system was ""collapsing"" under the strain of humanitarian crises and human trafficking. The plan to transport some asylum seekers who enter the UK unlawfully to Rwanda, where they can apply to settle, will allow people fleeing persecution to find safety, they said. And they added that the UK's investment in Rwanda - an initial Â£120m - would help to address the lack of opportunities which drive economic migration. No evidence Rwanda plan deters migrants - adviser How might the Rwanda asylum plan work? UK's Rwanda asylum plan ungodly, says Archbishop ""We are taking bold and innovative steps and it's surprising that those institutions that criticise the plans fail to offer their own solutions,"" they wrote. ""Allowing this suffering to continue is no longer an option for any humanitarian nation."" It also emerged that some refugees in Rwanda will be sent to the UK under the terms of the two nations' agreement. A UK government source told the BBC that it would be supporting Rwanda to resettle ""a portion of the most vulnerable refugees"". The scheme will initially focus mainly on single men arriving in the UK on small boats or lorries. Those sent to Rwanda will be provided with accommodation while their asylum claims are considered. If successful they will be able to remain in the east African nation. Energy minister Greg Hands told Times Radio sending migrants to Rwanda would be a ""significant deterrent"" to people attempting to cross the Channel in small boats. He said the government was ""confident"" that the policy would work. Two boats carrying 76 people were brought into Dover, Kent, on Sunday, the Home Office said, while a further two small boats were seen being brought ashore on Monday. This video can not be played Justin Welby addresses the ""serious ethical questions"" of sending asylum seekers to Rwanda On Easter Sunday, Mr Welby became the latest figure to criticise the plan, accusing the government of ""subcontracting our responsibilities"" and saying it cannot ""stand the judgment of God"". He was joined by the Archbishop of York, Stephen Cottrell, who said the policy was ""depressing and distressing"", adding: ""We can do better than this."" Opposition parties and some Conservative MPs have also criticised the plan, whilemore than 160 charities and campaign groups called it ""shamefully cruel""and urged the prime minister and Ms Patel to scrap it. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer described the scheme as ""unworkable"", while the Liberal Democrats said the government was ""slamming the door"" in the face of refugees and the SNP's Ian Blackford called it ""absolutely chilling"". Among their concerns was Rwanda's own human rights record, with the UK having raisedallegations of extrajudicial killings, disappearances and torture,externalin the east African nation at the UN last year. But in their Times article, Ms Patel and Mr Biruta said Rwanda ""ranks as one of the world's safest countries"" and has already accommodated 130,000 refugees from multiple countries. Which other countries send asylum seekers overseas? Analysis: Rwanda deal does what no country has done before Land of safety - or fear? Why Rwanda divides opinion While they said the plan would ""deter migrants from putting their lives at risk"" by making dangerous journeys, a letter from the Home Office's top official saidevidence for a deterrent effect was ""highly uncertain"". Permanent Secretary Matthew Rycroft warned the policy had a high cost and would only be value for money if it reduced the number of Channel crossings and other illegal entries to the UK. While the UK is investing Â£120m into the ""economic development and growth of Rwanda"" as part of the deal, the government said funding would also be provided to support asylum operations, accommodation and integration which would be ""similar to the costs incurred in the UK for these services"". The Times has reported a cost of Â£20,000 to Â£30,000 for each migrant sent to Rwanda. Labour's Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was ""highly unusual"" in the Home Office for a ministerial direction to be issued. She said if a policy is drawn up ""at the last minute"" it can be difficult to prove its monetary value but as the idea of processing asylum seekers abroad had been discussed by the government for some time, she said she would be interested to see the ""accounting for it"".

Breaking|Breaking newsSturgeon faces no further action over mask breachOfficers reminded Scotland's first minister of the importance of wearing face coverings when legally required.Scotland,"Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was filmed without a face covering on while in a barber shop Police officers have spoken to Nicola Sturgeon after she was filmed breaching Scotland's face mask rules. They reminded her of the importance of wearing a face covering when there was a legal requirement to do so, Police Scotland said. The force added it was satisfied that no further action was necessary. Footage shared on social media showedthe first minister without a mask in an East Kilbride barber shop. In a statement, Ms Sturgeon said she realised she had forgotten to put her face covering on ""within seconds"" of being in the shop on Saturday. ""I then immediately put it on,"" she added. ""However, I accept that not wearing a face covering even for a few seconds was an error on my part and I am sorry for that."" She said Police Scotland made contact with her after receiving complaints. Ms Sturgeon said: ""This is what they would have done with anyone else in these circumstances, and they were absolutely right to treat me no differently to any other citizen. ""I explained that the error was inadvertent and the police have confirmed that the matter is closed. ""While the law no longer requires face coverings to be worn, I will continue to do so in circumstances where this can help reduce the risk of infection, and I encourage everyone to do likewise.""

The legal requirement to wear face coverings in crowded indoor places, and on public transport was lifted on Monday. However, people are still being strongly advised to wear masks voluntarily while case numbers remain high. It is ironic that on the day Nicola Sturgeon lifted the legal requirement to wear a face covering in shops and on buses, she is in the news for breaking her own rules. For the second time in this pandemic, the first minister has apologised for forgetting to put on her mask when she should have. It was a temporary lapse and the police have judged that reminding Ms Sturgeon of her responsibilities was sufficient to deal with the matter. It is none the less embarrassing for Scotland's principal rule maker to have the police calling her out for being a Covid rule-breaker. Her case is not equivalent to the multiple parties and gatherings held in and around Downing Street over which the prime minister has already been fined. It does however provide Boris Johnson with a comeback to the SNP when he appears in the Commons on Tuesday to explain his behaviour and his previous claim that Covid rules were followed at all times. During the visit to the barber shop on Saturday, Ms Sturgeon shaved a man's beard while journalists took photographs. The SNP leader postedfootage on her own Instagram account,external, describing it as ""surreal"" but one of the best and ""scariest"" things she had done on the campaign trail. Further footage was later posted online showing her interacting with people without her mask on. Police Scotland said its response to the incident was ""in line with our proportionate approach throughout the pandemic"". Nicola Sturgeon has been photographed in a face covering while on the election trail In December 2020 Ms Sturgeonapologised for taking her face mask off at a wakefollowing the funeral of a Scottish government civil servant who died with Covid. Addressing MSPs shortly afterwards, she said: ""I am kicking myself very hard - possibly harder than my worst critic ever could - but more importantly I'll be making sure I don't drop my guard again."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Rishi Sunak, the chancellor,recently rejected calls to resign, despite being fined by police for breaking lockdown rules in Downing Street in June 2020.

"Ban water boss bonuses over sewage - Lib DemsBosses paid Â£27m extra since 2020 despite 1,000 sewage spills a day, according to the party's research.UK Politics","The government has put water companies under pressure to curb sewage spills The Liberal Democrats have urged the UK government to ban bonuses for water company bosses until sewage offences are stopped. The party's analysis showed firms in England had paid executives nearly Â£27m in bonuses since 2020. The bonuses are ""obscene"" given 1,000 sewage spills a day were recorded in 2021, the Lib Dems said. The government has not backed the ban, but said it was taking urgent action to curb sewage discharges. ""We are clear that we want water companies to spend more on better infrastructure and far less on pay-outs to shareholders,"" a government source told the BBC. Labour stopped short of backing the call for a ban on bonuses, but accused the government of allowing the companies bosses to dump sewage ""while pocketing eye-watering bonuses amid a cost of living crisis"". Water companies could face fines or criminal prosecutions after admitting possible illegal discharges into rivers and waterways. The admission last yearprompted a major government investigation,externalinto more than 2,200 sewage treatment works spanning all water and sewerage companies in England. Water companies illegally dumping sewage in England and Wales' rivers Environment Bill passes following lengthy battle over sewage How clean are the UK's rivers and lakes? Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey accused the Conservative government of ""allowing water companies to pump raw sewage into our precious rivers and lakes while awarding themselves obscene bonuses"". ""Just like the millions paid out to bankers during the financial crisis, the public will find this hard to stomach,"" he said. His party's analysis of company records showed executives at England's water companies were paid Â£48m in 2020 and 2021 - including Â£27.6m in bonuses, benefits and incentives. They claimed United Utilities paid out the largest package of bonuses, worth nearly Â£6m, followed by Severn Trent (Â£5.5m) and Anglian Water (Â£3.5m). In the same 2020-21 period, water companies made Â£2.7bn in operating profits, according to the analysis. Sir Ed said the bosses should hand back their bonuses ""to help clean up their mess"". But Green Party peer Jenny Jones said ""much stronger action"" was needed to tackle the ""sewage dumping scandal"". She called for water companies to be brought back into public ownership to ensure ""proper accountability"", but in the meantime, introduce a ""much tougher watchdog... to properly enforce the protection of our rivers and coastlines with heavy fines on companies that continue to carelessly pollute them."" United Utilities declined to comment.On its website,external, the company said it had a ""long-term ambition"" to ""eliminate pollution incidents"". Severn Trent pointed to its plan,externalto ensure no river in its catchment areas would be unhealthy because of its operations by 2030. The same commitment was made by Anglian Water, which said it would not comment on the remuneration of its staff. ""It is a matter for them and the independent remuneration committee, who ensure pay is benchmarked against other companies and industries,"" a spokeswoman said. The Lib Dems have also called for a sewage tax on the profits of water companies to fund the cleaning up of waterways polluted by sewage. But a government source accused the Lib Dems of ""hypocrisy"" for ""preaching about water quality"". ""They voted down our measures to improve water quality during the passage of the Environment Act,"" the source said. The government's Environment Bill was approved by Parliament last year, following a lengthy battle over the amount of sewage released into rivers. But Labour's shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon said the law ""allowed water firm bosses to dump raw sewage into our communities, while pocketing eye-watering bonuses amid a cost of living crisis."" He added: ""Labour is on your side and would respect our communities by cleaning up the sewage being dumped by companies in our fields, rivers, and lakes - which the Tories passed laws to allow."" Last month, the Environment Agency said the ""state of our rivers is not in the condition we want"" and ""we are still seeing too much pollution from a number of sources"". In 2021,the agency recorded,externalmore than 372,000 spill events lasting more than 2.6 million hours from storm overflows, which release untreated sewage and rainwater into the environment to ease pressure on the system. Water companies are allowed to discharge untreated sewage into rivers in exceptional circumstances - for example, during heavy rainfall. They can, however, be acting illegally if they fail to meet certain requirements, such as treating enough wastewater before overflows are released into the environment.

In the same 2020-21 period, water companies made Â£2.7bn in operating profits, according to the analysis. Sir Ed said the bosses should hand back their bonuses ""to help clean up their mess"". But Green Party peer Jenny Jones said ""much stronger action"" was needed to tackle the ""sewage dumping scandal"". She called for water companies to be brought back into public ownership to ensure ""proper accountability"", but in the meantime, introduce a ""much tougher watchdog... to properly enforce the protection of our rivers and coastlines with heavy fines on companies that continue to carelessly pollute them."" United Utilities declined to comment.On its website,external, the company said it had a ""long-term ambition"" to ""eliminate pollution incidents"". Severn Trent pointed to its plan,externalto ensure no river in its catchment areas would be unhealthy because of its operations by 2030. The same commitment was made by Anglian Water, which said it would not comment on the remuneration of its staff. ""It is a matter for them and the independent remuneration committee, who ensure pay is benchmarked against other companies and industries,"" a spokeswoman said. The Lib Dems have also called for a sewage tax on the profits of water companies to fund the cleaning up of waterways polluted by sewage. But a government source accused the Lib Dems of ""hypocrisy"" for ""preaching about water quality"". ""They voted down our measures to improve water quality during the passage of the Environment Act,"" the source said. The government's Environment Bill was approved by Parliament last year, following a lengthy battle over the amount of sewage released into rivers. But Labour's shadow environment secretary Jim McMahon said the law ""allowed water firm bosses to dump raw sewage into our communities, while pocketing eye-watering bonuses amid a cost of living crisis."" He added: ""Labour is on your side and would respect our communities by cleaning up the sewage being dumped by companies in our fields, rivers, and lakes - which the Tories passed laws to allow."" Last month, the Environment Agency said the ""state of our rivers is not in the condition we want"" and ""we are still seeing too much pollution from a number of sources"". In 2021,the agency recorded,externalmore than 372,000 spill events lasting more than 2.6 million hours from storm overflows, which release untreated sewage and rainwater into the environment to ease pressure on the system. Water companies are allowed to discharge untreated sewage into rivers in exceptional circumstances - for example, during heavy rainfall. They can, however, be acting illegally if they fail to meet certain requirements, such as treating enough wastewater before overflows are released into the environment.

Dozens held in Sweden after Quran burning riotsThere have been clashes between police and people angry at a far-right group's plan to burn Qurans.Europe,"Rioting continued on Sunday in NorrkÃ¶ping More than 40 people have been arrested after violent clashes in Sweden between police and people angry at plans by a far-right group to burn copies of the Quran. Three people were injured in Norrkoping on Sunday when officers fired warning shots at rioters, police said. The violence was sparked by a series of rallies organised by the Danish-Swedish politician Rasmus Paludan. He says he has burned a copy of Islam's holy book and wants to do so again. Muslims consider the Quran the sacred word of God and view any intentional damage or show of disrespect towards it as deeply offensive. Saudi Arabia has condemned what it called the ""deliberate abuse of the holy Quran by some extremists in Sweden, and provocation and incitement against Muslims"". Iran and Iraq earlier summoned the Swedish ambassadors to lodge protests. Police broke up crowd of protesters in the RosengÃ¥rd area of Malmo on Saturday Sweden's national police chief, Anders Thornberg, said he had never seen such violent riots following Sunday's clashes in Norrkoping, which is about 160km (99 miles) south-west of Stockholm, and nearby Linkoping. The two cites also witnessed riots on Friday, along with the Stockholm suburb of Rinkeby and the western city of Orebro. On Saturday, there was a riot in the southern city of Malmo. On Monday, police said 26 police officers and 14 members of the public had been injured in the violence and that more than 20 vehicles had been damaged or destroyed. They said that around 200 people had been involved in the violence, adding they believed it was organised by networks of criminal gangs. Some of the individuals are already known to police and Sweden's security service, Sapo. Sunday's violence in Norrkoping came after Rasmus Paludan said he planned to hold a rally there. However, he never showed up in the city. In a statement posted by his far-right, anti-immigrant Stram Kurs (Hard Line) party, Paludan said he cancelled the rally because Swedish authorities had ""shown that they are completely incapable of protecting themselves and me"". He had earlier appeared on Thursday in the central city of Jonkoping, but as he talked into a megaphone while holding a Quran, his words were drowned out by a priest ringing the bells of a local church in protest. Protests against plans by Stram Kurs to burn the Quran have turned violent in Sweden before. In 2020, protesters set cars on fire and shop fronts were damaged in clashes in MalmÃ¶. Paludan represented Stram Kurs party in the last Danish elections in 2019, where it received 1.8 % of the vote, failing to win a seat. In 2020, he was jailed in Denmark for a month for a string of offences including racism. He plans to stand in Swedish elections in September, but he reportedly does not yet have the necessary number of signatures to secure his candidature.

China reports first Covid deaths in Shanghai,"Three elderly people were reported to have died in the latest outbreak in Shanghai China has reported the deaths of three people from Covid in Shanghai for the first time since the financial hub entered lockdown in late March. A release from the city health commission said the victims were aged between 89 and 91 and unvaccinated. Shanghai officials said only 38% of residents over 60 are fully vaccinated. The city is now due to enter another round of mass testing, which means a strict lockdown will continue into a fourth week for most residents. Until now, China had maintained that no-one died of Covid in the city - a claim that hasincreasingly come into question. Monday's deaths were also  the first Covid-linked fatalities to be officially acknowledged by authorities in the entire country since March 2020. The timing of this announcement is odd. Firstly because, up to this point, it was a miraculous stretch of credulity to think that no-one in a city of almost 25 million people had succumbed to this wave of the virus. But second, and more importantly, we know that people HAVE already died after contracting Covid in this outbreak. We have reported that. It happened to dozens of elderly patients at a single hospital in Shanghai. But they were not official Covid deaths, according to the authorities. They died of underlying problems, apparently. So what's changed? The answer is nothing seems to have changed in terms of clinical assessments. People with underlying health problems died after testing positive but the death rate remained at zero. Now three people have died in very similar circumstances but the official death toll has increased. It's fair to ask - is this because the authorities have decided they need to make public the dangers of this vast wave of a virus against which barely half of China's over 60's are fully vaccinated? Because up to now this was a virus that Shanghai's authorities had warned could devastate the population - otherwise why else would they lock down the city - yet it hadn't officially killed anyone. In a statement announcing the deaths, Shanghai's Health Commission said that the three people died in hospital on Sunday despite ""full efforts to resuscitate them"". It added that all three people had underlying health conditions. Since the discovery of an Omicron-led outbreak three weeks ago, the city has been under strict lockdown, which has angered residents. Millions have been confined to their homes, with anyone testing positive being sent to quarantine centres. In recent weeks many havetaken to social mediato complain about the restrictions and the lack of food supplies. Omicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on? The economic cost of China's zero-Covid policy People have had to order in food and water and wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs, and analysts say many are running low on supplies. The lockdown extension has overwhelmed delivery services, grocery shop websites and even the distribution of government supplies. But with more than 20,000 new cases a day, authorities are struggling. The city in recent weeks has converted exhibition halls and schools into quarantine centres, and set up makeshift hospitals. The recent surge in cases in China, although small compared to some countries, is a significant challenge to China's ""zero-Covid"" strategy, which uses swift lockdowns and aggressive restrictions to contain any outbreak. The policy sets China apart from most other countries which are trying to live with the virus. But the increased transmissibility and milder nature of the Omicron variant has led to questions over whether the current strategy is sustainable in the long run.
