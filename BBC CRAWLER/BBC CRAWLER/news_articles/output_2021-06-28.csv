"Boy stabbed to death in ambush plan, court told","Olly Stephens was stabbed to death in Emmer Green in Reading A 13-year-old was ""lured"" to a park by a girl and ""ambushed"" by two teenage boys who stabbed him and left him to die, a court has heard. Oliver Stephens, known as Olly, was pronounced dead at Bugs Bottom fields in Emmer Green, Reading, on 3 January. Olly believed he was meeting a girl on her own, but two boys were lying in wait, Reading Crown Court heard. Two boys, both 14, deny murder. A girl, also 14, and one of the boys, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter. Olly was pronounced dead at Bug Bottom fields near his home in Emmer Green Opening the case for the prosecution, Alison Morgan QC said the defendants were ""motivated by perceived grievances"" against Olly. The barrister said he was ""lured"" to the fields by the girl as part of a plan devised in the days before the attack with the two boys. ""Olly was then ambushed by the defendants,"" said Ms Morgan, adding that he was stabbed in the chest and back. ""He was physically attacked by [the two boys], with [the girl] standing nearby lending assistance by her presence."" Ms Morgan said that this was ""not some kind of consensual fight"" but a planned attack in which Olly was ""vulnerable"". She told the court the defendants then fled the scene, deleted incriminating messages from their phones, and disposed of the clothes they were wearing. Jurors were told the defendants had shared several messages on Snapchat in the days leading up to Olly's death that demonstrated hostility towards him. These included a series of voice notes, in which one of the boys said: ""I actually hate the kid with a passion, like if I was to see him right now I'll probably end up killing him or something."" Other messages referenced the possession, handling and use of knives, the prosecutor said. The court heard that another girl who was asked to be part of the ""set up"" expressed concerns, and said she did not want to be part of a ""murder team"". ""Nah, it's not a murder,"" one of the boys on trial allegedly responded. The trial continues. Follow BBC South onFacebook,external,Twitter,external, orInstagram,external.

Murray survives wobble on SW19 return,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2021: Andy Murray through to second round after beating Nikoloz Basilashvili Wimbledon 2021 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:28 June-11 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Full detailshere Andy Murray recomposed himself to ensure his Wimbledon singles return ended with a dramatic four-set victory over 24th seed Nikoloz Basilashvili. In his first singles match in SW19 since 2017, the two-time champion led 6-4 6-3 5-0 against the Georgian. The Briton could not convert two match points and wobbled as Basilashvili, 29, fought back to force a fourth set. After a break to shut the Centre Court roof, Murray returned reinvigorated to win 6-4 6-3 5-7 6-3 under the lights. There was still more tension at the end of the fourth set, though. Murray was unable to take a third match point when Basilashvili nailed a forehand winner down the line, but clinched victory with the fourth when his opponent hit into the net. The majority of the home fans leapt to their feet, with a relieved Murray coolly raising his arms in the air before launching into a more manic leap moments later. ""I was really disappointed I had lost the third set and had to remember what I was doing to get into the winning position. I managed to turn it back around,"" said Murray, who is now ranked 118th in the world. The Scot will have a day off playing before his second-round match on Wednesday, knowing he will play a qualifier as Germany's Oscar Otte or France's Arthur Rinderknech await him. The pair saw their match suspended at 21:00 BST because of darkness - with the deciding set delicately poised at 9-9. Murray thought he would have to retire in 2019 before surgery which involved having metal put into his hip resurrected his career When Murray limped off Centre Court following his 2017 quarter-final defeat by American Sam Querrey, few would have predicted the 2013 and 2016 champion would not play in the singles again until four years later. That has been a combination of the injury problems which led to him contemplating retirement and the championships being postponed last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. While it was not quite like the heady days of old on Centre Court, 34-year-old Murray did offer a reminder to those 7,500 allowed in - and those many more watching at home - of what they have been missing. From playing smartly, confidently and coasting towards victory, Murray suddenly clammed up and the match took an unexpected turn. As one woman overheard at the back of Centre Court - along with many more on social media - said while waiting for the fourth set: ""It wouldn't be Andy without some drama, would it?"" The mood in the half-full arena - allowed because Wimbledon is part of the Government's Event Research Programme - had been buoyant from the start. Saltire flags, Scottish rugby shirts and tartan hats became more visible as Murray stoked up the atmosphere, with the home fans erupting in celebration at the end of the opening two sets. ""It is amazing to be back out here again on Centre Court. It was such a brilliant atmosphere, I have really missed playing in front of fans,"" Murray said. That joviality continued as he raced away with the third - until tension kicked in when victory loomed. Murray had served well until the latter part of the third set, where he was broken four times and saw his first-serve percentage drop to 47% The enforced break came at a good time for Murray and, watched on throughout by wife Kim and mum Judy, came out reinvigorated in the fourth. Twice he broke as the pair traded the opening three service games, rediscovering his nerve to survive three more break points and then claim victory at 21:49 BST. ""I did well to win the fourth set in the end because it was not mentally easy going back into the locker room,"" he said. To huge laughter, he added: ""I went to the shower and to the toilet - it was just a number one."" Murray's performance attracted a lot of attention, leading to Twitter posts from comedian Miranda Hart, First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon and Murray's fitness coach Matt Little which encapsulated the evening's entertainment.

Womad festival cancelled amid Covid-19 uncertainty,"Womad was last held in 2019 - the 2020 event was cancelled due to the pandemic The Womad music festival has been cancelled ""to guarantee its survival"", co-founder Peter Gabriel has announced. Earlier this month, the former Genesis singer warned that the three-day event might not go ahead without government-backed insurance or test event status. Confirming the cancellation, he said waiting for either would ""put Womad's long-term future at risk"". The government said it was working towards live events being able to reopen fully from 19 July. In a statement, Gabriel said the decision to cancel his world music festival, which was launched almost 40 years ago and attracts about 40,000 people each year, was made ""with great regret"". ""We feel that our audience, artists, staff, and contractors, who have been amazingly supportive throughout all this, will understand the need for us to act to guarantee our survival,"" he wrote. Festivals face 'lost summer' without safety net How one music festival is going ahead this weekend Festivals 2021: Which ones are still taking place? Reopening delay a hammer blow - live event sector There had been no clarity as to whether restrictions would be lifted on 19 July - three days before Womad was due to be held at Charlton Park, Wiltshire - despite several attempts to seek information, he said. Gabriel said the decision to granttest event statusto some festivals due to be held on the same 22-25 July weekend as Womad ""clearly implies that only approved test events will be protected and guaranteed the right to go ahead as normal - even though this flies in the face of the Prime Minister's statements"". Singer and co-founder Peter Gabriel said there was a lack of clarity from the government ""We have not been asking for financial support; all we have wanted is certainty in the form of insurance against cancellation (that we'd be happy to pay for),"" he wrote. ""We need an understanding of the realities of how our industry works and the benefits that we bring. ""The industry should see equal access to support and a much less opaque way of deciding who gets help."" Mass events are currently scheduled to be allowed to take place from July 19 when coronavirus restrictions ease. The music and arts festivals features bands from across the world - this is Lindigo performing in 2019 A Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson said it was working towards ""live events being able to reopen fully from the 19th July as well as providing unprecedented support for the culture sector"". ""Womad has benefited from almost Â£250,000 of taxpayer help through our Culture Recovery Fund, alongside a range of other music festivals,"" they said. ""We understand the challenges live events have in securing indemnity cover and are exploring what further support may be required once the sector is able to reopen.

US judge throws out Facebook anti-trust lawsuits,"The stock market value of Facebook has topped $1 trillion for the first time after the tech giant won a court victory against US regulators. A federal court dismissed two lawsuits, from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a coalition of states, sending Facebook shares up 4.2%. It took the value of Facebook above $1tn, making it the last of the ""big five"" tech firms to hit the milestone. The legal actions had accused Facebook of stifling competition. But Judge James Boasberg ruled that the FTC's anti-trust complaint against the social networking giant was too vague. Another separate anti-competition lawsuit filed by a group of 46 states was thrown out because the alleged violations occurred too long ago. In theUS District Court for the District of Columbia ruling,external, Judge Boasberg wrote that the FTC's complaint was ""legally insufficient"" and had to be dismissed, because the FTC had ""failed to plead enough facts"" to back up its claim that Facebook was stifling competition. Facebook asks judge to reject anti-trust lawsuit Facebook facing US legal action over competition Facebook faces fresh anti-trust investigation The FTC's lawsuit had requested that the technology giant, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, be broken up. ""The FTC's complaint says almost nothing concrete on the key question of how much power Facebook actually had, and still has, in a properly defined anti-trust product market,"" wrote Judge Boasberg. ""It is almost as if the agency expects the court to simply nod to the conventional wisdom that Facebook is a monopolist."" While this is a setback for the FTC that some analysts say could have repercussions for the future of anti-competition law in the US, the watchdog can re-file the charges and has until 28 July to do so. However, investors saw it as an important victory for Facebook, sending the share price higher. The values of the other tech giants - Apple, Google-owner Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon - have already topped $1tn. Separately, Judge Boasberg also dismissed an anti-competition lawsuit brought by a coalition of 45 US states together with the FTC. This lawsuit had also sought to force Facebook to divest Instagram and WhatsApp. It related to Facebook's acquisition of the two apps in 2012 and 2014. Facebook previously described the FTC's complaint as 'nonsensical' In March, Facebook petitioned the federal court in the US to dismiss them, describing the FTC complaint as ""nonsensical"". The firm said the FTC's case ""ignores the reality of the dynamic, intensely competitive high-tech industry in which Facebook operates"". In his ruling,externalon this case, Judge Boasberg said that the states did not provide ""a reasonable justification"" for why they had waited between six to eight years to decide to sue Facebook - an argument the social networking giant previously made. He added that the states had failed to provide ""a factual dispute"" and only gave a ""half-hearted contention that Facebook was not prejudiced but rather 'benefitted from the states not filing sooner', since it has been and remains a very profitable company"". ""Ultimately, this anti-trust action is premised on public, high-profile conduct, nearly all of which occurred over six years ago - before the launch of the Apple Watch or Alexa or Periscope, when Kevin Durant still played for the Oklahoma City Thunder and when Ebola was the virus dominating headlines,"" wrote Judge Boasberg. He added that the states' allegations made it clear that the lawsuit could easily have been filed between 2012 and 2014: ""The system of anti-trust enforcement that Congress has established does not exempt plaintiffs here from 'the consequences of [their] choice' to do nothing over the last half decade.

"PM ignoring Wales' parliament, Mark Drakeford saysThe first minister warns the union may break up if the UK government does not change strategy.Wales politics","First Minister Mark Drakeford accused Boris Johnson of ""aggressively"" ignoring Wales' government and parliament Mark Drakeford has accused Boris Johnson's government of ""aggressively"" ignoring Wales' government and parliament. The first minister has published a report on reforming the ""fragile"" union between the four UK nations. It calls for a partnership between governments, but says relations have recently deteriorated. UK ministers said focusing on constitutional issues was an ""irresponsible"" distraction from Covid. Mr Drakeford said there was an urgent need for change because ""the union has never been this fragile"". The report came asWelsh ministers were granted permission to appealafter their legal challenge to a post-Brexit UK trade law was blocked. The union between the four nations of the UK is ""fragile"", the first minister says ""If matters continue in their current vein the case for the break-up of the UK will only increase,"" the first minister said. ""Too often we see the UK government act in an aggressively unilateral way, claiming to act on behalf of the whole UK, but without regard for the status of the nations and the democratic mandates of their governments."" 'Put politics aside' for Wales' Covid recovery What is devolution and how does it work across the UK? The Labour first minister, an opponent of independence, wants more powers for the Welsh Parliament, including over the justice system. His report says Westminster should allow Wales and Scotland to hold referendums on independence if their devolved parliaments want to, but adds ""it would be unreasonable for such referendums to be held too frequently"". The first minister called for justice powers for the Welsh parliament and government Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland should continue to be represented in the House of Commons, the report says, but the membership of the House of Lords should also reflect the make-up of the UK. Funding for the devolved nations should be based on their needs, it says, and the UK government should get consent from Cardiff if it wants to pay for certain things in Wales. It follows a row over replacing EU funding to Wales, with UK government ministers acquiring new powers to fund things that arenormally controlled by the Welsh government. The UK government said the public wanted both administrations to work together In a statement, the UK government said people wanted both administrations to work together ""and our full focus must remain on recovering from the challenges the pandemic has created"". ""Choosing to prioritise constitutional issues in the middle of a pandemic is an irresponsible and unwanted distraction,"" it said. Responding to accusations that UK-wide schemes such as the levelling-up fund undermined devolution, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""What we're trying to do with more visibility and vigour - I'm very proud of the fact - is we are trying to get more money into Wales, more investment into Wales, more jobs into Wales."" On the subject of the union, Mr Hart added: ""For most people it's the comforting knowledge that we are part of a big, historic combination of strengths, and that on balance that it's a force for good,"" pointing to the Covid vaccination programme as an example. Plaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said the UK was ""failing utterly to deliver economic and social justice for the people of Wales"". ""The only way of achieving this is by putting Wales's future in Wales's hands, free from Westminster's chaos and incompetence. It's why support for independence is at an all-time high, and growing,"" he said.

Covid rules ease for weddings and funerals,"Covid restrictions for weddings have eased in Scotland, with live entertainment allowed and suppliers no longer part of the limit on guests. A person walking the bride or groom down the aisle will also no longer need to wear face a covering. Funeral guidance has also been revised to allow people from more than one household to carry a coffin. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said these were ""minor, but important changes"" towards returning to normal. It had previously been hoped that Scotland could move to the lowest level of Covid restrictions, level zero, on 28 June. Scotland aiming to lift all Covid rules by 9 August What Covid rules are changing, and when? But last week Ms Sturgeon said current levels would remain in force until 19 July. Lockdown easing was paused for three weeks to allow more time for people to be vaccinated. She said the easing of wedding and funeral rules are expected to have a ""relatively minor impact on transmission"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""I hope they will make some difference to those organising and attending weddings and funerals, ahead of the more substantial changes at level zero."" People from more than one household are now allowed to carry a coffin at funerals The current maximum number for attending weddings is 200 guests in level zero, 100 in level one and 50 in level two areas. Live entertainment at receptions will now be allowed, however guests will still need to be seated at tables. Island communities such as Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero, with all mainland areas in level one or level two of the country's five-tier system of restrictions. Duncan McConchie, of the Scottish Wedding Alliance, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethat the changes had been ""well received"" and were having an ""immediate impact"". But Mr McConchie, who runs a venue in Dumfries and Galloway, said that with table seating rules still in place they would continue to lobby for further easing. He added: ""We will keep conversations going, we can't sit back - the industry has lost far too much already. ""We are looking for dancing and we are also looking for funding that will support us, because we know that over 40% of our industry now will not trade profitably until 2022."" Scotland is aiming to remove all of its major Covid restrictions on 9 August. The first minister said this would allow life in Scotland to return to ""almost complete normality"". Scotland recorded 2,639 new Covid cases and one further death on Sunday. The country was said to have had the highest virus rate in Europe last week. Anew online portal has also launchedto allow all adults in Scotland who have not received a Covid vaccine to self-register for their first dose. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Emily Maitlis reprimanded over Piers Morgan tweet,"Emily Maitlis failed to provide ""surrounding context"" when she shared broadcaster Piers Morgan's government criticism BBC journalist Emily Maitlis has been reprimanded for sharing a ""clearly controversial"" post on social media, the broadcaster has said. The Newsnight presenterretweeted Piers Morgan's criticism,externalof the government's response to the pandemic in February. The BBC's complaints unit said she breached editorial guidelines by failing to provide ""surrounding context"" to ensure impartiality. Morgan described the decision as ""utterly spineless"". The BBC said the complaint was lodged by a member of the public who thought Maitlis ""gave an impression of partiality in a controversial matter"". Morgan's Twitter post, shared briefly by Maitlis during the third national lockdown earlier this year, read: ""If failing to quarantine properly is punishable by 10yrs in prison, what is the punishment for failing to properly protect the country from a pandemic?"" It was removed by Maitlis 10 minutes after she posted it. The BBC's Executive Complaints Unit found that the ""retweeted material was clearly controversial, implying sharp criticism of the Government, and there was nothing in the surrounding context to make clear that Ms Maitlis was not endorsing it or to draw attention to alternative views"". It added that despite Maitlis removing the post after 10 minutes, she failed to publicly clarify that it had fallen short of editorial standards. The ruling follows a move by BBC director general Tim Davie to ensure staff uphold impartiality guidelines when using social media. Speaking after taking over the role last year, he said staff sharing their opinions online could harm the broadcaster's reputation for impartiality, which he described as a ""number one priority"" amid accusations of bias from figures across the political spectrum. Last year the BBC deemed that an introduction to a Newsnight programme, in which Maitlis discussed the row over Dominic Cummings' trip to Durham,also breached impartiality rules.

Moves to 'minimise' pupils self-isolating in Wales,"Face masks are currently required to be used in Wales' secondary schools where social distancing cannot be maintained Wales' education minister says he wants to minimise the number of children having to self-isolate from schools. Jeremy Miles told a press conference he wanted to make sure a ""disproportionate"" number of pupils were not having to self-isolate. Councils in north-east Wales have told BBC Walesthousands of children are staying away from classes. But a head teachers' union said it was ""utterly confused"" by Mr Miles' comments. School inspections in Wales off until 2022 When will Covid measures be relaxed in schools? Mr Miles also said it would be up to individual schools, colleges and universities to decide their own Covid-safety rules in future - such as on social distancing, face masks and testing. It does not mean the safety measures - which are currently subject to national guidance - will be totally scrapped. But the minister said he wanted them to ""gradually ease"", with schools running as normal as possible in the autumn. The latest three-day rolling number of cases across schools in north Wales is at an average of 26 new cases a day - higher than at the peak of the second Covid wave in December. It compares with just eight cases a day in the Swansea Bay health board area, and less than one case a day on average across Powys. Groups of children, called bubbles, have been told to isolate when cases have been identified in their schools. That can involve entire year groups having to stay home. Mr Miles said the Welsh government would be looking at ""best practice across Wales to ensure that there we do not have a disproportionate number of learners self-isolating"". ""While class or year bubbles have played an important role over the last year, we need to ensure that settings distinguish between bubbles on the one hand, and personal contact with cases on the other,"" he said. Mr Miles said he wanted to make sure schools were not treating the individual contacts of a positive Covid-19 case and entire school bubbles the same way, ""because they are importantly very separate"". He said schools would be helped to minimise the numbers having to self-isolate, using contact tracing. Mr Miles acknowledged that in parts of north Wales cases were ""increasing"" - but he said it was not ""inevitable"" that more coronavirus cases would have an impact on schools there in the final three weeks of term. Jeremy Miles was appointed education minister in the Welsh government cabinet reshuffle ""While we will not simply be back to normal by September, we will look to gradually ease the extraordinary measures we've had to put in place,"" Mr Miles told the press conference. ""Our guiding principle has to be a move towards education being enabled to operate as normally as possible in the autumn. ""Currently, all education settings follow national guidance. However, as we move through the pandemic there will be a need to move to a more localised approach, rather than a blanket approach,"" he added. Eithne Hughes, director of Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: ""It appears from the education minister's statement that he suspects some schools in Wales are guilty of sending home large numbers of young people to self-isolate unnecessarily. ""The very last thing any school leader wants to do is to now have learners lose any more time in the classroom following the significant disruption to education they have experienced over the course of the last 16 months."" Laura Doel of the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru Laura Doel said: ""Whilst we all went to see an end to restrictions on social distancing in schools as soon as possible, the plan to do away with 'class bubbles' but retain a requirement for schools to identify close contacts of pupils is impractical,"" she said. She added: ""The proposals, with all the unintended consequences, have the potential to be hugely disruptive. ""We are utterly confused by the minister's statement, which we think could actually increase the number of close contacts rather than reduce them."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said: ""We can't afford for whole communities to be left behind thanks to a postcode lottery in education provision, and Labour ministers need to show leadership on this issue, and not pass the buck and responsibility for decision-making on to staff and schools that are already under enormous pressure."" Plaid Cymru's Sian Gwenllian it was ""crucial that the government is absolutely transparent with the public and provides a full picture on how quickly the virus is spreading in our classrooms and what measures they are putting in place - such as increased ventilation and vaccinations for young people - to curb the spread."" Keith Maher, head teacher of Pen y Dre High School, Merthyr Tydfil, said while he was looking forward to seeing an easing of restrictions he did not want to do anything that would ""take us back a step"". Speaking before Mr Miles' press conference, he said schools had adapted well to the ""unique experience"" and he was ""quietly satisfied"" with the way it had gone. Looking towards the autumn term, he said he wanted to see ""opening up slowly, surely, gradually in a measured way to make sure our children don't miss out on the fun of being young"". ""What we are looking for is clarity of information, a shared understanding of what the new term will look like but hopefully moving towards further easing back on risk assessments."" Sam says he is happy to have restrictions in place if it means he can stay in school Sam, 15, is in Year 10 at Pen y Dre High School and said he did not mind Covid measures if it meant in-person teaching could take place. ""We are grateful because online learning wasn't quite one-to-one, but now teachers are making it better to get back to normality so any measure we need to take is fine with me."" He thought being able to go to school without face masks next term could boost morale but was happy for other measures to stay in place. Gracie says she hopes she will not have to wear a mask in future Gracie, 12, went up to Year 7 while restrictions were in place which were not required in primary schools. She said she had got used to it - but some measures had made it harder to make friends and children missed out on more practical lessons such as drama. ""I really enjoy school at the moment but if it went down to 1m instead of 2m distance I could make more friends and be more comfortable,"" she said.

"PM ignoring Wales' parliament, Mark Drakeford says","First Minister Mark Drakeford accused Boris Johnson of ""aggressively"" ignoring Wales' government and parliament Mark Drakeford has accused Boris Johnson's government of ""aggressively"" ignoring Wales' government and parliament. The first minister has published a report on reforming the ""fragile"" union between the four UK nations. It calls for a partnership between governments, but says relations have recently deteriorated. UK ministers said focusing on constitutional issues was an ""irresponsible"" distraction from Covid. Mr Drakeford said there was an urgent need for change because ""the union has never been this fragile"". The report came asWelsh ministers were granted permission to appealafter their legal challenge to a post-Brexit UK trade law was blocked. The union between the four nations of the UK is ""fragile"", the first minister says ""If matters continue in their current vein the case for the break-up of the UK will only increase,"" the first minister said. ""Too often we see the UK government act in an aggressively unilateral way, claiming to act on behalf of the whole UK, but without regard for the status of the nations and the democratic mandates of their governments."" 'Put politics aside' for Wales' Covid recovery What is devolution and how does it work across the UK? The Labour first minister, an opponent of independence, wants more powers for the Welsh Parliament, including over the justice system. His report says Westminster should allow Wales and Scotland to hold referendums on independence if their devolved parliaments want to, but adds ""it would be unreasonable for such referendums to be held too frequently"". The first minister called for justice powers for the Welsh parliament and government Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland should continue to be represented in the House of Commons, the report says, but the membership of the House of Lords should also reflect the make-up of the UK. Funding for the devolved nations should be based on their needs, it says, and the UK government should get consent from Cardiff if it wants to pay for certain things in Wales. It follows a row over replacing EU funding to Wales, with UK government ministers acquiring new powers to fund things that arenormally controlled by the Welsh government. The UK government said the public wanted both administrations to work together In a statement, the UK government said people wanted both administrations to work together ""and our full focus must remain on recovering from the challenges the pandemic has created"". ""Choosing to prioritise constitutional issues in the middle of a pandemic is an irresponsible and unwanted distraction,"" it said. Responding to accusations that UK-wide schemes such as the levelling-up fund undermined devolution, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""What we're trying to do with more visibility and vigour - I'm very proud of the fact - is we are trying to get more money into Wales, more investment into Wales, more jobs into Wales."" On the subject of the union, Mr Hart added: ""For most people it's the comforting knowledge that we are part of a big, historic combination of strengths, and that on balance that it's a force for good,"" pointing to the Covid vaccination programme as an example. Plaid Cymru deputy leader Rhun ap Iorwerth said the UK was ""failing utterly to deliver economic and social justice for the people of Wales"". ""The only way of achieving this is by putting Wales's future in Wales's hands, free from Westminster's chaos and incompetence. It's why support for independence is at an all-time high, and growing,"" he said.

Earlier this month, the former Genesis singer warned that the three-day event might not go ahead without government-backed insurance or test event status. Confirming the cancellation, he said waiting for either would ""put Womad's long-term future at risk"". The government said it was working towards live events being able to reopen fully from 19 July. In a statement, Gabriel said the decision to cancel his world music festival, which was launched almost 40 years ago and attracts about 40,000 people each year, was made ""with great regret"".

Spain beat Croatia in eight-goal thrillerSpain reach the quarter-finals of Euro 2020 in dramatic fashion as they beat Croatia in extra time after an eight-goal thriller.,"This video can not be played Euro 2020 Croatia v Spain: Spain into quarter-finals after thriller Spain reached the quarter-finals of Euro 2020 in dramatic fashion by beating Croatia in extra time after an eight-goal thriller. Luis Enrique's side were rocked when Croatia substitutes Mislav Orsic and Mario Pasalic scored twice in the final five minutes to come back from 3-1 down and force extra time, but Spain rallied as the added 30 minutes produced yet more drama. Striker Alvaro Morata, who revealed before the match that hisfamily have been threatenedduring the tournament as a result of his performances, silenced his critics when he thumped in Spain's fourth goal in extra time in Copenhagen. The scoring did not end there as Mikel Oyarzabal added a fifth goal three minutes later to finally see off Croatia, who had fought bravely in this highly entertaining last-16 tie. In a hint of what was to come, 20 minutes into the game goalkeeper Unai Simon failed to control Pedri's 49-yard back pass, presenting Croatia with the lead. That bizarre own goal sparked a response from Spain though, with Pablo Sarabia thumping in an equaliser, Cesar Azpilicueta heading in another and Ferran Torres making it 3-1. This video can not be played All the goals in 90 seconds as Spain and Croatia share eight in Euro 2020 goalfest Spain looked comfortable and poised to cruise through but Croatia burst into action through their substitutes late on to force added time. The thrilling moments continued as Simon made up for his earlier error with a heroic stop from close range to deny Andrej Kramaric before Morata went up the other end to crucially put Spain ahead again. It was the most entertaining match of the tournament to date and three-time champions Spain will face Switzerland - after they beat France in another brilliant match - in the quarter-finals. Redemption for Simon after own goal Euro 2020 last-16 & quarter-final guide This video can not be played 'A terrible mistake!' - Spain goalkeeper Simon's howler puts Croatia ahead Spain became the first side in European Championship history to score five or more goals in consecutive matches - but Morata's was the most important. The forward had missed several good chances in the tournament before this game and it looked like it would not be his night again when he failed to nod in Ferran Torres' cross early on. Two minutes later, that miss looked especially costly as Croatia took the lead - but it was Morata who the Spain players gathered to congratulate at full-time after their place in the quarter-finals was sealed thanks largely to his goal. Spain's credentials to go deep into the tournament have been enhanced by this display of character to initially bounce back from the own goal then re-gather themselves after Croatia had forced extra time. The scenes at full-time were a mixture of jubilance and relief and they will now prepare for a quarter-final with Switzerland, whoknocked out world champions Francein an extraordinary penalty shootout in Bucharest. There was nobody more relieved than keeper Simon too - he pulled off a crucial save in extra time after his huge error. This video can not be played Kramaric's shot denied by strong Simon save World Cup finalists Croatia lost at the last-16 stage for the second Euros in a row after they were beaten by eventual winners Portugal in 2016. But they did not leave without a fight. Spain were relentless for periods of the match but Croatia created a number of clear-cut chances and had they been more clinical, it could have been a different story. Nikola Vlasic smashed one into the side-netting and Kramaric was flagged offside as he snuck in behind before Spain went 3-1 up. This video can not be played Euro 2020: Mario Pasalic heads stoppage-time equaliser to make it Croatia 3-3 Spain But just as Spain looked at ease, Croatia upped the intensity, unwilling to leave the competition without making an impact. The substitutes forced extra time and Croatia could have gone ahead when Orsic fired dangerously over the bar minutes before Kramaric was denied by Simon. Those misses proved costly and Spain almost scored a sixth when Dani Olmo's curler smacked off the left post in the dying moments. Croatia were naturally dejected at full time after they could not muster another astonishing comeback - but they had left their mark on this tournament by playing their part in an epic match.

Your updates were written by Alexandra Fouche, Alex Kleiderman, Jennifer Meierhans, Kate Whannel and Mary O'Connor. This page was edited by Holly Wallis and James Clarke. We are going to be finishing our live coverage of coronavirus for the day soon so here's a recap on the latest developments:  The UK's rise in Covid cases will end ""when most children have had the infection"", says Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. He tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme that getting the infection will protect them from more severe disease as adults. He says there are four other major coronaviruses which generally infect us multiple times in our lives. ""I think that's almost certainly how this will play out. We will expect to have multiple Covid infections, most of us, for the rest of our lives,"" he says. Prof Hunter says he would be ""very uneasy"" if the isolation of whole bubbles of school children was continued after the summer holidays. He says by 19 July, when all restrictions are expected to end in England, schools will have closed for summer holidays and about two thirds of adults will have had both vaccines. ""We've got to end the restrictions and come to some sort of more equilibrium with the virus and I think 19 July is the best date for some time, and certainly before we head into winter,"" he says. ""If we leave it into the autumn, we will have higher pressure from not only Covid but a lot of the other infections that are already coming back now,"" he adds. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Elsewhere, Taiwan has today recorded its lowest number of
Covid-19 cases since 14 May. This is significant because todayâs figures are on
par with those it recorded before lockdown restrictions were introduced across the
island. In the past 24 hours, there have been 60 new confirmed
cases of Covid-19, and three further deaths. However, it must be factored in
that these are weekend figures. Level 3 restrictions were imposed in New Taipei
and Taipei City on 15 May, and were implemented nationwide on 20 May. Taiwan
has four Covid-19 response levels, and level 3 is where all non-essential
businesses are ordered to close, and mask-wearing is mandatory. Over the past month,
Taiwan has experienced a severe wave of Covid-19.It was hailed as a success story in 2020as it consistently saw single digit or zero cases throughout the
year, while much of the world struggled to combat outbreaks. It is widely believed that this wave began as a
result of cabin crew being able to quarantine for a shorter period than regular
travellers. The earliest cases were airline staff at an airport hotel. Today,the Taipei Times says,externalthe Control Yuan, the government's investigative agency, plans to
question Taiwanâs minister of health and welfare âto determine whether
administrative negligence and a lack of preparednessâ led to this outbreak  More than 50 people have been arrested after an illegal rave attended by up to 2,000 people at a national park. Under current coronavirus rules, gatherings must not exceed 30 people unless covered by a legal exemption. Sussex Police says it was met with ""significant hostility"" as itshut down the event in Steyning, on the South Downs in West Sussex, yesterday. One officer was assaulted and another was treated for a suspected broken arm after a crash at the scene. The force described it as ""one of the largest unplanned operations we have experienced in recent years"". Those arrested were taken into custody on suspicion of offences including drink and drug-driving, possession of drugs and theft. We've got more on this story here. Here's the moment Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs he saw no reason to go beyond 19 July with coronavirus restrictions. This video can not be played The scientist leading a study into mixing Covid vaccines says itâs âreassuringâ that âwe have those options nowâ. The Com-Cov trial has found that combining doses of Pfizer and AstraZenecagives good protection. Speaking to BBC Radio 4âs PM programme, lead investigator Prof Matthew Snape says: âIf you did have a problem with supply, then you could switch over to use the other vaccine to give the second dose.â âItâs all about having options... Itâs reassuring that actually the different combinations... generated antibodies and T-cells that were above [the] threshold.â Dr Snape - who is associate professor in general paediatrics and vaccinology at the University of Oxford - says ""itâs better off sticking to the schedules where we have proven effectivenessâ. ""But if there were to be particular circumstances that dictated you might want to change, mix-and-match, we have those options now. For example, if there was a problem in vaccine supply or a change in the use of the vaccines in different age groups.â Meanwhile, schools in Wales are to decide their own Covid-safety measuresunder new plans from the Welsh government. Education Minister Jeremy Miles says the new system will allow measures such as social distancing, face masks and testing to be dropped or reinstated. It does not mean the measures - which are currently imposed nationally - will be totally scrapped. But Miles says he wants them to ""gradually ease"", with schools running as normal as possible in the autumn. The education minister has told a press conference schools will be able to make the decisions based on advice from local incident management teams. Currently, face masks are required to be used in secondary schools where social distancing cannot be maintained, with exceptions at meal times and when pupils are outside. Twice-a-week testing has been available to schools since last February. Schools were reopened fully after last Easter, after they were closed due to the second wave of coronavirus in the winter. It comes as coronavirus cases in Wales continue to rise, withsignificant differences between some parts of the country. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has finished addressing the House of Commons for today - answering a total of 31 questions from MPs in an hour. Conservative Mark Harper asks Javid to rule out introducing restrictions in winter and autumn ""as a mechanism for managing Covid"". The health secretary says he is happy to discuss the issue in more detail. He adds that he wants to ""remove all restrictions as quickly as possible"". Dr Ben Spencer MP asks if Sajid Javid shares his concerns about the coming winter when it is predicted ""there may be an increase in Covid hospitalisations superimposed on normal NHS winter pressures"". He asks if plans are being made to support the NHS in what could be a ""very difficult winter indeed"". Javid says he can ""absolutely confirm to him that plans are being put in place"" and that a huge amount of work has been done by outgoing health secretary Matt Hancock which he will continue. Javid adds that in due course he will come to the Commons and set out the plans. Labour's Richard Burgon says that during his year away from the front bench, the new health secretary has been ""very busy indeed lining his own pockets"" with second and third jobs. Meanwhile, he says, NHS staff have been working harder than ever getting our communities through this Covid crisis. Burgon says: ""Given that the secretary of state has done very well out of the last year bagging hundreds of thousands of pounds during a national crisis, wouldn't it be the height of hypocrisy for the new health secretary to refuse our NHS staff the pay rise they so clearly deserve?"" Savid Javid replies with one line: ""The honourable gentleman is going to have to try a lot harder than that."" Huw Merriman, the Conservative MP for Bexhill and Battle, asks about how the 19 July will affect international travel, including whether people who are double vaccinated will be allowed to go on holiday to amber list countries. Javid replies that the 19 July date will be focused on domestic restrictions, but points out that the government ""takes seriously"" the border rules and traffic light system, and that it is subject to regular review. He adds that he will sit down with the transport secretary as soon he can to discuss the situation. Conservative MP Jason McCartney raises the issue of parents and guardians having to look after school children who are isolating ""sometimes for the third or fourth time"". He says it is having a huge impact on education and mental health and calls for a new approach to self-isolation. Javid says he has asked for ""fresh advice to see if there is anything more we can do"". He says a pilot is under way to ascertain whether ""tests can be used in lieu of isolation"". ""I want to see if we can go further,"" he adds.  Greg Clark MP says Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, who he describes as one of the heroes of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, told his committee that new variants were likely to infect even the vaccinated. But, he adds, Prof Pollard believes that if high protection against hospitalisation continues, despite the spread of cases in the community, the public health crisis will be over. He asks Sajid Javid what he will do to inform the public that we must move from being concerned about the number of cases to the risk of hospitalisation. Javid says Clark makes a crucial point, saying cases are not unimportant but because we have the vaccine it will break the link between case numbers and hospitalisations. He says we are starting to see that and indications are very positive on this. Liam Fox, the Conservative MP for North Somerset, asks if the government is following the data rather than dates in unlocking Covid restrictions in England, adding: ""We need to understand much better how the government are reaching decisions."" Javid replies that he saw the data in the department ""for the first time yesterday"", adding: ""The very detail it provides, how granular it is, and I have to say, I was very impressed with that data, so I can give you the assurance that the government is looking at the data and absolutely taking that into account"". He adds that he would like to see ministers share as much of that data as possible, ""so others can benefit from that"" and the department was looking at ways to do that. Labour's Nav Mishra asks what is being done to tackle the cancer backlog. Javid insists that the cancer backlog is ""a top priority"". ""Many of the so-called 'missing patients' are coming forward, urgent referrals are rising - and that is what we all want to see,"" he adds. Theo Clarke, the Conservative MP for Stafford, says some services, such as maternity services, were temporarily suspended at Stafford's county hospital during the pandemic, and asks the health secretary whether he agrees they should be resumed as soon as possible. Javid says services were ""understandably"" suspended to deal with the pandemic, but that it was ""important"" that as we return to normality, so too do the services that we all rely on. He offers to set up a meeting between Clarke and one of his ministers to discuss further. SNP MP Marion Fellows asks the health secretary if he will deliver a pay rise to NHS staff in England. She also asks if he will ensure devolved nations get more money to support NHS staff. Javid repeats his earlier assertion that the government will ""make sure there is a fair pay settlement"". Clive Betts MP says the National Audit Office's report on NHS Test and Trace is ""hardly complimentary"". Directors of public health are still waiting for up-to-date data to deal with local outbreaks, he says. He asks Sajid Javid to commit to ensuring directors of public health are fully involved in the new model for testing and tracing that will be undertaken from July of this year. Javid says he will take a closer look at the report and he will write to him. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Javid replies that the 19 July date will be focused on domestic restrictions, but points out that the government ""takes seriously"" the border rules and traffic light system, and that it is subject to regular review. He adds that he will sit down with the transport secretary as soon he can to discuss the situation. Conservative MP Jason McCartney raises the issue of parents and guardians having to look after school children who are isolating ""sometimes for the third or fourth time"". He says it is having a huge impact on education and mental health and calls for a new approach to self-isolation. Javid says he has asked for ""fresh advice to see if there is anything more we can do"". He says a pilot is under way to ascertain whether ""tests can be used in lieu of isolation"". ""I want to see if we can go further,"" he adds.  Greg Clark MP says Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, who he describes as one of the heroes of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, told his committee that new variants were likely to infect even the vaccinated. But, he adds, Prof Pollard believes that if high protection against hospitalisation continues, despite the spread of cases in the community, the public health crisis will be over. He asks Sajid Javid what he will do to inform the public that we must move from being concerned about the number of cases to the risk of hospitalisation. Javid says Clark makes a crucial point, saying cases are not unimportant but because we have the vaccine it will break the link between case numbers and hospitalisations. He says we are starting to see that and indications are very positive on this. Liam Fox, the Conservative MP for North Somerset, asks if the government is following the data rather than dates in unlocking Covid restrictions in England, adding: ""We need to understand much better how the government are reaching decisions."" Javid replies that he saw the data in the department ""for the first time yesterday"", adding: ""The very detail it provides, how granular it is, and I have to say, I was very impressed with that data, so I can give you the assurance that the government is looking at the data and absolutely taking that into account"". He adds that he would like to see ministers share as much of that data as possible, ""so others can benefit from that"" and the department was looking at ways to do that. Labour's Nav Mishra asks what is being done to tackle the cancer backlog. Javid insists that the cancer backlog is ""a top priority"". ""Many of the so-called 'missing patients' are coming forward, urgent referrals are rising - and that is what we all want to see,"" he adds. Theo Clarke, the Conservative MP for Stafford, says some services, such as maternity services, were temporarily suspended at Stafford's county hospital during the pandemic, and asks the health secretary whether he agrees they should be resumed as soon as possible. Javid says services were ""understandably"" suspended to deal with the pandemic, but that it was ""important"" that as we return to normality, so too do the services that we all rely on. He offers to set up a meeting between Clarke and one of his ministers to discuss further. SNP MP Marion Fellows asks the health secretary if he will deliver a pay rise to NHS staff in England. She also asks if he will ensure devolved nations get more money to support NHS staff. Javid repeats his earlier assertion that the government will ""make sure there is a fair pay settlement"". Clive Betts MP says the National Audit Office's report on NHS Test and Trace is ""hardly complimentary"". Directors of public health are still waiting for up-to-date data to deal with local outbreaks, he says. He asks Sajid Javid to commit to ensuring directors of public health are fully involved in the new model for testing and tracing that will be undertaken from July of this year. Javid says he will take a closer look at the report and he will write to him. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Easing Covid measures on 19 July very likely - PMNew Health Secretary Sajid Javid will update MPs shortly on when restrictions in England will be eased.,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We're very likely to be in a position on 19 July to say that really is the terminus"" People in England are ""very likely"" to be able to return to ""pretty much life before Covid"" on 19 July, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. It was ""sensible to stick to our plan"" of having a ""cautious but irreversible approach"" to lifting the remaining coronavirus restrictions, he added. The final stage of easing lockdown measures was previously put back by four weeks from 21 June by the PM. New Health Secretary Sajid Javid will update MPs later on the restrictions. The planned easing on 21 June was delayed amid concern over the spread of the Delta variant. When announcing the delay, the prime minister promised a review after two weeks. Meanwhile, Spain, Malta and Portugal are introducing new restrictions for travellers from the this week. Those travelling to Spain - including the Balearic Islands, which will be on the UK's green travel list from Wednesday - will need to be fully vaccinated or have a negative PCR test. Malta, which will also go on the green list, will require visitors to have had both doses of a Covid-19 jab. Travellers from the UK to mainland Portugal will be required to quarantine for 14 dayson arrival, unless they have been fully vaccinated for at least two weeks - but these rules do not apply to the islands of Madeira, which is going on the green list, or the Azores. The Hong Kong government has also announced new measures, banning all passenger flights from the UK from 1 July after adding the country to its ""extremely high risk"" group. What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? The huge NHS challenge facing Sajid Javid Javid wants return to normal 'as soon as possible' Speaking on Monday, Mr Johnson said: ""Although there are some encouraging signs and the number of deaths remains low and the number of hospitalisations remains low - though both are going up a bit - we are seeing an increase in cases. ""So we think it's sensible to stick to our plan to have a cautious but irreversible approach, use the next three weeks or so really to complete as much as we can of that vaccine rollout. ""And then with every day that goes by it's clearer to me and all our scientific advisers that we're very likely to be in a position on 19 July to say that really is the terminus, and we can go back to life as it was before Covid as far as possible."" Mr Javid's address, which will come less than 48 hours after taking the rolefollowing Matt Hancock's resignation,is expected in the House of Commons at about 17:30 BST. Mr Javid said: ""I want to see the restrictions lifted and life going back to normal as quickly as possible. That is my absolute priority. I want to see those restrictions lifted as soon as we can. ""It's going to be irreversible, there's no going back. That's why we want to be careful during that process."" This video can not be played Health Secretary Sajid Javid: ""I want to see the restrictions lifted... as quickly as possible"" He was appointed on Saturday evening shortly after Mr Hancock resigned for breaching social distancing guidance. Pressure had been building on Mr Hancock following the publication by the Sun of pictures and a video of him kissing his colleague Gina Coladangelo. The pair are both married with three children each. There's lots of talk about encouraging data. But with infection levels climbing rapidly, how can that be? The key is in the picture emerging with hospital cases and deaths. When the initial delay to step four was announced, infection rates had just started rising and government scientists were worried about what that could lead to with the vaccination programme not fully rolled out. The past few weeks have provided clarity about what we can expect. The answer can be found by comparing the start of the second wave in the autumn with what is happening now. During September and October cases were rising much as they are now. Within eight weeks that had translated to more than 1,000 hospital admissions a day. This time round there are just above 200. There is even better news with deaths. Latest estimates show fewer than one in 1,000 infections is leading to a death. At the peak of the winter wave it was one in 60. This has dramatically altered what can be considered a proportionate response to the virus - and is why a further loosening of restrictions remains on the cards. The number of new coronavirus cases across the UK has continued to rise quickly in the week since what would have been ""freedom day"". The UK has recorded 116,287 cases in the past seven days - a 70% increase on the previous week's total. A total of 22,868 cases were reported on Monday, up from 14,876 on Sunday. However,the government said,externalSunday's figure was lower than expected because of a delay to processing data, and that Monday's total would include outstanding cases. A further three deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported in the UK. There tend to be fewer deaths reported on Mondays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. In Scotland, there have beena record number of daily cases recordedwith a further 3,285 cases reported on Monday - surpassing the previous high of 2,999 from Thursday. But the government's decision on lifting measures will also take into account the progress of the UK's vaccination rollout. Latest figures show that 84.4% of adults in the UK have had their first jab and 61.9% have had their second. Some Conservative backbenchers have urged the government to ease controls quickly, saying the country must learn to live with Covid and that the early investment in providing a vaccine in huge numbers was always intended to achieve just that. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health services in England, urged Mr Javid to be a ""voice of caution"" in the cabinet over the pressures the pandemic is heaping on the NHS. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The number of cases in hospital are rising... we have to keep a careful eye on it."" Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of the NHS Providers organisation, said Mr Javid's priorities should be tackling the new surge of Covid cases, along with the ""huge spike"" in demand for emergency services and the backlog of people waiting for NHS treatment. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told Today that if levels of protection from jabs continued then the UK should be in a ""very good position"", when asked about restrictions being lifted soon. He said: ""We're looking at the data that's coming from Public Health England about the effectiveness of the vaccines and we're seeing more than 90% protection."" In Wales, the lifting of coronavirus restrictions has beenpaused,external, to be reviewed again on 15 July, whilein Scotlandit is hoped that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August. Some rules inNorthern Ireland,externalwill be reviewed on 1 July. CLASSIC WIMBLEDON TRADITIONS:Do you know all five and how did they start?

LiveLiveUpdate due on England's 19 July lockdown end date3 minutes ago,"Health Secretary Sajid Javid has updated MPs on the planned ending of England's lockdown He confirms that the final stage in ending the lockdown remains 19 July Javid says: ""My task is to help return the economic and cultural life of this country"" He says that by 19 July two thirds of adults will have had both coronavirus jabs He said that while cases were rising, the number of deaths ""remains mercifully low"" ""For me 19 July is not only the end of the line but the start of an exciting new journey for our country,"" Javid tells MPs Labour has called for a probe into ministers' use of private email addresses following claims made after Matt Hancock's resignation Sydney's Delta variant outbreak grows to 128 cases, with other infections recorded in the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia AstraZeneca and Oxford University begin trials of a modified vaccine to act against the Beta variant, first identified in South Africa And a UK study has found using different brands of jab for first and second doses gives good protection against Covid Edited by James Clarke and Holly Wallis Thank you for joining us for a busy day of coronavirus news. Your updates were written by Alexandra Fouche, Alex Kleiderman, Jennifer Meierhans, Kate Whannel and Mary O'Connor. This page was edited by Holly Wallis and James Clarke. We are going to be finishing our live coverage of coronavirus for the day soon so here's a recap on the latest developments:  The UK's rise in Covid cases will end ""when most children have had the infection"", says Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. He tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme that getting the infection will protect them from more severe disease as adults. He says there are four other major coronaviruses which generally infect us multiple times in our lives. ""I think that's almost certainly how this will play out. We will expect to have multiple Covid infections, most of us, for the rest of our lives,"" he says. Prof Hunter says he would be ""very uneasy"" if the isolation of whole bubbles of school children was continued after the summer holidays. He says by 19 July, when all restrictions are expected to end in England, schools will have closed for summer holidays and about two thirds of adults will have had both vaccines. ""We've got to end the restrictions and come to some sort of more equilibrium with the virus and I think 19 July is the best date for some time, and certainly before we head into winter,"" he says. ""If we leave it into the autumn, we will have higher pressure from not only Covid but a lot of the other infections that are already coming back now,"" he adds. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Elsewhere, Taiwan has today recorded its lowest number of
Covid-19 cases since 14 May. This is significant because todayâs figures are on
par with those it recorded before lockdown restrictions were introduced across the
island. In the past 24 hours, there have been 60 new confirmed
cases of Covid-19, and three further deaths. However, it must be factored in
that these are weekend figures. Level 3 restrictions were imposed in New Taipei
and Taipei City on 15 May, and were implemented nationwide on 20 May. Taiwan
has four Covid-19 response levels, and level 3 is where all non-essential
businesses are ordered to close, and mask-wearing is mandatory. Over the past month,
Taiwan has experienced a severe wave of Covid-19.It was hailed as a success story in 2020as it consistently saw single digit or zero cases throughout the
year, while much of the world struggled to combat outbreaks. It is widely believed that this wave began as a
result of cabin crew being able to quarantine for a shorter period than regular
travellers. The earliest cases were airline staff at an airport hotel. Today,the Taipei Times says,externalthe Control Yuan, the government's investigative agency, plans to
question Taiwanâs minister of health and welfare âto determine whether
administrative negligence and a lack of preparednessâ led to this outbreak  More than 50 people have been arrested after an illegal rave attended by up to 2,000 people at a national park. Under current coronavirus rules, gatherings must not exceed 30 people unless covered by a legal exemption. Sussex Police says it was met with ""significant hostility"" as itshut down the event in Steyning, on the South Downs in West Sussex, yesterday. One officer was assaulted and another was treated for a suspected broken arm after a crash at the scene. The force described it as ""one of the largest unplanned operations we have experienced in recent years"". Those arrested were taken into custody on suspicion of offences including drink and drug-driving, possession of drugs and theft. We've got more on this story here. Here's the moment Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs he saw no reason to go beyond 19 July with coronavirus restrictions. This video can not be played The scientist leading a study into mixing Covid vaccines says itâs âreassuringâ that âwe have those options nowâ. The Com-Cov trial has found that combining doses of Pfizer and AstraZenecagives good protection. Speaking to BBC Radio 4âs PM programme, lead investigator Prof Matthew Snape says: âIf you did have a problem with supply, then you could switch over to use the other vaccine to give the second dose.â âItâs all about having options... Itâs reassuring that actually the different combinations... generated antibodies and T-cells that were above [the] threshold.â Dr Snape - who is associate professor in general paediatrics and vaccinology at the University of Oxford - says ""itâs better off sticking to the schedules where we have proven effectivenessâ. ""But if there were to be particular circumstances that dictated you might want to change, mix-and-match, we have those options now. For example, if there was a problem in vaccine supply or a change in the use of the vaccines in different age groups.â Meanwhile, schools in Wales are to decide their own Covid-safety measuresunder new plans from the Welsh government. Education Minister Jeremy Miles says the new system will allow measures such as social distancing, face masks and testing to be dropped or reinstated. It does not mean the measures - which are currently imposed nationally - will be totally scrapped. But Miles says he wants them to ""gradually ease"", with schools running as normal as possible in the autumn. The education minister has told a press conference schools will be able to make the decisions based on advice from local incident management teams. Currently, face masks are required to be used in secondary schools where social distancing cannot be maintained, with exceptions at meal times and when pupils are outside. Twice-a-week testing has been available to schools since last February. Schools were reopened fully after last Easter, after they were closed due to the second wave of coronavirus in the winter. It comes as coronavirus cases in Wales continue to rise, withsignificant differences between some parts of the country. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has finished addressing the House of Commons for today - answering a total of 31 questions from MPs in an hour. Conservative Mark Harper asks Javid to rule out introducing restrictions in winter and autumn ""as a mechanism for managing Covid"". The health secretary says he is happy to discuss the issue in more detail. He adds that he wants to ""remove all restrictions as quickly as possible"". Dr Ben Spencer MP asks if Sajid Javid shares his concerns about the coming winter when it is predicted ""there may be an increase in Covid hospitalisations superimposed on normal NHS winter pressures"". He asks if plans are being made to support the NHS in what could be a ""very difficult winter indeed"". Javid says he can ""absolutely confirm to him that plans are being put in place"" and that a huge amount of work has been done by outgoing health secretary Matt Hancock which he will continue. Javid adds that in due course he will come to the Commons and set out the plans. Labour's Richard Burgon says that during his year away from the front bench, the new health secretary has been ""very busy indeed lining his own pockets"" with second and third jobs. Meanwhile, he says, NHS staff have been working harder than ever getting our communities through this Covid crisis. Burgon says: ""Given that the secretary of state has done very well out of the last year bagging hundreds of thousands of pounds during a national crisis, wouldn't it be the height of hypocrisy for the new health secretary to refuse our NHS staff the pay rise they so clearly deserve?"" Savid Javid replies with one line: ""The honourable gentleman is going to have to try a lot harder than that."" Huw Merriman, the Conservative MP for Bexhill and Battle, asks about how the 19 July will affect international travel, including whether people who are double vaccinated will be allowed to go on holiday to amber list countries. Javid replies that the 19 July date will be focused on domestic restrictions, but points out that the government ""takes seriously"" the border rules and traffic light system, and that it is subject to regular review.

Those travelling to Spain - including the Balearic Islands, which will be on the UK's green travel list from Wednesday - will need to be fully vaccinated or have a negative PCR test. Malta, which will also go on the green list, will require visitors to have had both doses of a Covid-19 jab. Travellers from the UK to mainland Portugal will be required to quarantine for 14 dayson arrival, unless they have been fully vaccinated for at least two weeks - but these rules do not apply to the islands of Madeira, which is going on the green list, or the Azores. The Hong Kong government has also announced new measures, banning all passenger flights from the UK from 1 July after adding the country to its ""extremely high risk"" group. What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? The huge NHS challenge facing Sajid Javid Javid wants return to normal 'as soon as possible' Speaking on Monday, Mr Johnson said: ""Although there are some encouraging signs and the number of deaths remains low and the number of hospitalisations remains low - though both are going up a bit - we are seeing an increase in cases. ""So we think it's sensible to stick to our plan to have a cautious but irreversible approach, use the next three weeks or so really to complete as much as we can of that vaccine rollout. ""And then with every day that goes by it's clearer to me and all our scientific advisers that we're very likely to be in a position on 19 July to say that really is the terminus, and we can go back to life as it was before Covid as far as possible."" Mr Javid's address, which will come less than 48 hours after taking the rolefollowing Matt Hancock's resignation,is expected in the House of Commons at about 17:30 BST. Mr Javid said: ""I want to see the restrictions lifted and life going back to normal as quickly as possible. That is my absolute priority. I want to see those restrictions lifted as soon as we can. ""It's going to be irreversible, there's no going back. That's why we want to be careful during that process."" This video can not be played Health Secretary Sajid Javid: ""I want to see the restrictions lifted... as quickly as possible"" He was appointed on Saturday evening shortly after Mr Hancock resigned for breaching social distancing guidance. Pressure had been building on Mr Hancock following the publication by the Sun of pictures and a video of him kissing his colleague Gina Coladangelo. The pair are both married with three children each. There's lots of talk about encouraging data. But with infection levels climbing rapidly, how can that be? The key is in the picture emerging with hospital cases and deaths. When the initial delay to step four was announced, infection rates had just started rising and government scientists were worried about what that could lead to with the vaccination programme not fully rolled out. The past few weeks have provided clarity about what we can expect. The answer can be found by comparing the start of the second wave in the autumn with what is happening now. During September and October cases were rising much as they are now. Within eight weeks that had translated to more than 1,000 hospital admissions a day. This time round there are just above 200. There is even better news with deaths. Latest estimates show fewer than one in 1,000 infections is leading to a death. At the peak of the winter wave it was one in 60. This has dramatically altered what can be considered a proportionate response to the virus - and is why a further loosening of restrictions remains on the cards. The number of new coronavirus cases across the UK has continued to rise quickly in the week since what would have been ""freedom day"". The UK has recorded 116,287 cases in the past seven days - a 70% increase on the previous week's total. A total of 22,868 cases were reported on Monday, up from 14,876 on Sunday. However,the government said,externalSunday's figure was lower than expected because of a delay to processing data, and that Monday's total would include outstanding cases. A further three deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported in the UK. There tend to be fewer deaths reported on Mondays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. In Scotland, there have beena record number of daily cases recordedwith a further 3,285 cases reported on Monday - surpassing the previous high of 2,999 from Thursday. But the government's decision on lifting measures will also take into account the progress of the UK's vaccination rollout. Latest figures show that 84.4% of adults in the UK have had their first jab and 61.9% have had their second. Some Conservative backbenchers have urged the government to ease controls quickly, saying the country must learn to live with Covid and that the early investment in providing a vaccine in huge numbers was always intended to achieve just that. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health services in England, urged Mr Javid to be a ""voice of caution"" in the cabinet over the pressures the pandemic is heaping on the NHS. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The number of cases in hospital are rising... we have to keep a careful eye on it."" Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of the NHS Providers organisation, said Mr Javid's priorities should be tackling the new surge of Covid cases, along with the ""huge spike"" in demand for emergency services and the backlog of people waiting for NHS treatment. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told Today that if levels of protection from jabs continued then the UK should be in a ""very good position"", when asked about restrictions being lifted soon. He said: ""We're looking at the data that's coming from Public Health England about the effectiveness of the vaccines and we're seeing more than 90% protection."" In Wales, the lifting of coronavirus restrictions has beenpaused,external, to be reviewed again on 15 July, whilein Scotlandit is hoped that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August. Some rules inNorthern Ireland,externalwill be reviewed on 1 July. CLASSIC WIMBLEDON TRADITIONS:Do you know all five and how did they start?

Nissan investment to create thousands of UK jobsThe carmaker is set to announce a major expansion of battery production in Sunderland.,"Nissan is to announce a major expansion of battery production in Sunderland creating thousands of new jobs both directly and in the supply chain. The firm, which already makes the Leaf electric car in Sunderland, may also announce the launch of a brand new electric model. The government is contributing to the overall cost of the project, which is expected to cost hundreds of millions. The size of the government contribution has not been disclosed. As a person familiar with the deal put it, the government announced a ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, so it was prepared to support the transition. UK could be left behind in the electric car race Nissan 'in talks to build huge UK battery factory' Nissan furloughs hundreds of UK staff It is hoped the new plant will be producing batteries in time for 2024 when the level of UK-made components in UK-made cars is required to start increasing in line with the terms of the UK's trade deal with the European Union - where most of Nissan's Sunderland-assembled cars are sold. Industry sources expect the scale and size of the new facility may closely match that of a new facility in Douai, France recently announce by Renault - which is a major shareholder in Nissan and a partner in a global manufacturing alliance. The government is also in talks with Vauxhall to secure production of electric vehicles at its Ellesmere Port plant. The BBC understands those talks are ""going positively"" and an announcement is expected in the next few weeks. The market for electric cars is expanding rapidly. But earlier this month, influential green group Transport and Environment(T&E) said the UK risked being left behind in the race to build electric cars.

But it claimed a lack of investment by UK manufacturers meant that by the end of the decade that figure could fall to just 4%. T&E also said Nissan's expansion plans for Sunderland - which would reportedly see the plant having a capacity of 6.5 Gigawatt hours (GWh) - amounted to ""a tiny fraction of the 474GWh of production at 17 sites across Europe for which funding has already been secured"".

Easing Covid measures on 19 July very likely - PM,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We're very likely to be in a position on 19 July to say that really is the terminus"" People in England are ""very likely"" to be able to return to ""pretty much life before Covid"" on 19 July, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. It was ""sensible to stick to our plan"" of having a ""cautious but irreversible approach"" to lifting the remaining coronavirus restrictions, he added. The final stage of easing lockdown measures was previously put back by four weeks from 21 June by the PM. New Health Secretary Sajid Javid will update MPs later on the restrictions. The planned easing on 21 June was delayed amid concern over the spread of the Delta variant. When announcing the delay, the prime minister promised a review after two weeks.

Covid-safety measures in schools to be localised,"Face masks are currently required to be used in Wales' secondary schools where social distancing cannot be maintained Wales' education minister says he wants to minimise the number of children having to self-isolate from schools. Jeremy Miles told a press conference he wanted to make sure a ""disproportionate"" number of pupils were not having to self-isolate. Councils in north-east Wales have told BBC Walesthousands of children are staying away from classes. But a head teachers' union said it was ""utterly confused"" by Mr Miles' comments. School inspections in Wales off until 2022 When will Covid measures be relaxed in schools? Mr Miles also said it would be up to individual schools, colleges and universities to decide their own Covid-safety rules in future - such as on social distancing, face masks and testing. It does not mean the safety measures - which are currently subject to national guidance - will be totally scrapped. But the minister said he wanted them to ""gradually ease"", with schools running as normal as possible in the autumn. The latest three-day rolling number of cases across schools in north Wales is at an average of 26 new cases a day - higher than at the peak of the second Covid wave in December. It compares with just eight cases a day in the Swansea Bay health board area, and less than one case a day on average across Powys. Groups of children, called bubbles, have been told to isolate when cases have been identified in their schools. That can involve entire year groups having to stay home. Mr Miles said the Welsh government would be looking at ""best practice across Wales to ensure that there we do not have a disproportionate number of learners self-isolating"". ""While class or year bubbles have played an important role over the last year, we need to ensure that settings distinguish between bubbles on the one hand, and personal contact with cases on the other,"" he said. Mr Miles said he wanted to make sure schools were not treating the individual contacts of a positive Covid-19 case and entire school bubbles the same way, ""because they are importantly very separate"". He said schools would be helped to minimise the numbers having to self-isolate, using contact tracing. Mr Miles acknowledged that in parts of north Wales cases were ""increasing"" - but he said it was not ""inevitable"" that more coronavirus cases would have an impact on schools there in the final three weeks of term. Jeremy Miles was appointed education minister in the Welsh government cabinet reshuffle ""While we will not simply be back to normal by September, we will look to gradually ease the extraordinary measures we've had to put in place,"" Mr Miles told the press conference. ""Our guiding principle has to be a move towards education being enabled to operate as normally as possible in the autumn. ""Currently, all education settings follow national guidance. However, as we move through the pandemic there will be a need to move to a more localised approach, rather than a blanket approach,"" he added. Eithne Hughes, director of Association of School and College Leaders Cymru, said: ""It appears from the education minister's statement that he suspects some schools in Wales are guilty of sending home large numbers of young people to self-isolate unnecessarily. ""The very last thing any school leader wants to do is to now have learners lose any more time in the classroom following the significant disruption to education they have experienced over the course of the last 16 months."" Laura Doel of the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru Laura Doel said: ""Whilst we all went to see an end to restrictions on social distancing in schools as soon as possible, the plan to do away with 'class bubbles' but retain a requirement for schools to identify close contacts of pupils is impractical,"" she said. She added: ""The proposals, with all the unintended consequences, have the potential to be hugely disruptive. ""We are utterly confused by the minister's statement, which we think could actually increase the number of close contacts rather than reduce them."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Laura Anne Jones said: ""We can't afford for whole communities to be left behind thanks to a postcode lottery in education provision, and Labour ministers need to show leadership on this issue, and not pass the buck and responsibility for decision-making on to staff and schools that are already under enormous pressure."" Plaid Cymru's Sian Gwenllian it was ""crucial that the government is absolutely transparent with the public and provides a full picture on how quickly the virus is spreading in our classrooms and what measures they are putting in place - such as increased ventilation and vaccinations for young people - to curb the spread."" Keith Maher, head teacher of Pen y Dre High School, Merthyr Tydfil, said while he was looking forward to seeing an easing of restrictions he did not want to do anything that would ""take us back a step"". Speaking before Mr Miles' press conference, he said schools had adapted well to the ""unique experience"" and he was ""quietly satisfied"" with the way it had gone. Looking towards the autumn term, he said he wanted to see ""opening up slowly, surely, gradually in a measured way to make sure our children don't miss out on the fun of being young"". ""What we are looking for is clarity of information, a shared understanding of what the new term will look like but hopefully moving towards further easing back on risk assessments."" Sam says he is happy to have restrictions in place if it means he can stay in school Sam, 15, is in Year 10 at Pen y Dre High School and said he did not mind Covid measures if it meant in-person teaching could take place. ""We are grateful because online learning wasn't quite one-to-one, but now teachers are making it better to get back to normality so any measure we need to take is fine with me."" He thought being able to go to school without face masks next term could boost morale but was happy for other measures to stay in place. Gracie says she hopes she will not have to wear a mask in future Gracie, 12, went up to Year 7 while restrictions were in place which were not required in primary schools. She said she had got used to it - but some measures had made it harder to make friends and children missed out on more practical lessons such as drama. ""I really enjoy school at the moment but if it went down to 1m instead of 2m distance I could make more friends and be more comfortable,"" she said.

"Covid rules ease for weddings and funeralsNicola Sturgeon said these are ""minor, but important changes"" towards returning to normal in Scotland.ScotlandComments","Covid restrictions for weddings have eased in Scotland, with live entertainment allowed and suppliers no longer part of the limit on guests. A person walking the bride or groom down the aisle will also no longer need to wear face a covering. Funeral guidance has also been revised to allow people from more than one household to carry a coffin. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said these were ""minor, but important changes"" towards returning to normal. It had previously been hoped that Scotland could move to the lowest level of Covid restrictions, level zero, on 28 June. Scotland aiming to lift all Covid rules by 9 August What Covid rules are changing, and when? But last week Ms Sturgeon said current levels would remain in force until 19 July. Lockdown easing was paused for three weeks to allow more time for people to be vaccinated. She said the easing of wedding and funeral rules are expected to have a ""relatively minor impact on transmission"". Ms Sturgeon added: ""I hope they will make some difference to those organising and attending weddings and funerals, ahead of the more substantial changes at level zero."" People from more than one household are now allowed to carry a coffin at funerals The current maximum number for attending weddings is 200 guests in level zero, 100 in level one and 50 in level two areas. Live entertainment at receptions will now be allowed, however guests will still need to be seated at tables. Island communities such as Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles are already in level zero, with all mainland areas in level one or level two of the country's five-tier system of restrictions. Duncan McConchie, of the Scottish Wedding Alliance, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethat the changes had been ""well received"" and were having an ""immediate impact"". But Mr McConchie, who runs a venue in Dumfries and Galloway, said that with table seating rules still in place they would continue to lobby for further easing. He added: ""We will keep conversations going, we can't sit back - the industry has lost far too much already. ""We are looking for dancing and we are also looking for funding that will support us, because we know that over 40% of our industry now will not trade profitably until 2022."" Scotland is aiming to remove all of its major Covid restrictions on 9 August. The first minister said this would allow life in Scotland to return to ""almost complete normality"". Scotland recorded 2,639 new Covid cases and one further death on Sunday. The country was said to have had the highest virus rate in Europe last week. Anew online portal has also launchedto allow all adults in Scotland who have not received a Covid vaccine to self-register for their first dose. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Greggs' sales recovery stronger than expected,"Greggs says its sales have been stronger than anticipated in the weeks since lockdown measures were eased. The bakery chain saw a ""strong recovery"" during May after non-essential shops reopened, and although pent-up demand has tailed off, sales remain ahead of pre-pandemic levels. Car dealership Lookers also reported strong trading for the year so far. It said consumer demand was ""robust"" and it expected annual profits to be higher than previously forecast. Mark Raban, chief executive officer at Lookers, said the company's performance in the first six months of the year had been ""exceptionally strong"". Greggs said it had expected to see increased competition from cafes and restaurants when Covid lockdown measures were eased, but sales in its shops remained between 1% and 3% higher than levels seen in 2019, before the pandemic. ""This level of sustained sales recovery is stronger than we had anticipated and, if it were to continue, would have a materially positive impact on the expected financial result for the year,"" Greggs said. Earlier this year,Greggs had reported its first full-year loss for 36 yearsafter its sales fell by a third during 2020 amid coronavirus restrictions. Lookers said that after strong trading during the first four months of the year, the ""positive trends"" continued during May and June ""where we have seen robust consumer demand and ongoing outperformance of the UK retail new car market"". However, it added that there was ""some uncertainty"" going into the second half of the year due to the pandemic and ""notable"" supply restrictions in both new and used vehicles. Despite this, Lookers said it expected its full-year profits to be ""significantly ahead of current expectations"".

EU chief Brexit negotiator to go before StormontMaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ is appearing before the executive office committee to discuss the NI Protocol.Northern Ireland,"European Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ will be making an appearance in front of MLAs The EU's chief Brexit negotiator says he is ""confident"" a solution can be found in the next 48 hours over a possible ban on chilled meat products from GB being sold in NI. European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ  has appeared before a Stormont committee. Products such as chilled sausages were due to be prohibited from Thursday as a result of the NI Protocol. The protocol is part of the Brexit deal that creates a border in the Irish Sea. It keeps NI in the European Union single market for goods. The EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states. But the UK has asked the EU to delay the ban through extending a so-called grace period. Gulf remains between UK and EU over Brexit protocol What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? NI business disruption needs to be fixed, says Lewis Mr Å efÄoviÄ said he had been in ""intensive contact"" with the European Parliament and EU member states in recent days about the UK's request. ""While I cannot today announce the EU's formal agreement to the request, but after all the internal contacts I have had, I remain confident we can find a solution in the next 48 hours that will address both sides' needs and concerns,"" he said. ""I hope to be bringing such optimism to Northern Ireland more in the future."" Mr Å efÄoviÄ also told MLAs that the EU was ""prepared to take bold steps"" on flexibilities, if the UK is committed to implementing protocol in full, including changing EU laws if necessary. He repeated the EU's preference for a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement as a solution for Northern Ireland, where the UK continues to follow all EU agri-food rules. The UK has previously rejected this proposal, with its negotiator Lord Frost saying it would be ""an abrogation of sovereignty"" if it involved the rules being enforced through the EU institutions. Speaking later in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she welcomed the ""indication"" from Mr Å efÄoviÄ that the extension would be granted. ""We should bank that but what we need here are longer-term solutions and I hope we can find those in the period ahead,"" she added. ""I do think the appearance of Maros Å efÄoviÄ really was a positive development, I think it is really important that he does hear first-hand that the DUP doesn't speak for the north on Brexit or the Protocol."" Analysis There are clearly some within the EU who think that the UK government is not serious about maintaining the protocol. So Maros Å efÄoviÄ was saying 'yes we want to be flexible, but we also need to see the goodwill and the implementation from your side'. I think the two sides are still quite far apart on what sort of flexibilities are required or are necessary to make the protocol work. I think it's inevitable that we will see another big row blowing up at least by the autumn. Economy Minister Paul Frew described the protocol as ""damaging and brutal"". He told the assembly it was being used as ""punishment and leverage"" by the EU for future negotiations with the UK. ""There are some people here [in the assembly] who are complicit in that and that has really frustrated businesses I've spoken to over the last couple of weeks,"" he added. MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ appeared by video link before the Executive Office committee Before the Executive Office committee meeting, the SDLP's Colin McGrath, speaking as chairman, said the committee would make sure Mr Å efÄoviÄ was ""fully appraised"" of what Stormont's backbench members think about the protocol. The Northern Ireland Protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps NI in the European Union single market for goods. The EU does not generally permit the import of chilled meat products like mince and sausages from non-member states. Since January, producers in Great Britain have not been able to sell these products in the EU. However, in December 2020, the EU agreed to a six-month grace period to allow supermarkets in Northern Ireland to re-orientate supply chains away from Great Britain. The UK has asked the EU to extend a grace period for chilled meats to the end of September. Meanwhile judgement is expected this week in a judicial review which challenged the lawfulness of the protocol. The challenge was brought by a group of unionist politicians and was heard in the High Court in Belfast last month. One of the applicants, Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, tweeted that judgement is expected on Wednesday morning. Allow Twitter content?

Small firms warn of 18-day gap in Covid support,"Small firms need more help to bridge an 18-day gap as Covid limits continue but financial support packages wind down, the Federation of Small Business says. Restrictions were set to be lifted in England on 21 June but this was delayed for four weeks until 19 July. However, a number of measures aimed at helping firms, such as a business rates exemption and deferred VAT payments, will end on 1 July. A government spokeswoman said ""substantial"" support would remain. The FSB, which represents small firms, is concerned that there will be a gap in financial provisioning that will put more pressure on businesses that are already struggling. Many firms, especially in the night-time hospitality sector, had budgeted to be able to trade from 21 June. However, the delay in easing coronavirus restrictions means firms are continuing to struggle financially, the FSB says. How is furlough changing on 1 July? Easing delay to have 'critical impact' on business We're in serious trouble, says hospitality sector While the government has committed to continuing the furlough scheme, there will be changes from the start of July that will require increased payments from businesses. From 1 July, business rate exemptions for retailers and hospitality firms will also end. At the same time, the amount of wage costs employers need to contribute for furloughed staff through national insurance and pension will rise from 5% to 14%. Firms will also have to start paying deferred VAT bills, while repayments on more than Â£45bn in emergency bounce-back loans will soon be due. FSB national chairman Mike Cherry told the BBC that some of the UK's most fragile businesses had ""clung on"" through the pandemic, but now have no cash reserves remaining. ""With 'freedom day' delayed and business support now peeling back, we are worried for those who suddenly face new costs, but are unable to raise revenue to pay for them. Some may now cease trading and let staff go,"" he said. ""Business support should be extended such as full furlough and full business rates relief."" A spokeswoman for the government said that the furlough scheme, introduced at the start of the first nationwide lockdown, was still in place until September and ""is amongst the most generous schemes in the world"", providing Â£65bn of support and protecting 11.5 million jobs. ""The government will continue pay 70% of workers' wages over July, with businesses asked to cover just 10%,"" she added, ""They can also continue to access additional support, including restart grants worth up to Â£18,000 per business, and business rates relief and a cut to VAT - both in place until March 2022.""

Binance said the FCA notice would have no ""direct impact"" on the services it provides from its website Binance.com. Binance's existing crypto exchange is not UK-based so despite the FCA ruling, there will be no impact on UK residents who use the website to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies. The FCA does not regulate cryptocurrencies, but requires exchanges to register with them. Binance has not registered with the FCA and therefore is not allowed to operate an exchange in the UK. The FCA move comes amid pushback from regulators around the world against cryptocurrency platforms. Binance.com is an online centralised exchange that offers users a range of financial products and services, including purchasing and trading a wide range of digital currencies, as well as digital wallets, futures, securities, savings accounts and even lending. Binance Group is currently based in the Cayman Islands, while Binance Markets Limited is an affiliate firm based in London. The firm has multiple entities dotted around the world and Binance Group was previously based in Malta. Fears over risk-taking by cryptoasset investors Donald Trump calls Bitcoin 'a scam' World Bank rejects El Salvador Bitcoin request The FCA said that Binance Markets Limited (BML), which is owned by Binance Group, is not currently permitted to undertake any regulated activities without the prior written consent of the FCA. It has until Wednesday to comply with the ruling. The regulator also stressed that no entity in the Binance Group holds any form of authorisation, registration or licence to conduct regulated activity in the UK. At first sight, the Financial Conduct Authority's move to bar Binance from operating in the UK will have little impact. After all, it won't stop the company's many UK customers from using its exchange based in the Cayman Islands to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, the FCA is sending a strong signal that it is worried about the dangers of investing in cyptocurrencies in general. The reason it wants them all to register is because it's concerned about their potential use as a cover for illicit activity - and it wants consumers to be very careful indeed. As well as forbidding Binance from setting up an exchange in the UK, the regulator is ordering its UK division to stop any form of advertising here by 30 June. More significantly, it has until the end of this week to show the FCA that it has stored records of all of its UK customers, ready to be handed over if necessary. And there's a message to UK consumers to check whether any crypto company is registered with the regulator and, if it isn't, to consider withdrawing their assets. The FCA cannot stop people from trading in cryptocurrencies - but it has got out its biggest red flag and is waving it vigorously. This is not the first time that Binance has come under scrutiny by regulators over its global operations. In the US, one of the firm's entities - Binance Holdings - has been the subject of a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specifically by its officials dealing with money laundering and tax offences, according toBloomberg,external. The SEC issued a similar warning to US consumers in April about the platform. On Saturday, Binance announced it was pulling out of Ontario, Canada, after the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) accused it and several other crypto trading platforms of failing to comply with province regulations. And on Friday, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) warned Binance for the second time in three years that it is operating in the country without permission. Mark Walker is a technology entrepreneur who has invested in cryptocurrencies for three and a half years, alongside running a farm. He has used Binance for about six months. ""This ruling probably won't impact me in the short term, but long term it may push me to using one of the many other less secure exchanges,"" he explains. ""The FCA are taking a blunt approach - this is a space which is growing and employs millions so it's like them banning the internet in the 90s. ""I called the FCA this morning and they couldn't even answer whether existing users funds could be withdrawn,"" Mr Walker adds. It is possible to use apps to buy cryptocurrencies in the UK, but the FCA regulates speculation on prices One service Binance offers is the ability to use local currency to purchase digital currencies - known as fiat on-ramp in the industry. In mid-June, Binance's US partner Silvergate Bank decided to stop processing US dollar deposits and withdrawals for the firm, according toCoinDesk,external. While the cryptocurrency exchange says its entities are not all connected to it,  Nick Saponaro, a long-time cryptocurrency investor and entrepreneur, told the BBC this was a handy tactic for avoiding regulatory problems. ""Binance has over the course of their operations, moved several times to new jurisdictions,"" he said. ""That's not uncommon for these fledgling crypto businesses... if the regulations don't suit their needs, they just move their operations."" Another of the firm's entities - Binance.US -  is currently one of the biggest digital currency exchanges in the US, and Binance is one of the biggest firms in the global fintech industry, he says. ""I do believe they are trying to comply with regulations, but often with these businesses it's an 'ask for forgiveness' model, [where] they hope they can make enough money so if they do incur a fine, it's negligible comparatively to what they've earned."" Mr Saponaro, who co-founded the crypto-currency Divi and the blockchain payments ecosystem Divi Project, says the real problem with cryptocurrency exchanges is that they are still centralised, in that there is still a central authority that takes custody of the users' money, almost like a bank. This is counter to what the cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies were designed to do, and he feels that all exchanges should be totally decentralised, enabling users to have complete control over their digital coins. But he stresses that digital currencies are not a scam and eventually the fintech industry will get there. ""We're 12 years into the crypto adoption cycle, these things just take time - the exact same things were said about the internet initially,"" he said. ""Governments of each jurisdiction, especially the G7, need to with full transparency and confidence give us the full regulations about what we can and cannot do, and it needs to fit what the technology actually does.""

Love Island returns after 18-month break,"The islanders have reportedly been in quarantine for two weeks in the run-up to the series launch Love Island returns to screens on Monday after an 18-month break enforced by the coronavirus pandemic. It will be the first new series of the ITV2 dating show since Paige Turley and Finley Tappwere crowned the winnersof the first winter series last year. Eleven new islanders are set to enter the villa in Majorca, with Laura Whitmore and Iain Stirling returning to hosting and narrating duties. ITV has also announced an updated range of welfare measures for contestants. Here's everything you need to know ahead of the launch. Laura Whitmore will host again after taking over from the late Caroline Flack The seventh series of Love Island kicks off on ITV2 at 21:00 BST on Monday. ""Love Island was sorely missed last summer, and I wouldn't be surprised if ratings are higher than ever for this series,"" says Bonnie McLaren, senior entertainment writer at Grazia. ""It continues to be so popular for its ability to create nationwide conversation, whether that's over fiery arguments, hilarious moments - like Curtis saying he 'also wants to be one who wakes up in the morning and makes everyone a coffee' while breaking up with Amy - or more serious topics, like gaslighting."" The show has previouslyattracted praise for sparking debatesabout acceptable behaviour in relationships and shining a light on issues such as manipulation and girl code. ""And the contestants are always characters,"" McLaren adds. ""The list of islanders who have remained famous after their time on the show is incredibly long. The people in the villa - while you might not like all of them - are all incredibly entertaining to watch, and they're handpicked for being excellent TV."" Which brings us to this year's crop of contestants hoping to couple up. Left-right: New islanders Faye Winter, Aaron Francis and Liberty Poole We already know who the first 11 islanders will be, but expect several more to join the series over the next few weeks. PE teacherHugo Hammondwill become the show's first disabled contestant, although some viewers have described his casting as""a step rather than a leap""in the show's efforts to be more inclusive. He'll be joined by water engineerJake Cornish, model-turned-influencerShannon Singh, fashion bloggerKaz Kamwiand labourerBrad McClelland. Former civil servantSharon Gaffkahas possibly the most interesting back story. She worked on Brexit policy, did a stint in the Department of Health during the initial coronavirus response, andworked for six months,externalin the Department for Transport. Then there's lettings managerFaye Winterand former waitressLiberty Poole, whose previous job in Nando's should give Stirling enough material for plenty of ""extra hot"" jokes. Financial services marketing executiveChloe Burrows, luxury events hostAaron Francisand semi-professional footballerToby Aromolarancomplete the starting line-up. Of course, these are just names and job titles - we won't really get a sense of what the new islanders are like until they're actually in the villa. Ultimately, their personalities, screen presence and chemistry with the other islanders will determine their success. Iain Stirling will return to narrate the texts, tantrums and triumphs of the villa You'll have noticed that 11 is an odd number, and therefore one of the new islanders will be single from the beginning while the other 10 couple up. The show often starts this way, and it's a good way of creating some drama early on. Our new batch of Islanders have reportedlybeen in quarantine in Spain,externalfor the last two weeks ahead of the series launch, and there will be strict Covid protocols on site. It's thought there will also only be a skeleton crew based in Spain - with many of the show's editing and gallery staff working from London. ""There's lots of changes, and lots of protocols in place, but actually on screen no, there shouldn't be any changes,"" ITV commissioning editor Amanda Stavrirecently told the Radio Times,external. Whitmore will return to hosting duties, dropping into the villa every so often for recouplings and evictions, and will present the weekly Aftersun specials. Her real-life partner Stirling, meanwhile, will provide the voiceovers. Molly-Mae Hague, pictured with partner Tommy Fury, is one of Love Island's biggest success stories In short, cash - provided they can successfully capitalise on their new-found fame. Arguably the biggest break-out star of Love Island in recent years is Molly-Mae Hague, who is thought to bethe highest-earning former contestant,external, and certainly has the biggest social media following. It's worth readingthis excellent Vice article,externalabout how she did it. ""Molly-Mae is everywhere. In a way that no other Love Island alumna has quite managed,"" wrote Lauren O'Neill, commenting that Hague had ""set a gold standard for influencers"". Not every contestant can expect that type of career. Many vanish without a trace, while others find the fame slipping after the initial flurry around them has subsided. Former contestantMontana Brown told Cosmopolitan:,external""The first year after Love Island, I behaved like a bit of a brat - people give you everything for free, and do everything for you. ""But you can't forget that you're quite disposable in this industry. Future contestants need to know what they're getting into, and also understand that fame and money don't last forever."" One of this year's contestants, Sharon Gaffka, is a former civil servant ITV has announced a newly improved set of after-care measures following concerns about the mental health of previous contestants. The suicides of two former islanders in recent years prompted a debate about whether the show was doing enough to prepare them for the pressure that comes with the subsequent fame. Contestants on the new series will be taught how to handle the ""potential negativity"" of social media as part of the show's duty of care protocols. The training forms part ofa revised set of welfare measures,external, which will also see participants get ""comprehensive"" psychological support. Paige Turley and Finley Tapp won the winter series of Love Island last year While fans eagerly anticipate the show's return, there will also be plenty of people who spend the coming weeks shouting about the fact that they don't watch or care about Love Island. Sure, it's trashy, disposable, junk-food TV, but the fact that so many subsequent dating shows haven't quite managed to drum up the same excitement as Love Island during its absence is perhaps proof of its hard-to-define magic. Shows like The Cabins, Too Hot To Handle and Love Is Blind have kept us going in the last year or so, but none have quite compared with a summer of Stirling helping us navigate those texts, tantrums and triumphs under the Spanish sun. ""Personally, I couldn't be more excited for the series to return,"" says McLaren. ""And I think a lot of the people are the same. ""After 18 months off screen, and how - quite frankly - dull Winter Love Island was, I think the series is going to be more popular than ever, even though people now have the option to socialise instead of being stuck at home.""

Your updates were written by Alexandra Fouche, Alex Kleiderman, Jennifer Meierhans, Kate Whannel and Mary O'Connor. This page was edited by Holly Wallis and James Clarke. We are going to be finishing our live coverage of coronavirus for the day soon so here's a recap on the latest developments:  The UK's rise in Covid cases will end ""when most children have had the infection"", says Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia. He tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme that getting the infection will protect them from more severe disease as adults. He says there are four other major coronaviruses which generally infect us multiple times in our lives. ""I think that's almost certainly how this will play out. We will expect to have multiple Covid infections, most of us, for the rest of our lives,"" he says. Prof Hunter says he would be ""very uneasy"" if the isolation of whole bubbles of school children was continued after the summer holidays. He says by 19 July, when all restrictions are expected to end in England, schools will have closed for summer holidays and about two thirds of adults will have had both vaccines. ""We've got to end the restrictions and come to some sort of more equilibrium with the virus and I think 19 July is the best date for some time, and certainly before we head into winter,"" he says. ""If we leave it into the autumn, we will have higher pressure from not only Covid but a lot of the other infections that are already coming back now,"" he adds. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Elsewhere, Taiwan has today recorded its lowest number of
Covid-19 cases since 14 May. This is significant because todayâs figures are on
par with those it recorded before lockdown restrictions were introduced across the
island. In the past 24 hours, there have been 60 new confirmed
cases of Covid-19, and three further deaths. However, it must be factored in
that these are weekend figures. Level 3 restrictions were imposed in New Taipei
and Taipei City on 15 May, and were implemented nationwide on 20 May. Taiwan
has four Covid-19 response levels, and level 3 is where all non-essential
businesses are ordered to close, and mask-wearing is mandatory. Over the past month,
Taiwan has experienced a severe wave of Covid-19.It was hailed as a success story in 2020as it consistently saw single digit or zero cases throughout the
year, while much of the world struggled to combat outbreaks. It is widely believed that this wave began as a
result of cabin crew being able to quarantine for a shorter period than regular
travellers. The earliest cases were airline staff at an airport hotel. Today,the Taipei Times says,externalthe Control Yuan, the government's investigative agency, plans to
question Taiwanâs minister of health and welfare âto determine whether
administrative negligence and a lack of preparednessâ led to this outbreak  More than 50 people have been arrested after an illegal rave attended by up to 2,000 people at a national park. Under current coronavirus rules, gatherings must not exceed 30 people unless covered by a legal exemption. Sussex Police says it was met with ""significant hostility"" as itshut down the event in Steyning, on the South Downs in West Sussex, yesterday. One officer was assaulted and another was treated for a suspected broken arm after a crash at the scene. The force described it as ""one of the largest unplanned operations we have experienced in recent years"". Those arrested were taken into custody on suspicion of offences including drink and drug-driving, possession of drugs and theft. We've got more on this story here. Here's the moment Health Secretary Sajid Javid told MPs he saw no reason to go beyond 19 July with coronavirus restrictions. This video can not be played The scientist leading a study into mixing Covid vaccines says itâs âreassuringâ that âwe have those options nowâ. The Com-Cov trial has found that combining doses of Pfizer and AstraZenecagives good protection. Speaking to BBC Radio 4âs PM programme, lead investigator Prof Matthew Snape says: âIf you did have a problem with supply, then you could switch over to use the other vaccine to give the second dose.â âItâs all about having options... Itâs reassuring that actually the different combinations... generated antibodies and T-cells that were above [the] threshold.â Dr Snape - who is associate professor in general paediatrics and vaccinology at the University of Oxford - says ""itâs better off sticking to the schedules where we have proven effectivenessâ. ""But if there were to be particular circumstances that dictated you might want to change, mix-and-match, we have those options now. For example, if there was a problem in vaccine supply or a change in the use of the vaccines in different age groups.â Meanwhile, schools in Wales are to decide their own Covid-safety measuresunder new plans from the Welsh government. Education Minister Jeremy Miles says the new system will allow measures such as social distancing, face masks and testing to be dropped or reinstated. It does not mean the measures - which are currently imposed nationally - will be totally scrapped. But Miles says he wants them to ""gradually ease"", with schools running as normal as possible in the autumn. The education minister has told a press conference schools will be able to make the decisions based on advice from local incident management teams. Currently, face masks are required to be used in secondary schools where social distancing cannot be maintained, with exceptions at meal times and when pupils are outside. Twice-a-week testing has been available to schools since last February. Schools were reopened fully after last Easter, after they were closed due to the second wave of coronavirus in the winter. It comes as coronavirus cases in Wales continue to rise, withsignificant differences between some parts of the country. Health Secretary Sajid Javid has finished addressing the House of Commons for today - answering a total of 31 questions from MPs in an hour. Conservative Mark Harper asks Javid to rule out introducing restrictions in winter and autumn ""as a mechanism for managing Covid"". The health secretary says he is happy to discuss the issue in more detail. He adds that he wants to ""remove all restrictions as quickly as possible"". Dr Ben Spencer MP asks if Sajid Javid shares his concerns about the coming winter when it is predicted ""there may be an increase in Covid hospitalisations superimposed on normal NHS winter pressures"". He asks if plans are being made to support the NHS in what could be a ""very difficult winter indeed"". Javid says he can ""absolutely confirm to him that plans are being put in place"" and that a huge amount of work has been done by outgoing health secretary Matt Hancock which he will continue. Javid adds that in due course he will come to the Commons and set out the plans. Labour's Richard Burgon says that during his year away from the front bench, the new health secretary has been ""very busy indeed lining his own pockets"" with second and third jobs. Meanwhile, he says, NHS staff have been working harder than ever getting our communities through this Covid crisis. Burgon says: ""Given that the secretary of state has done very well out of the last year bagging hundreds of thousands of pounds during a national crisis, wouldn't it be the height of hypocrisy for the new health secretary to refuse our NHS staff the pay rise they so clearly deserve?"" Savid Javid replies with one line: ""The honourable gentleman is going to have to try a lot harder than that."" Huw Merriman, the Conservative MP for Bexhill and Battle, asks about how the 19 July will affect international travel, including whether people who are double vaccinated will be allowed to go on holiday to amber list countries. Javid replies that the 19 July date will be focused on domestic restrictions, but points out that the government ""takes seriously"" the border rules and traffic light system, and that it is subject to regular review. He adds that he will sit down with the transport secretary as soon he can to discuss the situation. Conservative MP Jason McCartney raises the issue of parents and guardians having to look after school children who are isolating ""sometimes for the third or fourth time"". He says it is having a huge impact on education and mental health and calls for a new approach to self-isolation. Javid says he has asked for ""fresh advice to see if there is anything more we can do"". He says a pilot is under way to ascertain whether ""tests can be used in lieu of isolation"". ""I want to see if we can go further,"" he adds.  Greg Clark MP says Professor Sir Andrew Pollard, who he describes as one of the heroes of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, told his committee that new variants were likely to infect even the vaccinated. But, he adds, Prof Pollard believes that if high protection against hospitalisation continues, despite the spread of cases in the community, the public health crisis will be over. He asks Sajid Javid what he will do to inform the public that we must move from being concerned about the number of cases to the risk of hospitalisation. Javid says Clark makes a crucial point, saying cases are not unimportant but because we have the vaccine it will break the link between case numbers and hospitalisations. He says we are starting to see that and indications are very positive on this. Liam Fox, the Conservative MP for North Somerset, asks if the government is following the data rather than dates in unlocking Covid restrictions in England, adding: ""We need to understand much better how the government are reaching decisions."" Javid replies that he saw the data in the department ""for the first time yesterday"", adding: ""The very detail it provides, how granular it is, and I have to say, I was very impressed with that data, so I can give you the assurance that the government is looking at the data and absolutely taking that into account"". He adds that he would like to see ministers share as much of that data as possible, ""so others can benefit from that"" and the department was looking at ways to do that. Labour's Nav Mishra asks what is being done to tackle the cancer backlog. Javid insists that the cancer backlog is ""a top priority"". ""Many of the so-called 'missing patients' are coming forward, urgent referrals are rising - and that is what we all want to see,"" he adds. Theo Clarke, the Conservative MP for Stafford, says some services, such as maternity services, were temporarily suspended at Stafford's county hospital during the pandemic, and asks the health secretary whether he agrees they should be resumed as soon as possible. Javid says services were ""understandably"" suspended to deal with the pandemic, but that it was ""important"" that as we return to normality, so too do the services that we all rely on. He offers to set up a meeting between Clarke and one of his ministers to discuss further. SNP MP Marion Fellows asks the health secretary if he will deliver a pay rise to NHS staff in England. She also asks if he will ensure devolved nations get more money to support NHS staff. Javid repeats his earlier assertion that the government will ""make sure there is a fair pay settlement"". Clive Betts MP says the National Audit Office's report on NHS Test and Trace is ""hardly complimentary"". Directors of public health are still waiting for up-to-date data to deal with local outbreaks, he says. He asks Sajid Javid to commit to ensuring directors of public health are fully involved in the new model for testing and tracing that will be undertaken from July of this year. Javid says he will take a closer look at the report and he will write to him. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Major storm delays Hong Kong stock market trading,"Trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange finally got under way on Monday afternoon after its morning session was cancelled due to extreme weather. The decision to open the market came after the government cancelled an earlier ""black rainstorm"" warning. The city has three levels of rainstorm warning, with black being the highest after amber and red. Landslides and flooding were reported in some parts of Hong Kong as it was hit with high amounts of rainfall. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange,externalannounced that trading would start from 1.30pm local time after the black rainstorm warning was lifted as the extreme weather conditions eased. It was the city's first black rainstorm warning this year, with more than 150mm of rain reported in the Western part of Hong Kong and the islands of Lantau and Lamma. Several other districts saw at least 70mm of rain. Hong Kong will stay a key financial hub say experts Baidu shares flat on its Hong Kong 'homecoming' NYSE does a U-turn on Chinese telecoms delistings The storm delayed a flight carrying Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and her delegation to Beijing for the Chinese Communist Party's 100th anniversary celebrations by around an hour, according to the South China Morning Post.

World's largest crypto-currency exchange in the UK,"Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, has been issued a warning by the UK's financial regulator. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) hasruled,externalthat the firm cannot conduct any ""regulated activity"" in the UK. It also advised people to be wary of adverts promising high returns on cryptoasset investments. Binance said the FCA notice would have no ""direct impact"" on the services it provides from its website Binance.com. Binance's existing crypto exchange is not UK-based so despite the FCA ruling, there will be no impact on UK residents who use the website to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies. The FCA does not regulate cryptocurrencies, but requires exchanges to register with them. Binance has not registered with the FCA and therefore is not allowed to operate an exchange in the UK. The FCA move comes amid pushback from regulators around the world against cryptocurrency platforms. Binance.com is an online centralised exchange that offers users a range of financial products and services, including purchasing and trading a wide range of digital currencies, as well as digital wallets, futures, securities, savings accounts and even lending. Binance Group is currently based in the Cayman Islands, while Binance Markets Limited is an affiliate firm based in London. The firm has multiple entities dotted around the world and Binance Group was previously based in Malta. Fears over risk-taking by cryptoasset investors Donald Trump calls Bitcoin 'a scam' World Bank rejects El Salvador Bitcoin request The FCA said that Binance Markets Limited (BML), which is owned by Binance Group, is not currently permitted to undertake any regulated activities without the prior written consent of the FCA. It has until Wednesday to comply with the ruling. The regulator also stressed that no entity in the Binance Group holds any form of authorisation, registration or licence to conduct regulated activity in the UK. At first sight, the Financial Conduct Authority's move to bar Binance from operating in the UK will have little impact. After all, it won't stop the company's many UK customers from using its exchange based in the Cayman Islands to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, the FCA is sending a strong signal that it is worried about the dangers of investing in cyptocurrencies in general. The reason it wants them all to register is because it's concerned about their potential use as a cover for illicit activity - and it wants consumers to be very careful indeed. As well as forbidding Binance from setting up an exchange in the UK, the regulator is ordering its UK division to stop any form of advertising here by 30 June. More significantly, it has until the end of this week to show the FCA that it has stored records of all of its UK customers, ready to be handed over if necessary. And there's a message to UK consumers to check whether any crypto company is registered with the regulator and, if it isn't, to consider withdrawing their assets. The FCA cannot stop people from trading in cryptocurrencies - but it has got out its biggest red flag and is waving it vigorously. This is not the first time that Binance has come under scrutiny by regulators over its global operations. In the US, one of the firm's entities - Binance Holdings - has been the subject of a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specifically by its officials dealing with money laundering and tax offences, according toBloomberg,external. The SEC issued a similar warning to US consumers in April about the platform. On Saturday, Binance announced it was pulling out of Ontario, Canada, after the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) accused it and several other crypto trading platforms of failing to comply with province regulations. And on Friday, Japan's Financial Services Agency (FSA) warned Binance for the second time in three years that it is operating in the country without permission. Mark Walker is a technology entrepreneur who has invested in cryptocurrencies for three and a half years, alongside running a farm. He has used Binance for about six months. ""This ruling probably won't impact me in the short term, but long term it may push me to using one of the many other less secure exchanges,"" he explains. ""The FCA are taking a blunt approach - this is a space which is growing and employs millions so it's like them banning the internet in the 90s. ""I called the FCA this morning and they couldn't even answer whether existing users funds could be withdrawn,"" Mr Walker adds.

Mr Saponaro, who co-founded the crypto-currency Divi and the blockchain payments ecosystem Divi Project, says the real problem with cryptocurrency exchanges is that they are still centralised, in that there is still a central authority that takes custody of the users' money, almost like a bank.

World's largest crypto-currency exchange banned in the UK,"Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange, has been issued a warning by the UK's financial regulator. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) hasruled,externalthat the firm cannot conduct any ""regulated activity"" in the UK. It also advised people to be wary of adverts promising high returns on cryptoasset investments. Binance said the FCA notice would have no ""direct impact"" on the services it provides from its website Binance.com. Binance's existing crypto exchange is not UK-based so despite the FCA ruling, there will be no impact on UK residents who use the website to purchase and sell cryptocurrencies. The FCA does not regulate cryptocurrencies, but requires exchanges to register with them. Binance has not registered with the FCA and therefore is not allowed to operate an exchange in the UK. The FCA move comes amid pushback from regulators around the world against cryptocurrency platforms. Binance.com is an online centralised exchange that offers users a range of financial products and services, including purchasing and trading a wide range of digital currencies, as well as digital wallets, futures, securities, savings accounts and even lending. Binance Group is currently based in the Cayman Islands, while Binance Markets Limited is an affiliate firm based in London. The firm has multiple entities dotted around the world and Binance Group was previously based in Malta. Fears over risk-taking by cryptoasset investors Donald Trump calls Bitcoin 'a scam' World Bank rejects El Salvador Bitcoin request The FCA said that Binance Markets Limited (BML), which is owned by Binance Group, is not currently permitted to undertake any regulated activities without the prior written consent of the FCA. It has until Wednesday to comply with the ruling. The regulator also stressed that no entity in the Binance Group holds any form of authorisation, registration or licence to conduct regulated activity in the UK. At first sight, the Financial Conduct Authority's move to bar Binance from operating in the UK will have little impact. After all, it won't stop the company's many UK customers from using its exchange based in the Cayman Islands to buy and sell Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Nevertheless, the FCA is sending a strong signal that it is worried about the dangers of investing in cyptocurrencies in general. The reason it wants them all to register is because it's concerned about their potential use as a cover for illicit activity - and it wants consumers to be very careful indeed. As well as forbidding Binance from setting up an exchange in the UK, the regulator is ordering its UK division to stop any form of advertising here by 30 June. More significantly, it has until the end of this week to show the FCA that it has stored records of all of its UK customers, ready to be handed over if necessary. And there's a message to UK consumers to check whether any crypto company is registered with the regulator and, if it isn't, to consider withdrawing their assets. The FCA cannot stop people from trading in cryptocurrencies - but it has got out its biggest red flag and is waving it vigorously. This is not the first time that Binance has come under scrutiny by regulators over its global operations. In the US, one of the firm's entities - Binance Holdings - has been the subject of a probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), specifically by its officials dealing with money laundering and tax offences, according toBloomberg,external.

'Black rainstorm' delays Hong Kong trading,"Trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange finally got under way on Monday afternoon after its morning session was cancelled due to extreme weather. The decision to open the market came after the government cancelled an earlier ""black rainstorm"" warning. The city has three levels of rainstorm warning, with black being the highest after amber and red. Landslides and flooding were reported in some parts of Hong Kong as it was hit with high amounts of rainfall. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange,externalannounced that trading would start from 1.30pm local time after the black rainstorm warning was lifted as the extreme weather conditions eased. It was the city's first black rainstorm warning this year, with more than 150mm of rain reported in the Western part of Hong Kong and the islands of Lantau and Lamma. Several other districts saw at least 70mm of rain. Hong Kong will stay a key financial hub say experts Baidu shares flat on its Hong Kong 'homecoming' NYSE does a U-turn on Chinese telecoms delistings The storm delayed a flight carrying Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam and her delegation to Beijing for the Chinese Communist Party's 100th anniversary celebrations by around an hour, according to the South China Morning Post.

Hazard goal takes Belgium past Portugal,"This video can not be played Belgium 1-0 Portugal: Thorgan Hazard's stunning winning goal from every angle A moment of class from Thorgan Hazard proved enough to knock out holders Portugal as Belgium continued their pursuit of a first major title by reaching the quarter-finals of Euro 2020. The Borussia Dortmund winger's swerving drive from 25 yards arrived late in a cagey first-half and carried Roberto Martinez's side into a mouth-watering meeting with Italy on Friday. Portugal - who again only introduced Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes from the bench - will look back on key Diogo Jota chances, a Ruben Dias header that was saved and a late Raphael Guerreiro drive that struck the post. Kevin De Bruyne's fitness may dominate headlines in the build-up to the Italy showdown in Munich after he limped off moments after half-time, and Belgium also lost Eden Hazard to a complaint late on. The world's highest-ranked side may have key holes to fill but again they have showed they possess the grit to complement their undoubted quality. 'Now or never for Belgium's golden generation' Thorgan Hazard's strike swerved away from Rui Patricio and he then raced to celebrate with his brother, Eden Martinez punched the air and shouted ""yes"" on the sound of the final whistle while Ronaldo crouched and beat the turf in frustration at Seville's Estadio de La Cartuja. His side had perhaps shown their best football of the tournament in the second 45 minutes, amassing 15 of a lofty 23 shots on the night. Jota fired a snap-shot over, Dias warmed the hands of Belgian keeper Thibaut Courtois with a point-blank header, Guerreiro found the foot of the post and substitute Joao Felix dragged a late effort wide. Manager Fernando Santos may well be asked where such a second-half display has been hiding. This video can not be played Belgium through, Ronaldo and Portugal out as Hazard strike seals win On their route to the trophy in 2016 Portugal won just one tournament fixture inside 90 minutes and in reaching the last-16 stage this time around they had failed to inspire. That they seemed so reluctant to use their unquestionable quality to dominate games is puzzling and whether Ronaldo - now 36 - graces another major tournament will now likely become a focus. He will undoubtedly go on to move clear of former Iran striker Ali Daei given the pair currently share the record figure of 109 international goals. His frustration at the final whistle though was tangible as after the highs of securing a first major honour in 2016, Portugal have flattered to deceive this time around. De Bruyne, seen here on the floor, was fouled before half-time but limped off moments after the re-start Martinez is now three wins away from delivering a first major honour for Belgium. He duly concluded this win required his side to overcome the fact Portugal's best trait is ""doing exactly what they need to do in the game to win"". And so it played out, with Belgium - now only beaten once in 27 outings - doing just enough to see off a side who have themselves achieved success by doing just enough. Martinez will be emboldened by the fact his group looked like a side who knew how to get over the line. Jan Vertonghen and Toby Alderweireld - boasting more than 240 caps between them - were recalled, while the likes of Axel Witsel, Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and Dries Mertens - all past or close to 100 caps - simply underline the experience Martinez has to call upon. Talisman Lukaku was quiet, touching the ball just 30 times. Only Portugal's Bernardo Silva - who played just 56 minutes - saw less of the ball of all the outfield players to start. And Lukaku's lack of impact showed as Belgium served up just six shots on goal all night. Thorgan Hazard's effort - which curled away from Rui Patricio - was their standout moment and they appeared happy to contain Portugal rather than press for more. Ronaldo's frustration was obvious when the final whistle sounded De Bruyne was hacked down before the break and lasted just seconds of the second half, while Eden Hazard pulled up sharply moments from the finish. Both would be a colossal miss against Italy, the only side who - like Belgium - won all of their group games and remain in the tournament. Many have tipped Roberto Mancini's side to go all the way given their impressive displays so far. Belgium may not have hit such entertaining heights here but there can be no doubt they pack enough of a threat to undo such opposition. To knock out the four-time world champions and European champions of 1968 will go a long way to bolster hope that this might finally be Belgium's year.

Javid to update MPs on lifting Covid measures,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We're very likely to be in a position on 19 July to say that really is the terminus"" People in England are ""very likely"" to be able to return to ""pretty much life before Covid"" on 19 July, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. It was ""sensible to stick to our plan"" of having a ""cautious but irreversible approach"" to lifting the remaining coronavirus restrictions, he added. The final stage of easing lockdown measures was previously put back by four weeks from 21 June by the PM. New Health Secretary Sajid Javid will update MPs later on the restrictions. The planned easing on 21 June was delayed amid concern over the spread of the Delta variant. When announcing the delay, the prime minister promised a review after two weeks. Meanwhile, Spain, Malta and Portugal are introducing new restrictions for travellers from the this week. Those travelling to Spain - including the Balearic Islands, which will be on the UK's green travel list from Wednesday - will need to be fully vaccinated or have a negative PCR test. Malta, which will also go on the green list, will require visitors to have had both doses of a Covid-19 jab. Travellers from the UK to mainland Portugal will be required to quarantine for 14 dayson arrival, unless they have been fully vaccinated for at least two weeks - but these rules do not apply to the islands of Madeira, which is going on the green list, or the Azores. The Hong Kong government has also announced new measures, banning all passenger flights from the UK from 1 July after adding the country to its ""extremely high risk"" group. What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? The huge NHS challenge facing Sajid Javid Javid wants return to normal 'as soon as possible' Speaking on Monday, Mr Johnson said: ""Although there are some encouraging signs and the number of deaths remains low and the number of hospitalisations remains low - though both are going up a bit - we are seeing an increase in cases. ""So we think it's sensible to stick to our plan to have a cautious but irreversible approach, use the next three weeks or so really to complete as much as we can of that vaccine rollout. ""And then with every day that goes by it's clearer to me and all our scientific advisers that we're very likely to be in a position on 19 July to say that really is the terminus, and we can go back to life as it was before Covid as far as possible."" Mr Javid's address, which will come less than 48 hours after taking the rolefollowing Matt Hancock's resignation,is expected in the House of Commons at about 17:30 BST. Mr Javid said: ""I want to see the restrictions lifted and life going back to normal as quickly as possible. That is my absolute priority. I want to see those restrictions lifted as soon as we can. ""It's going to be irreversible, there's no going back. That's why we want to be careful during that process."" This video can not be played Health Secretary Sajid Javid: ""I want to see the restrictions lifted... as quickly as possible"" He was appointed on Saturday evening shortly after Mr Hancock resigned for breaching social distancing guidance. Pressure had been building on Mr Hancock following the publication by the Sun of pictures and a video of him kissing his colleague Gina Coladangelo. The pair are both married with three children each. There's lots of talk about encouraging data. But with infection levels climbing rapidly, how can that be? The key is in the picture emerging with hospital cases and deaths. When the initial delay to step four was announced, infection rates had just started rising and government scientists were worried about what that could lead to with the vaccination programme not fully rolled out. The past few weeks have provided clarity about what we can expect. The answer can be found by comparing the start of the second wave in the autumn with what is happening now. During September and October cases were rising much as they are now. Within eight weeks that had translated to more than 1,000 hospital admissions a day. This time round there are just above 200. There is even better news with deaths. Latest estimates show fewer than one in 1,000 infections is leading to a death. At the peak of the winter wave it was one in 60. This has dramatically altered what can be considered a proportionate response to the virus - and is why a further loosening of restrictions remains on the cards. The number of new coronavirus cases across the UK has continued to rise quickly in the week since what would have been ""freedom day"". The UK has recorded 116,287 cases in the past seven days - a 70% increase on the previous week's total. A total of 22,868 cases were reported on Monday, up from 14,876 on Sunday. However,the government said,externalSunday's figure was lower than expected because of a delay to processing data, and that Monday's total would include outstanding cases. A further three deaths within 28 days of a positive test have been reported in the UK. There tend to be fewer deaths reported on Mondays, due to a reporting lag over the weekend. In Scotland, there have beena record number of daily cases recordedwith a further 3,285 cases reported on Monday - surpassing the previous high of 2,999 from Thursday. But the government's decision on lifting measures will also take into account the progress of the UK's vaccination rollout. Latest figures show that 84.4% of adults in the UK have had their first jab and 61.9% have had their second. Some Conservative backbenchers have urged the government to ease controls quickly, saying the country must learn to live with Covid and that the early investment in providing a vaccine in huge numbers was always intended to achieve just that. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health services in England, urged Mr Javid to be a ""voice of caution"" in the cabinet over the pressures the pandemic is heaping on the NHS. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The number of cases in hospital are rising... we have to keep a careful eye on it."" Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of the NHS Providers organisation, said Mr Javid's priorities should be tackling the new surge of Covid cases, along with the ""huge spike"" in demand for emergency services and the backlog of people waiting for NHS treatment. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, told Today that if levels of protection from jabs continued then the UK should be in a ""very good position"", when asked about restrictions being lifted soon. He said: ""We're looking at the data that's coming from Public Health England about the effectiveness of the vaccines and we're seeing more than 90% protection."" In Wales, the lifting of coronavirus restrictions has beenpaused,external, to be reviewed again on 15 July, whilein Scotlandit is hoped that the remaining rules will be lifted on 9 August. Some rules inNorthern Ireland,externalwill be reviewed on 1 July. CLASSIC WIMBLEDON TRADITIONS:Do you know all five and how did they start?

Did Matt Hancock break Covid law?,"Matt Hancock had Gina Coladangelo with him when he visited the BBC on 6 June Health Secretary Matt Hancock has resigned after he admitted breaching social distancing guidance, saying ""those of us who make these rules have got to stick by them"". His resignation and apology followedphotos published by the Sun newspaper,externalshowing him in an embrace with a colleague, Gina Coladangelo. The paper says the photos of the pair - both of whom are married - were taken inside the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) on 6 May 2021. Labour and the Liberal Democrats had called for the health secretary to be sacked before he quit. Social distancing in workplaces is not a legal requirement, but it is recommended. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE)says,external: ""Where possible you should keep people 2m apart. If this is not viable, keeping 1m apart with risk mitigation is acceptable."" The government'sguidelines,externalsay: ""When you cannot redesign an activity to meet social distance guidelines, ask if your business can continue without that activity."" Face coverings are not mandatory in offices. Guidance says they are ""not a replacement for the other ways of managing risk including ""minimising time spent in contact"". On 6 May, England was still atStage 2 of Covid restrictions. When it came to gatherings indoors, the law stated: ""No person may participate in a gathering... which consists of two or more people and takes place indoors."" There was an exception for work purposes but only if the gathering was ""reasonably necessary"". ""I cannot see how that exception could apply in the circumstances,"" Adam Wagner, a barrister from Doughty Street Chambers who is an expert on the lockdown restrictions told BBC Reality Check. ""Based on what we know, this seems to me to have been an illegal gathering."" The week before the photo is said to have been taken, Mr Hancock said: ""This is no time for complacency, it's a time for caution."" Speaking at aDowning Street press conference,external, he reminded the public to ""remember the basics of hands, face, space, and fresh air"". On 11 May, he said that once restrictions were eased he would be ""trusting people's personal responsibility"" on whether to hug others. He told Sky News: ""It depends on people's circumstances."" On 16 May, he told Sky News: ""Of course, there's people who have been yearning to have some physical contact - you should do that carefully."" On the subject of hugging, he added: ""The thing I'm really looking forward to is hugging my Mum... we'll probably do it outside and keep the ventilation going."" That was the day before hugging was allowed under the guidelines, on 17 May. A year before the photos were taken, he commented on the actions of Prof Neil Ferguson. Prof Ferguson quit as a government adviser afterthe Telegraph reported,externalthat a woman he was said to be in a relationship with had visited his home in lockdown. At the time, Mr Hancock told Sky News that it was ""just not possible"" for Prof Ferguson to continue advising the government. He said the social distancing rules ""are there for everyone"" and are ""deadly serious"". The Ministerial Code,externalsays ministers ""are expected to maintain high standards of behaviour and to behave in a way that upholds the highest standards of propriety"". It also says that they ""must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise"". A DHSC spokesperson was asked about the appointment of Gina Coladangelo (a friend of Mr Hancock since university) as a non-executive director of the health department last year and said: ""This appointment was made in the usual way and followed correct procedure"". Dr Catherine Haddon, from the Institute of Government, says: ""There is a good case to be made that Hancock may have broken some... aspects of the ministerial code"". But she questioned whether an inquiry into this would take place: ""It is still up to the prime minister to decide whether the Independent Adviser on Ministerial Interests can look into a minister"". Downing Street had said Boris Johnson had accepted Mr Hancock's apology and considered the matter closed, before the health secretary stepped down on Saturday, 26 June.

Easing delay to have 'critical impact' on business,"Nightclubs have been closed for more than 15 months Delaying lockdown easing could have a ""critical impact"" on already struggling businesses and cost UK hospitality Â£3bn in lost sales, industry groups say. The government is expected to say that current coronavirus rules willremain in place for another four weeksafter the planned 21 June unlocking. Capacity limits will remain in pubs and cinemas and nightclubs will stay shut. Junior Health Minister Ed Argar said he expected there to be more aid to help businesses cope. Kate Harl said her restaurant, the Bean Inn in St Ives, Cornwall, would be operating at a ""greatly reduced capacity"" due to the delay and her ability to earn would be ""severely restricted"". ""For us the number of covers that we will be doing each night will be down by about 40%,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""It feels like we're treading water at the moment. We're not able to progress and make a decent profit. We're not at risk of going under, but it's very very difficult and challenging to go forward."" 'We're in serious trouble,' says hospitality sector 'We'll lose thousands if wedding rules don't change' Lockdown easing in England to be delayed Ministers are concerned about the spread of the Delta variant of coronavirus, now the most prevalent in the UK, which is around 60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant first identified in Kent. UK Hospitality, which represents pubs, bars and restaurants, said it recognised the government had a balance to strike, but it said many businesses were already deeply in debt and called for greater levels of government support. Many restaurants are currently operating at a reduced capacity ""Even now, with partial reopening, sector sales remain down 42% and 300,000 jobs remain protected by furlough,"" said boss Kate Nicholls. ""A one-month delay to restrictions lifting would cost the sector around Â£3bn in sales - but would also have a knock-on impact on bookings throughout the summer and into the autumn."" The Night Time Industries Association, which represents nightclubs among other venues, said businesses had been waiting to open for more than 15 months and many had made financial commitments ahead of 21 June. It said 54% of businesses it surveyed had ordered stock, 73% had called in staff and 60% had sold tickets. The trade group says it will legally challenge any delay, arguing that levels of mortality, hospitalisation and infection are still relatively low. ""To delay would have a huge impact on the sector, losing many businesses [and] livelihoods culminating in further loss of confidence in the sector,"" said chief executive Michael Kill. ""We will see many more illegal unregulated events take the place of businesses that are licensed and regulated across the country as people express their frustration,"" he added. Anton Stevens said he ""new something wasn't right"" after news about the lockdown being prolonged was leaked to the media Anton Stevens, director of the Hidden Nightclub in Manchester, said further delays to lifting the lockdown restrictions was ""the last thing we need really"". Mr Stevens said he and colleagues were hopeful that the 21 June opening day was ""on track"". ""Any question of the variants being a deciding factor in delaying the 21 June plans were quashed by the PM only last month and the rise of new cases seemed a formality as the vaccination plan seemed to be working as expected,"" he said. Mr Stevens said his team added more air conditioning units, toilets and washrooms to ""reopen safely"". ""We've hired and trained new staff, a new security company and agreed plans for stock,"" he added. ""There's obviously a cost for all of this work which was needed to reopen safely and we're not going to see any return on the thousands of pounds invested for an extended period, with no mention of a another support package."" The Treasury has said eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief, VAT reduction and the Recovery Loan Scheme. The furlough scheme and support for the self-employed is in place until September. But business groups want the chancellor to go further. The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said business support measures should reflect the level of restrictions announced and remain in place until the economy is able to reopen fully. ""We would be calling for the government to provide further cash grants, at least equivalent to levels provided during the first lockdown, and to delay the tapering of government payments into the furlough scheme, planned for the start of July,"" said BCC co-executive director Claire Walker. ""The government should also look at extending the trade credit reinsurance scheme beyond the end of June to minimise possible disruptions in insurance coverage."" Junior Health Minister Ed Argar told Sky News: ""I know that when [the prime minister] addresses his decision, sets out what he intends to do around the easing on the 21st, he will address those points as well. ""He is very mindful of the need for businesses and others to get the support they need if they continue to be locked down or unable to open."" A Treasury spokesperson said it was ""committed to helping businesses and individuals through the pandemic and deliberately went long with our support to provide certainty over the summer"". ""The furlough scheme and support for the self employed is in place until September and eligible businesses will continue to benefit from business rates relief, VAT reduction and the Recovery Loan Scheme,"" they added.
