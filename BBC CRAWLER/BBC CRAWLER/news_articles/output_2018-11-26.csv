Touchdown triumph for Nasa's Mars probe,"InSight quickly returned its first image from Elysium Planitia The US space agency Nasa has landed a new robot on Mars after a dramatic seven-minute plunge to the surface of the Red Planet. The InSight probe,externalaims to study the world's deep interior, and make it the only planet - apart from Earth - that has been examined in this way. Confirmation of touchdown came through on cue at 19:53 GMT. It ended an anxious wait in which the robot radioed home a series of updates on its descent. Nasa's mission control at California's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) erupted into cheers when it became clear InSight was safe on the ground. The agency's chief administrator, James Bridenstine, celebrated what he called ""an amazing day"". President Trump had rung to offer his congratulations, he told reporters. And the director of JPL, Mike Watkins, said the success should remind everyone that ""to do science we have to be bold and we have to be explorers."" InSight is now sitting on a vast, flat plain known as Elysium Planitia, close to the Red Planet's equator. Before landing, Nasa had dubbed it the ""biggest parking lot on Mars"". The first picture of this landscape came back very quickly, within minutes. It showed a smudged, fisheye view of the robot's surroundings. The image was taken through the translucent lens cap of a camera positioned on the underside of the lander. The dust kicked up in the descent obscured much of the scene, but it was still possible to make out a small rock, one of the probe's feet and the sky on the horizon. A later picture captured by a camera on InSight's topside was much clearer. The mission team will be pleased to have avoided some of the rocks seen in the distance Mars InSight: Beating the odds James Tuttle Keane's guide to Mars' interior Nasa robot to target ancient lake crater This video can not be played The touchdown confirmation was celebrated by Nasa staff in California Like all previous landing attempts at Mars, Insight's race to the surface - the first attempt since 2012 - was a tense affair. Stage by stage and metre by metre, the robot reported back its progress. It had entered the atmosphere faster than a high-velocity bullet, using the combination of a heatshield, parachute and rockets to bring itself to a gentle stop. InSight's first critical task on landing was to deploy its solar panels, which were stowed for the descent. The robot absolutely had to start generating power to operate its systems and to warm equipment in the sub-zero temperatures that persist on the Red Planet. Notification of the panels' set-up came seven hours after landing. One of the big achievements in the InSight mission so far has been the role played by the two briefcase-sized satellites that were sent to Mars along with the robot lander. It was these mini-spacecraft, called MarCO A and B, that relayed the probe's signals back to Earth during the plunge to the surface. The duo cost less than $20m and their technologies are now sure to feature much more prominently on future interplanetary missions. And as if to underline their capabilities, the little satellites also took a picture of Mars. ""Having successfully brought all the data back from InSight during its exciting entry, descent and landing (EDL) sequence - what you see before you is an image taken roughly 4,700 miles from Mars, about 10-15 minutes after EDL itself,"" explained MarCO chief engineer Andy Klesh. The MarCO image of Mars. The grid to the right is the antenna used to relay InSight's signals to Earth This will be the first probe to dedicate its investigations to understanding Mars' interior. Scientists want to know how the world is constructed - from its core to its crust. InSight has three principal experiments to achieve this goal. The first is a package ofFranco-British seismometers,externalthat will be lifted on to the surface to listen for ""Marsquakes"". These vibrations will reveal where the rock layers are and what they are made of. A German-led ""mole"" system,externalwill burrow up to 5m into the ground to take the planet's temperature. This will give a sense of how active Mars still is. Andthe third experiment will use radio transmissions,externalto very precisely determine how the planet is wobbling on its axis. Deputy project scientist Suzanne Smrekar uses this analogy: ""If you take a raw egg and a cooked egg and you spin them, they wobble differently because of the distribution of liquid in the interior. And today we really don't know if the core of Mars is liquid or solid, and how big that core is. InSight will give us this information."" This video can not be played Bruce Banerdt: ""Right now a picture of the inside of Mars would have fuzzy boundaries"" Scientists understand very well how Earth's interior is structured, and they have some good models to describe the initiation of this architecture at the Solar System's birth more than 4.5 billion years ago. But Earth is one data point and Mars will give researchers a different perspective on how a rocky planet can be assembled and evolve through time. InSight chief scientist Bruce Banerdt said: ""The small details in how planets evolve are what we think make the difference between a place like Earth where you can go on vacation and get a tan, and a place like Venus where you'll burn in seconds or a place like Mars where you'll freeze to death.""

Trump: Brexit plan threatens US-UK trade,"This video can not be played Trump: Brexit agreement ""great deal for EU"" Donald Trump has suggested Theresa May's Brexit agreement could threaten a US-UK trade deal. The US president told reporters the withdrawal agreement ""sounds like a great deal for the EU"" and meant the UK might not be able to trade with the US. No 10 insisted it is ""very clear"" the UK would be able to sign trade deals with countries around the world. Downing Street added that Mrs May is ready to defend her deal in a TV debate with Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. It has been reported the debate could take place on 9 December - two days before the Parliamentary vote on Mrs May's deal. Speaking to reporters outside the White House, Mr Trump said: ""Right now if you look at the deal, [the UK] may not be able to trade with us. And that wouldn't be a good thing. I don't think they meant that."" Inside a US/UK trade deal Reality Check: The challenges ahead for a UK/US trade deal after Brexit The UK-US trade relationship in five charts It would appear Mr Trump was suggesting the agreement could leave Britain unable to negotiate a free-trade agreement with the United States. Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said Mr Trump's comments ""were not unexpected"" and negotiations on a trade deal with the US were always going to be ""challenging"". ""The United States is a tough negotiator,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""President Trump's always said very plainly 'I put America first'. Well, I'd expect the British prime minister to put British interests first."" The comments came after Mrs May fought off criticism of her Brexit deal from MPs on all sides of the Commons on Monday - insisting the agreement would allow the UK to regain control of laws, money and borders.

When Donald Trump fired a broadside at Theresa May's Brexit deal there was nothing accidental or off the cuff about it. Senior members of his administration maintain close contacts with prominent eurosceptics in the Conservative party. But when the president says the agreement could jeopardise trade with the UK, it's hard to see what he means. During the transition period, business with the US would presumably carry on in exactly the same way as it does now. Yet all the time that Britain is in some way yoked to EU rules then there are limits to what can be negotiated in terms of a free trade deal - all points that have been made by those who campaigned for a more decisive Brexit. This intervention, coming post deal and pre-Commons vote, can only be interpreted in one way - the president is siding with the prime minister's critics. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs have said they will vote against the Brexit deal. Sir Michel Fallon has launched a scathing attack on Mrs May's Brexit deal, labelling it ""doomed"". The senior Conservative and long-standing party loyalist echoed Mr Corbyn's words when he described the deal as ""the worst of all worlds"". Asked if the prime minister was now also doomed, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""That's up to my colleagues."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As part of her two-week bid to convince MPs and the British public to back her deal, Mrs May will tell politicians and employers in Wales on Tuesday that they will have more power after Brexit, with more than 150 areas of policy passing to devolved parliaments and assemblies. She will also highlight the potential benefits to farmers of leaving the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. Then in Northern Ireland, she will tell representatives of the five main political parties her deal will allow employers to ""trade freely across the border with Ireland and have unfettered access to the rest of the United Kingdom's market"". Winning over the Commons: An impossible task for PM? A guide to where we are with Brexit A really simple guide to Brexit Northern Ireland has featured heavily in discussions about Brexit because both the UK and the EU want to avoid a physical border - with guard posts and checks - between it and the Republic of Ireland. The agreement includes a ""backstop"" - a fall-back position - that would mean Northern Ireland would still follow some EU rules on things such as food products if a long-term trade deal is not agreed. The Democratic Unionist Party, which props up Mrs May's government, has accused the PM of breaking her promise that Northern Ireland would never be treated any differently from the rest of the UK - but the PM has said the backstop was an ""insurance policy no-one wants to use"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Even the prime minister's own cabinet can't bring themselves to sell this deal."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, under the terms of legislation already passed by Parliament. Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs have said they will vote against the Brexit deal. Lord Kerslake, the former head of the civil service, said government officials were probably working on a ""plan B"" in case the deal was rejected but there would be ""no whisper of it"" publicly until the outcome of the Commons vote. He told the BBC that while the option of seeking changes to the withdrawal agreement remained on the table, if the defeat was extremely heavy then more radical alternatives, such as extending the talks, would have to be considered. ""If Parliament rejects the deal by a significant majority and no deal is not now unacceptable there is a responsibility on the government to look seriously at options they have previously ruled out,"" he told Radio 4's Today.

An impossible task for PM?,"If you'd listened only to question after question in the Commons on Monday afternoon, protesting loud and long at the prime minister's compromise, you might wonder why she just doesn't pack up and go home. How on earth can Mrs May turn round the wave of resistance? Has she finally met her impossible task? In private, many MPs are even more caustic about this compromise deal getting through than they are in public - and that's saying something. And among the number of the sceptics are plenty of ministers too. Whether they are ministers who think the plan will fall and  are then willing to resign and then push for staying in the EU's single market and customs union... ....or whether they are Brexiteers in government who think Theresa May's made her own rotten luck by sticking too close to the EU... ...or even members of another group - those who look at the deal and think it's a grim, but realistic compromise, but then look at the numbers and think it just can't pass. This video can not be played Meet some of the MPs bidding to vote down Theresa May's Brexit plan But while there might be fewer of them, there are still some brave souls in government who think there is a chance the deal can pass. That's why the PM will be spending every day for the next fortnight determinedly arguing for the deal, and putting the case again and again. And then, yes, again: that in her view this deal is the only show in town. And while MPs, certainly her supporters, might have grimaced at the torrent of criticism this afternoon, there is no sense at all at this stage that the prime minister has any intention of moving away from her position. In fact, as the days get more desperate, in some of her public appearances and press conferences, she seems strangely more at ease, joking about forgetting journalists' names. Maybe, at long last, she has been able to settle on a simple Brexit message that she is actually comfortable with: in her view it's this deal or disaster. And having manoeuvred herself into this position, she has no choice but to keep going. Her political fate rests on whether she can pass the deal. The stability of her government and, she would argue, the country too. And everything about her track record tells us, as her colleagues privately confirm, the prime minister's style is to be stubborn and unbending; a weakness as well as a strength. Along with what will undoubtedly be ruthless management of Tory MPs, No 10's plan is to relentlessly and publicly use the fear of the unknown - worries about political chaos - to bring colleagues into line. It may work. It may well not. But Theresa May will not fail because she didn't try. We know now the vote that will make history takes place on 11 December. We may not know until that very moment which way it will go. UK's Brexit deal agreed by EU leaders Brexit deal 'worse than no deal' - DUP What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal?

May defends Brexit deal amid MPs' attacks,"This video can not be played Theresa May on Northern Ireland backstop: ""This is an insurance policy no-one wants to use."" Theresa May has defended her proposed Brexit deal in the Commons in the face of sustained criticism from the opposition and many Conservative MPs. She said the deal delivered on the result of the EU referendum - and MPs will get to vote on it on 11 December. But she admitted she was not ""entirely happy"" with the ""backstop"" contingency plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn said ""ploughing on"" with a deal opposed by the public and MPs was an ""act of national self-harm"". The Labour leader suggested Parliament would have ""little choice"" but to reject the deal when MPs vote on it. A host of former Tory cabinet ministers, including Iain Duncan Smith, Boris Johnson, Owen Paterson, Michael Fallon and Dominic Grieve, also said the deal was unsatisfactory, during the two-and-half hour debate. Where do MPs stand on Brexit deal? May regrets EU 'queue-jumpers' comment Winning over the Commons: An impossible task for PM? A simple guide to where we are with Brexit Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable joined a number of Labour MPs and the Green Party's Caroline Lucas in calling for the prime minister to back another EU referendum ""with the option of remaining in the European Union"". Mrs May rejected all of these calls and told Sir Vince it was time to ""deliver on the choice the British people made"" in the 2016 referendum. Mrs May faces an uphill struggle to persuade MPs to accept the terms of thewithdrawal agreement- and apolitical declaration on future relationsbetween the EU and UK - approved by EU leaders on Sunday. Mrs May said there had been ""give and take"" in the 19-month negotiations but the final agreement ""delivered for the British people"" by regaining control of laws, money and borders. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We are proud Gibraltar is British and our position on sovereignty has not, and will not, change."" She acknowledged concerns over arrangements to avoid the return of physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which could see the UK entering a customs arrangement with the EU -known as the ""backstop"". Katya Adler: Nineteen months of wrangling Reality Check: Theresa May's Brexit letter What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Parties keen to join a Brexit TV debate The ""backstop"" was an ""insurance policy no-one wants to use,"" Mrs May told MPs, and she insisted the UK would have the right to determine whether it came into force if the UK's future relationship was not settled by the end of 2020, as she hoped it would. A backstop of some kind would be required, she said, due to the UK's obligation to uphold the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland peace deal signed 20 years ago, adding ""there is no deal that comes without a backstop and without a backstop there is no deal"". She also insisted she had stood firm in the face of repeated EU attempts to link access to British waters for their fishermen to future trade arrangements, amid claims from the SNP and others that her deal had ""sold out"" Scotland's fishermen. The PM also said she regretted saying in a speech last week that Brexit would prevent EU migrants ""jumping the queue"". The comments sparked an angry backlash from EU citizens living in the UK. The Labour leader said Mrs May had brought home a ""botched deal"" that would ""leave the UK worse off"" and that ""ploughing on is not stoic, it is an act of national self-harm"". He said the prime minister needed a ""plan B"" involving a permanent customs arrangement and stronger employment and environmental protections, which is Labour's Brexit policy. ""This deal it is not a plan for Britain's future,"" he added and that was why MPs had ""little choice"" but to reject it. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Even the prime minister's own cabinet can't bring themselves to sell this deal."" Caroline Flint, one of the few Labour MPs who have signalled they could vote for the deal, urged Mrs May and Mr Corbyn to hold face-to-face talks to reach an accommodation acceptable to both parties. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had ""no plans"" to reach out personally to Labour MPs who might back a deal, although her chief of staff had invited opposition MPs to a briefing on the agreement on Monday evening. The SNP's Iain Blackford said the agreement was ""full of ifs and buts"" which would result in Scottish fishermen being ""sold out"". And the DUP's Nigel Dodds said the backstop ""was bad for the United Kingdom and bad for the economy"" and absolute certainty was needed over its legal application. Please upgrade your browser Tory backbencher Mark Francois was among a host of MPs to urge PM to think again, claiming the agreement was ""as dead as a dodo"" and ""would not get through"" Parliament. ""The House of Commons has never surrendered to anyone,"" he said. ""It won't start now."" And former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, previously regarded as a loyalist, said it would be a ""huge gamble"" for the UK to ""surrender our vote and our veto without any firm commitment to frictionless trade"" outside the EU. Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it was ""hard to see"" how the deal could provide certainty to business when cabinet ministers were saying different things about what they wanted. Following the debate, Mrs May was due to host more than 100 investors and employers from sectors including manufacturing, retail, food and drink and financial services to discuss the Brexit plan. This video can not be played Will MPs vote for Brexit? Analysis by the BBC's Iain Watson Theresa May told MPs her plan was in the national interest, delivering on the referendum result while protecting the economy. But if this debate is a taste of things to come, the prime minister is in big trouble. One MP after another, Remainers and Leavers alike, and across all parties, spoke out against Mrs May's plan. Indeed rarely can a prime minister have received such a mauling. Mrs May now has just over two weeks to try to rally support in Parliament. Asked repeatedly by MPs what the ""Plan B"" was if she lost the vote, she avoided a direct answer.

British academic pardoned by UAE,"This video can not be played Daniela Tejada says she is ""elated"" at the news Matthew Hedges has been pardoned A British academic who was jailed for spying in the United Arab Emirates has been freed after a pardon. Matthew Hedges, 31, denied spying and said he had been researching his PhD. His wife, Daniela Tejada, who appealed for clemency, said she was ""elated"" and ""can't wait to have him back home"". The UAE issued the pardon as part of a series of orders on the country's National Day anniversary. However, a spokesman said Mr Hedges was ""100% a secret service operative"". Mr Hedges is out of detention and on his way to the British embassy in the UAE, a family spokeswoman said. BBC Arabic special correspondent Feras Kilani said Mr Hedges was due to fly back to London tonight. Latest reaction to the pardoning and other North East news During a news conference, a video was shown of a purported confession from Mr Hedges saying he was a member of MI6. This accusation was rejected by Ms Tejada, who told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It's taken me by surprise and I'm just so happy and so relieved and really incredulous that it is all happening finally. ""It's been an absolutely nightmarish seven months already and I can't wait to have him back home."" Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman welcomed the news, adding: ""As we've been clear, we didn't agree with the charges, but we are grateful to the UAE government for resolving the issue."" Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the UK government had ""never seen any evidence"" the spying charges were true. He praised Ms Tejada, describing her as a ""determined lady"" who had ""fought incredibly hard and been to hell and back"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prosecutors said Mr Hedges had admitted the chargesin an Abu Dhabi court, which found him guilty of ""spying for or on behalf of"" the UK government, andwas jailed for life last week. Mr Hedges had always said he was innocent, and had been researching the country's security strategy as part of his PhD studies at Durham University. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent The UAE is a close ally of Britain. That makes this case all the harder to comprehend. Despite his official pardon, UAE officials remain adamant that - in their view - Matthew Hedges was caught red-handed spying for Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, which he denies. In an earlier video-taped confession shown at a news conference in Abu Dhabi today, Mr Hedges was shown describing himself as ""a captain in MI6"". No such rank exists in MI6, which does not use military ranks. For operational reasons, the UK government has a longstanding policy of Neither Confirm Nor Deny (NCND) whether someone is working for its intelligence agencies. As foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt is the person to whom both MI6 and GCHQ answer to. He has stopped short of publicly denying that Hedges was working for MI6 but has said he has seen no basis for the charges against him. This case differs markedly from those citizens jailed in Iran in that the UAE, as an ally, has shown it wants to see it resolved as quickly as possible. Mr Hunt tweeted: ""Fantastic news about Matthew Hedges. ""Although we didn't agree with charges we are grateful to UAE government for resolving issue speedily."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Hedges, who lives in Exeter, was arrested at Dubai Airport in May. His family said that during the first six weeks of his detention he had been interrogated without a lawyer and consular access was unavailable. Who is Matthew Hedges? Despite not speaking Arabic, he was made to sign a document which transpired to be a confession, they added. Ms Tejada said her husbandhad been left ""absolutely terrified""by the prospect of serving a life sentence in the UAE and suffered panic attacks. Daniela Tejada ""fought incredibly hard"" to get her husband back, the foreign secretary said The UAE accused Mr Hedges of trying to steal its ""sensitive national security secrets"" and gather ""classified information on [its] role in Yemen"". A spokesman for the UAE government, Jabel Al Lamki, claimed Mr Hedges had been ""using two different identities to gather information from his targets"". Mr Al Lamki added: ""In one he was Matthew Hedges the PhD researcher, in another one he was Matthew Hedges the businessman, he was part-time PhD researcher, and part-time businessman, but he was 100% a secret service operative."" He said a request for clemency from Mr Hedges' family had been granted ""in consideration of the historical relationship and close ties between the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom"". University staff's Dubai campus boycott Why is the UAE's legal system being criticised? Case 'is a warning by UAE to academics to be more careful' Durham University's vice-chancellor, Prof Stuart Corbridge, said: ""We are absolutely delighted to learn the news of Matt's impending release. ""It is paramount that he is now allowed to return home to Daniela and his family as quickly and safely as possible. ""We will continue to offer Matt's family our full support in the aftermath of this traumatic ordeal and we will be thrilled to welcome him back to the Durham University community."" This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt welcomes the pardon Detained in Dubai - an organisation that aims to help foreigners abroad - said that while it welcomed Mr Hedges' release it was ""far from an optimal resolution"". Chief executive Radha Stirling said: ""Matthew should never have been forced to sign a false confession in Arabic, never should have been locked up in solitary confinement for six months, and most certainly never should have been sentenced to life imprisonment. ""The pardon does not undo any of that, and indeed, Matthew's innocence has not been admitted by the UAE - the wrongs done to him have not been acknowledged."" Who is Matthew Hedges?

"'I failed you', Carl Sargeant told family","Carl Sargeant had been a Welsh Government minister for almost a decade A sacked Welsh Government minister found dead at his home last year left a letter telling his family ""I have failed you"", an inquest has heard. Labour AM Carl Sargeant, 49, was found hanged four days after First Minister Carwyn Jones dismissed him as communities and children secretary. The father-of-two faced allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards women, a claim he denied. He wrote: ""You deserve none of this adverse publicity 'cause of my acts."" Mr Sargeant had been suspended from the Welsh Labour party prior to his death on 7 November 2017. Coroner John Gittins has previously said theprovisional cause of death was hangingin ""an apparent act of self harm"". Mr Sargeant's letter, read to the inquest at Ruthin, Denbighshire, on Monday, said: ""To Bernie, Lucy, Jack and family/friends. I have let you down badly. You deserve none of this adverse publicity 'cause of my acts. I have failed you. ""That aside, I love you more than you'll ever know and I'm sorry I have taken the easy way out, leaving you with my shit. Please forgive me. I love you, Carl/Dad."" Former minister Leighton Andrews arriving at the inquest The court later heard from former Welsh Government minister Leighton Andrews, who told the inquest Carwyn Jones's behaviour was irresponsible following Mr Sargeant's sacking. Mr Andrews said Mr Jones gave media interviews on the Monday following a cabinet reshuffle on Friday 3 November 2017, which had a ""significant impact"" on Mr Sargeant's state of mind. Mr Andrews said the first minister had been ""speculating"" during the interviews, although he did not elaborate further. The inquest also heard details of a text message sent from Mr Andrews to Mr Jones on the evening of the reshuffle. Under questioning by the first minister's counsel Cathy McGahey, Mr Andrews agreed he had written phrases quoted from the text including ""great to see new faces promotedâ¦it's a great reshuffle"" and that it must have been an ""immensely difficult conversation to have had with Carl"". Before hearing evidence from Mr Andrews, the coroner told him the inquest was not about blame or fault. He thanked him for his previously-submitted statement, but warned him there may be elements within it that fell outside this investigation. Jack Sargeant with his mother Bernadette arriving at the inquest At the start of the inquest, Mr Gittins said there was no room in his court room for speculation or accusation, adding: ""This will not be a trial by press, politics or personality."" He read a statement from PC Siwan Hughes, who was called to Mr Sargeant's home in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, after his body was found in a utility room by his wife Bernadette. The police officer was told by Mrs Sargeant she had found a note on the door of the utility room telling her not to go in and to call the police. The letter to his family was left next to his body. The court heard there were traces of anti-depressants in his blood, but not enough to be a contributory factor to his death. Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe worked alongside Mr Sargeant Speaking at the inquest, future generations commissioner Sophie Howe, who became special adviser to Mr Sargeant in 2013, said she noticed his health begin to deteriorate in the summer of 2017, several months before his death. She said he used to say ""I'm having a real black dog of a day"" and there were ""a number of pressures at work"". She added on the day of Mr Sargeant's sacking, he called her in the afternoon saying ""I'm out and it's really bad"". ""He said 'I don't know what's going on, I haven't been told what the allegations are'. I find that incredible, that he could be sacked without being told what the allegations were,"" she said. Ms Howe added the work environment was ""toxic"". She said she was in regular contact with Mr Sargeant over the weekend following his sacking. ""He was saying 'I'm in a dark place'. I was very concerned about him,"" she said. Ms Howe added Mr Sargeant was ""distraught"" about not knowing the detail of the allegations against him. She added his mood had improved by the end of the weekend but took a ""downward turn"" after he was door-stepped by a journalist on the Monday morning. On the day before his death, Ms Howe received a text message from David Taylor, a friend of Mr Sargeant, who had been asking how to programme a text message to be sent at a later time. Ms Howe told the coroner she then became concerned Mr Sargeant was planning to take his own life. She managed to contact him by phone, and ""he sounded completely spaced-out"". She repeatedly asked him why he wanted to know how to delay a text message being sent, to which he said, ""I just wanted to know"". She added she believes she was the last person to speak to Mr Sargeant. Mr Sargeant later sent a text message to a group which she was a member of, saying ""love you all"". Leighton Andrews gave evidence at Ruthin in front of family lawyer Leslie Thomas (left), Coroner John Gittins (centre) and Mr Sargeant's wife Bernadette (right) Giving evidence, Mr Sargeant's GP Dr David Morris said the late politician had been in good general health, apart from being ""a big fella"", but had presented with symptoms of depression in March 2012, the first of several episodes. The doctor said Mr Sargeant had described himself as ""low in mood"", suffering from disturbed sleep and ""weepiness"", and had also told him: ""It feels like what I think post-traumatic stress might be."" This was due to an illness of another family member. He was prescribed a course of fluoxetine medication after being diagnosed with ""moderately severe depression"". He had a short course of sleeping tablets in 2014 and in July 2016 was put back on fluoxetine, which notes show he feared to stop taking. Later that year he scored one on a scale used to determine whether he had considered self-harming, which was at the lower end. He was prescribed a different anti-depressant and by November was feeling better, with improved sleep. The drugs were repeated throughout much of 2017, with the last prescription in the October of that year. Cathy McGahey QC, representing the first minister, asked whether some people suffering depression were able to function in their working lives, to which Dr Morris said they were. Questioned by Leslie Thomas QC, for the Sargeant family, the doctor also agreed some people did not function well at work with depression. Mr Thomas pointed out Mr Sargeant was last seen by a medical practitioner almost a year before his death. He asked what would be the impact on people who used work as an outlet for their depression if that work was going badly and an individual no longer had that outlet. Dr Morris said: ""A negative one."" Sargeant family gets inquiry review The first minister is due to appear at the five-day inquest on Wednesday, while Mr Sargeant's cabinet colleagues, Lesley Griffiths and Ken Skates, will also give evidence. The inquest is set to hear from Mr Sargeant's son Jack, who succeeded him as the AM for Alyn and Deeside. Mr Sargeant's body was found in the utility room of his house in Connah's Quay Mr Sargeant was facing a partyinvestigation into claims about inappropriate personal conduct with womenand was suspended from the Welsh Labour Party prior to his death. His family said he was not told the details of what he was accused of and was unable to properly defend himself. An independent investigation into how Mr Jones handled Mr Sargeant's sacking will begin in the new year. Earlier this month, theHigh Court gave the family permission to challengethe format of a separate investigation into how his sacking was handled, with his wife saying she feared the probe would be a ""cover-up"". Carl Sargeant had been a Welsh Government minister for almost a decade Mr Sargeant had been a Welsh Government minister for eight years before his sacking in November last year. The former environmental auditor and industrial firefighter had been a Welsh Assembly member since 2003. Mr Sargeant was appointed Labour's chief whip and deputy minister for assembly business following the 2007 election. He was promoted to the cabinet in 2009 as minister for social justice and local government, then served as housing and natural resources minister before being appointed communities secretary in May 2016. Mr Sargeant helped drive legislation to tackle domestic violence and ledthe Welsh Government's response to the Grenfell Tower fire, promising Welsh high-rise blocks were as safe as they could be.

Underworld duo 'murdered in gangland feud',"Paul Massey (left) and John Kinsella were both fatally shot A gangland feud led to an underworld ""Mr Big"" and a mob ""fixer"" being shot dead, a court has heard. Paul Massey, 55, from Salford, and his friend, John Kinsella, 53, from Liverpool, were ""notorious"" within gangland circles in Liverpool and Manchester, jurors were told. Both were gunned down during a deadly clash between rival north-west gangs, Liverpool Crown Court heard. Mark Fellows, 38, and Steven Boyle, 35, both deny the murders. Mr Fellows, of Warrington, and Mr Boyle, of Heywood, Greater Manchester, also deny the attempted murder of Kinsella's partner Wendy Owen. Prosecutor Paul Greaney QC said Massey was killed in July 2015 and Kinsella almost three years later, in May 2018. He said: ""They were friends and associates. Moreover, each was well known, if not notorious, within the gangland of the north west and both men undoubtedly had enemies. ""Their undoing has to do with events in the city of Salford, where serious violence broke out between two criminal gangs in 2015."" The jury heard that Mr Fellows and Mr Boyle were associated with a gang led by a man named Michael Carroll. A rival gang, which called itself ""the A Team"", was headed by a man named Stephen Britton who regarded Massey as ""a mentor"", the court was told. Massey was shot dead on 26 July 2015 outside his home in Clifton, Salford, by a gunman firing an Uzi sub-machine gun. Then at about 06:45 BST on 5 May this year, Kinsella was shot dead near his home in Rainhill, St Helens, by a man on a bike, the jury heard. The prosecutor said a man, allegedly Mr Fellows, had cycled up behind Kinsella and shot him twice in the back with a handgun and then twice to the back of the head. Mr Greaney said there were ""clear parallels"" which suggested the same people carried out both killings. Police investigating Kinsella's murder seized a GPS watch belonging to Mr Fellows, the court heard. When detectives analysed this it showed a few months before the 2015 murder of Massey, the wearer had travelled to where the victim was killed. The prosecution claim this showed Mr Fellows on a ""reconnaissance run"" for the planned gangland hit. Mr Boyle had acted as a ""spotter"" for both killings, the court was told. Mr Greaney said both men were in contact using a phone called an Aquaris X, or similar, sold on the internet and equipped with what is called Encrochat modification, costing up to Â£1,500 for six months' use. The phones have a ""dummy screen"" with a secret, encrypted partition which allows secret communication, the jury heard. Without a password, the content of the handset cannot be decrypted and police have not found it possible to decrypt the defendant's handsets. Both devices had been activated just days after the murder of Kinsella and Mr Greaney said both accused had ""like devices"" at the time of the killing but ditched them after the murder. Mr Greaney added: ""It hardly seems likely that they would do so because of a simple drug deal, whereas if they had been involved in a gangland assassination, it would be much easier to understand why they might wish to dispose of anything connecting them to the crime.""

Armageddon looms in World Chess finalTwo grandmasters vying for the â¬1m prize head to tiebreakers after drawing 12 games in a row.Europe,"A clash of kings: Carlsen, right, has been defending his title from Caruana Two chess grandmasters have spent November locked in stalemate, with the world chess championship up for grabs. After 12 games and 12 draws, American Fabiano Caruana is seeking to take the title from Norwegian Magnus Carlsen. After drawing their final match in London on Monday, they head to a series of fast-paced tie-breakers, culminating in a game type known as ""Armageddon"". If he wins, Caruana will be the first US world champion since Bobby Fischer in 1972. But in Wednesday's tie-breaker, he will again face a fierce title defence from Carlsen, who has been champion since 2013 and is the top-ranked player in the world. On top of the prestige that comes with the title, the pair are also battling over a â¬1m (Â£880,000) cash prize. The two players were locked in a soundproof box at the play venue for some three hours before Carlsen offered his opponent a draw. The game's moves were live-streamed with commentary from other chess grandmasters across platforms including YouTube and popular video game streaming site Twitch.tv. 'Pawnographic' World Chess logo mocked Russian politician crowned world chess head The country breeding a generation of chess whizz kids The 12-draw series in London makes it one of the most fiercely contested in history. The tie-breaker will be a series of increasingly fast games. If victorious Caruana would become the first US world champion in four decades Carlsen will be seen as the favourite as he is considered an expert at rapid chess. However, former grand master Garry Kasparov tweeted that he thought the draw offer indicated the Norwegian was losing his nerve. Allow Twitter content?

In the ordinary games, each player starts with a generous time bank of 100 minutes, and more time is added as the game progresses. That means it is possible to watch a grandmaster do nothing except stare at the board for several minutes. But in the tie-breakers, four games are played with just 25 minutes on the clock, and 10 seconds added after each move. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If it is still a draw after that, two ""blitz"" games are played - with just five minutes per player and three added seconds per turn. In such circumstances, mistakes are much easier to make. In the unlikely event that after five sets of blitz, the title is still tied, a sudden death variety called ""Armageddon"" is played. In this chess game type, there will be a winner - a draw means a victory for the player wielding the black game pieces. To compensate, white gets more time on his clock - a minute more, but the pace is still as fast as a blitz game.

Winning over the Commons: An impossible task for PM?,"If you'd listened only to question after question in the Commons on Monday afternoon, protesting loud and long at the prime minister's compromise, you might wonder why she just doesn't pack up and go home. How on earth can Mrs May turn round the wave of resistance? Has she finally met her impossible task? In private, many MPs are even more caustic about this compromise deal getting through than they are in public - and that's saying something. And among the number of the sceptics are plenty of ministers too. Whether they are ministers who think the plan will fall and  are then willing to resign and then push for staying in the EU's single market and customs union... ....or whether they are Brexiteers in government who think Theresa May's made her own rotten luck by sticking too close to the EU... ...or even members of another group - those who look at the deal and think it's a grim, but realistic compromise, but then look at the numbers and think it just can't pass. This video can not be played Meet some of the MPs bidding to vote down Theresa May's Brexit plan But while there might be fewer of them, there are still some brave souls in government who think there is a chance the deal can pass. That's why the PM will be spending every day for the next fortnight determinedly arguing for the deal, and putting the case again and again. And then, yes, again: that in her view this deal is the only show in town. And while MPs, certainly her supporters, might have grimaced at the torrent of criticism this afternoon, there is no sense at all at this stage that the prime minister has any intention of moving away from her position. In fact, as the days get more desperate, in some of her public appearances and press conferences, she seems strangely more at ease, joking about forgetting journalists' names. Maybe, at long last, she has been able to settle on a simple Brexit message that she is actually comfortable with: in her view it's this deal or disaster. And having manoeuvred herself into this position, she has no choice but to keep going. Her political fate rests on whether she can pass the deal. The stability of her government and, she would argue, the country too. And everything about her track record tells us, as her colleagues privately confirm, the prime minister's style is to be stubborn and unbending; a weakness as well as a strength. Along with what will undoubtedly be ruthless management of Tory MPs, No 10's plan is to relentlessly and publicly use the fear of the unknown - worries about political chaos - to bring colleagues into line. It may work. It may well not. But Theresa May will not fail because she didn't try. We know now the vote that will make history takes place on 11 December. We may not know until that very moment which way it will go. UK's Brexit deal agreed by EU leaders Brexit deal 'worse than no deal' - DUP What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal?

Katya Adler: Nineteen months of wrangling,"This video can not be played Jean-Claude Juncker: ""If the House [of Commons] would say no, we would have no deal"" There was a definite ""battle of the tones"" at the seal-the-deal Brexit summit with Theresa May. EU leaders were determinedly sombre, while the UK prime minister had to sound upbeat and positive about her country's Brussels-free future. It shouldn't be under-estimated. Sunday was a huge day for the EU, signing off on the divorce papers of a departing key member state for the first time in the history of the bloc. In the eyes of many, Brexit counts as an EU failure. At the summit, French President Emmanuel Macron reminded the press of the fragility of European Union. Which is why, time and again, EU leaders in Brussels continue to make so much of the (unusual) show of unity the Brexit process has provoked in EU ranks. Brexit: Where are we now? Your guide to EU jargon EU leaders agree UK's Brexit deal For now, of course, all European eyes turn to the UK to see if the hard-negotiated Brexit deal passes through the House of Commons. If it doesn't, the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, insists there will be no deal. Will the UK and EU reach a Brexit fishing deal? Fishing after Brexit: Sink or swim? ""This is the deal. This is THE deal,"" he told me emphatically, ruling out the possibility of renegotiating the Brexit texts. If he's true to his word, and parliament votes down the divorce deal, then all 19 months of painful EU-UK negotiations were for naught. And both sides could find themselves staring at the cost and potential chaos of what the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier calls a non-orderly Brexit. EU leaders are hell-bent on avoiding that. Jean-Claude Juncker told the BBC the Brexit deal reached with Theresa May was ""THE deal"" So much so, that as much as  EU leaders regret Brexit, and as often as they have spoken at every EU summit so far since the Brexit vote about the door still being open for the UK to change its mind, there was none of that talk on Sunday. Instead, they were fully on message with Theresa May - to help her sell her deal back home. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte remarked that Mrs May had ""fought hard"" and that the result was a good deal. Meanwhile, Mr Barnier said these had been ""extraordinary"", ""complex"" and ""difficult"" negotiations, resulting in an ""unprecedented and ambitious partnership"". All that talk of fair and fabulous deals somehow rings rather hollow, though, when the EU has made clear from the start that it would never concede a deal to the UK that made life look as good - or even better - outside, rather than inside, their club. Macron's blunt Brexit warning to UK,external Will EU Brexit summit crash on The Rock? But of course, this is not the final deal. The story of the EU and UK's tempestuous relationship is far from over. Maybe there will be a second vote on the Brexit deal in the UK parliament, or a second referendum, or a general election. Until we know, we cannot be 100%  sure how the EU will react. But if, as seems likely, Brexit does indeed go ahead, it is only then that the detailed negotiations for a future EU-UK trade deal begin in earnest. And Mr Macron reminded us all at the Sunday summit of the horse-trading, arm-twisting and conflicting national interests of EU countries that will challenge those negotiations. The French president essentially threatened the success of a future EU-UK trade deal if the UK didn't guarantee access for French fishermen to UK waters after Brexit. Fishing has been another contentious issue in the Brexit talks - and the French president has indicated he will not drop it Now this should shock no-one. Fish, Gibraltar, the EU trying to tie the UK to its competition rules, even the Irish border backstop are all issues that were dealt with just enough to complete the Brexit deal texts but, in reality, the can was kicked down the road to the future trade negotiations. To sum up: these 19 months of endless wrangling over the Brexit divorce deal... they were a just a taster of what is yet to come.

Ukraine backs martial law after sea clash,"This video can not be played Footage of the collision was posted by the Ukrainian interior minister Ukraine's parliament has backed a presidential plan to impose martial law in part of the country after Russia captured three of its naval vessels and 23 crew members on Sunday. President Petro Poroshenko said the 30-day order would affect border regions vulnerable to potential Russian attack. Authorities can ban protests and strikes, and citizens could be called up for military duty. Russia's President Putin expressed ""serious concern"" at the decision. Russian coastguard ships opened fire on Sunday as three Ukrainian boats sailed off the coast of Crimea, annexed by Russian in 2014. Several Ukrainian sailors were wounded in what Ukraine described as an ""act of aggression"" by Russia. Moscow said the ships had illegally entered its waters. Russian TV broadcast statements from some of the captured Ukrainian navy men on Tuesday. One commander was quoted as saying he realised his actions ""were provocative"" and Russian TV claimed the Ukrainian operation had been carried out by the SBU security service. The naval clash is the first time Russia and Ukraine have come into open conflict in recent years, although Russian-backed separatists and Russian ""volunteers"" have been fighting Ukrainian forces in eastern Ukraine since 2014. Why sea clash is fraught with risk Russia-Ukraine sea clash in 300 words Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Eastern Ukraine: A new, bloody chapter A number of Western countries condemned Russia's actions and President Poroshenko warned the threat of a Russian land invasion was ""extremely serious"". In New York, the United Nations Security Council met to discuss the crisis - but failed to agree a Russian-proposed agenda amid sharp disagreements between Moscow and the West. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement that the seizure of Ukrainian ships was a ""dangerous escalation and a violation of international law"". President Donald Trump said: ""We do not like what's happening, either way we don't like what's happening and hopefully they'll get straight."" Taking a call from German Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Vladimir Putin argued that the Ukrainians had ""deliberately ignored the rules of peaceful passage in the territorial sea of the Russian Federation"", the Kremlin said. After heated debate in Ukraine's parliament, 276 lawmakers backed a decision to impose martial law on 10 of Ukraine's 27 regions: Five regions border Russian territory Two regions border Moldova's breakaway Trans-Dniester region, where Russian troops are stationed Three regions on the Black Sea/Sea of Azov coast Thirty lawmakers voted against the move. Martial law will enter into force at 09:00 local time (07:00 GMT) on Wednesday and will end on 27 December. President Poroshenko said the authorities needed firm power in case of a full-scale Russian invasion Monday's vote in parliament came after an emotional address by President Poroshenko, who promised not to restrict basic freedoms. Some MPs expressed fears Mr Poroshenko could suspend a presidential poll on 31 March 2019 - a claim he firmly denied. But he stressed he needed firm power in case of a full-scale Russian invasion. Ukraine's national security and defence council had initially recommended a 60-day martial law. But Mr Poroshenko said he amended the proposal because he did not want martial law to affect the presidential elections. Still, critics expressed fears that Mr Poroshenko - whose ratings have plummeted in recent months - could suspend the elections to stay in power. This is the chronology of the dramatic events that led to the naval clash: In the morning, Ukraine said it had sent two gunboats and a tug from the Black Sea port of Odessa to Mariupol in the Sea of Azov Ukraine's navy then said Russian boats had tried to intercept its vessels, ramming the tug Russia accused Ukraine of illegally entering its territorial waters Russia scrambled fighter jets and helicopters as the Ukrainian vessels approached a bridge over the Kerch Strait - the only access to the Sea of Azov The bridge itself was blocked by a tanker In the evening, Ukraine said its vessels had been fired on and seized by the Russians. Six Ukrainian crew members were injured Russia confirmed it had used weapons to force the Ukrainian vessels to stop, saying three Ukrainians were injured Russia said the Ukrainian ships were in its waters illegally because Moscow had temporarily closed an area of water for shipping. Kiev called Russia's actions a flagrant violation of international law, because the Black Sea is free for shipping, and Crimea belongs to Ukraine. Ukraine also cited a 2003 Russia-Ukraine treaty on unimpeded access to the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov. It said it had informed the Russians in advance of its plan to move its ships to Mariupol - a claim denied by Russia. In recent weeks, two Ukrainian vessels passed through the Kerch Straight without incident. The crisis as it happened There have been growing tensions between the two sides over navigation in the area. Russia has recently begun inspecting all vessels sailing to or from Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov. This video can not be played Jonah Fisher talks to a commander of the Ukrainian Navy about the tensions in the Azov Sea This began after Ukraine detained a fishing vessel from Crimea in March. Moscow also says the checks are necessary for security reasons. Ukraine has accused Russia of trying to occupy the Sea of Azov and damage Ukraine's economy by hindering access to its ports. Ukraine gained independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. However, Russia considers a Western-leaning Ukraine a threat to its interests. In 2014, Ukraine's pro-Russian leader was overthrown, after large-scale protests against the government's decision to abandon plans to sign an association agreement with the EU. Russia then annexed Crimea, while Russia-backed separatists moved against the Ukrainian state in the east. Anger as Crimea excluded from Ukraine map The place that's rather difficult to get into More than 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict in the east. Russia-Ukraine hostility explained.

Safety concerns raised over breast implants,"Implants can be ""textured"" or ""smooth"" An investigation has raised safety concerns about the most commonly used type of silicone breast implant in the UK. Women in France are now being advised not to use ""textured"" silicone implants while authorities investigate links with a rare form of cancer. British women are still having the implants put in and there has been no warning from the UK regulator to stop. It says it will take action when it sees there is a problem. A Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority (MHRA) spokesman said: ""We know that there are ongoing concerns about the safety of silicone breast implants - we're keeping a very close eye on that."" Manufacturers say the safety of the implants is supported by extensive testing and studies, as well as more than a decade of use in America and Europe. The BBC's Panorama programmehas been investigating implants with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externaland organisations around the world, includingthe Guardian,externalnewspaper and theBritish Medical Journal,external. Janet Trelawny had breast cancer over 20 years ago. Her breasts were removed and replaced with textured implants. This video can not be played Janet Trelawny: ""I was devastated"" Now, she has been diagnosed with breast implant associated lymphoma (BIA-ALCL). It is not breast cancer but a type of cancer of the immune system. In most cases, it is found in the scar tissue and fluid near the implant. But in some, it can spread throughout the body. She said: ""It's frightening to think that something that I'd done because I've had a cancer previously has then caused me to get cancer again. ""I was absolutely mortified. I'm frightened that this can happen and I had no idea."" Janet is waiting for further biopsy results and has been told she will need to have chemotherapy to treat her cancer. The French have been investigating breast implants since 2011, when they started receiving reports of BIA-ALCL. The risks of developing it after an implant vary around the world but are thought to be very small. As of September 2018,external, the MHRA has received 57 reports of ALCL in patients with breast implants, 45 of which meet specific diagnostic criteria. That puts the estimated risk of BIA-ALCL at about one per 24,000 implants. BIA-ALCL appears to have occurred with textured implants made by every manufacturer, according to the British Association of Plastic and Reconstructive Aesthetic Surgeons (BAAPS). Breast implants come with different fillings and different surfaces - smooth and textured. In the UK, 99% of breast implants used are textured, according to BAAPS. Dr Suzanne Turner, an expert in breast implant associated lymphoma at Cambridge University, said: ""It is a concern, absolutely, particularly now that we're seeing breast implant associated lymphoma developing in these ladies. ""So, the risk is small but it's a risk that we should know about and be informed of."" The investigation discovered that some manufacturers did not carry out adequate tests before selling textured implants to the public. These tests are called biocompatibility tests and they assess how the body responds to a product. The manufacturers argued the tests were unnecessary but the French regulator said: ""Almost all of the arguments put forward by the manufacturers were considered to be unacceptable for justifying the lack of biocompatibility tests."" Some manufacturers now say that they have completed the necessary biocompatibility tests. But the secrecy around the regulatory system does not allow us to see what was done. The investigation has also found out that manufacturers in Europe and America have under-reported problems with breast implants. Some haven't told regulators when the implants rupture, because they say it's a routine event. Nobody knows the scale of the risks, because the implants haven't been adequately tracked when they've been put into people and problems may take years to develop. A register for breast implants was set up in 2016 but at the moment it's still voluntary. Carl Heneghan, professor of evidence based medicine at Oxford University, says campaigners have been asking for a register for 25 years. ""Every implant should be in a register because that's what defines patient safety.  In the absence of that, we're in the dark.""

Nominations for new ÃÂ£50 note released,"Rosalind Franklin, Stephen Hawking and Ada Lovelace feature on the official list of more than 800 - so far The Bank of England has released a list of scientists who have been nominated to feature on the new Â£50 note. On the list are computing pioneers Alan Turing and Ada Lovelace, telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell and astronomer Patrick Moore. The Bank received 174,112 nominations, of which 114,000 met the eligibility criteria. To be on the list, the individual must be real, deceased and have contributed to the field of science in the UK. The list, which includes more than 600 men and almost 200 women, includes black holes expert Stephen Hawking, penicillin discoverer Alexander Fleming, father of modern epidemiology John Snow, naturalist and zookeeper Gerald Durrell, fossil pioneer Mary Anning, British-Jamaican business woman and nursing pioneer Mary Seacole and Margaret Thatcher, who was a scientist before becoming prime minister. The late Baroness Thatcher studied chemistry at Oxford University and after graduating joined British Xylonite Plastics in 1947. Two years later she joined J. Lyons & Co in Hammersmith, west London, as a food research chemist in a role that involved testing the quality of cake-fillings and ice-cream, wrote biographer Hugo Young. The politician has been credited with inventing soft serve ice cream - a product Lyons worked on - but ""there is no firm evidence that Thatcher directly assisted in its invention"",according to a Royal Society journal article,external. Bookmakers William Hill have Stephen Hawking as the current favourite, with odds of 7/4, followed by Nobel-prize winning chemist Dorothy Hodgkin 4/1. Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing and Alexander Fleming have odds of 5/1 and Rosalind Franklin, who made important contributions to the understanding of DNA, is at 6/1. Further names will be considered,externalup until nominations close on 14 December. After that the decision will be considered by the Bank's Banknote Character Advisory Committee. Margaret Thatcher working as a research chemist in a picture dated 1950 Paul Rincon, BBC News website science editor The definition of eligibility for this list is pretty broad at the moment, but stricter criteria are likely to be applied once the names are considered by the Bank's committee. Thus, while Margaret Thatcher's contributions to politics are considerable, it remains to be seen whether the committee will judge her an equally significant scientific figure. Hers is just one of the names that some observers will think fall outside some of the stricter definitions of a scientist. But a broad definition of eligibility could assist the promotion of some figures that were overlooked by the establishment in their lifetimes, such as Mary Anning, who, without formal qualifications, helped document important fossil finds from southern England. Those hoping for strong female contenders will find much to like about the list. But there are also inclusions that highlight the contributions of ethnic minorities and immigrants to British science. The committee which draws up the shortlist will include space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock, author and genetics expert Emily Grossman, editor of the British Journal for the History of Science Simon Schaffer, and theoretical and particle physicist Simon Singh. Nominations can include anyone who worked in any field of science including astronomy, biology, bio-technology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, medical research, physics, technology or zoology. There are currently 330 million Â£50 notes in circulation, with a combined value of Â£16.5bn, the Bank said. A year ago there were doubts that the Â£50 note would continue to exist at all. Fears that the largest denomination note was widely used by criminals and rarely for ordinary purchases prompted a government-led discussion on whether to abolish it. The Â£50 note wasdescribed by Peter Sands, former chief executive of Standard Chartered bank, as the ""currency of corrupt elites, of crime of all sorts and of tax evasion"".

UK warship seizes three tonnes of hashish,"The crew of HMS Dragon pose with the seized drugs Three tonnes of hashish - with a street value of millions of pounds - has been seized in the Gulf. The Royal Navy warship HMS Dragon was on patrol in the Middle East, in a drug-smuggling route known as the ""Hash Highway"", when it came across the suspicious boat. Sailors and Royal Marines boarded the vessel and found 148 bags of hashish hidden on board. It's one of the Royal Navy's biggest drugs busts in the region this year. The bags of drugs seized on the dhow, a type of vessel common in the Middle East, weighed 3,048kg. The seizure, on Sunday, deals ""a major blow to the funding of terrorism"", the Ministry of Defence said. The Hash Highway is the route that smugglers use to transport drugs from Afghanistan to east Africa and the Middle East. Profits are thought to fund criminal networks and terrorist groups. Fast boats were used to travel from HMS Dragon, in the background, to the dhow Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""Alongside keeping key shipping channels safe, countering piracy and providing disaster relief, the Royal Navy makes a significant contribution to global security by tackling the illicit drugs trade. ""The success of HMS Dragon's seizure is the latest blow struck to this nefarious industry."" There were 148 bags of hashish concealed on the sailing vessel Some 260 crew are working on board HMS Dragon The commanding officer of the Royal Navy Type 45 destroyer, Commander Mike Carter-Quinn, said: ""This seizure is testament not only to days of focused hard work, but also to months of effort in preparation for HMS Dragon's operational deployment. ""The Dragons - all 260 of my crew, from the Royal Navy, Royal Marines, and US Coastguard - have done themselves and their families proud and I couldn't be more honoured to serve with them every day."" HMS Dragon, which is based in Portsmouth, is part of the Combined Task Force 150 which looks after security in the world's major shipping lanes.

Nominations for new Â£50 note released,"Rosalind Franklin, Stephen Hawking and Ada Lovelace feature on the official list of more than 800 - so far The Bank of England has released a list of scientists who have been nominated to feature on the new Â£50 note. On the list are computing pioneers Alan Turing and Ada Lovelace, telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell and astronomer Patrick Moore. The Bank received 174,112 nominations, of which 114,000 met the eligibility criteria. To be on the list, the individual must be real, deceased and have contributed to the field of science in the UK. The list, which includes more than 600 men and almost 200 women, includes black holes expert Stephen Hawking, penicillin discoverer Alexander Fleming, father of modern epidemiology John Snow, naturalist and zookeeper Gerald Durrell, fossil pioneer Mary Anning, British-Jamaican business woman and nursing pioneer Mary Seacole and Margaret Thatcher, who was a scientist before becoming prime minister. The late Baroness Thatcher studied chemistry at Oxford University and after graduating joined British Xylonite Plastics in 1947. Two years later she joined J. Lyons & Co in Hammersmith, west London, as a food research chemist in a role that involved testing the quality of cake-fillings and ice-cream, wrote biographer Hugo Young. The politician has been credited with inventing soft serve ice cream - a product Lyons worked on - but ""there is no firm evidence that Thatcher directly assisted in its invention"",according to a Royal Society journal article,external. Bookmakers William Hill have Stephen Hawking as the current favourite, with odds of 7/4, followed by Nobel-prize winning chemist Dorothy Hodgkin 4/1. Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing and Alexander Fleming have odds of 5/1 and Rosalind Franklin, who made important contributions to the understanding of DNA, is at 6/1. Further names will be considered,externalup until nominations close on 14 December. After that the decision will be considered by the Bank's Banknote Character Advisory Committee. Margaret Thatcher working as a research chemist in a picture dated 1950 Paul Rincon, BBC News website science editor The definition of eligibility for this list is pretty broad at the moment, but stricter criteria are likely to be applied once the names are considered by the Bank's committee. Thus, while Margaret Thatcher's contributions to politics are considerable, it remains to be seen whether the committee will judge her an equally significant scientific figure. Hers is just one of the names that some observers will think fall outside some of the stricter definitions of a scientist. But a broad definition of eligibility could assist the promotion of some figures that were overlooked by the establishment in their lifetimes, such as Mary Anning, who, without formal qualifications, helped document important fossil finds from southern England. Those hoping for strong female contenders will find much to like about the list. But there are also inclusions that highlight the contributions of ethnic minorities and immigrants to British science. The committee which draws up the shortlist will include space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock, author and genetics expert Emily Grossman, editor of the British Journal for the History of Science Simon Schaffer, and theoretical and particle physicist Simon Singh. Nominations can include anyone who worked in any field of science including astronomy, biology, bio-technology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, medical research, physics, technology or zoology. There are currently 330 million Â£50 notes in circulation, with a combined value of Â£16.5bn, the Bank said. A year ago there were doubts that the Â£50 note would continue to exist at all. Fears that the largest denomination note was widely used by criminals and rarely for ordinary purchases prompted a government-led discussion on whether to abolish it. The Â£50 note wasdescribed by Peter Sands, former chief executive of Standard Chartered bank, as the ""currency of corrupt elites, of crime of all sorts and of tax evasion"". Nevertheless, in October, ministers announced plans for a new version of the note, to be printed in the UK, which they said would be plastic - so, more durable, secure and harder to forge.

Trump casts doubt on climate change report,"This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world US President Donald Trump has cast doubt on a report by his own government warning of devastating effects from climate change. Asked outside the White House about the findings that unchecked global warming would wreak havoc on the US economy, he said: ""I don't believe it."" The report found that climate change will cost the US hundreds of billions of dollars annually and damage health. The Trump administration has pursued a pro-fossil fuels agenda. The world's leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced and warn that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity. What is climate change? Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' This video can not be played President Trump: ""We're the cleanest we've ever been"" He told reporters on Monday that he had ""read some of"" Friday's report, which was compiled with help from US government agencies and departments. Mr Trump said other countries must take measures to cut their emissions. ""You're going to have to have China and Japan and all of Asia and all these other countries, you know, it [the report] addresses our country,"" he said. ""Right now we're at the cleanest we've ever been and that's very important to me. ""But if we're clean, but every other place on Earth is dirty, that's not so good. ""So I want clean air, I want clean water, very important."" Former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton accused the Trump administration of trying to hide the report.

The Fourth National Climate Assessment,externaloutlines the potential impacts of climate change across every sector of American society. ""With continued growth in emissions at historic rates, annual losses in some economic sectors are projected to reach hundreds of billions of dollars by the end of the century - more than the current gross domestic product (GDP) of many US states,"" the report says. ""Without substantial and sustained global mitigation and regional adaptation efforts, climate change is expected to cause growing losses to American infrastructure and property and impede the rate of economic growth over this century."" The report notes that the effects of climate change are already being felt in communities across the country, including more frequent and intense extreme weather and climate-related events. But it says that projections of future catastrophe could change if society works to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ""to adapt to the changes that will occur"". The report warns that the frequency of wildfires could increase if climate change is unchecked In October,President Trump accused climate change scientists of having a ""political agenda"", telling Fox News he was unconvinced that humans were responsible for the earth's rising temperatures. After taking office he announced the US would withdraw from the Paris climate change agreement, which commits another 187 other countries to keeping rising global temperatures ""well below"" 2C above pre-industrial levels. At the time, Mr Trump said he wanted to negotiate a new ""fair"" deal that would not disadvantage US businesses and workers. During his election campaign in 2016 Mr Trump said climate change was ""a hoax"". However he has since rowed back on that statement saying in a recent interview: ""I don't think it's a hoax, I think there's probably a difference."" Risk of 'Hothouse Earth' despite CO2 cuts Climate and miscarriage in Bangladesh A report released in October by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) - the leading international body evaluating climate change - said it could be stopped only if the world made major, and costly, changes. That means reducing global emissions of CO2 by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, and reducing coal use to almost zero and using up to seven million sq km (2.7 million square miles) for land energy crops. If the world fails to act, the researchers warned, there would be some significant and dangerous changes to our world, including rising sea levels, significant impacts on ocean temperatures and acidity, and the ability to grow crops such as rice, maize and wheat.

EU court rejects Britons' anti-Brexit case,"EU referendum: The Leave vote in 2016 was 52%, while 48% voted Remain EU judges have dismissed a case brought by a 97-year-old war veteran and 12 other emigrant Britons objecting to the UK's Brexit negotiations. Harry Shindler and the others argued that it was wrong for the EU to open the Brexit talks because they and many other British expats had been deprived of a vote in the June 2016 referendum. The 13 plaintiffs have been living outside the UK for more than 15 years. The opening of Brexit talks did not infringe their rights, the ruling said. The EU's General Court in Luxembourg said the EU Council decision authorising the opening of Brexit negotiations ""does not directly affect the legal situation of the applicants"". A French lawyer representing the expat group, Julien Fouchet, said they would appeal to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the top EU court. Allow Twitter content?

UK Prime Minister Theresa May is now battling to persuade UK politicians to acceptthe Brexit deal she clinched with EU leaders on Sunday. The UK government is committed to exiting the EU next March. The EU Council - the body representing all the national governments - argued that opening Brexit talks was ""merely a preparatory act"" which did not affect citizens' rights. According to the court, those rights are likely to be affected, however, when the UK withdraws from the EU, with or without a Brexit deal. A guide to where we are with Brexit Nineteen months of wrangling - and that's just a taster I'll get vote by 100th birthday - expat Would Brexit violate UK citizens' rights? Mr Shindler has been struggling for years to win long-term expats the right to vote Mr Shindler lives in Italy, where he served with British forces in World War Two. There is a 15-year time limit on British expats being able to vote in UK elections or referendums. In May 2016, just before the Brexit vote, Mr Shindler and another British expat, Jacquelyn MacLennan, failed to persuade UK Supreme Court judges to change the law and enable them to vote. On Tuesday the ECJ is to hear a case brought by anti-Brexit Scottish politicians and activists, who want legal clarity on whether the UK can unilaterally revoke Article 50, the EU withdrawal procedure.

Murder accused abused girl 'to shame her',"Bishop was acquitted of the murders in 1987 but now faces a second trial A convicted paedophile has told jurors he molested a girl to ""belittle and shame"" her after he was cleared of murdering two nine-year-olds. Russell Bishop, 52, is on trial for the second time for killing Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway. He denies sexually assaulting and strangling the pair in Wild Park, Brighton, in October 1986. In 1990, Bishop was convicted of abducting, sexually assaulting and trying to kill a seven-year-old. The trial at the Old Bailey was halted on Monday when Bishop became agitated while being questioned about his ""sexual interest"" in children. Karen Hadaway (left) and Nicola Fellows went missing after they had gone out to play Under cross-examination he insisted he was not a paedophile but was just ""bloody angry"" at a hate campaign against him and thought ""I might as well do it"". Prosecutor Brian Altman QC asked: ""This was all about revenge?"" The defendant replied: ""Partly."" Mr Altman said: ""So the attempted murder of [the girl] was born out of revenge by virtue of the three years of the hate you and your family suffered? ""You are portraying yourself as a victim. This offence was all about sexual gratification and you are a paedophile."" Bishop denied it. Mr Altman continued: ""You enjoy controlling children and one aspect of your control of children, particularly girls, is sexual gratification."" Bishop said: ""No, not in any way."" The girls' bodies were found in a woodland den in Wild Park near Brighton The prosecutor asked: ""Why did you choose a young girl who was two years younger than the age of the two girls you were accused of murdering?"" Bishop said: ""It could have been anyone. Through the psychological trauma of the hate campaign and what everyone else was saying it came out in that behaviour."" The defendant said he assaulted the girl to ""belittle and shame her because I was bloody angry at everyone - at her and everyone who had done that to me"". Mr Altman asserted: ""This is all rubbish. This is all lies. ""You attacked that young girl because you had a sexual interest in children. It had nothing to do with three years of hate but everything to do with Russell Bishop and your character, didn't it? ""There are very good reasons for what I also suggest are obvious and striking similarities between the two offences because the killer of those two girls in October 1986 was the same person who attacked the [seven-year-old] in 1990. And that man is you."" Russell Bishop sat in the witness box wearing a beige jacket and glasses as his account was challenged by the prosecution for the first time. The girls' mothers listened from the back of the court as the 52-year-old denied being a paedophile. Did he have a sexual interest in children?, Brian Altman QC asked. ""No,"" Bishop replied. ""You enjoy controlling children for sexual gratification?"" said the prosecutor. ""Not in any way,"" Bishop said. At one point Bishop objected to what was being put to him by Brian Altman QC. He turned to the judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, and asked: ""Excuse me, is this legal?"". The judge replied: ""Yes it is and if it isn't I'll stop it."" After less than one and a half hours of evidence and a break the jury was brought back into court expecting to see Russell Bishop back in the witness box. But he wasn't. He was in the glass-sided dock. The jury wasn't to hear any more from him. They were told by the judge he had declined to give any further evidence in his defence. The judge told the jury: ""You will observe immediately, of course, Mr Bishop is in the dock, not the witness box. ""That is because he has declined to give any further evidence. As you have gathered, I have given him time to consider that but that is ultimately his position. ""I will give you directions in due course as to how you should approach that."" It marked an unexpected early end to the jurors' court day. The trial continues. Police 'destroyed' murder accused Dead girl 'not assaulted months earlier' Sexually explicit notes halt murder trial Man 'not party to daughter's killing' DNA samples 'linked to murder suspect' Sweatshirt 'linked murder accused to girls' Police 'pinned expert to wall' jury told Man 'murdered two schoolgirls in 1986' Girls' deaths 'similar to child sex attack' Murder jury retraces girls' last footsteps DNA 'links man to girls' murders' Murder accused points finger at girl's dad Jury hears how girls' bodies were found Girls' bodies 'seemed thrown together' Murder-accused offers EastEnders alibi HM Courts Service Theatre holds first-ever Pay What You Can lottery Major comedians to hold fundraising night Greens call for voters to have their say on âdevolutionâ plans Extra storey and penthouse flat approved by planners Thanks to the public for making the right choice of NHS service this week amidst cold weather alert Driver accused of running over Sussex manâs head with 4x4 as murder trial continues Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Police officer follows grandad's footsteps,"Clarence Sheard was the first officer to join the newly-formed Motorised Division in Rotherham, pictured here in what is thought was the force's first police car A South Yorkshire Police officer is patrolling the same beat as his grandfather, 90 years later. Insp James Sheard joined the force in 2007 and now works the same patch in Rotherham town centre. Clarence Sheard was the first officer in Rotherham Borough Police's new ""Motorised Division"" in the 1930s, having previously investigated gangs. Insp Sheard, 40, said: ""I'm so proud to be following in Clarence's footsteps, albeit in a very different Rotherham!"" Mr Sheard discovered photographs of his grandfather in police uniform and patrol car while helping his daughter on a school project about family history and Armistice Day. ""I always knew about Clarence's time with the police, but I didn't know much about his role in the Motorised Division until my dad dug out the old photos,"" Insp Sheard said. Insp James Sheard in his 2018 police patrol car ""Not many people could drive back then, but he'd had driving lessons in the Army which could be why he was first behind the wheel of the new car."" More Yorkshire stories Born in 1904, Clarence joined the Rotherham force in the early 1930s after having served in the Royal Artillery. When World War II broke out, he eventually re-joined the Army as a gunnery instructor. When the war ended, he worked in industry rather than returning to the force. Mr Sheard said his grandfather had inspired him to join the police and he is the only person in his family to follow in his footsteps.

Parties keen on Brexit TV debate,"Theresa May was criticised for missing a TV debate ahead of the 2017 general election Theresa May faces calls from several parties to be included if she decides to hold a TV debate on her Brexit deal. Labour said Jeremy Corbyn would ""relish"" going head-to-head with the PM, in response to reports she wanted to challenge him to a TV showdown. The SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens have demanded to be involved to ensure a range of views is reflected. Meanwhile, Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said a Brexiteer must be on the panel. No 10 has declined to comment. A spokesman told reporters the prime minister ""debates the leaders of the opposition parties regularly on Brexit"" and was doing so again in the House of Commons on Monday afternoon. However, he did not deny the option was being considered. May and Corbyn clash over Brexit deal A guide to where we are with Brexit Can May get Brexit deal through Commons?

And Plaid Cymru echoed the SNP's views that the leaders of the two main parties could not represent the British public as a whole: ""It can hardly be much of a debate when both of them are committed to Brexit."" Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable demanded to be involved, pointing out that neither the Tories nor Labour had called for another Brexit referendum. And Green Party MP Caroline Lucas, who is also pushing for a new referendum, said any debate ""must be cross-party, featuring a diverse range of voices representing every nation, as well as every stance on this deal and our relationship with the EU"". Senior Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin told the BBC's Politics Live Brexiteers would have to be represented. Referring to the respective party leaders' stances before the 2016 In-Out referendum, he said: ""Corbyn was for Remain, Theresa May was for Remain. The 52% who voted Leave have got to be represented in those debates."" Faced with strong opposition from both Leave and Remain supporters in the Commons, including from many in her own party, the prime minister is focused on convincing the public her deal is ""for the good of our United Kingdom"". In a""letter to the nation""she set out why she would fight ""heart and soul"" for her vision of Brexit, and in recent weeks has responded directly to the public via the BBC News Channel, Radio 5 live and LBC radio. The apparent appetite from Downing Street for Theresa May to go head-to-head with Jeremy Corbyn is a turnaround from last year when she declined to to take part TV debates during the general election campaign.

"May defends Brexit deal amid MPs' attacksThe PM faces criticism of her deal in the Commons - as Labour's leader calls for a ""plan B"".UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Theresa May on Northern Ireland backstop: ""This is an insurance policy no-one wants to use."" Theresa May has defended her proposed Brexit deal in the Commons in the face of sustained criticism from the opposition and many Conservative MPs. She said the deal delivered on the result of the EU referendum - and MPs will get to vote on it on 11 December. But she admitted she was not ""entirely happy"" with the ""backstop"" contingency plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn said ""ploughing on"" with a deal opposed by the public and MPs was an ""act of national self-harm"". The Labour leader suggested Parliament would have ""little choice"" but to reject the deal when MPs vote on it. A host of former Tory cabinet ministers, including Iain Duncan Smith, Boris Johnson, Owen Paterson, Michael Fallon and Dominic Grieve, also said the deal was unsatisfactory, during the two-and-half hour debate. Where do MPs stand on Brexit deal? May regrets EU 'queue-jumpers' comment Winning over the Commons: An impossible task for PM? A simple guide to where we are with Brexit Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable joined a number of Labour MPs and the Green Party's Caroline Lucas in calling for the prime minister to back another EU referendum ""with the option of remaining in the European Union"". Mrs May rejected all of these calls and told Sir Vince it was time to ""deliver on the choice the British people made"" in the 2016 referendum. Mrs May faces an uphill struggle to persuade MPs to accept the terms of thewithdrawal agreement- and apolitical declaration on future relationsbetween the EU and UK - approved by EU leaders on Sunday. Mrs May said there had been ""give and take"" in the 19-month negotiations but the final agreement ""delivered for the British people"" by regaining control of laws, money and borders. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We are proud Gibraltar is British and our position on sovereignty has not, and will not, change."" She acknowledged concerns over arrangements to avoid the return of physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which could see the UK entering a customs arrangement with the EU -known as the ""backstop"". Katya Adler: Nineteen months of wrangling Reality Check: Theresa May's Brexit letter What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Parties keen to join a Brexit TV debate The ""backstop"" was an ""insurance policy no-one wants to use,"" Mrs May told MPs, and she insisted the UK would have the right to determine whether it came into force if the UK's future relationship was not settled by the end of 2020, as she hoped it would. A backstop of some kind would be required, she said, due to the UK's obligation to uphold the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland peace deal signed 20 years ago, adding ""there is no deal that comes without a backstop and without a backstop there is no deal"". She also insisted she had stood firm in the face of repeated EU attempts to link access to British waters for their fishermen to future trade arrangements, amid claims from the SNP and others that her deal had ""sold out"" Scotland's fishermen. The PM also said she regretted saying in a speech last week that Brexit would prevent EU migrants ""jumping the queue"". The comments sparked an angry backlash from EU citizens living in the UK. The Labour leader said Mrs May had brought home a ""botched deal"" that would ""leave the UK worse off"" and that ""ploughing on is not stoic, it is an act of national self-harm"". He said the prime minister needed a ""plan B"" involving a permanent customs arrangement and stronger employment and environmental protections, which is Labour's Brexit policy. ""This deal it is not a plan for Britain's future,"" he added and that was why MPs had ""little choice"" but to reject it. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Even the prime minister's own cabinet can't bring themselves to sell this deal."" Caroline Flint, one of the few Labour MPs who have signalled they could vote for the deal, urged Mrs May and Mr Corbyn to hold face-to-face talks to reach an accommodation acceptable to both parties. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had ""no plans"" to reach out personally to Labour MPs who might back a deal, although her chief of staff had invited opposition MPs to a briefing on the agreement on Monday evening. The SNP's Iain Blackford said the agreement was ""full of ifs and buts"" which would result in Scottish fishermen being ""sold out"". And the DUP's Nigel Dodds said the backstop ""was bad for the United Kingdom and bad for the economy"" and absolute certainty was needed over its legal application. Please upgrade your browser Tory backbencher Mark Francois was among a host of MPs to urge PM to think again, claiming the agreement was ""as dead as a dodo"" and ""would not get through"" Parliament. ""The House of Commons has never surrendered to anyone,"" he said. ""It won't start now."" And former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, previously regarded as a loyalist, said it would be a ""huge gamble"" for the UK to ""surrender our vote and our veto without any firm commitment to frictionless trade"" outside the EU. Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it was ""hard to see"" how the deal could provide certainty to business when cabinet ministers were saying different things about what they wanted. Following the debate, Mrs May was due to host more than 100 investors and employers from sectors including manufacturing, retail, food and drink and financial services to discuss the Brexit plan. This video can not be played Will MPs vote for Brexit? Analysis by the BBC's Iain Watson Theresa May told MPs her plan was in the national interest, delivering on the referendum result while protecting the economy. But if this debate is a taste of things to come, the prime minister is in big trouble. One MP after another, Remainers and Leavers alike, and across all parties, spoke out against Mrs May's plan. Indeed rarely can a prime minister have received such a mauling. Mrs May now has just over two weeks to try to rally support in Parliament. Asked repeatedly by MPs what the ""Plan B"" was if she lost the vote, she avoided a direct answer.

Mars probe set for '7 minutes of terror'The InSight mission is about to make the hair-raising descent to the surface of the Red Planet.Science & EnvironmentComments,"This video can not be played Nasa Mars InSight lander mission to teach us more about Earth The American space agency Nasa will attempt to put another robotic probe on Mars later. TheInSight lander,externalis being targeted at a flat plain just north of the planet's equator called Elysium Planitia. It carries a suite of instruments - many of them from Europe - to try to determine the rocky world's internal structure. Signals from the probe confirming its safe touchdown should be received at 19:53 GMT, give or take a minute. As with previous surface missions, InSight must survive the ""seven minutes of terror"" - the time it takes for a probe entering Mars' thin atmosphere at hypersonic speedÂ to slow to walking pace and gently put itself on the ground. Many have tried; most have failed. ""As humanity, as explorers - we're batting at less than 50%,"" said Nasa's science chief, Thomas Zurbuchen. ""Going to Mars is really, really hard."" Mars InSight: Beating the odds James Tuttle Keane's guide to Mars' interior Nasa robot to target ancient lake crater InSight has some heritage on its side. It will be using the exact same combination of heatshield, parachute and retro-rockets that proved so successful in positioning Nasa's Phoenix probe in Mars ""Arctic"" in 2007. Engineers here at mission control on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory campus in California have a quiet confidence in the outcome as a result. That said, they are also very aware of the statistics. ""We've done all the preparations that we can possibly think of to make sure that our entry, descent and landing (EDL) goes as smoothly as we can imagine,"" explained project manager Tom Hoffman. ""But Mars as a planet does not always behave. I think our team is ready; I think the spacecraft is ready. We just don't know if Mars is ready,"" he told BBC News. The EDL engineers have been closely watching the weather on the Red Planet, looking especially for any dust storms and evidence of high winds that could complicate InSight's passage through the atmosphere. The probe's trajectory was altered ever so slightly on Sunday, to ensure it is lined up perfectly with the targeted landing zone on Elysium Planitia. There is very little now that Nasa teams can do to influence the outcome. The whole process is necessarily automated because commands take eight minutes to traverse the 146 million km distance between Mars and Earth. You cannot use a joystick to control a far-off probe. InSight will transmit messages as it heads down to the surface. These will be relayed back to Earth via two small satellites flying overhead. Radio telescopes at Earth will also be tracking the probe's progress just in case the primary communications link falls over. Assuming it lands in one piece, InSight is programmed to take a quick picture of its immediate surroundings. This could come back within the first 30 minutes on the surface. InSight will be using technologies that were proven on the 2007 Phoenix mission This will be the first probe to dedicate its investigations to understanding Mars' interior. Scientists want to know how the world is constructed - from its core to its crust. InSight has three principal experiments to achieve this goal. The first is a package ofFranco-British seismometers,externalthat will be lifted on to the surface to listen for ""Marsquakes"". These vibrations will reveal where the rock layers are and what they are made of. A German-led ""mole"" system,externalwill burrow up to 5m into the ground to take the planet's temperature. This will give a sense of how active Mars still is. Andthe third experiment will use radio transmissions,externalto very precisely determine how the planet is wobbling on its axis. Deputy project scientist Suzanne Smrekar uses this analogy: ""If you take a raw egg and a cooked egg and you spin them, they wobble differently because of the distribution of liquid in the interior. And today we really don't know if the core of Mars is liquid or solid, and how big that core is. InSight will give us this information."" Scientists understand very well how Earth's interior is structured, and they have some good models to describe the initiation of this architecture at the Solar System's birth more than 4.5 billion years ago. But Earth is one data point and Mars will give researchers a different perspective on how a rocky planet can be assembled and evolve through time. InSight chief scientist Bruce Banerdt said: ""The small details in how planets evolve are what we think make the difference between a place like Earth where you can go on vacation and get a tan, and a place like Venus where you'll burn in seconds or a place like Mars where you'll freeze to death.""

Bronze sculpture will be 'UK's largest'The nine-and-a-half-tonne installation will stand 7m tall and is inspired by an actor's pose.Devon,"This is what Messenger will look like when the 7m (23ft) high sculpture is installed A piece of art inspired by an actor's on-stage pose will be the UK's largest cast bronze sculpture when it goes on display next year. The 7m (23ft) sculpture, called Messenger, will be installed outside the Theatre Royal Plymouth. Sculptor Joseph Hillier was inspired to create it by an actor rehearsing Shakespeare's Othello at the theatre. He said its name refers to the ""pivotal"" role of a performer to ""breathe life into words"". The sculpture, commissioned by the theatre, had a working title of Bianca after the character whose ""split-second pose"" is the basis for the piece. ""This work offers a young, powerful woman, a potent force about to transform the world by her actions,"" Mr Hillier said. ""The actor carries the voice of her playwright or director - she carried a message. ""It's a metaphor for what great theatre does,"" he added. Latest news from Devon and Cornwall The sculpture is too large to be put together inside the foundry in Wales More than 200 panels are currently being welded together by ""master craftsmen and women"" in Wales More than 200 bronze panels are being welded together at the Castle Fine Art Foundry in Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, Powys, using the technique of lost wax casting. The sculpture will weigh nine and a half tonnes and is too large to be put together inside the foundry. About 30 craftspeople are involved in the sculpture's creation Messenger will be installed outside the Theatre Royal in Plymouth Cornish sculptor Mr Hillier said he was ""taken aback"" when he first saw the completed leg section. ""It's a really big piece - if I lay on the floor, I'm the size of one of the feet,"" he said. It is set to be unveiled at the Theatre Royal in spring next year as part of its Â£7.5m regeneration project. Visitors will be able to walk under Messenger's body ""into the theatre, like an archway"". Sculptor Joseph Hillier used the technique of lost wax casting to create the piece The Theatre Royal said it is ""by far"" the UK's largest bronze sculpture by volume, at 25.6 cubic metres It was created using 3D scans taken from the actor It is 7m (23ft) high, 8.7m (29ft) wide and 5,5m (18ft) deep It will be made of more than 200 individual bronze panels Each panel weighs about 35kg (77lbs) In total, 30 craftspeople have worked on the construction Theatre Royal Plymouth ""Desperate need"" plea as Exeter riverside site set for transformation Warning over Devon devolution 'power grab' Urgent crunch talks called on future of Plymouth Destructive Devon town centre trees to be dealt with Community cafÃ© opened doors on Christmas Day for charity Jazz and blues festival to introduce new food area Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

May regrets 'queue-jump' comment,"This video can not be played Theresa May says: âI should not have used that language in that speechâ Theresa May has said she regrets saying EU workers will no longer be able to ""jump the queue"" after Brexit. ""I should not have used that language in that speech,"" she told MPs during a debate on her Brexit deal with the EU. But she said she stood by her point that migrants should be ""judged"" on their skills not ""where they come from"". SNP MP Philippa Whitford had called on the prime minister to apologise for her ""thoughtless and insulting comments"". Backlash over May's 'queue jumping' comment May defends Brexit deal amid MPs' attacks ""Last week the prime minister managed to insult and upset over three million European citizens, who live and work in this country,"" said the Central Ayrshire MP. ""Over 150,000 of them - like my German husband, a GP here for over 30 years - felt absolutely thrown away, when they have spent decades here looking after us when we are ill."" Philippa Whitford called on the prime minister to apologise Mrs May said she had always strived to protect EU nationals' rights during Brexit negotiations - and had ""delivered"" on that in the withdrawal agreement she agreed with the EU on Sunday. The PM said the point she was trying to make was a ""simple one"", that ""most people here in the United Kingdom"" want to see migrants ""coming and making a contribution"". ""They want people to be judged on the skills and the contributions to this country rather than simply on where they come from,"" she added. Mrs May made the controversial remarks, which sparked a backlash, in a speech to the CBI, in which she vowed to end free movement after Brexit. This video can not be played Theresa May: EU nationals won't be able to 'jump the queue' after Brexit She said: ""It will no longer be the case that EU nationals, regardless of the skills or experience they have to offer, can jump the queue ahead of engineers from Sydney or software developers from Delhi. ""Instead of a system based on where a person is from, we will have one that is built around the talents and skills a person has to offer."" SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the PM's words were ""disgraceful"" and EU citizens living in the UK said the comments would fuel hate crimes against them. The government says it wants the estimated 3.5 million citizens of other EU nations already living in the UK to stay after Brexit but they will have to apply for leave to remain.

UK summers could be over 5C warmer by 2070,"The heat wave experienced across the UK in the summer of 2018 could become the norm In its first major update on climate change in almost 10 years, the Met Office has warned of significant temperature rises in the decades ahead. TheUK Climate Projections 2018,externalstudy is the most up to date assessment of how the UK may change over this century. It says that under the highest emissions scenario, summer temperatures could be 5.4C hotter by 2070. The chances of a summer as warm as 2018 are around 50% by 2050. Is China behind global coal power surge? Dire warning on US climate change impacts Climate and miscarriage in Bangladesh One key figure in the report is the rise in summer temperatures  - up to 5.4C warmer than the average between 1981-2000. This would only happen, according to the Met Office, if the world was to continue increasing emissions of carbon dioxide rather than reducing them as most governments intend. So for a central location in England like Nottingham, the Met Office says that, under a high emissions future (where greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere over coming decades are at the high end of all possible scenarios), temperatures could rise by between 1.1C to 5.8C. For other central locations in the nations of the UK, there are similar ranges of projected temperature rises. In Scotland, at Pitlochry, the summer rise ranges from 0.6C to 4.8C warmer. Around Aberystwyth in Wales, they range from 0.9C to 5.9C warmer while Cookstown in Northern Ireland could be 0.8 to 4.9C hotter. But even under a low emissions scenario, the Met Office says that the UK will see an increase in the average yearly temperature of up to 2.3C by 2100. Summers as warm as the one just past, are likely to be very common, with a 50% chance of occurring. ""With really hot summers like this year's - in the 1990s that was a less than 5% chance of getting those,"" said Met Office chief scientist Dr Stephen Belcher. ""Now we are up to a 15-20% chance. By 2050 that's a normal summerâ¦By late century it depends what we do about greenhouse gases."" The UK faces wetter winters and drier summers These warmer summers of the future are likely to be much drier too, with average summer rainfall dropping by 47% by 2070. Winters could be warmer by up to 4.2C but they will also see more rainfall, increasing by up to 35% by 2070, under the worst emissions scenario. Raised sea levels are also one of the consequences of a warmer world and according to the report, they could increase by 1.15 metres in London by 2100. The report says the UK is set to see an increase in both the frequency and magnitude of extreme water levels. Just a few weeks ago the UK's Committee on Climate Change (CCC)warned that by 2080 up to 1.2 million homesmay be at increased risk of flooding. ""The UK18 projections are further evidence that we will see more extreme weather in the future - we need to prepare and adapt now, climate change impacts are already being felt with the record books being re-written,"" said Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency. ""The Environment Agency cannot wall up the country, but will be at the forefront - protecting communities, building resilience, and responding to incidents."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove praised the new study as an ""invaluable tool"" as it will help with decisions on large infrastructure. ""It is clear that the planet and its weather patterns are changing before our eyes,"" he said, launching the report at the Science Museum in London. ""We know, more than ever before, the urgency of acting."" This video can not be played Why there were so many heatwaves around the world in 2018 Mr Gove has been stressing that Britain has a good track record on climate change, having cut emissions by 40% since 1990 while continuing to grow the economy. However, other political figures say that the new report underlines how much more needs to be done. ""These projections paint a devastating picture of what climate breakdown means for the UK if we continue down the path we're on,"" said Green party MP Caroline Lucas. ""Michael Gove's vague talk of mitigating the worst impacts of floods, droughts and storms are far from reassuring."" Some researchers were also critical of the report, saying that it gave the impression that scientists can give more detail about the future than is possible. ""It (the report) feeds our desire for specifics and for high resolution pictures,"" said Prof David Stainforth from the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and the environment. ""It is valuable in bringing to life the types of changes we want to avoid. It is, however, based on research at the edge of scientific understanding, using methods whose reliability has been questioned. It is not reliable and robust in the way that knowledge of the climate change threat is, so it creates its own risks.""

InSight chief scientist Bruce Banerdt said: ""The small details in how planets evolve are what we think make the difference between a place like Earth where you can go on vacation and get a tan, and a place like Venus where you'll burn in seconds or a place like Mars where you'll freeze to death.""

Bronze sculpture will be 'UK's largest',"This is what Messenger will look like when the 7m (23ft) high sculpture is installed A piece of art inspired by an actor's on-stage pose will be the UK's largest cast bronze sculpture when it goes on display next year. The 7m (23ft) sculpture, called Messenger, will be installed outside the Theatre Royal Plymouth. Sculptor Joseph Hillier was inspired to create it by an actor rehearsing Shakespeare's Othello at the theatre. He said its name refers to the ""pivotal"" role of a performer to ""breathe life into words"". The sculpture, commissioned by the theatre, had a working title of Bianca after the character whose ""split-second pose"" is the basis for the piece. ""This work offers a young, powerful woman, a potent force about to transform the world by her actions,"" Mr Hillier said. ""The actor carries the voice of her playwright or director - she carried a message. ""It's a metaphor for what great theatre does,"" he added. Latest news from Devon and Cornwall The sculpture is too large to be put together inside the foundry in Wales More than 200 panels are currently being welded together by ""master craftsmen and women"" in Wales More than 200 bronze panels are being welded together at the Castle Fine Art Foundry in Llanrhaeadr-ym-Mochnant, Powys, using the technique of lost wax casting. The sculpture will weigh nine and a half tonnes and is too large to be put together inside the foundry. About 30 craftspeople are involved in the sculpture's creation Messenger will be installed outside the Theatre Royal in Plymouth Cornish sculptor Mr Hillier said he was ""taken aback"" when he first saw the completed leg section. ""It's a really big piece - if I lay on the floor, I'm the size of one of the feet,"" he said. It is set to be unveiled at the Theatre Royal in spring next year as part of its Â£7.5m regeneration project. Visitors will be able to walk under Messenger's body ""into the theatre, like an archway"". Sculptor Joseph Hillier used the technique of lost wax casting to create the piece The Theatre Royal said it is ""by far"" the UK's largest bronze sculpture by volume, at 25.6 cubic metres It was created using 3D scans taken from the actor It is 7m (23ft) high, 8.7m (29ft) wide and 5,5m (18ft) deep It will be made of more than 200 individual bronze panels Each panel weighs about 35kg (77lbs) In total, 30 craftspeople have worked on the construction Theatre Royal Plymouth ""Desperate need"" plea as Exeter riverside site set for transformation Warning over Devon devolution 'power grab' Urgent crunch talks called on future of Plymouth Destructive Devon town centre trees to be dealt with Community cafÃ© opened doors on Christmas Day for charity Jazz and blues festival to introduce new food area Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

In an email, seen by BBC Wales, staff were told by registrar Andrew Rhodes, that the matters being looked into did not concern ""the academic performance of the university or its financial wellbeing"". Mr Rhodes is to take on vice-chancellor duties on an interim basis. He added: ""I appreciate that a lot of questions will arise from this message, but it will not be possible to provide more detail at this time.

More staff hired in shrinking pub industry,"Food is helping boost employment in pubs and is pulling in the customers Pubs are employing more people than 10 years ago, despite almost a quarter of them having closed over the same period, official figures show. According to research by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) this could be because an increasing number now serve food, which is more labour intensive. More than 11,000 pubs have closed, leaving around 39,000 across the UK, the ONS said. Some areas on the edges of big cities have seen pub numbers halve since 2001. The ONS found that the number of jobs in pubs dipped during the economic downturn. However, employment in the sector picked up subsequently and there are now 6% more jobs in pubs and bars than there were in 2008. The largest increases have been in bigger pubs (those with 10 or more employees). This may be because serving food requires more waiting and kitchen staff. Pubs closing at rate of 18 a week The rise in employment has been more pronounced in rural pubs, where in 2018 total employment in England and Wales is 17% higher compared with 2008. In contrast, employment in urban pubs rose by only 4% over the same period. But most jobs in the sector are low paid with around 70% of workers in pubs and bars being paid less than the Living Wage Foundation's recommended Living Wage. This is set at Â£10.55 per hour in London and Â£9 per hour elsewhere. The ONS's analysis shows it is small pubs that are disappearing, while the bigger chains are consolidating around larger bars. The closure of British pubs is a well-known story. Organisations such as the Campaign for Real Ale and the British Beer and Pub Association have charted the disappearance of pubs for many years, citing reasons including rising overheads, the smoking ban and the rise of cheaper alcohol sold in supermarkets. Barking and Dagenham, Newham and Luton - all in and around London - now have fewer than half the pubs they did in 2001. There are far fewer pubs in some towns around Manchester, including Burnley, Bolton and Rochdale, as well as on the outskirts of Birmingham, in areas including Sandwell, Dudley and Walsall. On the other hand, locations popular with tourists, including the Highlands of Scotland, Blackpool and Brighton, either have seen pub numbers increase or hold steady. The ONS's report, called ""Economies of ale"", includes an interactive map,external, which can be used to see changes in pub numbers and employment in your area.

May and Corbyn clash over Brexit deal,"This video can not be played Theresa May on Northern Ireland backstop: ""This is an insurance policy no-one wants to use."" Theresa May has defended her proposed Brexit deal in the Commons in the face of sustained criticism from the opposition and many Conservative MPs. She said the deal delivered on the result of the EU referendum - and MPs will get to vote on it on 11 December. But she admitted she was not ""entirely happy"" with the ""backstop"" contingency plan to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Jeremy Corbyn said ""ploughing on"" with a deal opposed by the public and MPs was an ""act of national self-harm"". The Labour leader suggested Parliament would have ""little choice"" but to reject the deal when MPs vote on it. A host of former Tory cabinet ministers, including Iain Duncan Smith, Boris Johnson, Owen Paterson, Michael Fallon and Dominic Grieve, also said the deal was unsatisfactory, during the two-and-half hour debate. Where do MPs stand on Brexit deal? May regrets EU 'queue-jumpers' comment Winning over the Commons: An impossible task for PM? A simple guide to where we are with Brexit Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable joined a number of Labour MPs and the Green Party's Caroline Lucas in calling for the prime minister to back another EU referendum ""with the option of remaining in the European Union"". Mrs May rejected all of these calls and told Sir Vince it was time to ""deliver on the choice the British people made"" in the 2016 referendum. Mrs May faces an uphill struggle to persuade MPs to accept the terms of thewithdrawal agreement- and apolitical declaration on future relationsbetween the EU and UK - approved by EU leaders on Sunday. Mrs May said there had been ""give and take"" in the 19-month negotiations but the final agreement ""delivered for the British people"" by regaining control of laws, money and borders. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""We are proud Gibraltar is British and our position on sovereignty has not, and will not, change."" She acknowledged concerns over arrangements to avoid the return of physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which could see the UK entering a customs arrangement with the EU -known as the ""backstop"". Katya Adler: Nineteen months of wrangling Reality Check: Theresa May's Brexit letter What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Parties keen to join a Brexit TV debate The ""backstop"" was an ""insurance policy no-one wants to use,"" Mrs May told MPs, and she insisted the UK would have the right to determine whether it came into force if the UK's future relationship was not settled by the end of 2020, as she hoped it would. A backstop of some kind would be required, she said, due to the UK's obligation to uphold the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland peace deal signed 20 years ago, adding ""there is no deal that comes without a backstop and without a backstop there is no deal"". She also insisted she had stood firm in the face of repeated EU attempts to link access to British waters for their fishermen to future trade arrangements, amid claims from the SNP and others that her deal had ""sold out"" Scotland's fishermen. The PM also said she regretted saying in a speech last week that Brexit would prevent EU migrants ""jumping the queue"". The comments sparked an angry backlash from EU citizens living in the UK. The Labour leader said Mrs May had brought home a ""botched deal"" that would ""leave the UK worse off"" and that ""ploughing on is not stoic, it is an act of national self-harm"". He said the prime minister needed a ""plan B"" involving a permanent customs arrangement and stronger employment and environmental protections, which is Labour's Brexit policy. ""This deal it is not a plan for Britain's future,"" he added and that was why MPs had ""little choice"" but to reject it. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Even the prime minister's own cabinet can't bring themselves to sell this deal."" Caroline Flint, one of the few Labour MPs who have signalled they could vote for the deal, urged Mrs May and Mr Corbyn to hold face-to-face talks to reach an accommodation acceptable to both parties. A Downing Street spokesman said the prime minister had ""no plans"" to reach out personally to Labour MPs who might back a deal, although her chief of staff had invited opposition MPs to a briefing on the agreement on Monday evening. The SNP's Iain Blackford said the agreement was ""full of ifs and buts"" which would result in Scottish fishermen being ""sold out"". And the DUP's Nigel Dodds said the backstop ""was bad for the United Kingdom and bad for the economy"" and absolute certainty was needed over its legal application. Please upgrade your browser Tory backbencher Mark Francois was among a host of MPs to urge PM to think again, claiming the agreement was ""as dead as a dodo"" and ""would not get through"" Parliament. ""The House of Commons has never surrendered to anyone,"" he said. ""It won't start now."" And former defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon, previously regarded as a loyalist, said it would be a ""huge gamble"" for the UK to ""surrender our vote and our veto without any firm commitment to frictionless trade"" outside the EU. Former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said it was ""hard to see"" how the deal could provide certainty to business when cabinet ministers were saying different things about what they wanted. Following the debate, Mrs May was due to host more than 100 investors and employers from sectors including manufacturing, retail, food and drink and financial services to discuss the Brexit plan. This video can not be played Will MPs vote for Brexit? Analysis by the BBC's Iain Watson Theresa May told MPs her plan was in the national interest, delivering on the referendum result while protecting the economy. But if this debate is a taste of things to come, the prime minister is in big trouble. One MP after another, Remainers and Leavers alike, and across all parties, spoke out against Mrs May's plan. Indeed rarely can a prime minister have received such a mauling. Mrs May now has just over two weeks to try to rally support in Parliament. Asked repeatedly by MPs what the ""Plan B"" was if she lost the vote, she avoided a direct answer.

Who is Matthew Hedges?,"Matthew Hedges has written about defence, intelligence and the Middle East Friends, family and colleagues of the British academic jailed in the United Arab Emirates after being accused of spying are united in one thing: They say he is not an intelligence agent. But who is he? Matthew Hedges is no stranger to the Middle East. He had spent time there when he was younger and had worked in the region for several years. But on a research trip for his PhD in May he was arrested. On 21 November he wasjailed for lifefor ""spying for or on behalf of"" the UK government, buthe was granted a presidential pardon and freedfive days later. Here is what we know about the man who his family and friends insist is just an ""innocent victim"". The 31-year-old is a PhD student at Durham University but his status belies an established career in research and consultancy. He describes himself as ""an intelligence analyst at a cyber-intelligence firm in the UK"" and has been an advisor for consultancy firm Gulf State Analytics since January 2016. Corporate investigations, due diligence and research also appear in his areas of freelance consultancy expertise. His research covers subjects such as defence, security, international affairs and military policy in the Middle East. Daniela Tejada and Matthew Hedges are reported to have been married for two years Since starting work on his PhD at Durham University he has been employed as an associate researcher at the university's Institute for Middle Eastern and Islamic Studies (IMEIS). He is married to publicist Daniela Tejada who he reportedly met while studying at the University of Exeter. Hedges was born in Surrey and went to the independent Cranleigh boarding school near Guildford. He spent his school and university holidays in the UAE with his family who worked there. Hedges attended Cranleigh boarding school Although relatives say he can neither speak nor read Arabic, his PhD supervisor in Durham said he ""knew the country very well"". Prof Clive Jones said he was ""very much a known face"", certainly among the ""Emirati political elite"". Many of those he went to the UAE to talk to for his PhD were people he knew personally or had worked for. This area of the world has clearly piqued his interest. Both his degree from the University of Bradford and his masters at the University of Exeter explored the Middle East and international relations. His MA thesis was entitled ""What has driven the UAE's military spending since 2001"". Latterly living in Exeter, Hedges has been a PhD student at Durham University since 2015, where he has been researching the effects of the Arab Spring on the Gulf states. His specific interest is the region's ""evolving national security strategy"". Other research interests including civil-military relations, Middle Eastern politics, security studies and political economy are listed in his Durham University biography. In a joint statement with the University of Exeter, his university said there had been ""no evidence whatsoever that Matt was conducting anything other than legitimate academic research"" while in the UAE. His thesis was nearly finished and had been carried out in ""full accordance"" with its research and ethics procedures, it said. Hedges has worked across the Middle East offering analysis on subjects such as defence, security, Gulf politics, international affairs and military capabilities. His research has coveredbattlefield technology,externalanddefence expenditure,externalin the UAE and political and militarypolicy in the Middle East,external. Defense News, Gulf States Newsletter, Military Balance and Defence Procurement International have all published his work. Matthew Hedges has published a number of pieces of research concerning the region In March last year he wrote an article for the US-based Middle East Policy Councilexploring the future of the Muslim Brotherhood and the Gulf Cooperation Council,external, of which the UAE is a member. Hedges has also worked for Dubai thinktank the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis (INEGMA) and media services company Babylon Communications. At Optimum Business Consultants he was involved in negotiations for natural resource extraction concessions in South-East Asia and West Africa.

Guide: Where we are with Brexit,"This video can not be played Brexit: May under pressure over deal Theresa May has secured a deal with the European Union on the terms of Britain's exit on 29 March - and a joint statement on how future relations between the two might work. What happens now? The UK is due to leave the European Union at 23:00 GMT on Friday 29 March, 2019, after people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for Leave in the 2016 referendum. The UK and the EU have spent more than a year trying to agree on how the divorce - as it's often called - will work in practice. This has now been agreed with the EU and backed by the cabinet, althoughtwo ministers resigned in protest at it.They have also agreed a rough outline of how future relations might work, known as the political declaration. Theresa May now has to get MPs to vote for the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration. A vote scheduled for Tuesday, 11 December was delayed by the prime minister until 21 January at the latest. If she eventually clears that hurdle, it will go to a vote in the European Parliament. There are two documents. Adraft 585-page agreement on Britain's withdrawal,externalfrom the European Union is a legally-binding text that sets out the terms of the UK's departure. It includes: Commitments over citizens' rights after Brexit - people will be able to work and study where they currently live, and to be joined by family members A 21-month transition period after the UK's departure, to allow time for trade talks The UK would continue to follow all EU rules during this period in order to give governments and businesses more time to prepare for long term changes A ""fair financial settlement"" from the UK - also known as the Â£39bn ""divorce bill"" A ""backstop"" arrangement to keep the Irish border unmanned if trade talks don't come up with a way of avoiding that happening More on how what the draft agreement reveals The other document isa 26-page statement on the UK's future relationship with the EU,external, when the transition period comes to an end. This is not legally-binding and contains wriggle room for both sides, based around the central ideal of continued close co-operation. The government has described it as ""a set of instructions to negotiators"" working on a legally-binding treaty. Formal negotiations on everything it contains can only begin after Brexit has actually happened on 29 March 2019. The declaration includes: Plans for a ""free trade area and deep co-operation on goods, with zero tariffs and quotas"" ""Ambitious customs arrangements"" that ""build on"" the arrangements in the withdrawal agreement Commitment to respect the EU's four freedoms - the free movement of people, goods, services and money around the EU A specific reference to the end of free movement in the UK A reference to allowing the UK to strike its own trade deals after Brexit An exit from the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy Determination to use technology to replace the Northern Irish ""backstop"" - but no guarantee A clear continuing role for the European Court of Justice in the interpretation of EU law Continued participation in EU programmes in areas like science, culture, education, overseas development and space, including ""a fair and appropriate financial contribution"" Continued co-operation on defence and security More on what's in the political declaration This was the major sticking point in talks with Brussels. Both sides are committed to avoiding a return to a visible Northern Ireland border with guard posts and checks. They believe that bringing them back would put the peace process at risk. So they agreed to put in place a ""backstop"" - a kind of safety net to ensure there is no hard border whatever the outcome of future trade talks between the UK and the EU. The backstop will mean that Northern Ireland would stay aligned to some EU rules on things like food products and goods standards. That will prevent the needs for checks on goods at the Irish border, but would require some products being brought to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK to be subject to new checks and controls. The backstop would also involve a temporary single custom territory, effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union. But Brexiteers do not like the prospect of being tied to EU customs rules and they say there's no process for the UK to unilaterally decide to exit the backstop - and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will not tolerate anything that creates a new border down the Irish Sea. Mrs May insists she does not want to use the backstop and says it is highly unlikely that it will ever be triggered (her critics think otherwise). But if no trade deal is in prospect by July 2020, the two sides could agree to extend the transition period instead. This would avoid the need for the backstop at that time, and keep trade with the EU flowing as it does now. They could do this only once. The transition could not go on being extended indefinitely. But there is no agreement on how long any extension would be. Some have suggested the end of 2022, but the government position has been for it all to be sorted before the next election, which is due in Spring 2022. Either way, this could keep the UK under EU rules for at least three years after March's official Brexit date, something Brexiteers are also unhappy about. This video can not be played When will Brexit happen? As things stand, it looks unlikely. MPs were scheduled to vote on Tuesday, 11 December. However, the prime minister delayed the vote, admitting that ""widespread and deep concern"" over the Northern Ireland backstop meant the deal would have been rejected ""by a significant margin"". Mrs May said she would raise those concerns with EU leaders, and also look at ways to give MPs the power to force the government to ""ensure that the backstop cannot be in place indefinitely"" and has ""democratic legitimacy"". Downing Street has said it will be rescheduled for 21 January at the latest, although Brexit Minister Robin Walker told MPs he hoped it would be sooner. Before the vote was postponed, Labour and all the other opposition parties in the House of Commons had said they would vote against the deal. About 100 Conservative MPs have said will not support it, although some might abstain rather than actually voting against. And Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, who Mrs May relies on to keep her in power, have also said they will vote against it. Theresa May is hoping to persuade MPs that the deal not only delivers on the result of the EU referendum by allowing the UK to take back control of its ""money, laws and borders"" it is also the best the UK can get from the EU and there is no alternative on offer. She will also argue that if her deal is voted down, Britain risks leaving without a deal - a prospect feared by many MPs, who think it will cause chaos at the ports and damage industry - or, she says, there will be ""no Brexit at all"". Brexiteers say it is not what people voted for - and it could keep the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, without any say over its rules. Some have even argued that it would be worse than staying in the EU. Remainers also argue that it is a worse deal for the UK than staying in the EU. This video can not be played Radio 4 The World at One asks: What will happen if Parliament rejects the Brexit plan? It is hard to say for certain. There are number of possible scenarios, including: Leaving the EU without a deal Having another vote in Parliament - Mrs May will get three weeks to make a second attempt Another EU referendum (this can only happen if the government brings forward legislation to hold one and a majority in the Commons supports it) A general election - Labour's preferred option but it would need a no-confidence vote in the PM Theresa May is removed by her own MPs and a new leader tries to renegotiate a deal with the EU - Tory MPs say they are close to having enough signatures to trigger a confidence vote in her Some of these options would involve delaying the official Brexit date of 29 March by a few months to allow time to renegotiate a deal, if the EU agrees to that Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell has alsofloated the idea of Labour forming a minority governmentwithout a general election to have a go at getting its own version of Brexit - centred around a permanent customs union with the EU - through Parliament, although the party would then have to get the EU to agree to that.

Back my deal or risk more division - May,"This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I will make the case for this deal with all my heart"" Rejecting the Brexit deal will be risky and lead to ""division and uncertainty"", Prime Minister Theresa May will say to MPs who oppose her plan. Her Commons speech comes after the 27 other EU leaders approved the terms of the UK's exit at a summit on Sunday. Mrs May now has to persuade politicians in the UK Parliament to back the deal. But cabinet ministers admit she faces an uphill struggle, with Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP, the DUP and many Tory MPs set to vote against it. Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party has said it will review its parliamentary pact with the Conservatives - which props up Mrs May's government - if the deal is approved by MPs. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said his party will oppose the deal, calling it ""the worst of all worlds"". Parliament live: Rolling updates on May's statement Laura Kuenssberg: The PM's strategy Katya Adler: Nineteen months of wrangling What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Brexit: A really simple guide The prime minister has pledged to put her ""heart and soul"" into a two-week push to convince MPs to back the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU and its future relations with the bloc. Parliament will decide whether to accept or reject the package next month, in a vote which is likely to be on 12 December. Mrs May has said it is the ""only deal"" on the table for the UK, which is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Following a two-hour cabinet meeting earlier, No 10 said in the ""unlikely event"" that Parliament could not agree on the terms of withdrawal ""all necessary action"" would be taken to prepare the UK to leave without an agreement. Mrs May's campaign - which saw her appeal to the public in a ""letter to the nation"" at the weekend - will later see Labour MPs briefed on the deal while there will be a reception for business leaders at Downing Street.

The Daily Telegraph,externalreported Mrs May would challenge Mr Corbyn to a head-to-head debate. Labour says he would ""relish"" a debate while Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said he would like to join in and ""take them both on"". But former Conservative cabinet minister Damian Green said he was sceptical about the idea, telling the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire show it was unlikely to ""illuminate"" what was a hugely complex subject. Mrs May's Tory critics include Brexiteer MPs David Davis, Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson, as well as Remainers Justine Greening, Dominic Grieve and Jo Johnson Opponents of the deal on either side of the argument say it fails to deliver on what people voted for during the 2016 referendum or what the public were promised during the campaign and afterwards. Brexiteers argue that rather than taking back control, the UK is giving the EU too much of a say in key areas and hampering the UK's ability to strike trade deals with other countries. In particular, they fear the UK could find itself trapped indefinitely in a ""backstop"" customs arrangement, designed to avoid the need for physical checks of people and goods at the border on the island of Ireland, without the unilateral right to exit. Many Remain supporters argue the deal is inferior to remaining in the EU because it will not guarantee frictionless trade, while the UK will no longer have a say in setting rules and regulations it will have to abide by. Those who want to stop Brexit say they want another referendum because, they say, in 2016 people did not know the detail of what Leave meant. This video can not be played Citizens' rights, the Irish border and money are the three big negotiation points In her Commons statement on Monday, Mrs May will say that backing the deal would bring an end to the uncertainty surrounding Brexit. ""Our duty as a Parliament over these coming weeks is to examine this deal in detail, to debate it respectfully, to listen to our constituents and decide what is in our national interest,"" she will say. Brexit deal 'worse than no deal' - DUP Sturgeon hits out at 'desperate' EU appeal 'Wales less prosperous after Brexit deal' Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop She will tell MPs to choose whether they want to back the deal and ""move on to building a brighter future of opportunity"" or reject it and ""go back to square one"". On Sunday, Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, said anyone in Britain who thought the EU might offer better terms would be ""disappointed"" because this was the ""only"" deal. But opponents of the deal say if it is rejected, EU officials would have to give ground to avoid a no-deal exit. The DUP's Sammy Wilson said the EU was hoping Mrs May could ""bludgeon"" the deal through Parliament. ""But given it's been condemned by all sides, that's very unlikely and I think that Mr Juncker may finish up eating his words and having to look for an alternative arrangement,"" he told the BBC. And the Leave Means Leave campaign group said Mrs May was seeking to ""bribe or isolate"" rebel MPs and the UK should not be alarmed by the prospect of leaving without a deal. By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg No 10 is all too aware it is waging this campaign for its compromise against a wall of resistance. There are doubts about elements of the deal inside cabinet, and the Tory backbenches are riddled with concerns. The opposition parties and her supposed partners in government - the DUP - are all, so far, set against. But the prime minister's chosen - and perhaps only realistic - political option at this moment is to keep pushing on with a deal that she believes allows us to leave the European Union without hurting the economy while putting the UK in charge of its own immigration policy. There's irritation in government about the French president's warning over the long-term control of fishing rights. Noises off from other EU leaders who tried in the main to show a helpful face in Brussels yesterday are not part of Number 10's carefully designed script. The leaders of the remaining 27 EU countries have made clear they still hope to negotiate fishing access in UK waters based on existing rights. At the EU summit, French President Emmanuel Macron warned that if, in future talks, the UK was unwilling to make compromises over fishing, the negotiations for a wider trade deal could be slowed down, which could potentially lead to the last-resort backstop plan coming into force. Analysis: Macron's blunt fishing warning to UK EU leaders still hope for fishing access But Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told the BBC it was not in the EU's interest, and countries such as France, for the backstop to be activated and there were ""safeguards"" to stop this happening. ""If you take quite literally what President Macron said, in the event of a backstop then all access to UK fishing waters would cease on day one so it is not as suggested,"" he told Radio 4's Today. Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that if Mrs May's deal was voted down by Parliament, she would either have to re-negotiate or ""there really ought to be a general election"" because she had ""failed so badly in these negotiations"". Analysis commissioned by the People's Vote campaign- which wants another referendum on Brexit - was carried out by the economic research group, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, and claimed the deal would leave the UK Â£100bn a year worse off by 2030 than it would be if it had stayed in the European Union.

Boy stabbed to death 'over postcode',"This video can not be played Police commander 'can't accept' Jaydon James' fatal stabbing The sister of a teenage boy stabbed to death in a city has said he was targeted ""because of his postcode"". Jaydon James, 16, known as JJ, was wounded in Coventry at about 23:40 GMT on Saturday, and died later in hospital. Jayda James described her brother as the ""sweetest, funniest most kind-hearted boy"". His grandfather Joe Green said he had lost his life simply because he had gone out to buy some food. ""He wasn't a fighter,"" said Mr Green. ""He went out to get something to eat and lost his life within about 500 yards of his house."" Police said Jaydon, who celebrated his 16th birthday two weeks ago, was attacked while with friends in Deedmore Road, Wood End, a suburb four miles north of the city centre. Two of Jaydon's friends were also seriously injured in the attack and taken to hospital, where they remain. No arrests have been made. Writing on Facebook, Ms James said: ""Jaydon was the sweetest, funniest most kind hearted boy. ""He didn't fight, he wasn't part of a ""gang"", he was friends with everyone and tried to keep the peace whenever he could. Jaydon was stabbed to death because of his postcode, because he was a [Wood End] boy. ""I can't believe someone took my brother's life simply because of the neighbourhood he lived in."" She also thanked the boys who ""stuck by Jaydon's side"" and ""waited for help to arrive and made sure me and my mum was aware"". Deedmore Road was cordoned off near the Moat House and Castle Wood School Staff at Foxford School and Community Arts College, in Coventry, said Jaydon had been ""loyal, caring and his friends knew that they could rely upon him"". ""He was a bright, respectful student with a big personality and a full member of our school community,"" head teacher Ruth Williamson said. ""The tragic news of Jaydon's death has been a shock to all members of the school and Jaydon's family are at the forefront of our minds."" By Sima Kotecha, BBC Midlands Correspondent The area of Wood End is to the north of Coventry and has large pockets of deprivation. Rows of floral tributes line the pavement along the shops where Jaydon often went to get food. The mood is understandably sombre and as the afternoon sunshine creeps in and reflects off the plastic covering of the bouquets, his former girlfriend Savannah-Jade cries. She describes him as ""wonderful, funny and beautiful"". Ch Supt Mike O'Hara, from West Midlands Police, said the force would not ""fuel conjecture"" that Jaydon's death was gang-related. He said police were ""keeping an open mind"" and would ""leave no stone unturned"". ""I can't accept that I've had a child murdered in the streets of my city,"" he said. On Sunday night more than 200 people held a candlelit vigil in Jaydon's memory. Mr Green called on the community to ""pull together"" to stop the problem of knife crime.

MP to face retrial in speed ticket case,"Ms Onasanya has denied perverting the course of justice A Labour MP accused of lying about who was driving her speeding car will face a retrial after a jury failed to reach a verdict. Fiona Onasanya, 35, is alleged to have claimed a Russian man was behind the wheel to escape prosecution for driving 41mph in a 30mph zone in July 2017. The MP for Peterborough had denied a single charge of perverting the course of justice, at the Old Bailey. Her brother has previously admitted three counts of the same charge. Ms Onasanya is set to face a retrial on 11 December. The prosecution had claimed Ms Onasanya and her brother Festus Onasanya, 33, ""acted jointly in telling lies"" to claim she was not driving her Nissan Micra when it was clocked by a speed camera in Thorney, near Peterborough at 22:03 BST on 24 July last year. The court was told a Notice of Intended Prosecution (Nip) was returned and named Aleks Antipow - the previous tenant of a property that Ms Onasanya and her brother had rented in Cambridge - as the driver, jurors heard. Ms Onasanya told the court that she did not know who was behind the wheel at the time of the offence. When a notice of intended prosecution arrived in the post, she said she ""assumed"" she was not driving that Monday because of her Westminster commitments, even though Parliament was in recess. She left the letter at her mother's house for whoever had been driving her car to deal with, not realising it was her responsibility as keeper of the vehicle, she said. The sentencing of Mr Onasanya, of Chesterton, Cambridge, had been adjourned until after her trial.

UK summers could be over 5C warmer by 2070The Met Office has warned of significant temperature rises in the decades ahead.Science & EnvironmentComments,"The heat wave experienced across the UK in the summer of 2018 could become the norm In its first major update on climate change in almost 10 years, the Met Office has warned of significant temperature rises in the decades ahead. TheUK Climate Projections 2018,externalstudy is the most up to date assessment of how the UK may change over this century. It says that under the highest emissions scenario, summer temperatures could be 5.4C hotter by 2070. The chances of a summer as warm as 2018 are around 50% by 2050. Is China behind global coal power surge? Dire warning on US climate change impacts Climate and miscarriage in Bangladesh One key figure in the report is the rise in summer temperatures  - up to 5.4C warmer than the average between 1981-2000. This would only happen, according to the Met Office, if the world was to continue increasing emissions of carbon dioxide rather than reducing them as most governments intend. So for a central location in England like Nottingham, the Met Office says that, under a high emissions future (where greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere over coming decades are at the high end of all possible scenarios), temperatures could rise by between 1.1C to 5.8C. For other central locations in the nations of the UK, there are similar ranges of projected temperature rises. In Scotland, at Pitlochry, the summer rise ranges from 0.6C to 4.8C warmer. Around Aberystwyth in Wales, they range from 0.9C to 5.9C warmer while Cookstown in Northern Ireland could be 0.8 to 4.9C hotter. But even under a low emissions scenario, the Met Office says that the UK will see an increase in the average yearly temperature of up to 2.3C by 2100. Summers as warm as the one just past, are likely to be very common, with a 50% chance of occurring. ""With really hot summers like this year's - in the 1990s that was a less than 5% chance of getting those,"" said Met Office chief scientist Dr Stephen Belcher. ""Now we are up to a 15-20% chance. By 2050 that's a normal summerâ¦By late century it depends what we do about greenhouse gases."" The UK faces wetter winters and drier summers These warmer summers of the future are likely to be much drier too, with average summer rainfall dropping by 47% by 2070. Winters could be warmer by up to 4.2C but they will also see more rainfall, increasing by up to 35% by 2070, under the worst emissions scenario. Raised sea levels are also one of the consequences of a warmer world and according to the report, they could increase by 1.15 metres in London by 2100. The report says the UK is set to see an increase in both the frequency and magnitude of extreme water levels. Just a few weeks ago the UK's Committee on Climate Change (CCC)warned that by 2080 up to 1.2 million homesmay be at increased risk of flooding. ""The UK18 projections are further evidence that we will see more extreme weather in the future - we need to prepare and adapt now, climate change impacts are already being felt with the record books being re-written,"" said Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the Environment Agency. ""The Environment Agency cannot wall up the country, but will be at the forefront - protecting communities, building resilience, and responding to incidents."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove praised the new study as an ""invaluable tool"" as it will help with decisions on large infrastructure. ""It is clear that the planet and its weather patterns are changing before our eyes,"" he said, launching the report at the Science Museum in London. ""We know, more than ever before, the urgency of acting."" This video can not be played Why there were so many heatwaves around the world in 2018 Mr Gove has been stressing that Britain has a good track record on climate change, having cut emissions by 40% since 1990 while continuing to grow the economy. However, other political figures say that the new report underlines how much more needs to be done. ""These projections paint a devastating picture of what climate breakdown means for the UK if we continue down the path we're on,"" said Green party MP Caroline Lucas. ""Michael Gove's vague talk of mitigating the worst impacts of floods, droughts and storms are far from reassuring."" Some researchers were also critical of the report, saying that it gave the impression that scientists can give more detail about the future than is possible. ""It (the report) feeds our desire for specifics and for high resolution pictures,"" said Prof David Stainforth from the Grantham Research Institute on climate change and the environment. ""It is valuable in bringing to life the types of changes we want to avoid. It is, however, based on research at the edge of scientific understanding, using methods whose reliability has been questioned. It is not reliable and robust in the way that knowledge of the climate change threat is, so it creates its own risks.""

Nominations for new ÃÂ£50 note releasedThe list of suggested scientists who might appear on the new ÃÂ£50 note includes Stephen Hawking and Ada Lovelace.BusinessComments,"Rosalind Franklin, Stephen Hawking and Ada Lovelace feature on the official list of more than 800 - so far The Bank of England has released a list of scientists who have been nominated to feature on the new Â£50 note. On the list are computing pioneers Alan Turing and Ada Lovelace, telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell and astronomer Patrick Moore. The Bank received 174,112 nominations, of which 114,000 met the eligibility criteria. To be on the list, the individual must be real, deceased and have contributed to the field of science in the UK. The list, which includes more than 600 men and almost 200 women, includes black holes expert Stephen Hawking, penicillin discoverer Alexander Fleming, father of modern epidemiology John Snow, naturalist and zookeeper Gerald Durrell, fossil pioneer Mary Anning, British-Jamaican business woman and nursing pioneer Mary Seacole and Margaret Thatcher, who was a scientist before becoming prime minister. The late Baroness Thatcher studied chemistry at Oxford University and after graduating joined British Xylonite Plastics in 1947. Two years later she joined J. Lyons & Co in Hammersmith, west London, as a food research chemist in a role that involved testing the quality of cake-fillings and ice-cream, wrote biographer Hugo Young. The politician has been credited with inventing soft serve ice cream - a product Lyons worked on - but ""there is no firm evidence that Thatcher directly assisted in its invention"",according to a Royal Society journal article,external. Bookmakers William Hill have Stephen Hawking as the current favourite, with odds of 7/4, followed by Nobel-prize winning chemist Dorothy Hodgkin 4/1. Ada Lovelace, Alan Turing and Alexander Fleming have odds of 5/1 and Rosalind Franklin, who made important contributions to the understanding of DNA, is at 6/1. Further names will be considered,externalup until nominations close on 14 December. After that the decision will be considered by the Bank's Banknote Character Advisory Committee. Margaret Thatcher working as a research chemist in a picture dated 1950 Paul Rincon, BBC News website science editor The definition of eligibility for this list is pretty broad at the moment, but stricter criteria are likely to be applied once the names are considered by the Bank's committee. Thus, while Margaret Thatcher's contributions to politics are considerable, it remains to be seen whether the committee will judge her an equally significant scientific figure. Hers is just one of the names that some observers will think fall outside some of the stricter definitions of a scientist. But a broad definition of eligibility could assist the promotion of some figures that were overlooked by the establishment in their lifetimes, such as Mary Anning, who, without formal qualifications, helped document important fossil finds from southern England. Those hoping for strong female contenders will find much to like about the list. But there are also inclusions that highlight the contributions of ethnic minorities and immigrants to British science. The committee which draws up the shortlist will include space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock, author and genetics expert Emily Grossman, editor of the British Journal for the History of Science Simon Schaffer, and theoretical and particle physicist Simon Singh. Nominations can include anyone who worked in any field of science including astronomy, biology, bio-technology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, medical research, physics, technology or zoology. There are currently 330 million Â£50 notes in circulation, with a combined value of Â£16.5bn, the Bank said. A year ago there were doubts that the Â£50 note would continue to exist at all. Fears that the largest denomination note was widely used by criminals and rarely for ordinary purchases prompted a government-led discussion on whether to abolish it. The Â£50 note wasdescribed by Peter Sands, former chief executive of Standard Chartered bank, as the ""currency of corrupt elites, of crime of all sorts and of tax evasion"". Nevertheless, in October, ministers announced plans for a new version of the note, to be printed in the UK, which they said would be plastic - so, more durable, secure and harder to forge.

China baby gene editing claim 'dubious',"Significant doubts have emerged about claims from a Chinese scientist that he has helped make the world's first genetically edited babies. Prof He Jiankui says the twin girls, born a few weeks ago, had their DNA altered as embryos to prevent them from contracting HIV. His claims, filmed by Associated Press, are unverified and have sparked outrage from other scientists, who have called the idea monstrous. Such work is banned in most countries. Gene editing could potentially help avoid heritable diseases by deleting or changing troublesome coding in embryos. But experts worry meddling with the genome of an embryo could cause harm not only to the individual but also future generations that inherit these same changes. And many countries, including the UK, have laws that prevent the use of genome editing in embryos for assisted reproduction in humans. Scientists can do gene editing research on discarded IVF embryos, as long as they are destroyed immediately afterwards and not used to make a baby. But Prof He, who was educated at Stanford in the US and works from a lab in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, says he used gene-editing tools to make two twin baby girls, known as ""Lulu"" and ""Nana"". In a video,external, he claims to have eliminated a gene called CCR5 to make the girls resistant to HIV should they ever come into contact with the virus. He says his work is about creating children who would not suffer from diseases, rather than making designer babies with bespoke eye colour or a high IQ. ""I understand my work will be controversial - but I believe families need this technology and I'm willing to take the criticism for them,"" he says in the video. However, several organisations, including a hospital, linked to the claim have denied any involvement. The Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen said it had been unaware of the research project and will now launch an investigation. This video can not be played Fergus Walsh: ""CRISPR gene editing .... uses molecular scissors to cut both strands of DNA"" And other scientists say if the reports are true, Prof He has gone too far, experimenting on healthy embryos without justification. Prof Robert Winston, Emeritus Professor of Fertility Studies and Professor of Science and Society at Imperial College London, said: ""If this is a false report, it is scientific misconduct and deeply irresponsible. ""If true, it is still scientific misconduct."" Dr Dusko Ilic, an expert in stem cell science at King's College London, said: ""If this can be called ethical, then their perception of ethics is very different to the rest of the world's."" He argues that HIV is highly treatable and that if the infection is kept under control with drugs, then there is almost no risk of the parents passing it on to the baby anyway. Prof Julian Savulescu, an expert in ethics at the University of Oxford, said: ""If true, this experiment is monstrous. The embryos were healthy - no known diseases. ""Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer. ""This experiment exposes healthy normal children to risks of gene editing for no real necessary benefit."" Scientists say baby gene editing may one day be justifiable, but that more checks and measures are needed before allowing it. Dr Yalda Jamshidi, an expert in human genetics at St George's, University of London, said: ""We know very little about the long term effects, and most people would agree that experimentation on humans for an avoidable condition just to improve our knowledge is morally and ethically unacceptable. ""Whether the results stand up to scrutiny or not we need as a society to think hard and fast about when and where we are willing to take the risks that come with any new therapeutic treatment, particularly ones that could affect future generations.""

"Solo rower, 60, starts Atlantic attempt","This video can not be played Shirley Thompson expects the voyage to take her three months A 60-year-old Belfast woman has started her bid to become the oldest woman to row solo across the Atlantic. Shirley Thompson expects the voyage to take her three months. She spent the last 24 hours stocking up on fresh produce to eat and drink during the first five days of the voyage. After that, she will be relying on packet food. ""I'm feeling really excited and, of course, nervous,"" she told BBC News NI before she set off on Monday morning. ""I've been building up for this for eight months but now I just want to cast off."" Until recently Ms Thompson could not swim,external, but she is an experienced endurance runner and extremely fit. Shirley Thompson had rowed five miles by midday on Monday - she has 2,995 miles to go She will not have any boat support, and will be relying on a passing ship to pick her up if she capsizes. Her chosen route covers 3,000 nautical miles from Gran Canaria to St Barts in the Caribbean. Even though it is the start of winter in Europe, there are favourable trade winds at this time of year for a trans-Atlantic crossing. She plans to take her time. ""I have no interest in rowing through storms, I just want to get as far as I can safely,"" she said. ""This is pleasure for me. This is my treat - it's my 60th birthday present for me. ""I am a woman of 60 years of age and I want to show that a woman of 60 can do anything she puts her mind to."" If all goes according to plan, she will spend Christmas in the mid-Atlantic and arrive in the Caribbean by the end of February.

"'I have failed you,' Carl Sargeant tells family","Carl Sargeant had been a Welsh Government minister for almost a decade A sacked Welsh Government minister found dead at his home last year left a letter telling his family ""I have failed you"", an inquest has heard. Labour AM Carl Sargeant, 49, was found hanged four days after First Minister Carwyn Jones dismissed him as communities and children secretary. The father-of-two faced allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards women, a claim he denied. He wrote: ""You deserve none of this adverse publicity 'cause of my acts."" Mr Sargeant had been suspended from the Welsh Labour party prior to his death on 7 November 2017. Coroner John Gittins has previously said theprovisional cause of death was hangingin ""an apparent act of self harm"". Mr Sargeant's letter, read to the inquest at Ruthin, Denbighshire, on Monday, said: ""To Bernie, Lucy, Jack and family/friends. I have let you down badly. You deserve none of this adverse publicity 'cause of my acts. I have failed you. ""That aside, I love you more than you'll ever know and I'm sorry I have taken the easy way out, leaving you with my shit. Please forgive me. I love you, Carl/Dad."" Former minister Leighton Andrews arriving at the inquest The court later heard from former Welsh Government minister Leighton Andrews, who told the inquest Carwyn Jones's behaviour was irresponsible following Mr Sargeant's sacking. Mr Andrews said Mr Jones gave media interviews on the Monday following a cabinet reshuffle on Friday 3 November 2017, which had a ""significant impact"" on Mr Sargeant's state of mind. Mr Andrews said the first minister had been ""speculating"" during the interviews, although he did not elaborate further. The inquest also heard details of a text message sent from Mr Andrews to Mr Jones on the evening of the reshuffle. Under questioning by the first minister's counsel Cathy McGahey, Mr Andrews agreed he had written phrases quoted from the text including ""great to see new faces promotedâ¦it's a great reshuffle"" and that it must have been an ""immensely difficult conversation to have had with Carl"". Before hearing evidence from Mr Andrews, the coroner told him the inquest was not about blame or fault. He thanked him for his previously-submitted statement, but warned him there may be elements within it that fell outside this investigation. Jack Sargeant with his mother Bernadette arriving at the inquest At the start of the inquest, Mr Gittins said there was no room in his court room for speculation or accusation, adding: ""This will not be a trial by press, politics or personality."" He read a statement from PC Siwan Hughes, who was called to Mr Sargeant's home in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, after his body was found in a utility room by his wife Bernadette. The police officer was told by Mrs Sargeant she had found a note on the door of the utility room telling her not to go in and to call the police. The letter to his family was left next to his body. The court heard there were traces of anti-depressants in his blood, but not enough to be a contributory factor to his death. Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe worked alongside Mr Sargeant Speaking at the inquest, future generations commissioner Sophie Howe, who became special adviser to Mr Sargeant in 2013, said she noticed his health begin to deteriorate in the summer of 2017, several months before his death. She said he used to say ""I'm having a real black dog of a day"" and there were ""a number of pressures at work"". She added on the day of Mr Sargeant's sacking, he called her in the afternoon saying ""I'm out and it's really bad"". ""He said 'I don't know what's going on, I haven't been told what the allegations are'. I find that incredible, that he could be sacked without being told what the allegations were,"" she said. Ms Howe added the work environment was ""toxic"". She said she was in regular contact with Mr Sargeant over the weekend following his sacking. ""He was saying 'I'm in a dark place'. I was very concerned about him,"" she said. Ms Howe added Mr Sargeant was ""distraught"" about not knowing the detail of the allegations against him. She added his mood had improved by the end of the weekend but took a ""downward turn"" after he was door-stepped by a journalist on the Monday morning. On the day before his death, Ms Howe received a text message from David Taylor, a friend of Mr Sargeant, who had been asking how to programme a text message to be sent at a later time. Ms Howe told the coroner she then became concerned Mr Sargeant was planning to take his own life. She managed to contact him by phone, and ""he sounded completely spaced-out"". She repeatedly asked him why he wanted to know how to delay a text message being sent, to which he said, ""I just wanted to know"". She added she believes she was the last person to speak to Mr Sargeant. Mr Sargeant later sent a text message to a group which she was a member of, saying ""love you all"". Leighton Andrews gave evidence at Ruthin in front of family lawyer Leslie Thomas (left), Coroner John Gittins (centre) and Mr Sargeant's wife Bernadette (right) Giving evidence, Mr Sargeant's GP Dr David Morris said the late politician had been in good general health, apart from being ""a big fella"", but had presented with symptoms of depression in March 2012, the first of several episodes. The doctor said Mr Sargeant had described himself as ""low in mood"", suffering from disturbed sleep and ""weepiness"", and had also told him: ""It feels like what I think post-traumatic stress might be."" This was due to an illness of another family member. He was prescribed a course of fluoxetine medication after being diagnosed with ""moderately severe depression"". He had a short course of sleeping tablets in 2014 and in July 2016 was put back on fluoxetine, which notes show he feared to stop taking. Later that year he scored one on a scale used to determine whether he had considered self-harming, which was at the lower end. He was prescribed a different anti-depressant and by November was feeling better, with improved sleep. The drugs were repeated throughout much of 2017, with the last prescription in the October of that year. Cathy McGahey QC, representing the first minister, asked whether some people suffering depression were able to function in their working lives, to which Dr Morris said they were. Questioned by Leslie Thomas QC, for the Sargeant family, the doctor also agreed some people did not function well at work with depression. Mr Thomas pointed out Mr Sargeant was last seen by a medical practitioner almost a year before his death. He asked what would be the impact on people who used work as an outlet for their depression if that work was going badly and an individual no longer had that outlet. Dr Morris said: ""A negative one."" Sargeant family gets inquiry review The first minister is due to appear at the five-day inquest on Wednesday, while Mr Sargeant's cabinet colleagues, Lesley Griffiths and Ken Skates, will also give evidence. The inquest is set to hear from Mr Sargeant's son Jack, who succeeded him as the AM for Alyn and Deeside. Mr Sargeant's body was found in the utility room of his house in Connah's Quay Mr Sargeant was facing a partyinvestigation into claims about inappropriate personal conduct with womenand was suspended from the Welsh Labour Party prior to his death. His family said he was not told the details of what he was accused of and was unable to properly defend himself. An independent investigation into how Mr Jones handled Mr Sargeant's sacking will begin in the new year. Earlier this month, theHigh Court gave the family permission to challengethe format of a separate investigation into how his sacking was handled, with his wife saying she feared the probe would be a ""cover-up"". Carl Sargeant had been a Welsh Government minister for almost a decade Mr Sargeant had been a Welsh Government minister for eight years before his sacking in November last year. The former environmental auditor and industrial firefighter had been a Welsh Assembly member since 2003. Mr Sargeant was appointed Labour's chief whip and deputy minister for assembly business following the 2007 election. He was promoted to the cabinet in 2009 as minister for social justice and local government, then served as housing and natural resources minister before being appointed communities secretary in May 2016. Mr Sargeant helped drive legislation to tackle domestic violence and ledthe Welsh Government's response to the Grenfell Tower fire, promising Welsh high-rise blocks were as safe as they could be.

Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies?,"This video can not be played A migrant rescue off the coast of Dover in November 2018 More than 100 migrants, claiming to be Iranian, have attempted the dangerous journey by small boat to the UK in the past three weeks. Why? On 23 November, shortly before sunrise, eight migrants were foundclinging to a dinghy in choppy watersoff the coast of Kent. They told their rescuers they had spent 12 hours at sea. It was a similar story the day before, when seven more were found in a boat just off the Dover coast - the same number of people had been pulled from an inflatable boat just a few hours earlier. Since 3 November, 101 migrants - including four children - have attempted the 21-mile journey across the Channel, one whichpolice have likenedto ""trying to cross the M25 at rush-hour on foot"". Border Force was called to Dover's marina on 22 November to deal with seven suspected migrants The Home Office has refused to publish official figures, but the BBC has established that at least that number have entered British shores since the start of the month. Without fail, the migrants have told officials they are Iranian. British and French authorities, under pressure to stem the rise in boat trips before a life is lost, face several questions. Why have so many boats set off for the coast of Kent? What can be done to stop it? And why are all the occupants apparently from the Middle Eastern country? The answer to the last question could lie 1,200 miles away in the Serbian capital of Belgrade. A French helicopter joined the rescue effort on 22 November Miodrag ÄakiÄ, chief executive of Refugee Aid Serbia, which monitors migration through the Balkans, believes migrants arriving in the UK are among the thousands who flew into Serbia after the country began offering visa-free access to Iranians in August last year. The move was ostensibly intended to increase tourism and trade between Iran, the world's 25th largest economy, and Serbia, the 90th. The visa scheme - which attracted allegations it was being abused by migrants seeking access to western Europe - ended on 17 October, by which time some 40,000 Iranians were said to have flown to the Balkan nation. It is unknown how many returned home, but according to the Associated Press, local media reported that direct flights from Tehran to Belgrade had been arriving full and returning empty. BBC reporter Simon Jones tweeted a picture of this boat after one rescue near Dover According to Info Park, a refugee support centre in Belgrade, Serbian police estimate the number of Iranians who failed to return at 12,000. Mr ÄakiÄ said it was believed within the refugee community that Iranians were using ""false passports and more complex methods"" to enter western Europe. They arrived better prepared for the journey ahead and would stay in hostels or hotels. Most refugees in Serbia slept in squats, while Iranians reportedly stayed in hotels Meanwhile, refugees from countries such as Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, travelled thousands of kilometres on foot and ended up living on the streets or in derelict buildings across Belgrade. Compared to fellow migrants, the Iranians looked ""more like tourists... they were kids in hoodies and jeans, with backpacks"", said Gordan Paunovic, of Info Park. ""Many of [the Iranians] were travelling with fake passports, which were costing between 3,000 to 6,000 euros in Istanbul. ""They didn't share the normal fate of refugees and migrants who have a very hard time in the Balkans. They would not be forced to sleep rough or go to refugee centres like the other people. ""They were here for a month, staying in hotels, and would find a smuggler to make other arrangements."" Iranians were said not to have shared ""the normal fate"" of migrants in the Balkans Iranians may be set apart from fellow migrants by their economic prosperity, yet for many living under the repressive regime, life is far from easy. Kaveh Kalantri, of the Iranian Association, which supports refugees in the UK, said a lack of freedom and human rights violations were driving some Iranians out. ""People get arrested if they have liberal or left-wing views, or if they are from religious minorities. A lot of people experience violence on a daily basis."" Since the Islamic Revolution in 1979, it has been estimated that between 150,000 and 200,000 Iranians have left the country every year. In the past two years, Iranian citizens have made more UK asylum applications than any other nationality, according to Home Office figures. In 2017, they accounted for 9% of the 26,350 applications. ""Iranians coming to the UK is not unusual, but the way they are coming is,"" Mr Kalantri said. Tens of thousands of Iranians are said to have flown into Belgrade One theory as to why Iranians are choosing to risk their lives on boats stems from their comparative wealth - simply put, they can afford to pay smuggling gangs to get them onboard a vessel. Maya Konforti, of L'Auberge des Migrants, a refugee support group in Calais, described the attempted crossings as ""the speciality of Iranians"". ""Crossing by boat can only be done by people who have some money. Africans don't have any left by the time they arrive in Calais,"" she said. ""There is a new influx of Iranians arriving in Calais. They seem to be the only ones who both dare to do it and find the means to do so."" The Calais Jungle was dismantled in 2016, but migrants from across Africa and the Middle East continue to live in camps Mr ÄakiÄ suggested Iranians heading for Kent had entered the EU via Serbia. ""I don't see any other explanation. Serbia was the only country on the Balkan Route that had a significant number of Iranians."" Not everyone believes all the migrants are Iranian. Prof Adib-Moghaddam, from the Centre for Iranian Studies at SOAS University of London, suspects most of them are of Afghan origin. However, immigration specialist Emma Nawaz said she ""could not see what benefit they would achieve by falsely saying that they are Iranian"". Life and death on Mediterranean rescue boat Which industries employ European workers? How has EU migration changed the UK? Regardless, the ""surge"" in attempts is being fuelled by ""organised criminal and mafia networks"" in France, according to Ingrid Parrot, who works for the Maritime prefecture - the Border Force equivalent based in Cherbourg. She said there had been 30 attempted crossings in 2018, 12 in 2017, and 23 the year before. The majority failed because the vessels were too small - mostly canoes, dinghies and ""makeshift"" boats - but several attempts in 2018 have been made in pleasure crafts and speedboats, which have seen a spike in thefts. Ingrid Parrot says ""our fear is having bodies on the beaches"" Border Force officers have reported that ""access to small craft was getting easier and cheaper, creating more opportunities for criminals to involve themselves in the facilitation of clandestine entry and smuggling,"" according to an inspection of the South Coast ports,published this month. But understanding the true scale of the issue is complicated by the department's insistence that revealing the number of so-called ""clandestine entries"" made by boat would ""prejudice the operation of immigration controls"". Dover and Deal MP Charlie Elphicke, who described the rise in boat crossings as ""unprecedented"", said Border Force needed more resources, including investment in additional patrol boats to act as a deterrent. He said the number of migrants detected in lorries in Dover had ""plummeted"" by more than a third since the Calais Jungle was dismantled. But Bridget Chapman, of Kent Refugee Action Network, said the increase in boat crossings was a ""natural consequence of the hostile environment and tightening up the borders"". ""People are having to find ways that are more and more dangerous,"" she added. In the past 21 days, 12 groups of migrants have attempted the crossing from France to England Ashford MP and former immigration minister Damian Green said emphasis should be placed on ""actually knowing where people are coming from [and] breaking up the international criminal gangs that are actually behind this"". ""If we do need more resources, that's where they should go,"" he added. The Home Office said officials were focusing on ""identifying and dismantling the organised crime groups that facilitate illegal immigration"". Ms Parrot said the French were already ""strengthening measures"" to prevent attempted crossings, rather than focusing only on launching rescue operations. ""Our greatest fear is, on the one hand, a collision that leads to a loss of human life and, what's more, an accident at sea that we need to assist with,"" she said. ""On the other hand, our other fear is having injured people at sea and bodies on the beaches. We do not want it to come to that."" A note on terminology: The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum. This group includes people fleeing war-torn countries, who are likely to be granted refugee status, as well as people who are seeking jobs and better lives, who governments are likely to rule are economic migrants.

Tensions spark Ukraine martial law talks,"This video can not be played Footage of the collision was posted by the Ukrainian Interior Minister Ukraine's parliament is to decide whether to bring in martial law, after Sunday's capture of three of its naval vessels and 23 crew members by Russia. The three ships were sailing off the coast of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, when they were seized. Russia opened fire, before its special forces stormed the vessels. Between three and six Ukrainians were injured. Ukraine said it was a Russian ""act of aggression"". Moscow said the ships had illegally entered its waters. On Monday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said he was proposing that parliament back a 30-day martial law - half the length of that recommended by Ukraine's security and defence council. He said he did not want the measure to affect presidential elections set for 31 March 2019. Sunday's clash is the first time Russia and Ukraine have come into open conflict in recent years, although Ukrainian forces have been fighting Russian-backed separatists and Russia volunteers in the east since 2014. Russia-Ukraine sea clash in 300 words Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Eastern Ukraine: A new, bloody chapter A number of Western countries condemned Russia's actions. In New York, the UN Security Council met to discuss the crisis - but failed to agree a Russian-proposed agenda amid sharp disagreements between Moscow and the West. This is the chronology of the dramatic events that led to the naval clash: In the morning, Ukraine said it had sent two gunboats and a tug from the Black Sea port of Odessa to Mariupol in the Sea of Azov Ukraine's navy then said Russian boats had tried to intercept its vessels, ramming the tug Russia accused Ukraine of illegally entering its territorial waters Russia scrambled fighter jets and helicopters as the Ukrainian vessels approached a bridge over the Kerch Strait - the only access to the Sea of Azov The bridge itself was blocked by a tanker In the evening, Ukraine said its vessels had been fired on and seized by the Russians. Six Ukrainian crew members were injured Russia confirmed it had used weapons to force the Ukrainian vessels to stop, saying three Ukrainians were injured Russia said the Ukrainian ships were in its waters illegally because Moscow had temporarily closed an area of water for shipping. Kiev called Russia's actions a flagrant violation of international law, because the Black Sea is free for shipping, and Crimea belongs to Ukraine. Ukraine also cited a 2003 Russia-Ukraine treaty on unimpeded access to the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov. It said it had informed the Russians in advance of its plan to move its ships to Mariupol - a claim denied by Russia. In recent weeks, two Ukrainian vessels passed through the Kerch Straight without incident. The crisis as it happened Ukraine names Russia as 'aggressor' state By Jonathan Marcus, defence and diplomatic correspondent The incident in the Black Sea is a powerful reminder that the tensions between Russia and Ukraine are not part of a frozen conflict: they can flare up with very little warning. Nato and Ukraine's allies in the West have strongly backed President Poroshenko. But what can they do to influence Russian behaviour? This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high There will be talk of more economic sanctions. But Russia is already heavily sanctioned, and this has not encouraged it to rethink its annexation of Crimea. There will be calls for additional support for the Ukrainians; Nato countries provide training for Kiev's military - they could presumably do more. And the Trump administration, even before this episode, was already considering calls to sell additional weaponry to Ukraine in addition to the Javelin anti-tank missiles already supplied. But there is a difficult balance to be struck between support for Ukraine's territorial integrity on the one hand and avoiding anything that might tip the conflict into full-scale war. There have been growing tensions between the two sides over navigation in the area. Russia has recently begun inspecting all vessels sailing to or from Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov. This video can not be played Jonah Fisher talks to a commander of the Ukrainian Navy about the tensions in the Azov Sea This began after Ukraine detained a fishing vessel from Crimea in March. Moscow also says the checks are necessary for security reasons. Ukraine has accused Russia of trying to occupy the Sea of Azov and damage Ukraine's economy by hindering access its ports. Late on Sunday, crowds gathered outside the Russian embassy in Kiev, some throwing flares. At least one car belonging to the embassy was set alight. Far-right activists in Ukraine have been demanding martial law The Ukrainian defence ministry announced thatorders had been given to put the military on full combat alert,external. Martial law could give the government the power to restrict public demonstrations,external, regulate the media, suspend elections, and oblige citizens to carry out ""socially necessary"" tasks such as working at a defence facility, local media report. Ukraine's parliament is discussing how to proceed with the issue. A vote is expected later on Monday. If backed by MPs, martial law would enter into force at 07:00 GMT on 28 November. But some politicians are expressing concern it could still lead to the presidential elections being cancelled. Some say President Poroshenko could be a main beneficiary, as his ratings have plummeted. Ukraine gained independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. However, Russia considers a Western-leaning Ukraine a threat to its interests. In 2014, Ukraine's pro-Russian leader was overthrown, after large-scale protests against the government's decision to abandon plans to sign an association agreement with the EU. Russia then annexed Crimea, while Russia-backed separatists moved against the Ukrainian state in the east.

Almost 150 whales die on New Zealand beach,"This video can not be played Almost 150 whales died in a mass stranding on NZ's Stewart Island A group of up to 145 pilot whales have died after becoming stranded on a beach on Stewart Island in New Zealand. The animals were discovered by a walker late on Saturday, strewn along the beach of Mason Bay. Authorities said half the whales had already died by then, while the other half were put down as it would have been too difficult to save them. In separate incidents, 12 pygmy whales and a sperm whale also beached in New Zealand over the weekend. The pilot whales were beached in two pods about 2km (1.2 miles) apart on a remote beach on Rakiura or Stewart Island off the coast of South Island. Whale 'had 115 plastic cups' in stomach Whale hunt turns sea red with blood Whales get stuck in Icelandic fjord ""Sadly, the likelihood of being able to successfully re-float the remaining whales was extremely low,"" Ren Leppens of the regional Department of Conservation (DOC) said in a statement. ""The remote location, lack of nearby personnel and the whales' deteriorating condition meant the most humane thing to do was to euthanise."" ""However, it's always a heart-breaking decision to make."" Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

The DOC said in a statement that whale strandings are not uncommon in New Zealand and that there are about 85 incidents a year. In most cases, though, it's just a single animal that is beached, not a whole pod. It's not fully known why whales or dolphins strand, the agency said. Possible reasons might be sickness, navigational errors, falling tides or being chased by a predator. Also over the weekend, 12 pygmy whales were found stranded at the northern tip of North Island. Four of them have died. There are hopes that the remaining eight can still be rescued and efforts are under way by local marine mammal charity Project Jonah. The group said it planned to re-float the whales on Tuesday and has asked for volunteers to help. On another North Island beach, a 15m (50ft) sperm whale died on Saturday morning.

'Drastic change needed' to protect implant patients,"Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said the risks posed by some devices could grow as technology was advancing so rapidly Urgent and drastic changes to the rules around medical devices, such as pacemakers, are needed to protect patients, according to the Royal College of Surgeons. It wants a register of every device in every patient set up so doctors know if new innovations are causing harm. An investigation by 58 media organisations has uncovered patients being given implants that were unsafe. The government said it would look at what changes may be required. Medical devices range from implanted contraceptives to hip replacements to pacemakers in the heart. BBC Panorama has been investigating the industry with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externaland organisations around the world includingThe Guardian,externalnewspaper and theBritish Medical Journal,external. They found implants being put into people after failing in trials, some involving baboons or after tests only on pigs and dead bodies. The therapy tested on pigs and corpses Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, called for ""drastic"" changes which it urged the government to ""urgently"" address. ""There needs to be compulsory registration of every new device and implant that goes into a patient in the United Kingdom,"" he said. He said doctors were ""not sure"" about the harms of some devices and the risks could grow as technology was advancing so rapidly. Boz Michalowska, a medical devices lawyer at the firm Leigh Day, said: ""It should be a source of shame for the UK government and its regulatory bodies that patients continue to suffer from such avoidable harm."" Representation of a Nanostim leadless pacemaker implanted in a heart (L) and a close-up of the device A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the UK regulator, the MHRA, had a ""robust process"" in place to support the regulation of new medical devices, and it ""expected them to follow up any safety concerns swiftly and with patient care in mind"". ""We will work with the regulator to see what future changes may be required,"" they said. The MHRA said the regulatory system for medical devices had been in place for 25 years and medical technology had ""improved and transformed countless lives"". ""The need to protect public health, whilst not stifling innovation, must be carefully balanced. The MHRA welcomes innovative medical devices that can bring huge health benefits to people as long as this doesn't compromise patient safety,"" it said. Maureen McCleave, 82 from Essex, was the first person in the UK to be fitted with the ""Nanostim"" pacemaker because of an irregular heartbeat. Pacemakers are life-saving implants that deliver electrical pulses to the heart to keep them beating regularly. Traditional ones have leads from a battery to the heart that deliver the electrical pulse, but the cables can break. The Nanostim was the first leadless pacemaker that sat inside the heart. Maureen said she was ""over the moon"" to be the first and felt like a ""good guinea pig"" when she was implanted with the device at Bart's hospital in London. ""I was so grateful that I'd been chosen, because it sounded too good to be true."" Maureen McCleave was fitted with a new type of pacemaker But three years after it was fitted, the battery in Maureen's Nanostim failed and surgeons could not get it out. She now has a traditional pacemaker keeping her alive. The Nanostim is still sitting inside her heart. She says: ""I don't like the thought I've got a piece of metal or whatever in my heart that's doing nothing and it's just laying there."" Maureen was not alone - a number of batteries failed and parts fell off inside patients. The pacemaker was withdrawn for safety reasons. At least two people died and 90 events were recorded in which patients were seriously harmed by the device. The Nanostim heart pacemaker was turned down by safety bodies in Germany because of a lack of evidence. Yet it was approved by the British Standards Institution in the UK. Not all medical devices are dangerous. Many save lives or dramatically improve quality of life. But the investigation has found that some devices are failing patients including: implants that cracked inside people's backs and had failed in baboon tests birth control implants that caused internal damage and bleeding misfiring implantable defibrillators mesh implants for incontinence that caused abdominal pain The BBC also uncovered a treatment for children with a severely curved spine, or scoliosis, which was allowed on to the market following tests only on pigs and dead bodies. Yet, due to a lack of transparency and data collection, the scale of any problem across the medical device industry remains a mystery to both patients and doctors. If you are worried, a panel of experts put together by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has put together some advice. It recommends: ""Your first point of call should be the medical team that performed the operation. ""If you cannot go back to them for whatever reason, you should consult your primary care doctor. ""The doctor should be able to refer you to a specialist who is familiar with the device and the surgery you had."" International Consortium of Investigative Journalists: The Implant Files,external Patients in the UK can alsoreport problems to the regulator,external. Europe does not have a governmental body that checks medical devices before they are put onto the market. Instead a series of companies called notified bodies issue CE marks - the same mark of approval given to devices like toasters and kettles. There are 58 of them in Europe and approval by one means a product can be used anywhere in the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway). But if one body says no, a company can shop around and ask another. Less than patients might think. And there is so much secrecy that even surgeons implanting these devices do not always see the evidence upon which a device has been approved for its safety and effectiveness. The British Standards Institution said it could not discuss the evidence for Nanostim due to ""confidentiality requirements"". Even the UK's regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, says it is ""bound by confidentiality when it comes to some of the actions that we've taken around individual devices"". But the investigation discovered there was only one clinical study before Nanostim was approved for use on the public. It followed just 33 patients for 90 days. Prof Rita Redberg: ""A 90-day follow-up is not enough."" Prof Rita Redberg, one of the world's leading cardiologists and from the University of California, San Francisco, said: ""We're talking about a permanently implanted pacemaker, so I think that's a very tiny study. ""They're supposed to last 10, 20 years. A 90-day follow up is not enough to learn much about the pacemaker."" MedTech Europe, the body that represents the medical devices industry, said: ""Millions of people have safely benefited from medical devices and can now live healthier, more productive and more independent lives. ""Life is unimaginable today without the hundreds of thousands of medical devices in our hospitals and in our homes."" And it defended the system of notified bodies which were ""selected for the expertise, impartiality, transparency and independence of their staff"". Abbott, which manufactured Nanostim, says that many patients have been helped by leadless pacemakers and many more will benefit from this technology in the future. It said: ""In accordance with the European CE Mark approval process, the Nanostim leadless pacing system was approved based on strong performance and safety data. ""In addition, upon CE Mark approval Nanostim was further assessed through a European post market clinical follow-up study."" The UK's Royal College of Surgeons has called for ""drastic regulatory changes"". Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ""All implantable devices should be registered and tracked to monitor efficacy and patient safety in the long-term."" But when the European Union suggested tightening the rules, the industry ran a campaign called ""Don't lose the 3"". It referred to the fact that manufacturers can get new products to patients three years quicker in Europe then they can in the United States. New medical device regulation will come into forcein Europe in 2020,external, but campaigners say the new rules do not go far enough. German MEP Dagmar Roth Behrendt told Panorama that an intensive lobbying campaign by the industry undermined the proposed reforms. ""It's a success for them and a failure for the European parliament and for European patients, I have no doubt about it. ""It is like an open wound for me, that we could not do more for European patients and for the safety of European patients hurts.""

China baby gene editing claim 'dubious'Significant doubts emerge over claims of twins altered as embryos to prevent them from contracting HIV.Health,"Significant doubts have emerged about claims from a Chinese scientist that he has helped make the world's first genetically edited babies. Prof He Jiankui says the twin girls, born a few weeks ago, had their DNA altered as embryos to prevent them from contracting HIV. His claims, filmed by Associated Press, are unverified and have sparked outrage from other scientists, who have called the idea monstrous. Such work is banned in most countries. Gene editing could potentially help avoid heritable diseases by deleting or changing troublesome coding in embryos. But experts worry meddling with the genome of an embryo could cause harm not only to the individual but also future generations that inherit these same changes. And many countries, including the UK, have laws that prevent the use of genome editing in embryos for assisted reproduction in humans. Scientists can do gene editing research on discarded IVF embryos, as long as they are destroyed immediately afterwards and not used to make a baby. But Prof He, who was educated at Stanford in the US and works from a lab in the southern Chinese city of Shenzhen, says he used gene-editing tools to make two twin baby girls, known as ""Lulu"" and ""Nana"". In a video,external, he claims to have eliminated a gene called CCR5 to make the girls resistant to HIV should they ever come into contact with the virus. He says his work is about creating children who would not suffer from diseases, rather than making designer babies with bespoke eye colour or a high IQ. ""I understand my work will be controversial - but I believe families need this technology and I'm willing to take the criticism for them,"" he says in the video. However, several organisations, including a hospital, linked to the claim have denied any involvement. The Southern University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen said it had been unaware of the research project and will now launch an investigation. This video can not be played Fergus Walsh: ""CRISPR gene editing .... uses molecular scissors to cut both strands of DNA"" And other scientists say if the reports are true, Prof He has gone too far, experimenting on healthy embryos without justification. Prof Robert Winston, Emeritus Professor of Fertility Studies and Professor of Science and Society at Imperial College London, said: ""If this is a false report, it is scientific misconduct and deeply irresponsible. ""If true, it is still scientific misconduct."" Dr Dusko Ilic, an expert in stem cell science at King's College London, said: ""If this can be called ethical, then their perception of ethics is very different to the rest of the world's."" He argues that HIV is highly treatable and that if the infection is kept under control with drugs, then there is almost no risk of the parents passing it on to the baby anyway. Prof Julian Savulescu, an expert in ethics at the University of Oxford, said: ""If true, this experiment is monstrous. The embryos were healthy - no known diseases. ""Gene editing itself is experimental and is still associated with off-target mutations, capable of causing genetic problems early and later in life, including the development of cancer. ""This experiment exposes healthy normal children to risks of gene editing for no real necessary benefit."" Scientists say baby gene editing may one day be justifiable, but that more checks and measures are needed before allowing it. Dr Yalda Jamshidi, an expert in human genetics at St George's, University of London, said: ""We know very little about the long term effects, and most people would agree that experimentation on humans for an avoidable condition just to improve our knowledge is morally and ethically unacceptable. ""Whether the results stand up to scrutiny or not we need as a society to think hard and fast about when and where we are willing to take the risks that come with any new therapeutic treatment, particularly ones that could affect future generations.""

Jaydon James, 16, known as JJ, was wounded in Coventry at about 23:40 GMT on Saturday, and died later in hospital. Jayda James described her brother as the ""sweetest, funniest most kind-hearted boy"". His grandfather Joe Green said he had lost his life simply because he had gone out to buy some food. ""He wasn't a fighter,"" said Mr Green. ""He went out to get something to eat and lost his life within about 500 yards of his house."" Police said Jaydon, who celebrated his 16th birthday two weeks ago, was attacked while with friends in Deedmore Road, Wood End, a suburb four miles north of the city centre. Two of Jaydon's friends were also seriously injured in the attack and taken to hospital, where they remain. No arrests have been made. Writing on Facebook, Ms James said: ""Jaydon was the sweetest, funniest most kind hearted boy. ""He didn't fight, he wasn't part of a ""gang"", he was friends with everyone and tried to keep the peace whenever he could. Jaydon was stabbed to death because of his postcode, because he was a [Wood End] boy. ""I can't believe someone took my brother's life simply because of the neighbourhood he lived in."" She also thanked the boys who ""stuck by Jaydon's side"" and ""waited for help to arrive and made sure me and my mum was aware"". Deedmore Road was cordoned off near the Moat House and Castle Wood School Staff at Foxford School and Community Arts College, in Coventry, said Jaydon had been ""loyal, caring and his friends knew that they could rely upon him"". ""He was a bright, respectful student with a big personality and a full member of our school community,"" head teacher Ruth Williamson said. ""The tragic news of Jaydon's death has been a shock to all members of the school and Jaydon's family are at the forefront of our minds."" By Sima Kotecha, BBC Midlands Correspondent The area of Wood End is to the north of Coventry and has large pockets of deprivation. Rows of floral tributes line the pavement along the shops where Jaydon often went to get food. The mood is understandably sombre and as the afternoon sunshine creeps in and reflects off the plastic covering of the bouquets, his former girlfriend Savannah-Jade cries. She describes him as ""wonderful, funny and beautiful"". Ch Supt Mike O'Hara, from West Midlands Police, said the force would not ""fuel conjecture"" that Jaydon's death was gang-related. He said police were ""keeping an open mind"" and would ""leave no stone unturned"". ""I can't accept that I've had a child murdered in the streets of my city,"" he said. On Sunday night more than 200 people held a candlelit vigil in Jaydon's memory. Mr Green called on the community to ""pull together"" to stop the problem of knife crime.

Farrell to replace Schmidt as Ireland rugby coachJoe Schmidt is to stand down as Ireland coach after the 2019 World Cup and will be replaced by defence coach Andy Farrell.BBC SportComments,"Farrell joined Schmidt's coaching team in 2016 ahead of the summer tour of South Africa Joe Schmidt is to stand down as Ireland's head coach after the 2019 World Cup and will be replaced by current defence coach Andy Farrell. Schmidt, 53, said he had decided to finish coaching and focus on family commitments. He has been with Ireland since 2013 and this year guided them to their third Grand Slam and a first victory on home soil over New Zealand. ""I feel that Irish rugby is in good hands,"" said Schmidt. Schmidt's lasting legacy on Irish rugby ""The management and players have been incredible to work with and the tremendous support we have had, particularly at home in the Aviva, but wherever we have travelled, has been uplifting."" Farrell, 43, joined the Ireland set-up in April 2016 as defence coach, having previously had a four-year spell as England assistant coach. The father of current England international Owen Farrell, he was a dual code player who won eight England caps after switching from rugby league to union. Before his role as assistant with England, Farrell coached Aviva Premiership side Saracens. He was also a defence coach for the 2013 series-winning British & Irish Lions tour to Australia. Joe Schmidt has guided Ireland to two wins over the All Blacks ""It is a privilege to be considered for such a prestigious role,"" he said. ""I have learned a lot from Joe over the past few seasons and I will continue to learn from him over the next year as the coaching group and players focus on competing in two huge tournaments in 2019."" Schmidt, who had been tipped as a likely successor to New Zealand coach Steve Hansen, backed the appointment of Farrell as his successor. ""The coaches have been fantastic to work with and Andy has made a big impact since coming into the group,"" the Kiwi said. ""His ability to lead and his understanding of the game will ensure that the group will continue to move forward."" Schmidt, who led Ireland to Six Nations titles in 2014 and 2015 as well as 2018, has masterminded both of Ireland's victories over New Zealand, including the 16-9 win in Dublin earlier this month. He also guided his team from eighth to second in the world rankings in five years at the helm. Ireland reached the quarter-finals of the 2015 World Cup during Schmidt's tenure but will hope to reach at least the last four for the first time in 2019. This video can not be played Schmidt leaves Ireland in a better place - Kearney Schmidt said last week that he had been ""beating myself up about a decision that's been a long time coming"". ""I know I can't continue to go backwards and forwards. The family I have probably committed most to is this family that I live with in Carton House [Ireland's training base] as much as it is the family I have at home. ""So we've put our heads together and tried to reconcile how we can best, maybe, cater for both."" Before Monday's announcement, former Ireland captain Paul O'Connell said the Irish Rugby Football Union should make it ""financially irresponsible"" for Schmidt to leave his post. ""His coaching style and philosophy is filtering down into all the provinces,"" O'Connell told Matt Dawson's Rugby Show on BBC Radio 5live. ""It's filtering down into schools and into underage rugby. It's having a massive effect on Irish rugby in general. ""So it's not just the results he delivers with the national team that mean the IRFU gets great value when they pay him whatever they pay him, it's the effect he seems to be having further down the game as well."" Ireland celebrated what was their third Grand Slam victory in March Chris Jones, BBC Sport rugby union correspondent Since taking over five years ago, Schmidt's impact on Irish rugby has been seismic, with the one blemish being the deflating quarter-final exit at the World Cup in 2015 - something he will be desperate to remedy at next year's tournament in Japan. Schmidt had been talked about as the next All Blacks boss, but says instead he will step away from coaching because of family commitments, leaving Ian Foster as the clear favourite to succeed Steve Hansen. Andy Farrell's appointment as Schmidt's successor is also hugely significant. Sacked by England in 2015, his coaching resurrection is now complete - with this news quashing any chance of a return to Twickenham in the near future.

Director Bernardo Bertolucci dies at 77,"Bernardo Bertolucci, Italian director of Last Tango in Paris and The Last Emperor, has died in Rome, aged 77. Born in Parma in 1941, his other films included The Conformist, The Dreamers, 1900 and The Sheltering Sky. Winner of two Oscars, for directing and co-writing The Last Emperor, he was known for his bold visual style and the controversy stoked by Last Tango in Paris's explicit sexual content. A spokesperson confirmed to the BBC he died of cancer after a short illness. His final feature, Me and You, had its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in 2012. Bernardo Bertolucci: Five key films Bertolucci began his career as an assistant director to Pier Paolo Pasolini on his 1961 film Accattone. He directed his first feature, 1962's La Commare Secca, at the age of 21. The films Before the Revolution and The Spider's Stratagem followed, although it was Last Tango - starring Marlon Brando - that brought him to the attention of the world. The film, about an American businessman who begins a sexually charged relationship with a young Frenchwoman, was banned in several countries. Last Tango rape row a 'misunderstanding' Bertolucci: My love for legend Brando,external Bertolucci given European honour In 2016, a row was ignited after a video emerged of Bertolucci claiming he did not fully prepare the then 19-year-old female star of the film, Maria Schneider, for what he and Brando had planned in the famous butter scene. Schneider claimed the scene in question wasn't in the original script, but the director claimedit was ""a ridiculous misunderstanding"". Bertolucci's most critically successful film was The Last Emperor, a biopic of the Chinese emperor Pu Yi, which won nine Oscars in 1988, including best picture. Bertolucci received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2008 and was awarded an honorary Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2011. The Cannes Festival paid tribute to the director, calling him a ""giant of Italian filmmaking, [who] will remain forever a leading light in world cinema"". Allow Twitter content?

Uber driver convicted over Briton's death,"An Uber driver has been convicted over the death of an English passenger in Sydney, Australia. The passenger, 30-year-old Samuel Thomas, died when he fell from the Uber and was hit by a bus in June last year. Mr Thomas, from Hertfordshire, had been getting out of the car when driver Nazrul Islam accelerated. Islam, 32, pleaded not guilty to negligent driving causing death, but a magistrate ruled that he had not kept ""a proper lookout"" as Mr Thomas exited. ""Mr Islam did not exercise the reasonable care that a driver must exercise,"" Magistrate Mary Ryan told a Sydney court on Monday. Islam had argued that he did not notice his passenger's attempts to exit. The court heard that Mr Thomas and two friends were intoxicated as they travelled home in the Uber from a house party. They were about five minutes from their destination when Mr Thomas, who was in the back seat, opened a rear door and began to get out. Security footage showed the car's internal light was illuminated for six seconds before Islam began to accelerate, causing Mr Thomas to fall. Magistrate Ryan noted that Mr Thomas had opened the door ""without a word of warning"", but said: ""Six seconds of light within the car is a significant warning. ""The only explanation is that Mr Islam was much more fatigued than he admitted."" After the verdict Mr Thomas's sister, Hannah, said it had been her brother's dream to live in Australia. ""We love him and miss him and we just hope that today is some closure for us and for him,"" she said. Islam will be sentenced in January.

Needle found in New Zealand strawberries,"A needle crisis in Australia saw hundreds of punnet pulled from shelves A needle was found inside a punnet of strawberries on sale in a New Zealand supermarket, the second such incident in recent months. The strawberries were bought at a Fresh Choice supermarket in Geraldine, a town on the South Island. It comes after a nationwide scare in Australia which saw almost 200 reports of needle-contaminated strawberries. An Australian woman accused of carrying out the act in ""spite"" has since been arrested. It is not clear if the strawberry punnet, which was bought on Saturday morning, was domestic to New Zealand or imported from Australia. Why would someone hide a needle in fruit? Berry needle scare 'motivated by spite' Australia crackdown on fruit scare 'idiots' The person who found the needle was not harmed,,externala Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) spokesperson told news outlet Newshub. However, the store has removed all strawberries from its shelves as a ""precautionary measure"". MPI say the matter has been referred to the police, adding that they were currently conducting an investigation. This is the latest incident to take place in New Zealand sincea needle was found in a punnet of Australia-imported strawberriesearlier in September New Zealand's two largest food distributors - Countdown and Foodstuffs - said then they had stopped importing Australian strawberries due to the scare. The nationwide scare in Australia saw hundreds of punnets of strawberries pulled from shelves. But some reports turned out to be hoaxes and others are thought to be copycat cases or social media stunts. However, Australian woman My Ut Trinh who has been accused of putting needles inside strawberries, was arrested earlier this month. Ms Trinh, who worked at a supervisor at a strawberry farm north of Brisbane, is alleged to have been motivated by spite. She faces up to 15 years in prison if found guilty.

Have a lovely weekend. Winds will slowly ease down this evening, with showers largely diminishing. During the early hours, skies will gradually cloud over from the south, though conditions should stay dry through to dawn. Minimum Temperature: 0 to 3C (32 to 37F). Tomorrow a  cloudy day is envisaged, with rain quickly spreading from the south to leave a wet morning. During the afternoon, most of the rain will clear east, leaving just a few showers and some brighter spells. Maximum Temperature: 3 to 6C (37 to 43F). The Magpie Group has called upon Newcastle supporters to refrain from taking their seats during the first 11 minutes of the West Ham match tomorrow. The action is in protest at the 11  years of Mike Ashley's tenure as owner of the club. According to the group, December is their last chance to put pressure upon the owner to support Rafa Benitez (pictured) in the January transfer window. There are concerns that the manager will not renew his contract next summer unless he receives backing. A group spokesman said 
""We encourage fans to take a stand in this fixture and in the game against Wolves, where we propose a full boycott. ""We know this is painful for Newcastle supporters to do but, for the longer term future of the club, it's time to tell those at the top that enough is enough"" Metro passengers will see a ""modest"" increase in single, day and season fares, Nexus has announced. The new prices will come into effect from 2 January. According to the new proposals, the cost of the Pop Pay As You Go smartcard will be frozen. This means students and customers who use it will be paying the same price for their travel in 2019 as they were in 2012. Meanwhile, single, day and season Metro tickets' price will go up by 10p. The increase is to help meet running costs. Newcastle boss Rafael Benitez is still without defender Paul Dummett for the
Magpies' Premier League clash with West Ham tomorrow. Dummett picked up a hamstring injury on international duty with Wales and is
expected to be ruled out for a number of weeks. Benitez can pick from a fully-fit squad, with captain Jamaal
Lascelles among those pushing for a return following a shoulder injury. Artefacts, including pottery, animal bone and a 600-year-old shoe have been uncovered during improvement works around Stephenson's Monument in Newcastle. The findings, dating back to the 14th and 15th centuries, suggest the area was used as waste ground or a garden. Chris Scott, senior
archaeologist at Solstice Heritage, said: âThe finds show that even 600 years ago, people in Newcastle
were fashionable, busy in business and linked closely with our continental neighbours
through trade.â Archaeologists investigated the area before improvement work began as part of transformation project, funded through the Regional Growth Fund. The social media challenge where people fill a trolley with donations was set up by a proud Gypsy. The Heerema HFG facility at Hartlepool is going up for sale but staff are hopeful a new owner will diversify the company's produce. The firm's Dutch headquarters is also up for sale.

She said: ""I know that many people are fed up of hearing about Brexit - and I too am angry that we have spent almost 30 months not properly focusing on the myriad of other issues desperately requiring our attention, whether the NHS, schools, transport, rising food bank use, social care or climate change, particularly when the Prime Minister's deal is all we have to show for it. ""But our impending departure from the EU is the single biggest issue facing our country since the Second World War, and it is impossible to overstate how important it is we get this right. ""This is categorically not about trying to re-run the 2016 referendum, but about asking people to confirm - now that a Brexit deal is actually on the table - whether this is what they want for our country, our economy and their families.

Kuenssberg: The PM's strategy,"The talking in Brussels is done. After nearly two years of negotiations, arguments - and the inevitable moments where it felt like the process would explode - there is, now, a deal. It's a compromise. It was always going to be. It's not a happy compromise either. People on both sides of the Brexit argument are already screaming their protests. And although the prime minister must be relieved, she didn't exactly say that she was pleased about the deal when I asked her at a news conference this lunchtime. Instead, she said she was sure the country's best days are ahead. But however she really feels about it - and with this prime minister it is hard to tell - her strategy for the next couple of weeks is crystal clear. Her case? This is all there is. UK's Brexit deal agreed by EU leaders Brexit deal 'worse than no deal' - DUP Theresa May's 'letter to the nation' in full With the explicit backing of almost every European leader who has opened their mouth today, this is the ""only deal"", the ""best possible deal"", ""the max"". The message to MPs from Theresa May and her counterparts: don't kid yourselves if you think something else might magically appear if you vote it down. And the message to the public? Just let me get on with it, then we can all stop talking about Brexit - please. Again today she used the platform to ""talk directly to the British public"", to explain how her (now rather pink) red lines, on ""money, laws and borders"", have been followed. It's her Brexit with caveats, with a lot to be sorted out about the future, in the future.You can remind yourself what's actually in the deal here. And No 10 is all too aware that dozens and dozens of their own MPs hate it. Theresa May has reached her imperfect compromise at a moment when in Parliament both sides are hardening against the idea of compromising at all. What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Brexit: All you need to know 'Wales less prosperous after Brexit deal' For two years Theresa May has survived by tacking one way, then another. But now the deal is on paper, in black and white, that approach can't go on. A senior government figure said privately that No 10 was past the point of trying to please everyone. And of course, everyone in government is all too aware that it is likely that the deal will be rejected by Parliament in any case. But the only potential route through for the prime minister is through the middle, to look like, as one senior Whitehall official describes it, ""the adult in a world of children"". However the prime minister looks, however she sounds in the next fortnight, the levels of unhappiness at home are so profound that her pleas may fall on deaf ears. If the deal falls, she - and her government - may fall with it. Scrape it through then she'll have pulled off a feat far harder than getting the actual deal done.

Mexico to deport migrants who stormed borderA group of about 500 Central Americans tried to cross into the US illegally on Sunday.US & Canada,"This video can not be played US closes border crossing after migrant rush Mexico says it has deported nearly 100 Central American migrants a day after they tried to storm the US border. The group, among thousands of migrants heading towards the US, was rounded up after trying to cross the border ""violently"" and ""illegally"" on Sunday, said the interior ministry. Video footage shows dozens of people running towards the border fence near the city of Tijuana. US border officers used tear gas to repel them and said some threw rocks. US President Donald Trump hasreiterated a threat he made last weekto close the border completely. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday US officials confirmed that 42 people who managed to cross on Sunday had been arrested, accused of disturbing the peace and other charges. And Gerardo Garcia Benavente, of Mexico's migration office, said: ""98 foreigners were returned to their country last night following the violent incident at the border post."" Tension has been running high on the US-Mexican border since the arrival of almost 7,500 migrants over the past weeks. Humanitarian crisis develops in Tijuana What is the migrant caravan heading to US? The migrants, who are mostly from Honduras, but also from Guatemala and El Salvador, say they are fleeing the threat of violence in their home countries and looking to make a better life for themselves and their families. They have travelled in large groups, dubbed ""caravans"", for more than 4,000km (2,500 miles) from Central America and most want to reach the United States, where they say they plan to ask for asylum. Among them are many families with young children. President Trump has vowed to keep each migrant on the Mexican side of the border until courts have decided their cases, meaning some face a long wait. They have been spending the past two weeks in temporary shelters in the Mexican border city of Tijuana and in Mexicali, 180km to the east along the border. A group of at least 500 migrants joined a march from their shelter in Tijuana towards the border on Sunday. The march started peacefully Mexican Interior Minister Alfonso Navarrete said the migrants had asked for help to organise the demonstration but were then reportedly encouraged by some of the movement's leaders to split into different groups so they could make a run for the border and try to cross into the US. The march started peacefully with migrants carrying pro-immigration banners and shouting: ""We aren't criminals! We are hard workers!"" But once they managed to get past the security cordon, the march quickly turned into a dash for the border, BBC correspondent Will Grant reports. But when a group split off and made a dash for the border, US border patrol reacted Some migrants managed to climb the border fence But they were driven back by tear gas Several hundred managed to climb over the first barrier, according to AFP news agency. It was as they tried to cross a second, spike-topped wall that officials on the US side began firing tear gas. An AFP journalist saw the migrants - including mothers and children - trying to protect themselves from the gas. Associated Press Mexico correspondentChris Sherman said he had seen parents running away with choking toddlers,external. Among them was Honduran migrant Ana Zuniga, 23, and her three-year-old child: ""We ran but when you run, the smoke smothers you more."" US Customs and Border Protection, which polices the border, said its personnel had been assaulted and hit by rocks. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Chief Patrol Agent Rodney Scott told CNN on Monday: ""There were sections that had dilapidated border wall that was made out of scrap metal the military gave us. ""The group breached a couple of sections of that, actually tore down one small section."" As a result of Sunday's action, the US closed the San Ysidro border crossing near Tijuana to vehicles and pedestrians for a number of hours, causing long delays in both directions. The San Ysidro border crossing is the busiest between Mexico and the US US Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the migrants had tried to harm US border guards ""by throwing projectiles at them"". She said the department would ""not tolerate this type of lawlessness and will not hesitate to shut down ports of entry for security and public safety reasons"" and that US officials would ""seek to prosecute"" offenders. Mr Trump has said he has given troops at the border the go-ahead to use lethal force if needed, but no soldiers were involved in Sunday's confrontation. Mexico's interior ministry said that, ""far from helping their objectives"", the migrants' actions had violated the legal migration framework and could have led to a ""serious incident"". The ministry also said on Sunday it has deported 11,000 Central Americans since 19 October, when this influx of migrants first entered the country. The mood in the migrant shelter is likely to darken, says the BBC's Will Grant. And with many in the shelters realising how long the wait for asylum could be, some, like Honduran Joseph GarcÃ­a, are growing increasingly desperate: ""My little girl is sick and I don't even have money for milk. I can't stand it anymore."" Mexican officials deny US border deal What is the migrant caravan heading to US?

Medical device rules need 'drastic change',"Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said the risks posed by some devices could grow as technology was advancing so rapidly Urgent and drastic changes to the rules around medical devices, such as pacemakers, are needed to protect patients, according to the Royal College of Surgeons. It wants a register of every device in every patient set up so doctors know if new innovations are causing harm. An investigation by 58 media organisations has uncovered patients being given implants that were unsafe. The government said it would look at what changes may be required. Medical devices range from implanted contraceptives to hip replacements to pacemakers in the heart. BBC Panorama has been investigating the industry with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externaland organisations around the world includingThe Guardian,externalnewspaper and theBritish Medical Journal,external. They found implants being put into people after failing in trials, some involving baboons or after tests only on pigs and dead bodies. The therapy tested on pigs and corpses Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, called for ""drastic"" changes which it urged the government to ""urgently"" address. ""There needs to be compulsory registration of every new device and implant that goes into a patient in the United Kingdom,"" he said. He said doctors were ""not sure"" about the harms of some devices and the risks could grow as technology was advancing so rapidly. Boz Michalowska, a medical devices lawyer at the firm Leigh Day, said: ""It should be a source of shame for the UK government and its regulatory bodies that patients continue to suffer from such avoidable harm."" Representation of a Nanostim leadless pacemaker implanted in a heart (L) and a close-up of the device A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said the UK regulator, the MHRA, had a ""robust process"" in place to support the regulation of new medical devices, and it ""expected them to follow up any safety concerns swiftly and with patient care in mind"". ""We will work with the regulator to see what future changes may be required,"" they said. The MHRA said the regulatory system for medical devices had been in place for 25 years and medical technology had ""improved and transformed countless lives"". ""The need to protect public health, whilst not stifling innovation, must be carefully balanced. The MHRA welcomes innovative medical devices that can bring huge health benefits to people as long as this doesn't compromise patient safety,"" it said. Maureen McCleave, 82 from Essex, was the first person in the UK to be fitted with the ""Nanostim"" pacemaker because of an irregular heartbeat. Pacemakers are life-saving implants that deliver electrical pulses to the heart to keep them beating regularly. Traditional ones have leads from a battery to the heart that deliver the electrical pulse, but the cables can break. The Nanostim was the first leadless pacemaker that sat inside the heart. Maureen said she was ""over the moon"" to be the first and felt like a ""good guinea pig"" when she was implanted with the device at Bart's hospital in London. ""I was so grateful that I'd been chosen, because it sounded too good to be true."" Maureen McCleave was fitted with a new type of pacemaker But three years after it was fitted, the battery in Maureen's Nanostim failed and surgeons could not get it out. She now has a traditional pacemaker keeping her alive. The Nanostim is still sitting inside her heart. She says: ""I don't like the thought I've got a piece of metal or whatever in my heart that's doing nothing and it's just laying there."" Maureen was not alone - a number of batteries failed and parts fell off inside patients. The pacemaker was withdrawn for safety reasons. At least two people died and 90 events were recorded in which patients were seriously harmed by the device. The Nanostim heart pacemaker was turned down by safety bodies in Germany because of a lack of evidence. Yet it was approved by the British Standards Institution in the UK. Not all medical devices are dangerous. Many save lives or dramatically improve quality of life. But the investigation has found that some devices are failing patients including: implants that cracked inside people's backs and had failed in baboon tests birth control implants that caused internal damage and bleeding misfiring implantable defibrillators mesh implants for incontinence that caused abdominal pain The BBC also uncovered a treatment for children with a severely curved spine, or scoliosis, which was allowed on to the market following tests only on pigs and dead bodies. Yet, due to a lack of transparency and data collection, the scale of any problem across the medical device industry remains a mystery to both patients and doctors. If you are worried, a panel of experts put together by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has put together some advice. It recommends: ""Your first point of call should be the medical team that performed the operation. ""If you cannot go back to them for whatever reason, you should consult your primary care doctor. ""The doctor should be able to refer you to a specialist who is familiar with the device and the surgery you had."" International Consortium of Investigative Journalists: The Implant Files,external Patients in the UK can alsoreport problems to the regulator,external. Europe does not have a governmental body that checks medical devices before they are put onto the market. Instead a series of companies called notified bodies issue CE marks - the same mark of approval given to devices like toasters and kettles. There are 58 of them in Europe and approval by one means a product can be used anywhere in the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway). But if one body says no, a company can shop around and ask another. Less than patients might think. And there is so much secrecy that even surgeons implanting these devices do not always see the evidence upon which a device has been approved for its safety and effectiveness. The British Standards Institution said it could not discuss the evidence for Nanostim due to ""confidentiality requirements"". Even the UK's regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, says it is ""bound by confidentiality when it comes to some of the actions that we've taken around individual devices"". But the investigation discovered there was only one clinical study before Nanostim was approved for use on the public. It followed just 33 patients for 90 days. Prof Rita Redberg: ""A 90-day follow-up is not enough."" Prof Rita Redberg, one of the world's leading cardiologists and from the University of California, San Francisco, said: ""We're talking about a permanently implanted pacemaker, so I think that's a very tiny study. ""They're supposed to last 10, 20 years. A 90-day follow up is not enough to learn much about the pacemaker."" MedTech Europe, the body that represents the medical devices industry, said: ""Millions of people have safely benefited from medical devices and can now live healthier, more productive and more independent lives. ""Life is unimaginable today without the hundreds of thousands of medical devices in our hospitals and in our homes."" And it defended the system of notified bodies which were ""selected for the expertise, impartiality, transparency and independence of their staff"". Abbott, which manufactured Nanostim, says that many patients have been helped by leadless pacemakers and many more will benefit from this technology in the future. It said: ""In accordance with the European CE Mark approval process, the Nanostim leadless pacing system was approved based on strong performance and safety data. ""In addition, upon CE Mark approval Nanostim was further assessed through a European post market clinical follow-up study."" The UK's Royal College of Surgeons has called for ""drastic regulatory changes"". Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ""All implantable devices should be registered and tracked to monitor efficacy and patient safety in the long-term."" But when the European Union suggested tightening the rules, the industry ran a campaign called ""Don't lose the 3"". It referred to the fact that manufacturers can get new products to patients three years quicker in Europe then they can in the United States. New medical device regulation will come into forcein Europe in 2020,external, but campaigners say the new rules do not go far enough. German MEP Dagmar Roth Behrendt told Panorama that an intensive lobbying campaign by the industry undermined the proposed reforms. ""It's a success for them and a failure for the European parliament and for European patients, I have no doubt about it. ""It is like an open wound for me, that we could not do more for European patients and for the safety of European patients hurts.""

Uber driver convicted over Briton's deathSamuel Thomas was fatally struck by a bus while trying to get out of the Uber in Sydney.Australia,"An Uber driver has been convicted over the death of an English passenger in Sydney, Australia. The passenger, 30-year-old Samuel Thomas, died when he fell from the Uber and was hit by a bus in June last year. Mr Thomas, from Hertfordshire, had been getting out of the car when driver Nazrul Islam accelerated. Islam, 32, pleaded not guilty to negligent driving causing death, but a magistrate ruled that he had not kept ""a proper lookout"" as Mr Thomas exited. ""Mr Islam did not exercise the reasonable care that a driver must exercise,"" Magistrate Mary Ryan told a Sydney court on Monday. Islam had argued that he did not notice his passenger's attempts to exit. The court heard that Mr Thomas and two friends were intoxicated as they travelled home in the Uber from a house party. They were about five minutes from their destination when Mr Thomas, who was in the back seat, opened a rear door and began to get out. Security footage showed the car's internal light was illuminated for six seconds before Islam began to accelerate, causing Mr Thomas to fall. Magistrate Ryan noted that Mr Thomas had opened the door ""without a word of warning"", but said: ""Six seconds of light within the car is a significant warning. ""The only explanation is that Mr Islam was much more fatigued than he admitted."" After the verdict Mr Thomas's sister, Hannah, said it had been her brother's dream to live in Australia. ""We love him and miss him and we just hope that today is some closure for us and for him,"" she said. Islam will be sentenced in January.

Rail complaints ombudsman launchedPassengers who are unhappy with how their complaints are handled can now appeal through new service.Business,"Rail passengers who are unhappy about how their complaints have been handled will be able to appeal via a service launched on Monday. The Dispute Resolution Ombudsman is an independent body designed to hold train companies to account. Figures show 28% of people who made a complaint to a rail company in 2017/18 were satisfied with the outcome. It follows widespread disruption on the railways this year which has angered many passengers. This included the botched rollout of a new timetable in May and repeated strikes which caused chaos on some lines. 'Nobody took charge' in rail timetable chaos Arriva blames weather for complaints spike The most common gripes last year were about punctuality and reliability, difficulties buying a ticket and not being able to find a seat. The vast majority of complaints are dealt with by train companies without the need for people to turn to an appeals process, the Office of Rail and Road says.

Rail complaints ombudsman launched,"Rail passengers who are unhappy about how their complaints have been handled will be able to appeal via a service launched on Monday. The Dispute Resolution Ombudsman is an independent body designed to hold train companies to account. Figures show 28% of people who made a complaint to a rail company in 2017/18 were satisfied with the outcome. It follows widespread disruption on the railways this year which has angered many passengers. This included the botched rollout of a new timetable in May and repeated strikes which caused chaos on some lines. 'Nobody took charge' in rail timetable chaos Arriva blames weather for complaints spike The most common gripes last year were about punctuality and reliability, difficulties buying a ticket and not being able to find a seat. The vast majority of complaints are dealt with by train companies without the need for people to turn to an appeals process, the Office of Rail and Road says. However, passengers can use the ombudsman if they are unhappy with the final response from an operator or if their complaint has not been resolved within 40 working days. It is thought around 6,000 complaints a year will be referred to the new service. Its decisions will be binding and rail firms will have to take action if failings are identified.

Sacked Welsh minister's inquest to start,"Carl Sargeant had been a Welsh Government minister for almost a decade A sacked Welsh Government minister found dead at his home last year left a letter telling his family ""I have failed you"", an inquest has heard. Labour AM Carl Sargeant, 49, was found hanged four days after First Minister Carwyn Jones dismissed him as communities and children secretary. The father-of-two faced allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards women, a claim he denied. He wrote: ""You deserve none of this adverse publicity 'cause of my acts."" Mr Sargeant had been suspended from the Welsh Labour party prior to his death on 7 November 2017. Coroner John Gittins has previously said theprovisional cause of death was hangingin ""an apparent act of self harm"". Mr Sargeant's letter, read to the inquest at Ruthin, Denbighshire, on Monday, said: ""To Bernie, Lucy, Jack and family/friends. I have let you down badly. You deserve none of this adverse publicity 'cause of my acts. I have failed you. ""That aside, I love you more than you'll ever know and I'm sorry I have taken the easy way out, leaving you with my shit. Please forgive me. I love you, Carl/Dad."" Former minister Leighton Andrews arriving at the inquest The court later heard from former Welsh Government minister Leighton Andrews, who told the inquest Carwyn Jones's behaviour was irresponsible following Mr Sargeant's sacking. Mr Andrews said Mr Jones gave media interviews on the Monday following a cabinet reshuffle on Friday 3 November 2017, which had a ""significant impact"" on Mr Sargeant's state of mind. Mr Andrews said the first minister had been ""speculating"" during the interviews, although he did not elaborate further. The inquest also heard details of a text message sent from Mr Andrews to Mr Jones on the evening of the reshuffle. Under questioning by the first minister's counsel Cathy McGahey, Mr Andrews agreed he had written phrases quoted from the text including ""great to see new faces promotedâ¦it's a great reshuffle"" and that it must have been an ""immensely difficult conversation to have had with Carl"". Before hearing evidence from Mr Andrews, the coroner told him the inquest was not about blame or fault. He thanked him for his previously-submitted statement, but warned him there may be elements within it that fell outside this investigation. Jack Sargeant with his mother Bernadette arriving at the inquest At the start of the inquest, Mr Gittins said there was no room in his court room for speculation or accusation, adding: ""This will not be a trial by press, politics or personality."" He read a statement from PC Siwan Hughes, who was called to Mr Sargeant's home in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, after his body was found in a utility room by his wife Bernadette. The police officer was told by Mrs Sargeant she had found a note on the door of the utility room telling her not to go in and to call the police. The letter to his family was left next to his body. The court heard there were traces of anti-depressants in his blood, but not enough to be a contributory factor to his death. Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe worked alongside Mr Sargeant Speaking at the inquest, future generations commissioner Sophie Howe, who became special adviser to Mr Sargeant in 2013, said she noticed his health begin to deteriorate in the summer of 2017, several months before his death. She said he used to say ""I'm having a real black dog of a day"" and there were ""a number of pressures at work"". She added on the day of Mr Sargeant's sacking, he called her in the afternoon saying ""I'm out and it's really bad"". ""He said 'I don't know what's going on, I haven't been told what the allegations are'. I find that incredible, that he could be sacked without being told what the allegations were,"" she said. Ms Howe added the work environment was ""toxic"". She said she was in regular contact with Mr Sargeant over the weekend following his sacking. ""He was saying 'I'm in a dark place'. I was very concerned about him,"" she said. Ms Howe added Mr Sargeant was ""distraught"" about not knowing the detail of the allegations against him. She added his mood had improved by the end of the weekend but took a ""downward turn"" after he was door-stepped by a journalist on the Monday morning. On the day before his death, Ms Howe received a text message from David Taylor, a friend of Mr Sargeant, who had been asking how to programme a text message to be sent at a later time. Ms Howe told the coroner she then became concerned Mr Sargeant was planning to take his own life. She managed to contact him by phone, and ""he sounded completely spaced-out"". She repeatedly asked him why he wanted to know how to delay a text message being sent, to which he said, ""I just wanted to know"". She added she believes she was the last person to speak to Mr Sargeant. Mr Sargeant later sent a text message to a group which she was a member of, saying ""love you all"". Leighton Andrews gave evidence at Ruthin in front of family lawyer Leslie Thomas (left), Coroner John Gittins (centre) and Mr Sargeant's wife Bernadette (right) Giving evidence, Mr Sargeant's GP Dr David Morris said the late politician had been in good general health, apart from being ""a big fella"", but had presented with symptoms of depression in March 2012, the first of several episodes. The doctor said Mr Sargeant had described himself as ""low in mood"", suffering from disturbed sleep and ""weepiness"", and had also told him: ""It feels like what I think post-traumatic stress might be."" This was due to an illness of another family member. He was prescribed a course of fluoxetine medication after being diagnosed with ""moderately severe depression"". He had a short course of sleeping tablets in 2014 and in July 2016 was put back on fluoxetine, which notes show he feared to stop taking. Later that year he scored one on a scale used to determine whether he had considered self-harming, which was at the lower end. He was prescribed a different anti-depressant and by November was feeling better, with improved sleep. The drugs were repeated throughout much of 2017, with the last prescription in the October of that year. Cathy McGahey QC, representing the first minister, asked whether some people suffering depression were able to function in their working lives, to which Dr Morris said they were. Questioned by Leslie Thomas QC, for the Sargeant family, the doctor also agreed some people did not function well at work with depression. Mr Thomas pointed out Mr Sargeant was last seen by a medical practitioner almost a year before his death. He asked what would be the impact on people who used work as an outlet for their depression if that work was going badly and an individual no longer had that outlet. Dr Morris said: ""A negative one."" Sargeant family gets inquiry review The first minister is due to appear at the five-day inquest on Wednesday, while Mr Sargeant's cabinet colleagues, Lesley Griffiths and Ken Skates, will also give evidence. The inquest is set to hear from Mr Sargeant's son Jack, who succeeded him as the AM for Alyn and Deeside. Mr Sargeant's body was found in the utility room of his house in Connah's Quay Mr Sargeant was facing a partyinvestigation into claims about inappropriate personal conduct with womenand was suspended from the Welsh Labour Party prior to his death. His family said he was not told the details of what he was accused of and was unable to properly defend himself. An independent investigation into how Mr Jones handled Mr Sargeant's sacking will begin in the new year. Earlier this month, theHigh Court gave the family permission to challengethe format of a separate investigation into how his sacking was handled, with his wife saying she feared the probe would be a ""cover-up"". Carl Sargeant had been a Welsh Government minister for almost a decade Mr Sargeant had been a Welsh Government minister for eight years before his sacking in November last year. The former environmental auditor and industrial firefighter had been a Welsh Assembly member since 2003. Mr Sargeant was appointed Labour's chief whip and deputy minister for assembly business following the 2007 election. He was promoted to the cabinet in 2009 as minister for social justice and local government, then served as housing and natural resources minister before being appointed communities secretary in May 2016. Mr Sargeant helped drive legislation to tackle domestic violence and ledthe Welsh Government's response to the Grenfell Tower fire, promising Welsh high-rise blocks were as safe as they could be.

'Unusual' bushfires sweep Australia's north,"A 50km-long bushfire in Queensland is threatening homes Hundreds of Australians have evacuated their homes due to bushfires amid ""unprecedented"" weather conditions in the state of Queensland, officials say. About 40 bushfires are burning across the state following a heatwave, said Queensland Fire and Emergency Services. The most serious blaze, 450km (280 miles) north of Brisbane, has destroyed at least two homes, damaged four others and prompted evacuation orders. The conditions have been described as ""highly unusual"" for this time of year. The largest bushfire is about 50km long and has burnt through approximately 11,000 hectares in the Deepwater National Park. It began on Saturday and is expected to remain a threat in coming days. Most of the other bushfires are being contained, authorities said. Unlike in Australia's drier south, intense fire conditions are unusual in Queensland in late November because it is the wet season. However strong winds, drier than average conditions and a recent heatwave had led to fires across the state, QFES Commissioner Katarina Carroll said on Monday. ""In this part of the world we have not experienced these conditions before,"" she said. ""It is unprecedented."" How Australia's extreme heat might be here to stay Australia's drought seen from the air The region is forecast to experience further strong winds and hot temperatures this week. Bushfires also damaged neighbouring New South Wales last week. Both states are currently in the grip of drought. No single factor is to blame for extreme weather butclimate change is bringing more frequent and severe events, experts say.

Russia seizes Ukrainian naval ships,"This video can not be played Jonah Fisher talks to a commander of the Ukrainian Navy about the tensions in the Azov Sea Russia has fired on and seized three Ukrainian naval vessels off the Crimean Peninsula in a major escalation of tensions between the two countries. Two gunboats and a tug were captured by Russian forces. A number of Ukrainian crew members were injured. Each country blames the other for the incident. On Monday Ukrainian MPs are due to vote on declaring martial law. The crisis began when Russia accused the Ukrainian ships of illegally entering its waters. The Russians placed a tanker under a bridge in the Kerch Strait - the only access to the Sea of Azov, which is shared between the two countries. A tanker under the bridge shut all navigation from and into the Sea of Azov During a meeting of Ukraine's National Security and Defence Council, President Petro Poroshenko described the Russian actions as ""unprovoked and crazy"". Russia has requested an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council, which US ambassador to the UNNikki Haley says has been called for 11:00,externalNew York time (16:00 GMT) on Monday. The crisis as it happened Crimea profile Tensions have recently risen in the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov off the Crimean peninsula - annexed by Russia in 2014. In the morning, Ukraine's Berdyansk and Nikopol gunboats, and the Yana Kapa tug, tried to sail from the Black Sea port of Odessa to Mariupol in the Sea of Azov. Ukraine says the Russians tried to intercept the ships, ramming the tug. The vessels continued towards the Kerch Strait, but were prevented by the tanker. Russia scrambled two fighter jets and two helicopters to the area. It accused the ships of illegally entering its waters and said the traffic had been suspended for security reasons. The Ukrainian navy later said the boats had been hit and disabled as they tried to leave the area. It said six crew members had been injured. Eastern Ukraine: A new, bloody chapter Ukraine names Russia as 'aggressor' state Russia's FSB later confirmed that one of its patrol boats had used force to seize the three Ukrainian vessels but said only three sailors had been wounded. Ukraine said it had informed the Russians of its plan to move its ships through the sea to Mariupol. Analysis by Steven Rosenberg, BBC News, Moscow Tension between Russia and Ukraine has been building for months off Crimea. Under a 2003 treaty between Moscow and Kiev, the Kerch Strait and the Sea of Azov are shared territorial waters. But recently there, Russia began inspecting all vessels sailing to or from Ukrainian ports. The use of force by Russia to seize Ukrainian vessels - with casualties - is a major escalation. But you won't hear Moscow taking the blame. Under President Vladimir Putin, when Russia has used force before, its line of defence has always been: ""We didn't start it."" That goes for the Russia-Georgia War of 2008, and the appearance of ""Little Green Men"" (Russian special forces) in Crimea in 2014, which preceded Moscow's annexation of the peninsula. So, expect Moscow to pin the blame for what happened on Sunday and for whatever happens next on President Poroshenko's government. The European Union called on Russia to ""restore freedom of passage at the Kerch Strait"" and urged ""all to act with utmost restraint"". Nato said it ""fully supports Ukraine's sovereignty and its territorial integrity, including its navigational rights in its territorial waters"". It said Russia should ""ensure unhindered access to Ukrainian ports in the Azov Sea"". The shallow Sea of Azov lies east of Crimea, and south of the Ukrainian regions partially seized by pro-Russian separatists. The two Ukrainian ports on its northern shore - Berdyansk and Mariupol - are key to exporting grain and produce such as steel, also for importing coal. The 2003 treaty between Ukraine and Russia guaranteed free navigation to both countries' vessels. Russian navy ships intercepted the Ukrainian vessels after accusing them entering Russia's waters But Russia has recently begun inspecting ships going to or from Ukrainian ports. Earlier this month, the EU warned it would take ""targeted measures"" to address the issue. The inspections began soon after Ukraine detained a fishing vessel from Crimea in March. Moscow says they are necessary for security reasons, pointing to a potential threat to the bridge from Ukrainian radicals. More than 10,000 people have been killed in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions since separatists moved against the Ukrainian state in April 2014. Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of sending its troops to the region and arming the separatists. Moscow denies this but says that Russian volunteers are helping the rebels.

Fury after Russia seizes Ukrainian boats,"This video can not be played Footage of the collision was posted by the Ukrainian Interior Minister Ukraine's parliament is to decide whether to bring in martial law, after Sunday's capture of three of its naval vessels and 23 crew members by Russia. The three ships were sailing off the coast of Crimea, which was annexed by Russia in 2014, when they were seized. Russia opened fire, before its special forces stormed the vessels. Between three and six Ukrainians were injured. Ukraine said it was a Russian ""act of aggression"". Moscow said the ships had illegally entered its waters. On Monday, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said he was proposing that parliament back a 30-day martial law - half the length of that recommended by Ukraine's security and defence council. He said he did not want the measure to affect presidential elections set for 31 March 2019. Sunday's clash is the first time Russia and Ukraine have come into open conflict in recent years, although Ukrainian forces have been fighting Russian-backed separatists and Russia volunteers in the east since 2014. Russia-Ukraine sea clash in 300 words Russia 'bigger threat than IS' - Army chief Eastern Ukraine: A new, bloody chapter A number of Western countries condemned Russia's actions. In New York, the UN Security Council met to discuss the crisis - but failed to agree a Russian-proposed agenda amid sharp disagreements between Moscow and the West. This is the chronology of the dramatic events that led to the naval clash: In the morning, Ukraine said it had sent two gunboats and a tug from the Black Sea port of Odessa to Mariupol in the Sea of Azov Ukraine's navy then said Russian boats had tried to intercept its vessels, ramming the tug Russia accused Ukraine of illegally entering its territorial waters Russia scrambled fighter jets and helicopters as the Ukrainian vessels approached a bridge over the Kerch Strait - the only access to the Sea of Azov The bridge itself was blocked by a tanker In the evening, Ukraine said its vessels had been fired on and seized by the Russians. Six Ukrainian crew members were injured Russia confirmed it had used weapons to force the Ukrainian vessels to stop, saying three Ukrainians were injured Russia said the Ukrainian ships were in its waters illegally because Moscow had temporarily closed an area of water for shipping. Kiev called Russia's actions a flagrant violation of international law, because the Black Sea is free for shipping, and Crimea belongs to Ukraine. Ukraine also cited a 2003 Russia-Ukraine treaty on unimpeded access to the Kerch Strait and Sea of Azov. It said it had informed the Russians in advance of its plan to move its ships to Mariupol - a claim denied by Russia. In recent weeks, two Ukrainian vessels passed through the Kerch Straight without incident. The crisis as it happened Ukraine names Russia as 'aggressor' state By Jonathan Marcus, defence and diplomatic correspondent The incident in the Black Sea is a powerful reminder that the tensions between Russia and Ukraine are not part of a frozen conflict: they can flare up with very little warning. Nato and Ukraine's allies in the West have strongly backed President Poroshenko. But what can they do to influence Russian behaviour? This video can not be played Why tensions between Russia and Ukraine are so high There will be talk of more economic sanctions. But Russia is already heavily sanctioned, and this has not encouraged it to rethink its annexation of Crimea. There will be calls for additional support for the Ukrainians; Nato countries provide training for Kiev's military - they could presumably do more. And the Trump administration, even before this episode, was already considering calls to sell additional weaponry to Ukraine in addition to the Javelin anti-tank missiles already supplied. But there is a difficult balance to be struck between support for Ukraine's territorial integrity on the one hand and avoiding anything that might tip the conflict into full-scale war. There have been growing tensions between the two sides over navigation in the area. Russia has recently begun inspecting all vessels sailing to or from Ukrainian ports in the Sea of Azov. This video can not be played Jonah Fisher talks to a commander of the Ukrainian Navy about the tensions in the Azov Sea This began after Ukraine detained a fishing vessel from Crimea in March. Moscow also says the checks are necessary for security reasons. Ukraine has accused Russia of trying to occupy the Sea of Azov and damage Ukraine's economy by hindering access its ports. Late on Sunday, crowds gathered outside the Russian embassy in Kiev, some throwing flares. At least one car belonging to the embassy was set alight. Far-right activists in Ukraine have been demanding martial law The Ukrainian defence ministry announced thatorders had been given to put the military on full combat alert,external. Martial law could give the government the power to restrict public demonstrations,external, regulate the media, suspend elections, and oblige citizens to carry out ""socially necessary"" tasks such as working at a defence facility, local media report. Ukraine's parliament is discussing how to proceed with the issue. A vote is expected later on Monday. If backed by MPs, martial law would enter into force at 07:00 GMT on 28 November. But some politicians are expressing concern it could still lead to the presidential elections being cancelled. Some say President Poroshenko could be a main beneficiary, as his ratings have plummeted. Ukraine gained independence after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. However, Russia considers a Western-leaning Ukraine a threat to its interests. In 2014, Ukraine's pro-Russian leader was overthrown, after large-scale protests against the government's decision to abandon plans to sign an association agreement with the EU. Russia then annexed Crimea, while Russia-backed separatists moved against the Ukrainian state in the east.

PM's message: 'This is all there is',"The talking in Brussels is done. After nearly two years of negotiations, arguments - and the inevitable moments where it felt like the process would explode - there is, now, a deal. It's a compromise. It was always going to be. It's not a happy compromise either. People on both sides of the Brexit argument are already screaming their protests. And although the prime minister must be relieved, she didn't exactly say that she was pleased about the deal when I asked her at a news conference this lunchtime. Instead, she said she was sure the country's best days are ahead. But however she really feels about it - and with this prime minister it is hard to tell - her strategy for the next couple of weeks is crystal clear. Her case? This is all there is. UK's Brexit deal agreed by EU leaders Brexit deal 'worse than no deal' - DUP Theresa May's 'letter to the nation' in full With the explicit backing of almost every European leader who has opened their mouth today, this is the ""only deal"", the ""best possible deal"", ""the max"". The message to MPs from Theresa May and her counterparts: don't kid yourselves if you think something else might magically appear if you vote it down. And the message to the public? Just let me get on with it, then we can all stop talking about Brexit - please. Again today she used the platform to ""talk directly to the British public"", to explain how her (now rather pink) red lines, on ""money, laws and borders"", have been followed. It's her Brexit with caveats, with a lot to be sorted out about the future, in the future.You can remind yourself what's actually in the deal here. And No 10 is all too aware that dozens and dozens of their own MPs hate it. Theresa May has reached her imperfect compromise at a moment when in Parliament both sides are hardening against the idea of compromising at all. What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? Brexit: All you need to know 'Wales less prosperous after Brexit deal' For two years Theresa May has survived by tacking one way, then another. But now the deal is on paper, in black and white, that approach can't go on. A senior government figure said privately that No 10 was past the point of trying to please everyone. And of course, everyone in government is all too aware that it is likely that the deal will be rejected by Parliament in any case. But the only potential route through for the prime minister is through the middle, to look like, as one senior Whitehall official describes it, ""the adult in a world of children"". However the prime minister looks, however she sounds in the next fortnight, the levels of unhappiness at home are so profound that her pleas may fall on deaf ears. If the deal falls, she - and her government - may fall with it. Scrape it through then she'll have pulled off a feat far harder than getting the actual deal done. PS: Here's a great explanation from my colleague Ben Wright about what might happen if the vote, which we expect on 12 December, doesn't pass the deal.

Sacked Welsh minister's inquest to startCarl Sargeant was found dead in his home four days after being sacked by First Minister Carwyn Jones.Wales politics,"Carl Sargeant had been a Welsh Government minister for almost a decade A sacked Welsh Government minister found dead at his home last year left a letter telling his family ""I have failed you"", an inquest has heard. Labour AM Carl Sargeant, 49, was found hanged four days after First Minister Carwyn Jones dismissed him as communities and children secretary. The father-of-two faced allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards women, a claim he denied. He wrote: ""You deserve none of this adverse publicity 'cause of my acts."" Mr Sargeant had been suspended from the Welsh Labour party prior to his death on 7 November 2017. Coroner John Gittins has previously said theprovisional cause of death was hangingin ""an apparent act of self harm"". Mr Sargeant's letter, read to the inquest at Ruthin, Denbighshire, on Monday, said: ""To Bernie, Lucy, Jack and family/friends. I have let you down badly. You deserve none of this adverse publicity 'cause of my acts. I have failed you. ""That aside, I love you more than you'll ever know and I'm sorry I have taken the easy way out, leaving you with my shit. Please forgive me. I love you, Carl/Dad."" Former minister Leighton Andrews arriving at the inquest The court later heard from former Welsh Government minister Leighton Andrews, who told the inquest Carwyn Jones's behaviour was irresponsible following Mr Sargeant's sacking. Mr Andrews said Mr Jones gave media interviews on the Monday following a cabinet reshuffle on Friday 3 November 2017, which had a ""significant impact"" on Mr Sargeant's state of mind. Mr Andrews said the first minister had been ""speculating"" during the interviews, although he did not elaborate further. The inquest also heard details of a text message sent from Mr Andrews to Mr Jones on the evening of the reshuffle. Under questioning by the first minister's counsel Cathy McGahey, Mr Andrews agreed he had written phrases quoted from the text including ""great to see new faces promotedâ¦it's a great reshuffle"" and that it must have been an ""immensely difficult conversation to have had with Carl"". Before hearing evidence from Mr Andrews, the coroner told him the inquest was not about blame or fault. He thanked him for his previously-submitted statement, but warned him there may be elements within it that fell outside this investigation. Jack Sargeant with his mother Bernadette arriving at the inquest At the start of the inquest, Mr Gittins said there was no room in his court room for speculation or accusation, adding: ""This will not be a trial by press, politics or personality."" He read a statement from PC Siwan Hughes, who was called to Mr Sargeant's home in Connah's Quay, Flintshire, after his body was found in a utility room by his wife Bernadette. The police officer was told by Mrs Sargeant she had found a note on the door of the utility room telling her not to go in and to call the police. The letter to his family was left next to his body. The court heard there were traces of anti-depressants in his blood, but not enough to be a contributory factor to his death. Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe worked alongside Mr Sargeant Speaking at the inquest, future generations commissioner Sophie Howe, who became special adviser to Mr Sargeant in 2013, said she noticed his health begin to deteriorate in the summer of 2017, several months before his death. She said he used to say ""I'm having a real black dog of a day"" and there were ""a number of pressures at work"". She added on the day of Mr Sargeant's sacking, he called her in the afternoon saying ""I'm out and it's really bad"". ""He said 'I don't know what's going on, I haven't been told what the allegations are'. I find that incredible, that he could be sacked without being told what the allegations were,"" she said. Ms Howe added the work environment was ""toxic"". She said she was in regular contact with Mr Sargeant over the weekend following his sacking. ""He was saying 'I'm in a dark place'. I was very concerned about him,"" she said. Ms Howe added Mr Sargeant was ""distraught"" about not knowing the detail of the allegations against him. She added his mood had improved by the end of the weekend but took a ""downward turn"" after he was door-stepped by a journalist on the Monday morning. On the day before his death, Ms Howe received a text message from David Taylor, a friend of Mr Sargeant, who had been asking how to programme a text message to be sent at a later time. Ms Howe told the coroner she then became concerned Mr Sargeant was planning to take his own life. She managed to contact him by phone, and ""he sounded completely spaced-out"". She repeatedly asked him why he wanted to know how to delay a text message being sent, to which he said, ""I just wanted to know"". She added she believes she was the last person to speak to Mr Sargeant. Mr Sargeant later sent a text message to a group which she was a member of, saying ""love you all"". Leighton Andrews gave evidence at Ruthin in front of family lawyer Leslie Thomas (left), Coroner John Gittins (centre) and Mr Sargeant's wife Bernadette (right) Giving evidence, Mr Sargeant's GP Dr David Morris said the late politician had been in good general health, apart from being ""a big fella"", but had presented with symptoms of depression in March 2012, the first of several episodes. The doctor said Mr Sargeant had described himself as ""low in mood"", suffering from disturbed sleep and ""weepiness"", and had also told him: ""It feels like what I think post-traumatic stress might be."" This was due to an illness of another family member. He was prescribed a course of fluoxetine medication after being diagnosed with ""moderately severe depression"". He had a short course of sleeping tablets in 2014 and in July 2016 was put back on fluoxetine, which notes show he feared to stop taking. Later that year he scored one on a scale used to determine whether he had considered self-harming, which was at the lower end. He was prescribed a different anti-depressant and by November was feeling better, with improved sleep. The drugs were repeated throughout much of 2017, with the last prescription in the October of that year. Cathy McGahey QC, representing the first minister, asked whether some people suffering depression were able to function in their working lives, to which Dr Morris said they were. Questioned by Leslie Thomas QC, for the Sargeant family, the doctor also agreed some people did not function well at work with depression. Mr Thomas pointed out Mr Sargeant was last seen by a medical practitioner almost a year before his death. He asked what would be the impact on people who used work as an outlet for their depression if that work was going badly and an individual no longer had that outlet. Dr Morris said: ""A negative one."" Sargeant family gets inquiry review The first minister is due to appear at the five-day inquest on Wednesday, while Mr Sargeant's cabinet colleagues, Lesley Griffiths and Ken Skates, will also give evidence. The inquest is set to hear from Mr Sargeant's son Jack, who succeeded him as the AM for Alyn and Deeside. Mr Sargeant's body was found in the utility room of his house in Connah's Quay Mr Sargeant was facing a partyinvestigation into claims about inappropriate personal conduct with womenand was suspended from the Welsh Labour Party prior to his death. His family said he was not told the details of what he was accused of and was unable to properly defend himself. An independent investigation into how Mr Jones handled Mr Sargeant's sacking will begin in the new year. Earlier this month, theHigh Court gave the family permission to challengethe format of a separate investigation into how his sacking was handled, with his wife saying she feared the probe would be a ""cover-up"". Carl Sargeant had been a Welsh Government minister for almost a decade Mr Sargeant had been a Welsh Government minister for eight years before his sacking in November last year. The former environmental auditor and industrial firefighter had been a Welsh Assembly member since 2003. Mr Sargeant was appointed Labour's chief whip and deputy minister for assembly business following the 2007 election. He was promoted to the cabinet in 2009 as minister for social justice and local government, then served as housing and natural resources minister before being appointed communities secretary in May 2016. Mr Sargeant helped drive legislation to tackle domestic violence and ledthe Welsh Government's response to the Grenfell Tower fire, promising Welsh high-rise blocks were as safe as they could be.

Hamilton ends season with Abu Dhabi winLewis Hamilton ends his fifth title-winning F1 season with victory at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.BBC SportComments,"Lewis Hamilton won the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix to end the season in which he clinched his fifth World Championship on a high. It was the 11th victory of the year for Hamilton, who dominated the race with a controlled drive. Hamilton performed 'doughnut' spins after crossing the line, before he and former title rival Sebastian Vettel flanked the retiring two-time world champion Fernando Alonso, and all three performed more doughnuts on the start-finish straight. Hamilton and Vettel then each shared an embrace with Alonso, demonstrating their respect for each other's abilities. The three drivers hold 11 of some of the most recent World Championships won in a golden era for driving talent in the sport. Vettel took second after Hamilton's team-mate Valtteri Bottas faded to fifth, which means the Finn ends the season without a victory. Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo took third and fourth. Abu Dhabi Grand Prix results Hamilton wins in Abu Dhabi - reaction Hamilton ends season in style - Abu Dhabi post-race podcast A sweet moment: Hamilton, Vettel and Alonso indulge in a triple doughnut Hamilton goes topless on the podium, and we thought Raikkonen refusing to remove his sunglasses was controversial... Renault's Nico Hulkenberg emerged unhurt from a frightening-looking accident in which he was pitched into a roll and landed upside down in a first-lap clash with Romain Grosjean's Haas. Hulkenberg sounded scared as he said to the team: ""I'm hanging here like a cow. Get me out. There's fire."" But once the fire was extinguished and the car righted, he was able to climb out unaided. Hulkenberg appeared trapped in his car as it caught fire Hamilton's evening under the lights of the attractive but characterless Yas Marina circuit was complicated when Mercedes pitted him earlier than expected during a caution period caused when Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari stopped on the pit straight. That was on lap seven of 55 - nine laps earlier than Bottas' first stop - but Mercedes were covering one of their rivals potentially doing the same thing. It meant a race of careful driving and tyre management, but Hamilton handled it well, to re-claim the positions he had lost one by one as his rivals pitted. This video can not be played Was Fernando Alonso a pantomime villain? Behind him, the race came to a tense climax as the differing strategies of Vettel and the two Red Bull drivers converged. Max Verstappen was closing on Vettel as the second Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo closed on the Dutchman. But both Red Bull drivers lost time when they came upon the lapped car of Pierre Gasly as it was suffering an imminent engine failure with smoke pouring out of it. That gave Vettel breathing space and locked the Red Bulls in their positions. It was a disappointing end to a bold attempt by Ricciardo and Red Bull to benefit from a different strategy by running very long to their first pit stops, but in the end it made little difference. Will Smith was guest of honour of Lewis Hamilton as part of his 50th birthday bucket list - and filmed it all for social media Fernando Alonso's illustrious career ended with an 11th place, just out of the points. The McLaren, which started 15th, was just not quick enough for him to do any more. There was time for one more bit of radio magic, though, when his engineer in the closing laps said: ""Go and get a point."" Alonso, 37, replied: ""I've already got 1,800."" Actually, he has 1,899 so it would have made a round 1,900, but he could not catch Kevin Magnussen's Haas - not helped by a five-second time penalty for cutting a chicane when he missed his braking point pushing while chasing the Dane. Max Verstappen did a great job in keeping his hyper-soft tyres alive for a longer first stint than either Mercedes on the ultra-softs, pressured Bottas and took a third place that lifted him to fourth in the championship. Lots of hard work designing and building new cars, pre-season testing and then a new season starts in Melbourne, Australia in March next year. It'll be there before you know it.

Patients given unsafe medical implants,"Maureen McCleave was fitted with a new type of pacemaker Medical devices that are unsafe and have not been adequately tested are ending up inside patients' bodies, an investigation has revealed. The devices include heart pacemakers, rods to correct spines, and artificial knees and hips. The investigation found implants that had failed in baboons, or were tested only on pigs and dead bodies, were coming onto the market. The industry says it has transformed millions of lives for the better. BBC Panorama has been working with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,externaland 58 media organisations around the world includingThe Guardian,externalnewspaper and theBritish Medical Journal,external. The therapy tested on pigs and corpses The investigation found a lax system of regulation in Europe that allows companies to ""shop around"" dozens of safety organisations until one of them approves their product. It also found that doctors can be left in the dark about the true risk of treatments they are recommending to their patients. Maureen McCleave, 82 from Essex, was the first person in the UK to be fitted with the ""Nanostim"" pacemaker because of an irregular heartbeat. Pacemakers are life-saving implants that deliver electrical pulses to the heart to keep them beating regularly. Traditional ones have leads from a battery to the heart that deliver the electrical pulse, but the cables can break. The Nanostim was the first leadless pacemaker that sat inside the heart. Maureen said she was ""over the moon"" to be the first and felt like a ""good guinea pig"" when she was implanted with the device at Bart's hospital in London. ""I was so grateful that I'd been chosen, because it sounded too good to be true."" But three years after it was fitted, the battery in Maureen's Nanostim failed and surgeons could not get it out. She now has a traditional pacemaker keeping her alive. The Nanostim is still sitting inside her heart. She says: ""I don't like the thought I've got a piece of metal or whatever in my heart that's doing nothing and it's just laying there."" Maureen was not alone - a number of batteries failed and parts fell off inside patients. The pacemaker was withdrawn for safety reasons. At least two people died and ninety events were recorded in which patients were seriously harmed by the device. The Nanostim heart pacemaker was turned down by safety bodies in Germany because of a lack of evidence. Yet it was approved by the British Standards Institute in the UK. Not all medical devices are dangerous. Many save lives or dramatically improve quality of life. But the investigation has found that some devices are failing patients including: implants that cracked inside people's backs and had failed in baboon tests birth control implants that caused internal damage and bleeding misfiring implantable defibrillators mesh implants for incontinence that caused abdominal pain The BBC also uncovered a treatment for children with a severely curved spine, or scoliosis, which was allowed on to the market following tests only on pigs and dead bodies. Yet, due to a lack of transparency and data collection, the scale of any problem across the medical device industry remains a mystery to both patients and doctors. If you are worried, a panel of experts put together by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists has put together some advice. It recommends: ""Your first point of call should be the medical team that performed the operation. ""If you cannot go back to them for whatever reason, you should consult your primary care doctor. ""The doctor should be able to refer you to a specialist who is familiar with the device and the surgery you had."" International Consortium of Investigative Journalists: The Implant Files,external Patients in the UK can alsoreport problems to the regulator,external. Europe does not have a governmental body that checks medical devices before they are put onto the market. Instead a series of companies called notified bodies issue CE marks - the same mark of approval given to devices like toasters and kettles. There are 58 of them in Europe and approval by one means a product can be used anywhere in the European Economic Area (the EU plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway). But if one body says no, a company can shop around and ask another. Less than patients might think. And there is so much secrecy that even surgeons implanting these devices do not always see the evidence upon which a device has been approved for its safety and effectiveness. The British Standards Institution said it could not discuss the evidence for Nanostim due to ""confidentiality requirements"". Even the UK's regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, says it is ""bound by confidentiality when it comes to some of the actions that we've taken around individual devices"". But the investigation discovered there was only one clinical study before Nanostim was approved for use on the public. It followed just 33 patients for 90 days. Prof Rita Redberg Prof Rita Redberg, one of the world's leading cardiologists and from the University of California, San Francisco, said: ""We're talking about a permanently implanted pacemaker, so I think that's a very tiny study. ""They're supposed to last 10, 20 years. A 90-day follow up is not enough to learn much about the pacemaker."" MedTech Europe, the body the represents the medical devices industry, said: ""Millions of people have safely benefited from medical devices and can now live healthier, more productive and more independent lives. ""Life is unimaginable today without the hundreds of thousands of medical devices in our hospitals and in our homes."" And it defended the system of notified bodies which were ""selected for the expertise, impartiality, transparency and independence of their staff"". Abbott, which manufactured Nanostim, says that many patients have been helped by leadless pacemakers and many more will benefit from this technology in the future. It said: ""In accordance with the European CE Mark approval process, the Nanostim leadless pacing system was approved based on strong performance and safety data. ""In addition, upon CE Mark approval Nanostim was further assessed through a European post market clinical follow-up study."" The UK's Royal College of Surgeons has called for ""drastic regulatory changes"". Prof Derek Alderson, president of the Royal College of Surgeons, said: ""All implantable devices should be registered and tracked to monitor efficacy and patient safety in the long-term."" But when the European Union suggested tightening the rules, the industry ran a campaign called ""Don't lose the 3"". It referred to the fact that manufacturers can get new products to patients three years quicker in Europe then they can in the United States. New medical device regulation will come into forcein Europe in 2020,external, but campaigners say the new rules do not go far enough. German MEP Dagmar Roth Behrendt told Panorama that an intensive lobbying campaign by the industry undermined the proposed reforms. ""It's a success for them and a failure for the European parliament and for European patients, I have no doubt about it. ""It is like an open wound for me, that we could not do more for European patients and for the safety of European patients hurts.""
