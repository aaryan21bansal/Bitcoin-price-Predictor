Anti-Semitic graffiti daubed on shops and cafes,"A council worker removed the graffiti which someone had covered with a note wishing all people ""Peace and Good Will"" Anti-Semitic graffiti has been daubed on a synagogue and several shops in north London during the Jewish festival of Hanukkah. The Star of David, a Jewish symbol, and ""911"" were spray-painted in Hampstead and Belsize Park, possibly referencing a conspiracy theory. South Hampstead Synagogue was among the premises targeted, with reports made to police from 23:30 GMT on Saturday. Police are treating it as a racially motivated hate crime. The graffiti could reference an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews are responsible for the 9/11 terror attack. It could also reference Kristallnacht, an organised nationwide attack on Jews which began in Germany on 9 November 1938. The vandalism was carried out six days after the start of Hanukkah - one of the biggest festivals of the year for Jewish people. No arrests have been made. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said on Twitter: ""This makes me sick to my stomach"" adding that ""anti-Semitism like this"" had ""no place anywhere and certainly not in London"". He also said that residents could expect more police patrols in the area. A South Hampstead Synagogue spokesman said: ""This is a time for people of all backgrounds - of all faiths and of none - to stand united and show our determination that we do not tolerate prejudice, hate and division - on our streets or online.""

MP for Hampstead and Kilburn Tulip Siddiq, MP for Holborn and St Pancras Keir Starmer and Camden Council leader Georgia Gould released a joint statement, which read: ""Camden is and always will be no place for hate. ""We stand together with all of our Jewish residents and our whole community in saying these cowardly pedlars of hate do not represent Camden and our values. ""We are proud to have a strong, vibrant Jewish community as part of our beautiful borough. ""This is not an isolated incident and we must all confront the rising tide of hate crime and anti-Semitism in the UK. ""Now is the moment to find the courage to confront hatred and prejudice wherever we see it."" Camden street cleaning teams are removing the graffiti ""as quickly and sensitively as possible,"" they added. Conservative councillor for Hampstead Oliver Cooper said he spent Sunday morning patrolling the neighbourhood after ""appalled"" residents alerted the Community Security Trust charity, which works to protect the Jewish community. The graffiti could reference an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that Jews are responsible for the 9/11 terror attack Mr Cooper said: ""My first reaction was shock and horror. ""I've had to report anti-Semitic graffiti in Hampstead a number of times before, including by a banned neo-Nazi group, but I have never seen anything approaching this extent."" Mr Cooper said he came across the graffiti in nine places, and others also posted photographs of the markings on Twitter. Ms Siddiq described the vandalism as ""unbelievable, senseless, disgusting anti-Semitism at the heart of our community"". Insp Kev Hailes, of the Met, said: ""This is clearly a concerning incident and one we are taking seriously. ""We have liaised with our partners in order to remove the graffiti and various inquiries are under way to find who is responsible. ""Officers will be on patrol throughout the area in order to provide some reassurance to local communities."" The graffiti was seen being removed from shop windows on Sunday afternoon.

Putin thanks Trump for foiling new year attacks,"President Putin and President Trump, pictured at the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany in 2017 Russia's President Vladimir Putin has thanked US counterpart Donald Trump for intelligence that helped foil ""acts of terrorism"" on Russian soil, according to a Kremlin statement. Mr Putin and Mr Trump spoke on the phone on Sunday, it said. The Kremlin said the information came via intelligence services, but it provided no further details. Russian media is reporting the discovery of a plot to attack St Petersburg over the new year period. Tass news agency says two Russian nationals have been arrested and plans to attack a mass gathering were seized, according to a spokesperson from the FSB, the Russian intelligence agency. Mr Putin and Mr Trump have spoken on the phone and in person various times since the latter took office. How world leaders call each other Records from the conversations show they have often talked about Syria, as well as nuclear agreements, North Korea and trade. In December 2017, Mr Putin thanked Mr Trump for another warning from US intelligence agencies, which again apparently prevented a terrorist plot in St Petersburg, according to a White House account. During that call, the Kremlin said Mr Putin had promised to reciprocate with information about terrorist threats to the United States. Relations between Washington and Moscow plummeted after Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from neighbouring Ukraine in 2014. Ties were further strained whenUS intelligence agencies concluded that the Kremlin had interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Despite this, President Trump and President Putin have appeared to be on good terms personally - and they have vowed to co-operate on terrorism. Mr Trump has indicated he is considering attending the Victory Day celebrations in Moscow next May, after an invitation from the Russian leader. The Trump-Russia saga in 350 words Both countries have felt the threat of the Islamic State group. In 2015, the group admitted downing a Russian passenger plane shortly after its take-off in Egypt - an attack that killed 224 people. It is unknown whether those recently arrested in Russia have any links to a wider group.

And I hope I’ve not wasted any of it. I try to get the good of every bit of it because I know they would have done if they’d had the chance.” - Judith Kerr, speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Desert Island Discs in 2004   “If you’re going to write a good erotic scene, you have to go into details.

He went on to photograph The Rolling Stones, David Bowie, Elton John and the Queen - and, in the months before his death, received a CBE for services to photography.  “All I can do is turn a phrase until it catches the light. There was a time when I got hot under the collar if the critics said I had nothing new to say. Now I realise that they had a point. My field is the self-evident. Everything I say is obvious, although I like to think that some of the obvious things I have said were not so obvious until I said them.” - Clive James, May Week Was in June, 1990    Once described as the “godfather of the modern soap”, Reg Watson - pictured above left with actress Noele Gordon and media impresario Lew Grade - created the UK series Crossroads, which was set in a Midlands motel.

He probably wouldn’t mind…” - Comedian and writer Stephen Fry on Twitter (André Previn pictured with Eric Morecambe and Ernie Wise in 1971) “I don’t remember a moment in my life when I wasn’t trying to sing.” - Jessye Norman speaking to NPR in 2014      The New Orleans-born, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame singer - real name Malcolm John Rebennack Jr - combined the genres of blues, pop, jazz, boogie woogie and rock and roll. After his death, the former Beatles drummer Ringo Starr wrote on Twitter: “God bless Dr John, peace and love to all his family. I love the doctor, peace and love.” As vocalist with The Beat, Ranking Roger spearheaded the two-tone movement with a distinctive vocal style influenced by the Jamaican rap technique of toasting. The group enjoyed several top 10 hits, most famously Mirror in the Bathroom - the first digitally recorded single released in the UK. Their 1980 cover of Andy Williams’ Can’t Get Used To Losing You was used as the main sample on Beyonce’s 2016 hit Hold Up. He co-wrote such hits as Destiny’s Child’s Grammy-winning Say My Name and Lady Gaga’s Telephone. Daniels, who was known as Big Shiz, also worked with artists including Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Brandy and Toni Braxton. The Grammy-winner and Oscar-nominee had two US number ones, with the smooth soul ballads Baby Come To Me and I Don’t Have The Heart. He also co-wrote Michael Jackson’s PYT with Quincy Jones. His debut album Victory Lap received a nomination for best rap album at this year’s Grammy Awards. Fellow musician Drake, who won a Grammy on the same night, took to Instagram to pay tribute to the 33-year-old: “My whole energy is just at a low right now hearing this… You were having the best run and I was so happy watching from distance fam nobody ever talks down on your name you were a real one to your people and to the rest of us.”     The musician, real name Jarad Anthony Higgins, rose to fame in 2018 with hit singles All Girls Are the Same and Lucid Dreams. More plaudits followed the release of his first studio album, Goodbye & Good Riddance - and his second album Death Race for Love topped the Billboard chart this year.  The US band - formed in Boston in the mid-1970s by Ocasek and Benjamin Orr - helped kick-start the new wave movement. Merging guitar rock with synthesizer-based pop, their early hits included Just What I Needed, My Best Friend’s Girl and Good Times Roll. Their 1984 ballad Drive was used as background music for footage of the Ethiopian famine, and its re-release as a single after Live Aid helped raise money for the cause. Born Edward Joseph Mahoney in New York, Money had major US chart success in the 70s and 80s with songs such as Two Tickets to Paradise and Take Me Home Tonight. He released 11 albums and sold nearly 30 million records in a career that spanned four decades. He was one of the most innovative and influential drummers in rock music. A co-founder of Cream, Ginger Baker also played with Blind Faith, Hawkwind and Fela Kuti in a long and varied career. His style combined the lyricism of jazz with the crude power of rock. One critic said watching him was like witnessing “a human combine harvester”. Over the course of his career he played on countless hits by Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, The Beach Boys and John Lennon, amongst others. According to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which inducted him in 2000, Blaine “certainly played on more hit records than any drummer in the rock era, including 40 number one singles and 150 that made the [US] top 10”. His most recognisable riff is the “boom-ba-boom-crack” bar that opens The Ronettes’ Be My Baby. Duncan attended Dundee Art College with fellow band members Roger Ball and Alan Gorrie. He played sax on the group’s US chart-topper Pick Up The Pieces. The soul and funk band, formed in 1972, gained worldwide success including a number one album in the US. The singer and pianist achieved fame as half of musical duo Captain & Tennille. Dragon and his ex-wife Toni Tennille (pictured) were best known for Love Will Keep Us Together, which topped the US charts in 1975. Tennille described him as “a brilliant musician with many friends who loved him greatly. I was at my most creative in my life, when I was with him.”   Roxette achieved global success in the late 1980s and 1990s with hits such as Joyride, Dressed for Success and The Look. Fredriksson and bandmate Per Gessle (both pictured) achieved their biggest success when It Must Have Been Love was re-written for inclusion on the Pretty Woman film soundtrack in 1990. The song topped the charts in more than 10 countries and gave Roxette their biggest UK hit, reaching number three.    Roland Charles “Boon” Gould (pictured left) was one of the founding members of the 1980s pop group, playing guitar and saxophone between 1980 and 1987 - and reuniting for a one-off performance in 2012. Level 42 formed on the Isle of Wight and had a string of hits including Lessons in Love and Running in the Family. The Brazilian musician’s versions of songs like Quiet Nights and The Girl from Ipanema became standards in world music. He created a new beat, with his unique guitar style, mixing traditional samba music with modern jazz influences. In 1964, he famously collaborated with America saxophone player Stan Getz. Their album - Getz/Gilberto - sold millions of copies and won international praise, including a US Grammy for Album of the Year. The 1980s band achieved mainstream success with such hits as It’s My Life and Such a Shame, but became increasingly insular and experimental over time. After releasing a solo album in 1998, Hollis removed himself from public view. Spandau Ballet’s Gary Kemp said: “His influence upon music was immense and far-reaching. A great presence in the modern era who took his bow far too early but has left us so much still to be moved by.” Recognisable by his fluorescent spiked hair and known for high-octane performances, Flint sang lead vocals on both the band’s number one singles - Breathe and Firestarter. In 1996, Flint told the BBC the Firestarter lyrics, “I’m the firestarter/Twisted firestarter”, were not about starting fires. “It was when you’re in front of 5,000 people and you can go out there - and just with the aid of the music and a visual performance, you can stir all them people up into a frenzy and that’s almost like starting a massive fire, or a riot,” he said. The band were best known for their top 10 hit in 1977, Do Anything You Wanna Do. Formed in Canvey Island, Essex in 1975, they were part of the pub rock scene which included Dr Feelgood and Ian Dury’s band Kilburn and the High Roads. In 1976 they made headlines when they played at London’s Marquee Club while supported by The Sex Pistols, who went on to smash the Hot Rods’ gear following a chaotic set. The British conductor, organist and composer presided over the world-famous Festival of Nine Lessons which is broadcast live on BBC radio on Christmas Eve. He was director of music at King’s for nearly four decades. The actress-singer, whose real name was Choi Jin-ri, was a member of girl band f(x) until she left in 2015 to focus on her acting career. She had more than five million followers on Instagram. She came to be known for speaking out on mental health issues, cyber-bullying and women’s rights - issues that remain sensitive in conservative South Korean society. Tork was one of the four Monkees (pictured second from right) - a made-for-TV 1960s pop group and marketed as the American answer to The Beatles. He played keyboard and bass for the group, which had a string of hits including I’m A Believer, Daydream Believer and Last Train to Clarksville.  The writer, comedian and musician was dubbed “The Seventh Python”. Python founding member Sir Michael Palin described him as “the most lovely friend”, while John Cleese called him “a very sweet man, much too nice for his own good”. Innes also performed in The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band - later renamed The Bonzo Dog Band - who had a hit in 1968 with I'm the Urban Spaceman. After his work with Monty Python, Innes joined fellow Python Eric Idle on a new series, Rutland Weekend Television, which gave birth to their spoof band The Rutles - a pastiche of The Beatles.   His song Misirlou played over the opening credits to Quentin Tarantino’s film Pulp Fiction. Dale was known for his blindingly-fast strumming style, which inspired acts like The Beach Boys and Jimi Hendrix. He said the sound reminded him of the rumble and crash of the waves, and the noises of marine animals, as he surfed in California. Reed (pictured right) co-wrote Tom Jones hits Delilah and It’s Not Unusual, as well as The Last Waltz by Engelbert Humperdinck (pictured left). He also served as a pianist in The John Barry Seven and conducted his own orchestra for more than 10 years. He wrote more than 200 film and TV scores, as well as songs. In 1968, he won his first Oscar for the song The Windmills of Your Mind from The Thomas Crown Affair. Two more best original score Oscars followed in 1971, for the movie Summer of ’42 and in 1983 for Yentl. Gott was a Czech singer who sold millions of records. He released almost 300 albums, starting in the mid-1960s, selling tens of millions of copies around the world. He was popular behind the Iron Curtain and became known as the “golden voice of Prague”, but he also found fame in Western Europe, especially in Germany.     “He took music to a place that it hasn’t actually ever been since.” - Musician and producer Brian Eno    Born in Cuba, Alonso is considered one of the greatest ballerinas of the 20th Century. She began to lose her sight at 19, relying on only the stage lights to guide her. After the 1959 revolution, she helped found the National Ballet of Cuba with then leader Fidel Castro. Miller studied medicine at Cambridge before embarking on a career in the arts. The catalyst was the groundbreaking satirical revue Beyond the Fringe, in which he appeared with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett. It premiered at the 1960 Edinburgh Festival before transferring to the West End and Broadway. He went on to direct numerous television plays, as well as productions at the National Theatre, London’s Old Vic and at Glyndebourne for the ENO. Who’s Who listed his only recreation as “deep sleep”. Pennebaker captured pivotal moments in the history of rock music and politics. He is best known for the Bob Dylan documentary Don’t Look Back - and the 1973 film that captured David Bowie’s final performance as Ziggy Stardust. The War Room, his fly-on-the-wall look at Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, earned an Oscar nomination. The Belgian-born film-maker was one of the key figures in the French New Wave in the 1960s, making films like The Creatures, Le Bonheur and Cleo from 5 to 7 - about a model’s anguished two-hour wait for the results of her cancer test. She was the first female director to be awarded an honorary Oscar in 2017, and became the oldest ever nominee for a competitive Oscar in 2018 with the documentary Faces Places. His bold ideas and enduring energy made the Italian one of the 20th Century’s most creative and prolific directors. The Florence native directed stars including Elizabeth Taylor in the 1967 film Taming of the Shrew and Dame Judi Dench on stage in Romeo and Juliet. The two-time Oscar nominee also served in the Italian senate for two terms as a member of Silvio Berlusconi’s Forza Italia party. Singleton was considered a trailblazer for African-American directors in the 1990s. He was Oscar-nominated for Boyz N The Hood, a film partly inspired by his childhood. It explored themes of youth and friendship with the backdrop of inner-city violence in Los Angeles. The film was met with high praise on its Cannes debut and went on to become a box-office success. As a larger-than-life studio executive at Paramount, he was also key to the making of Rosemary’s Baby, Love Story and the first two films in the Godfather series. The former actor, who was married seven times, authored an autobiography - The Kid Stays in the Picture - that itself inspired a film. Williams was born in Toronto but moved to the UK in the 1950s. He won two Oscars and a Bafta for his work as animation director on the 1988 live-action animated comedy, which starred Bob Hoskins. Prince won 21 Tony Awards for his work as a director and producer. His solo credits as a producer include Fiddler on the Roof, which had a record-breaking run of more than 3,000 performances between 1964 and 1972. Writing on Twitter, Andrew Lloyd Webber said Prince was “not just the prince of musicals”, but “the crowned head who directed two of the greatest productions of my career, Evita and Phantom”. He was best known for the 1952 Hollywood musical, which he co-directed with its star Gene Kelly. Singin’ in the Rain was named the greatest movie musical of all time by the American Film Institute in 2006. The director’s other films included On the Town, Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and Funny Face.     “We French have lost a statesman whom we loved as much as he loved us. Whether we share, or not, his ideas or what he fought for, we all recognise ourselves in this man who resembled us, and brought us together.” - French President Emmanuel Macron     “If you were my enemy, you are now my friend. If you hated me, you cannot avoid the love that binds me to you and you to me.” - Robert Mugabe speaking during a national address, 1980     Morsi’s time as president lasted only one year. He was ousted by the military on 3 July 2013. A top figure in the Islamist movement Muslim Brotherhood, Morsi had been in custody since his removal. He was on trial on charges of espionage when he died. The Texan ran twice for US president in the 1990s - against candidates from the two main parties. In the 1992 election campaign, he advocated balanced budgets and called for an end to the outsourcing of jobs abroad. Perot took almost a fifth of the popular vote in the three-way race - which is believed to have helped Democrat Bill Clinton defeat incumbent Republican George HW Bush. Renowned for his love of beer and cricket, Hawke dominated Australian politics in the 1980s. The charismatic politician with a maverick approach was the centre-left Labor Party’s longest-serving PM - from 1983 to 1991. He is credited with modernising the country’s economy. Once dubbed the Duchess of Downing Street, Marcia Williams was Wilson’s private and political secretary from 1956 to 1983, which included his leadership of the Labour Party and his time in office. She was believed by many to wield more influence than MPs and even cabinet ministers - something she always denied. Walden served as Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood from 1964 until 1977. He went on to present the ITV political programme Weekend World. On television he was known for his tough political interviews, including one encounter with Margaret Thatcher in 1989 which helped speed up the then-prime minister’s downfall. The Belfast-born former chairman of the Conservative Party joined the House of Lords in 2005. During his Commons career Brian Mawhinney served as transport secretary under John Major. For seven years from 2003, he was also the chairman of the Football League. In 1993, Michael Spicer founded the ERG, a Eurosceptic group of Conservative MPs, which has in recent years played a prominent role in promoting Brexit. Speaking in the House of Lords in June 2018, he described himself as “a pain in the neck to those who want to stay in Europe”. He added: “The essence of why I oppose staying in the European Union is that it seems to me that the nation state is the best unit for democracy.” A popular figure in the party, Dobson served as health secretary under Tony Blair - even though he was a left-pragmatist rather than a starry-eyed Blairite. He left government to contest the first-ever London mayoral election in 2000, coming third to ex-colleague Ken Livingstone. A campaigning miner’s daughter from Dewsbury, Betty Lockwood became chief women’s officer in the Labour Party from 1967 to 1975. She was then appointed as the first head of the Equal Opportunities Commission - which was set up to tackle sex discrimination and promote gender equality.   “Gordon was a fantastic goalkeeper, without doubt one of the best England has ever had. I was proud to call him a team-mate. Obviously we shared that great day in 1966 but it was more than that.” - Sir Bobby Charlton, part of the 1966 World Cup team         Described as “10 years ahead of his time” by his manager Sir Alf Ramsey, Peters scored England’s second goal in their World Cup final win over West Germany in July 1966. Asked about the goal, the West Ham legend once said: “The emotion was like being struck by lightning, it was unbelievable.”    The former Liverpool captain helped the club to domestic and European success in the 1960s and 1970s. Known for his tough tackling, and nicknamed the “Anfield Iron”, Smith had an 18-year career at Anfield, during which he won four league titles. McNeill led Celtic’s “Lisbon Lions” when they beat Inter Milan 2-1 in the 1967 European Cup Final. He captained the club to nine successive titles, seven Scottish Cups and six League Cups. He was capped 29 times for Scotland. In two spells as Celtic manager, he won four titles and four cups. He also managed Clyde, Aberdeen, Manchester City and Aston Villa. Chalmers scored the winning goal in the 1967 European Cup Final - when Celtic’s “Lisbon Lions” defeated Inter Milan 2-1 and became the first British club to lift the European Cup. The Scotland forward spent 12 seasons at Celtic, scoring 236 goals, and also played for Morton and Partick Thistle. Full-back Caldow (pictured left) made 407 appearances during a 13-year career at Ibrox, winning five league titles, two Scottish Cups and three Scottish League Cups. Comfortable on either flank, Caldow won 40 Scotland caps and captained the national team on 14 occasions. Hole won 30 caps for Wales between 1963 and 1970. The Swansea-born midfielder made more than 200 appearances for Cardiff City and won promotion to the first division in 1960. After spells with Blackburn Rovers and Aston Villa, he returned to Wales to spend two seasons playing for Swansea City. Argentine-born Sala died in a light aircraft crash in the English Channel. Sala had just signed for Cardiff from French club Nantes for a club record fee of £15m. The aircraft’s pilot David Ibbotson also died. Ricksen was a fans’ favourite during his six-year spell at Rangers. He helped the club win the domestic cup double in 2002, the treble in 2003 and was captain for a trophy double in 2005. He had been battling motor neurone disease since 2013 - and his charity raised more than £1m for scientists seeking a cure for the debilitating condition, which attacks nerves in the brain and spinal cord. The Spaniard joined the Gunners from Sevilla in January 2004. He was part of the ‘Invincibles’ side that went through the 2003-04 season unbeaten, winning the Premier League. Harrison was described by former manager Sir Alex Ferguson as “one of the greatest coaches of our time” with an ability to “make good human beings” out of young players. He is credited with developing Manchester United’s FA Youth Cup-winning “Class of ’92” squad, which contained what is regarded as one of the best crop of young players in the English game. He is pictured above (left) with Ryan Giggs, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Gary Neville, Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and Terry Cooke. In tribute to Harrison, Beckham said: “I can still hear him telling me ‘no more Hollywood passes.’” The fast bowler took 325 wickets in 90 Tests from 1971 to 1984, claiming a career-best 8-43 to help England to a famous win over Australia at Headingley in the 1981 Ashes. He captained England in 18 Tests and 29 one-day internationals before his retirement from all forms of cricket in 1984. Willis subsequently worked as a summariser on BBC TV before joining Sky Sports as a commentator in 1991. The England and Wales Cricket Board said the sport had “lost a dear friend”. Qadir (pictured centre) took 236 wickets in 67 Tests between 1977 and 1990. He captured a further 132 in 104 one-day international appearances. In the 1980s era before Shane Warne, when leg-spin bowling was cricket’s most mystical art, he was its finest exponent on the world stage. His best performance came when he took 9-56 in an innings against England in his home city of Lahore in 1987.  He was the loud, garish and eccentric face of Channel 4’s horse racing coverage for nearly three decades. Known for his energetic dispatches beside the racecourse, clad in tweed and gold jewellery and clutching giant Havana cigars, “Big Mac” was the punter’s friend.   Flamboyant Barnes was best known for beating Jack Nicklaus twice in a day during the 1975 match against the United States. Barnes played for Great Britain & Ireland and then Europe in six Ryder Cups between 1969 and 1979 and won 20 professional titles. Brand won eight times on the European Tour from 1982-93 and was a regular on the senior circuit. He played in two Ryder Cups, making his debut in 1987 when Europe won in America for the first time, before helping to retain the trophy two years later at The Belfry.   Vervoort won gold and silver in the T52 100m and T52 200m wheelchair races at the London 2012 Paralympics. At the Rio Paralympics she claimed silver in the T51/52 400m and bronze in T51/52 100m. She had an incurable degenerative muscle disease and chose to end her own life through euthanasia at the age of 40. Williams played 27 Tests for the Springboks between 1993 and 2000, scoring 14 tries. Although the 1995 Rugby World Cup was held after the end of apartheid, the former wing was the only black player in the South African team that beat New Zealand 15-12 in the final. Matti Nykänen is regarded as one of the best-ever ski jumpers after a glittering 10-year career, which included 46 individual World Cup titles. He won a gold medal at the Winter Olympics in Sarajevo in 1984 - and then three more at the Calgary Games in 1988, as Eddie ‘the Eagle’ Edwards was winning the hearts of the British public by finishing last.   “During that accident he died twice and was resuscitated... He came to Monza [for the Italian Grand Prix], which I was doing commentary for. He shouldn’t have been there but he wanted to get back to racing… He was suffering so much pain. When he came out from driving at the end I was there and the blood was running down out of his helmet.” - Three-time world champion Sir Jackie Stewart recalling Lauda’s determination after his near-fatal crash in the 1976 German Grand Prix      All images subject to copyright.

Scots author Alasdair Gray dies aged 85,"The Glasgow author said he wanted to leave his body to science Renowned Scottish author and artist Alasdair Gray has died, his publisher has confirmed. The 85-year-old was known for novels such as Lanark (1981) and the award-winning Poor Things (1992), which are both set in Glasgow where he was born. His public murals are visible across the city, with further pieces on display in the V&A and the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art. He died on Sunday at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. His family said he wanted to leave his body to science so there would be no funeral. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Fellow author and friend Ian Rankin told BBC Scotland that Mr Gray was responsible for making everyday Scottish life interesting on an international level. He said: ""He could take something very personal to him - his background growing up in Glasgow for example - and make it that people around the world wanted to read it. ""He was part of that thing about taking Scotland out of the kailyard, writing sort of misty stories of Highland villages. ""Suddenly you were writing about things that meant stuff, writing politically, writing about your own experiences. ""His books were beautiful, they were crafted, they were elegant. He had a sense of fun, he was mischievous, he had this huge intellect but he was a 'lad of pairts' - he could do a little bit of everything and he did it all well."" Alasdair Gray has been described as ""one of Scotland's literary giants"" Nick Barley, director of the Edinburgh International Book Festival said: ""Scotland has been blessed with a host of great writers over the past 50 years, but if history remembers only one, it will likely be Alasdair Gray. ""He was a bright star in a luminous constellation of northern lights; a game-changer whose boundlessly innovative, cross-disciplinary thinking paved the way for so many others to succeed. ""We can thank Alasdair, not only for his own great work, but for his role in creating the conditions for a literary renaissance that has, in so many different ways, changed most people's understanding about what it means to be Scottish today."" Francis Bickmore, Mr Gray's editor and publishing director at Canongate, said: ""What sad news this is that Alasdair Gray is gone. It seems hard to believe that Alasdair was mortal and might ever leave us. ""No one single figure has left such a varied legacy - or missed so many deadlines - as Alasdair Gray. ""At least through Gray's phenomenal body of work he leaves a legacy that will outlive us all. His voice of solidarity and compassion for his fellow citizens, and his forward-looking vision is cause for great celebration and remembrance."" Unseen Alasdair Gray mural unveiled Writer seriously injured in fall His agent Jenny Brown said: ""We mourn Alasdair Gray's passing, but his genius will live on for readers through his remarkable work. ""He was a cultural trailblazer: nobody has done more to spur on, and give confidence to, the next generation of Scottish writers."" One of the artist's most famous murals spans the ceiling of the Oran Mor pub and restaurant in the west end of Glasgow. A writer in residence at the University of Glasgow in the 1970s, Mr Gray was described as a ""strong and close friend"" of the institution. University principal professor Sir Anton Muscatelli said: ""Alasdair Gray was one of the true greats of Scottish art and literature. ""It is with great sadness that we mark his passing, but the many works he produced, from his magnificent novel Lanark to the inspiring murals that adorn the city ensure that his legacy will live on for many years to come."" Mr Gray was a supporter of Scottish independence, writing Independence: How We Should Rule Ourselves, which was published in June 2014 as Scotland geared up for the independence referendum. In June 2015 he was badly injured in a fall at his home, which affected his mobility, though he later returned to work. Last month the author was given a lifetime achievement award by the Saltire Society for his contribution to Scottish literature. I've been lucky enough to know Alasdair Gray since I was a student at Glasgow University in the 1980s. My Honours dissertation was on his work, including the then recently published Lanark, which had cast a spotlight on someone who, despite being a polymath, from the humblest of backgrounds was never comfortable talking about himself. Do you see yourself as a Scottish writer or a London writer?, asked a reporter from the London-based arts programme Monitor in 1983. Was Dickens asked to describe himself as an English writer or a London writer? That question, sir, was unworthy of you, replies Alasdair Gray, with a grin. But he goes on to answer it. ""I would claim to be everything I might be suspected of. Glaswegian, Scottish, British, I'm everything."" The same was true of those who tried to pin him down as an artist or as a writer, one simply merged into the other. Sometimes it was his art which sustained him, as city recorder for Elspeth King at the People's Palace, making a series of paintings, documenting the changing city around him. Many will still know him as the creator of the visual tales around their city, the murals of Oran Mor and Hillhead Underground Station among others. Alasdair Gray's murals are at a number of Glasgow locations It's hard to describe what a groundbreaking novel Lanark was. And the city he described in Lanark - both real and fantastical - inspired many other writers, artists and readers to find their own voices. At 80, he found himself, to his bemusement at the centre of a photocall for a retrospective at several galleries across Glasgow, including Kelvingrove, where he'd first been taken to art classes as a schoolboy. For many people, it was a tribute to a titan of Scottish art and literature which was long overdue. For the jobbing artist, who recalled countless commissions taken to sustain his family, he was most bemused by the gift shop in which you could buy Lanark fridge magnets. A fall in 2015, left him in intensive care for a number of months. It meant he missed Lanark being staged as part of the Edinburgh International Festival but visitors to his bedside told him about it, and it wasn't long before he began to work again, translating Dante. The trilogy, for Canongate, which he illustrated as well as translated was the first thing he began work on when he returned home. When I last visited, he was deep in work, and once again bemused by the attention his accident had caused, and the outpouring of affection for him. Painting and writing were even then, inextricably linked. He was a brilliant artist and writer, who made extraordinary art almost every day of what he believed to be an ordinary life. And I for one, will miss him.

Trump faces criticism over whistleblower tweetThe president shares a post naming the alleged whistleblower whose complaint led to his impeachment.US & Canada,"US President Donald Trump is facing staunch criticism for retweeting a post that included the alleged name of the whistleblower whose complaint led to the president's impeachment. Mr Trump shared a post from a user named @surfermom77, who described themselves as a ""100% Trump supporter"". The retweet seemed to disappear from the president's timeline for a period but was visible again later. Mr Trump has repeatedly called for the whistleblower to be identified. In November, lawyers for the whistleblower - who is said to work in the US intelligence community - issued a cease-and-desist warning to the president, saying their client was ""in physical danger"". But the president ignored the warning and continued to call for them to be named. The US has federal laws that guarantee the protection of whistleblowers, designed to shield those who come forward with evidence of wrongdoing by the government. A US state divided by impeachment How will Senate trial work? Previous posts by @surfermom77 - the Twitter user retweeted by President Trump - include anti-Islam content and posts spreading the false conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was a Muslim. According to areport by the Associated Press,external, the account bears the hallmarks of an automated ""bot"" account, ""including an unusually high amount of activity and profile pictures featuring stock images from the internet"". The account's profile picture - a stock photo of a woman in business attire that was pulled from the internet - was changed on Saturday to an image of Mr Trump. Facebook has a policy of banning posts that name the alleged whistleblower, the New York Times reported, but Twitter does not. In a statement issued to the Associated Press, Twitter said the @surfermom77 tweet was ""not a violation of the Twitter Rules"". There was some speculation about whether Mr Trump deleted the retweet after the outcry. Twitters users said they were unable to see the post on his timeline on Saturday morning, after he shared it at around midnight on Friday. On Saturday afternoon, Twitter said there had been a glitch in its system, which had made some tweets invisible to some users, although the company did not specify how many people were affected or make a direct connection to this specific controversy.

The retweet was visible again in the president's feed by Sunday morning. His account is followed by 68 million people. The president had already faced criticism from Democratic leaders over his ongoing efforts to publicise the whistleblower's identity. In response to his retweet on Saturday, attorney Stephen Kohn, an expert in whistleblower protection laws, told the Washington Post that the president was violating his duty to safeguard whistleblowers. ""The paradox is that it was the president's duty to protect this person,"" Mr Kohn said. ""It's inconceivable that he not only doesn't do it, but violates it."" A former whistleblower told the Associated Press that the ease with which the person's identity had been spread online demonstrated the need for greater legal protection. Michael German, who left the FBI after reporting allegations of mismanagement, said it was ""completely inappropriate for the president of the United States to be engaged in any type of behaviour that could harm a whistleblower"". The controversy centres around a call between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Trump With a wealth of first-hand testimony, Democrats have moved the impeachment on from the whistleblower's evidence. But the president and other Republicans have worked to keep the whistleblower in the press. In an audio recording that emerged in September, President Trump was heard comparing the whistleblower's sources to a ""spy"". Then in an apparent reference to the execution of spies by the US in the past, he said: ""You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now."" According to reports in the Washington Post and the Guardian, the person named by right wing media as the whistleblower was receiving a spike in threats when the president tweeted about them, and was being driven to and from work by armed security officers following the threats. In August, the whistleblower filed a report expressing concern over a phone call a month earlier in which Mr Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, a Democratic front-runner for the 2020 US presidential election. Democrats said the call transcript showed President Trump abusing the power of his office to pressure President Zelensky to damage a US Democratic political rival. President Trump defended the call, saying it was ""perfect"".  He has dismissed the impeachment process as a ""witch-hunt"". This video can not be played ""Cheapened the process of impeachment"" - Trump reacts at a rally The whistleblower's report led ultimately to an inquiry in the House of Representatives which culminated in the president's impeachment on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, making Mr Trump only the third president in US history to be impeached.

Why Australia's PM is facing anger over bushfires,"Sydney has endured weeks of smoke from nearby bushfires Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has cut short his holiday to Hawaii amid growing criticism of his leadership during a bushfire crisis ravaging huge areas of the country. Since September, blazes in eastern Australia have killed six people, destroyed more than 700 homes and blanketed towns and cities including Sydney in smoke. On Thursday, two volunteer firefighters heading to a blaze in Sydney's south-west also died when their fire engine was hit by a tree. New South Wales, Australia's most populous state, has declared a state of emergency for a second time in two months. This video can not be played Footage shows bushfire ""crowning"" across treetops The country is also facing a historic heatwave -the national average temperature broke the previous records on two consecutive days this week. As the crisis rolls on, many Australians have accused the prime minister of failing to provide reassurances or support to fire-hit communities. Mr Morrison and his government have also faced a mounting backlash over their climate policies. Mr Morrison has called the fires a ""national disaster"", but he has often been accused of downplaying the severity of the crisis. He has readily offered ""thoughts and prayers"" to victims,external, toured fire zones and praised crews - most of whom are trained but unpaid volunteers. Mr Morrison has visited people affected by some of the fires, like here in Taree, NSW Mr Morrison rejected calls for greater funding of firefighters, saying existing resources were sufficient and that volunteers ""want to be there"". He later pledged an additional A$11m (Â£5.7m; $7.5m) towards aerial firefighting. Much criticism has focused on the government's support for coal-fired power plants. But the Labor opposition has also attracted anger over its pro-coal policies. Melinda Plesman called for the government to take action on climate change Several protests have been held, includingthousands of people coming onto the streets in Sydney, where the air quality has been pushed to hazardous levels. One woman left the remains of her home, destroyed by a bushfire, outside parliament in Canberra. On them she had written: ""Morrison, your climate crisis destroyed my home."" Their views are not shared by all, however. Others have placed the blame for the fires on a severe drought, the sheer amount of dry land there is to burn, and what they view as natural weather cycles. Mr Morrison's decision to go on holiday with his family had not been publicly announced, but his office said the opposition leader Anthony Albanese had been told. In the media and on social media, suggestions that he should not be ""missing in action"" at a time of crisis escalated, particularly as he had once been critical of a fire commissioner for doing the same. Phrases such as #WhereisScoMo, and #FireMorrison have been trending online. Sydney gets tough water cuts amid bushfires How bad is bushfire smoke for health? How do you fight extreme wildfires? Mr Albanese had said the PM was entitled to a holiday, but criticised the ""lack of information and transparency"". Mr Morrison's office initially denied he was in Hawaii, but then a picture emerged on social media apparently showing him posing with other tourists on a beach drinking a beer. This video can not be played Australians on the heatwave: 'It's so hot, I feel like dying' On Friday, Mr Morrison confirmed he was in Hawaii but was returning early. His announcement came shortly after two firefighters - both volunteers and fathers of young children - had been killed. They are the first firefighters to die in the crisis. ""Given these most recent tragic events, I will be returning to Sydney from leave as soon as can be arranged,"" he said in a statement. He said the country had been well-managed in his absence, but: ""I deeply regret any offence caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with family at this time."" Australia, with its coal-dependent economy, has one of the highest per capita greenhouse gas emission rates globally. The 2020 Climate Change Performance Index ranked Australia last of 57 countries,externalfor its climate policy, saying it had gone backwards under the Morrison government. Is climate change to blame for Australia's fires? The climate phenomenon linking floods and bushfires Australia defies climate warning to back coal The UN has also identified Australia as one of seven G20 nationsneeding to do more on their climate promises. Australia has warmed overall by slightly more than 1C since 1910, with most of the heating occurring since 1950. While bushfires are a natural part of the Australian cycle, the Bureau of Meteorology has said the rising heat has exacerbated drought which in turn has made dangerous fires more frequent and more intense. The group Emergency Leaders for Climate Action, made up of former former fire chiefs and emergency leaders, has accused the government of being ""missing in action"" on climate action and ignoring calls for a crisis summit. Mr Morrison - prime minister since last year - has suggested reining in the country's emissions would be a drop in ocean. ""To suggest that at just 1.3% of emissions, that Australia doing something more or less would change the fire outcome this season - I don't think that stands up to any credible scientific evidence at all,"" he said recently. Deputy PM Michael McCormack rejected such questions as the concerns of ""raving inner-city lefties"", adding: ""We've had fires in Australia since time began."" More recently, Mr Morrison has acknowledged climate change as one of ""many other factors"" in fuelling the bushfires. But he has dismissed direct links between the fires and his government's policies. ""Let me be clear about this - climate change is a global challenge. Australia is playing our role as part of this global challenge,"" he said on Thursday.

The threat of rising anti-Semitism,"This video can not be played Rabbi Doris Dyen: 'I'm broken and I can't pray' Last autumn, cards suddenly started appearing in some mail boxes of the well kept brick houses of quiet Squirrel Hill, a historic Jewish neighbourhood in the East End of Pittsburgh. One side had a woman smiling next to a swastika. A message, ""It's not illegal to be White... yet"", and the image of a noose had been printed on the other. At the same time, stickers were found on benches in a nearby public park, saying ""White People Rock!"" Alarms were raised. It was not the first time that residents of this tight-knit community, which dates back to the 1920s, had suffered anti-Semitic abuse; yet, some were left scared. The cards eventually stopped coming, the stickers were quickly removed to never be seen again, and life continued as normal. Isolated words of hate, many thought. But they were not, these families would tragically find out just one year later, as similar hostility, on the rise here and across the country, resulted in a massacre in one of their most sacred places. ""All Jews must die,"" the suspected gunman reportedly said as he shot indiscriminately against worshippers gathered for their Sabbath rituals at the Tree of Life synagogue.Eleven people, aged between 54 and 97, were killed. The deadliest anti-Semitic attack in recent US history hit the heart of this ""vibrant Jewish oasis"", as some called it. For many in Squirrel Hill, and certainly elsewhere, it did not come as a total surprise. Anti-Semitic incidents increased 57% in the US in 2017 compared to the previous year, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), with cases reported in every single state for the first time since 2010. With alarming frequency, swastikas and messages like ""Hitler was not wrong"", ""Kill all Jews"" and ""No Jews"" have appeared on synagogues, Jewish graves and homes and school campuses, terrorising their targets. The messages left in Squirrel Hill had the name of the Creativity Alliance, a white supremacist group, and were one of the 1,986 incidents of anti-Semitism reported by the ADL nationwide last year. A sign, they said, that their perpetrators felt emboldened enough to break the law and carry out their acts. ""Anti-Semitism is a complicated, stubborn phenomenon,"",externalsaid Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL's chief executive. ""[The cases] are disturbing and upsetting, and they demonstrate that we live in a nation where bigots still foment fear and hate."" As to be expected, anti-Semitic speech has also increased online, where neo-Nazis, white nationalists, conspiracy theorists and others have found places to freely spread their messages in anonymity, despite notable efforts to limit them. The alleged Tree of Life gunman, aged 46,had posted anti-Semitic content on the social network Gab, a place widely used by far-right figureheads banned from mainstream platforms. The bio on his account read ""Jews are the children of Satan"". 'I'm now more aware of being Jewish' 'Jewish oasis' mourns its dead The dramatic rise in anti-Semitic incidents comes as incendiary rhetoric by top politicians and other prominent personalities in the last few years have deepened tensions. It is not a coincidence, many observers say, with some even blaming President Donald Trump for stirring divisions, a claim he has repeatedly denied - reacting to the shooting, Mr Trump called for national unity, angering those who sayheis part of the problem. White nationalists marched through the University of Virginia campus last year The tragedy in Pittsburgh was the worst nightmare of America's Jewish community which, last year, watched in shock white nationalists march in Charlottesville, Virginia, chanting ""Jews will not replace us"". ""The political rhetoric [in the US] has headed toward the gutter. Things are being said that weren't said before,"" said David Harris, chief executive of the American Jewish Committee, an advocacy group. ""Jews aren't excluded from what has been happening."" The anti-Semitic threat was also real from far-left and Islamist groups, he said, with a warning: if things did not change, we would all pay a heavy price. The days before the attack had been particularly tense, and perhaps a sign of that. In Kentucky, a 51-year-old white man shot dead two African-Americans, aged 67 and 69, in a supermarket, after he tried to enter a predominantly black church in Jeffersontown. Officials are investigating it as a hate crime. This video can not be played ""It's a horrific crime scene. One of the worst, and I've been on plane crashes"" At the same week, a56-year-old man allegedly sent more than a dozen explosive devicesto critics of President Trump, including top Democrats, CNN and Hungarian-American billionaire and philanthropist George Soros, who is Jewish and has been vilified by many on the right for being a ""globalist"". In this perverse narrative, Mr Soros - who has been publicly criticised by Mr Trump himself - and other ""globalists"" are a nasty force who want to disrupt their predominantly white, Christian societies through unlimited immigration and, therefore, need to be defeated. Hours before his rampage in Pittsburgh, the suspected gunman criticised refugee aid group Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS), saying he could not ""sit by and watch my people get slaughtered"". He now faces hate crime charges which could lead to a death sentence. This video can not be played The billionaire financier and philanthropist has become a divisive figure in global politics in recent years Tree of Life Rabbi Jeffrey Myers was at the synagogue when the attack happened and, this week, welcomed Mr Trump to Squirrel Hill, despite protests. Mr Trump was joined by First Lady Melania, his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is Jewish, and daughter Ivanka, who converted to Judaism when she married him. Some of the demonstrators carried placards saying ""Make America Kind Again,"" a play with the president's slogan. ""[But] this is not about politics. Hate doesn't know political party, religion, colour, persuasion or anything,"" said Mr Myers, who led the funerals of some of his own friends, shot dead at the synagogue. ""We do need to have strong leadership from all our elected leaders, not any one person, all of them from all political parties. We need to stop the hate."" US hate crimes: 'I fear my neighbour' Pittsburgh shooting: The victims In the last decades, American Jews watched their fellows being targeted in Europe and thought they were relatively safe. Brutal attacks have taken place inFrance, which has the Continent's largest Jewish community,Germanyand beyond. In the UK, theLabour Party has been embroiled in a long-running row over claims of anti-Semitism. ""I'm from Europe, it's much more common everywhere. For Americans, it's shocking because it's unusual,"" said 30-year-old Nathan Rittri, who lived a few houses from Tree of Life, as he walked with his wife and two young children to light candles in front of the synagogue on the morning after the shooting. ""It's something that is part of the day-to-day lives in other countries."" The attack was the deadliest against the Jewish community in the US in recent history In some European cities, Jewish buildings are secured by armed officers and followers have adopted precautions, such as avoiding displaying religious symbols. (Mr Trump said the outcome in Pittsburgh would have been different if there were armed guards outside the congregation.) It was still early to say if any measures would be taken in this country, and residents in Squirrel Hill were determined that nothing would change. For some others, though, change has already happened. ""There was a kind of wishful thinking here that we were somehow immune,"" said Mr Harris. ""Pittsburgh, in a way, destroyed whatever innocence was left in American Jews."" 'I'm now more aware of being Jewish' 'Jewish oasis' mourns a mass shooting Pittsburgh shooting: Who were the victims?

Five stabbed at home of New York rabbi,"Police sealed off the scene of the attack, which is close to a synagogue At least five people have been stabbed at the house of a rabbi in New York state, police say. The house in Monsey, north of New York City, was hosting a religious celebration when the attacker burst in,according to the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council,external(OJPAC). The suspect fled but was later taken into custody, police said. The motive was not immediately clear. One of the victims was stabbed at least six times, OJPAC said in a tweet. Why are people anti-Semitic? New Jersey attack 'may be anti-Semitic terror' The threat of rising anti-Semitism The attack came a day after New York city police said officers were stepping up patrols in heavily Jewish districts following a spate of anti-Semitic threats and attacks. This video can not be played ""We were scared, but we were not surprised"" A man brandishing a machete attacked a Hanukkah celebration at the rabbi's property in Monsey - an area with a large population of ultra-Orthodox Jews, CBS New York reported. The incident happened at about 22:00 on Saturday (03:00 GMT Sunday). ""The house had many dozens of people in there,"" Yossi Gestetner, a co-founder of OJPAC for the Hudson Valley region, told the New York Times. Aron Kohn, 65, was in the rabbi's home at the time. He told the paper: ""I was praying for my life. He started attacking people right away as soon as he came in the door. We didn't have time to react at all."" The rabbi's house was hosting a Hanukkah celebration Mr Kohn said that the attacker then tried to enter a synagogue next to the house, but people inside had locked the door. Reports said the attacker fled the scene in a car and some witnesses noted the number plate. Police said later they had located a matching vehicle and arrested a suspect. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the stabbings were a ""despicable and cowardly act"". ""Anti-Semitism and bigotry of any kind are repugnant to our values of inclusion and diversity and we have absolutely zero tolerance for such acts of hate,"" he said in a statement. Police in New York have been guarding synagogues following a spate of hate crimes Letitia James, the New York Attorney General, said she was ""deeply disturbed"" by the situation. ""There is zero tolerance for acts of hate of any kind and we will continue to monitor this horrific situation,"" she said in a Twitter post.

In Israel, President Reuven Rivlin expressed his ""shock and outrage"" at the attack. ""The rise of anti-Semitism is not just a Jewish problem, and certainly not just the State of Israel's problem,"" he said in a statement. ""We must work together to confront this evil, which is raising its head again and is a genuine threat around the world."" The attack follows a series of anti-Semitic threats and attacks in and around New York City. On Friday Mayor Bill de Blasio announced extra police patrols in three areas of Brooklyn. Responding to the attack in Monsey, Mr de Blasio said he could not ""overstate the fear people are feeling right now"". ""We will not allow this to become the new normal. We'll use every tool we have to stop these attacks once and for all,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

They included a threat by a man who walked into an Orthodox Jewish community organisation's headquarters in Brooklyn and threatened to shoot someone. In another incident a 30-year-old woman reportedly slapped three women in the face. New York Police Department commissioner Dermot Shea has said hate crimes in New York City are up 22% this year.

Fellow author and friend Ian Rankin told BBC Scotland that Mr Gray was responsible for making everyday Scottish life interesting on an international level. He said: ""He could take something very personal to him - his background growing up in Glasgow for example - and make it that people around the world wanted to read it. ""He was part of that thing about taking Scotland out of the kailyard, writing sort of misty stories of Highland villages. ""Suddenly you were writing about things that meant stuff, writing politically, writing about your own experiences. ""His books were beautiful, they were crafted, they were elegant. He had a sense of fun, he was mischievous, he had this huge intellect but he was a 'lad of pairts' - he could do a little bit of everything and he did it all well."" Alasdair Gray has been described as ""one of Scotland's literary giants"" Nick Barley, director of the Edinburgh International Book Festival said: ""Scotland has been blessed with a host of great writers over the past 50 years, but if history remembers only one, it will likely be Alasdair Gray. ""He was a bright star in a luminous constellation of northern lights; a game-changer whose boundlessly innovative, cross-disciplinary thinking paved the way for so many others to succeed. ""We can thank Alasdair, not only for his own great work, but for his role in creating the conditions for a literary renaissance that has, in so many different ways, changed most people's understanding about what it means to be Scottish today."" Francis Bickmore, Mr Gray's editor and publishing director at Canongate, said: ""What sad news this is that Alasdair Gray is gone. It seems hard to believe that Alasdair was mortal and might ever leave us. ""No one single figure has left such a varied legacy - or missed so many deadlines - as Alasdair Gray. ""At least through Gray's phenomenal body of work he leaves a legacy that will outlive us all. His voice of solidarity and compassion for his fellow citizens, and his forward-looking vision is cause for great celebration and remembrance."" Unseen Alasdair Gray mural unveiled Writer seriously injured in fall His agent Jenny Brown said: ""We mourn Alasdair Gray's passing, but his genius will live on for readers through his remarkable work. ""He was a cultural trailblazer: nobody has done more to spur on, and give confidence to, the next generation of Scottish writers."" One of the artist's most famous murals spans the ceiling of the Oran Mor pub and restaurant in the west end of Glasgow. A writer in residence at the University of Glasgow in the 1970s, Mr Gray was described as a ""strong and close friend"" of the institution. University principal professor Sir Anton Muscatelli said: ""Alasdair Gray was one of the true greats of Scottish art and literature. ""It is with great sadness that we mark his passing, but the many works he produced, from his magnificent novel Lanark to the inspiring murals that adorn the city ensure that his legacy will live on for many years to come."" Mr Gray was a supporter of Scottish independence, writing Independence: How We Should Rule Ourselves, which was published in June 2014 as Scotland geared up for the independence referendum. In June 2015 he was badly injured in a fall at his home, which affected his mobility, though he later returned to work. Last month the author was given a lifetime achievement award by the Saltire Society for his contribution to Scottish literature. I've been lucky enough to know Alasdair Gray since I was a student at Glasgow University in the 1980s. My Honours dissertation was on his work, including the then recently published Lanark, which had cast a spotlight on someone who, despite being a polymath, from the humblest of backgrounds was never comfortable talking about himself. Do you see yourself as a Scottish writer or a London writer?, asked a reporter from the London-based arts programme Monitor in 1983. Was Dickens asked to describe himself as an English writer or a London writer? That question, sir, was unworthy of you, replies Alasdair Gray, with a grin. But he goes on to answer it. ""I would claim to be everything I might be suspected of. Glaswegian, Scottish, British, I'm everything."" The same was true of those who tried to pin him down as an artist or as a writer, one simply merged into the other. Sometimes it was his art which sustained him, as city recorder for Elspeth King at the People's Palace, making a series of paintings, documenting the changing city around him. Many will still know him as the creator of the visual tales around their city, the murals of Oran Mor and Hillhead Underground Station among others. Alasdair Gray's murals are at a number of Glasgow locations It's hard to describe what a groundbreaking novel Lanark was. And the city he described in Lanark - both real and fantastical - inspired many other writers, artists and readers to find their own voices. At 80, he found himself, to his bemusement at the centre of a photocall for a retrospective at several galleries across Glasgow, including Kelvingrove, where he'd first been taken to art classes as a schoolboy. For many people, it was a tribute to a titan of Scottish art and literature which was long overdue. For the jobbing artist, who recalled countless commissions taken to sustain his family, he was most bemused by the gift shop in which you could buy Lanark fridge magnets. A fall in 2015, left him in intensive care for a number of months. It meant he missed Lanark being staged as part of the Edinburgh International Festival but visitors to his bedside told him about it, and it wasn't long before he began to work again, translating Dante. The trilogy, for Canongate, which he illustrated as well as translated was the first thing he began work on when he returned home. When I last visited, he was deep in work, and once again bemused by the attention his accident had caused, and the outpouring of affection for him. Painting and writing were even then, inextricably linked. He was a brilliant artist and writer, who made extraordinary art almost every day of what he believed to be an ordinary life. And I for one, will miss him.

Trump faces criticism over whistleblower tweet,"US President Donald Trump is facing staunch criticism for retweeting a post that included the alleged name of the whistleblower whose complaint led to the president's impeachment. Mr Trump shared a post from a user named @surfermom77, who described themselves as a ""100% Trump supporter"". The retweet seemed to disappear from the president's timeline for a period but was visible again later. Mr Trump has repeatedly called for the whistleblower to be identified. In November, lawyers for the whistleblower - who is said to work in the US intelligence community - issued a cease-and-desist warning to the president, saying their client was ""in physical danger"". But the president ignored the warning and continued to call for them to be named. The US has federal laws that guarantee the protection of whistleblowers, designed to shield those who come forward with evidence of wrongdoing by the government. A US state divided by impeachment How will Senate trial work? Previous posts by @surfermom77 - the Twitter user retweeted by President Trump - include anti-Islam content and posts spreading the false conspiracy theory that President Barack Obama was a Muslim. According to areport by the Associated Press,external, the account bears the hallmarks of an automated ""bot"" account, ""including an unusually high amount of activity and profile pictures featuring stock images from the internet"". The account's profile picture - a stock photo of a woman in business attire that was pulled from the internet - was changed on Saturday to an image of Mr Trump. Facebook has a policy of banning posts that name the alleged whistleblower, the New York Times reported, but Twitter does not. In a statement issued to the Associated Press, Twitter said the @surfermom77 tweet was ""not a violation of the Twitter Rules"". There was some speculation about whether Mr Trump deleted the retweet after the outcry. Twitters users said they were unable to see the post on his timeline on Saturday morning, after he shared it at around midnight on Friday. On Saturday afternoon, Twitter said there had been a glitch in its system, which had made some tweets invisible to some users, although the company did not specify how many people were affected or make a direct connection to this specific controversy.

The retweet was visible again in the president's feed by Sunday morning. His account is followed by 68 million people. The president had already faced criticism from Democratic leaders over his ongoing efforts to publicise the whistleblower's identity. In response to his retweet on Saturday, attorney Stephen Kohn, an expert in whistleblower protection laws, told the Washington Post that the president was violating his duty to safeguard whistleblowers. ""The paradox is that it was the president's duty to protect this person,"" Mr Kohn said. ""It's inconceivable that he not only doesn't do it, but violates it."" A former whistleblower told the Associated Press that the ease with which the person's identity had been spread online demonstrated the need for greater legal protection. Michael German, who left the FBI after reporting allegations of mismanagement, said it was ""completely inappropriate for the president of the United States to be engaged in any type of behaviour that could harm a whistleblower"". The controversy centres around a call between Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky and President Trump With a wealth of first-hand testimony, Democrats have moved the impeachment on from the whistleblower's evidence. But the president and other Republicans have worked to keep the whistleblower in the press. In an audio recording that emerged in September, President Trump was heard comparing the whistleblower's sources to a ""spy"". Then in an apparent reference to the execution of spies by the US in the past, he said: ""You know what we used to do in the old days when we were smart? Right? With spies and treason, right? We used to handle them a little differently than we do now."" According to reports in the Washington Post and the Guardian, the person named by right wing media as the whistleblower was receiving a spike in threats when the president tweeted about them, and was being driven to and from work by armed security officers following the threats. In August, the whistleblower filed a report expressing concern over a phone call a month earlier in which Mr Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, a Democratic front-runner for the 2020 US presidential election. Democrats said the call transcript showed President Trump abusing the power of his office to pressure President Zelensky to damage a US Democratic political rival. President Trump defended the call, saying it was ""perfect"".  He has dismissed the impeachment process as a ""witch-hunt"". This video can not be played ""Cheapened the process of impeachment"" - Trump reacts at a rally The whistleblower's report led ultimately to an inquiry in the House of Representatives which culminated in the president's impeachment on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, making Mr Trump only the third president in US history to be impeached.

Thousands urge Sydney to halt 'traumatic' fireworksThe petition argues that the money spent on fireworks should go to those fighting bushfires.Australia,"Sydney's New Year fireworks - pictured here in 2018 - generate millions for the economy More than a quarter of a million people have signed a petition calling for Sydney's New Year's Eve fireworks to be cancelled and the money spent on fighting fires that threaten the city. Some A$5.8m (Â£3m; $4m) was reportedly spent on fireworks in Sydney last year, the petition says. The display should also be cancelled as it ""may traumatise some people"" who are dealing with ""enough smoke in the air"". But Sydney's lord mayor Clover Moore said the fireworks would go ahead. Ms Moore said she shared the ""deep sympathies"" of those who had signed the petition, but the fireworks were planned 15 months in advance and most of the budget had already been spent. ""We can't cancel the fireworks and even if we could, doing so would have little practical benefit,""the lord mayor wrote on the petition's website.,external However, Australians who signed the Change.org petition said a firework display would be an ""insult"".

He told the paper: ""I was praying for my life. He started attacking people right away as soon as he came in the door. We didn't have time to react at all."" The rabbi's house was hosting a Hanukkah celebration Mr Kohn said that the attacker then tried to enter a synagogue next to the house, but people inside had locked the door. Reports said the attacker fled the scene in a car and some witnesses noted the number plate. Police said later they had located a matching vehicle and arrested a suspect. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the stabbings were a ""despicable and cowardly act"". ""Anti-Semitism and bigotry of any kind are repugnant to our values of inclusion and diversity and we have absolutely zero tolerance for such acts of hate,"" he said in a statement. Police in New York have been guarding synagogues following a spate of hate crimes Letitia James, the New York Attorney General, said she was ""deeply disturbed"" by the situation.
