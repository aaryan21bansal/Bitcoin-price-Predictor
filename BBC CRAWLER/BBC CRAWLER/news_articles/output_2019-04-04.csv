Ethiopia pilots 'could not stop nosedive',"This video can not be played The MCAS system explained The Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed last month nosedived several times before it hit the ground, a preliminary report has said. Pilots ""repeatedly"" followed procedures recommended by Boeing before the crash,according to the first official report into the disaster,external. Boeing's boss has admitted for the first time a failure in the jet's anti-stall system was a factor in the crash. Flight ET302 crashed after take-off from Addis Ababa, killing 157 people. Despite their efforts, pilots ""were not able to control the aircraft"", Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges said. It was the second crash of a Boeing 737 Max aircraft in five months. Last October, Lion Air flight JT 610 crashed into the sea near Indonesia killing all 189 people on board. Who are the victims of crash? What went wrong with Boeing 737 Max? What do the 737 crashes mean for Boeing? In a news conference in Addis Ababa, Ms Dagmawit said: ""The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly [that were] provided by the manufacturer but were not able to control the aircraft."" The 737 Max family of aircraft was grounded following the Ethiopian Airlines crash, a move affecting more than 300 planes. The preliminary report did not attribute blame for the crash. But it says the crew were fully qualified to conduct the flight, and that they performed all the expected procedures correctly. The report goes on to recommend that Boeing review the 737 Max's ""flight control system related to flight controllability"" and that aviation regulators ensure this is done before the aircraft goes back into the air. Crash investigators have focused their attention on the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) - software designed to help prevent the 737 Max from stalling. The software reacts when sensors in the nose of the aircraft show the jet is climbing at too steep an angle, which can cause a plane to stall. The report does not mention the MCAS by name, but it does detail during the minutes after take off the problems the pilots were having in trying to control the aircraft's angle of flight. At one point the captain called out three times ""pull up"", and seconds after instructed the first officer to tell Air Traffic Control that they had a flight control problem. In a statement on Thursday, the chief executive of Ethiopian Airlines, Tewolde GebreMariam, said he was ""very proud"" of the pilots' ""high level of professional performance"". ""It was very unfortunate they could not recover the airplane from the persistence of nosediving,"" the airline said in a statement. An investigation into the Lion Air flight suggested the system malfunctioned, and forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times before it crashed into the sea. The preliminary report from Indonesian investigators found that a faulty sensor on the aircraft wrongly triggered MCAS without the pilots' knowledge. Boeing has been working on an upgrade of the MCAS software since the Lion Air crash. It has said the system can be disabled - allowing pilots to regain control if there appears to be a problem. But the latest comments from Ethiopian officials suggest that pilots could not regain control, despite following procedures recommended by Boeing. By Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent Hundreds of 737 Maxs are grounded worldwide Two crashes, five months apart, with a total of 346 people dead. Both preliminary crash reports suggest a new design to the 737 Max 8 malfunctioned, pushing each plane repeatedly into a nosedive. One lawsuit has been filed. More are likely. The suffering of those who've lost loved ones can't be quantified. But the commercial toll for the manufacturer and damage to its reputation, at this stage, can't be either. Hundreds of 737 Maxs are grounded worldwide. Thousands of orders are, for now on ice, and some could even be in jeopardy. The Max was Boeing's answer to Airbus' A320: a single-aisle, fuel-efficient short-haul plane. But in the opinion of one experienced 737 pilot, the new anti-stall system, which was added to the aircraft and contributed to both crashes, was ""flawed"". Boeing is working to fix it. It needs to get the aircraft certified as safe and back in the air as soon as it can. Read more from Tom here. In a statement on Thursday, Boeing's chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said that following the release of the report it was ""apparent"" that in both flights, the MCAS software was ""activated in response to erroneous angle of attack information"". He added: ""As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment. It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it and we know how to do it."" Earlier, Boeing said in a statement: ""To ensure unintended MCAS activation will not occur again, Boeing has developed and is planning to release a software update to MCAS and an associated comprehensive pilot training and supplementary education program for the 737 MAX."" The company said the update ""adds additional layers of protection and will prevent erroneous data from causing MCAS activation. Flight crews will always have the ability to override MCAS and manually control the airplane"". Boeing has issued guidance to pilots on how to manage MCAS, and it plans to install an extra warning system on all 737 Max aircraft, which was previously an optional safety feature. It is also revising pilot training to provide ""enhanced understanding of the 737 Max"" flight system and crew procedures. The plane-maker says the upgrades are not an admission that MCAS caused the crashes. Boeing 737 Max MCAS system explained.

The game is rooted in ancient mythology and stars Kratos, the former Greek god of war, and his son Atreus. Fortnite, released in 2017, was named best evolving game. Despite receiving six nominations, UK-made western adventure Red Dead Redemption 2 walked away empty-handed at the glitzy ceremony in central London. This video can not be played Forza Horizon 4 won Best British Game The first God of War game was released in 2005. This eighth instalment in the series, developed by Santa Monica Studio, sees its iconic lead character Kratos - son of Zeus - as a struggling single parent. Cory Barlog, director of God of War, told the BBC winning the awards was ""amazing, overwhelming, and scary"". He said the win showed that story-led games could be as ""relevant"" as the presently popular Battle Royale style titles. Nintendo's Labo won two awards, one for best family game and the other for innovation.

""A game of such depth and innovation (whether you finished it or not!) - their loss is the independent sector's gain. Tonight shows titles from smaller teams that manage to speak a certain truth to players can be just as successful (in awards terms - not cash!) as the big guns,"" he tweeted. Presenter Dara O'Briain told the BBC the event celebrates the diversity of the games industry and the award results can be surprising. ""Like the movie industry suddenly going indie and choosing all indie and not choosing the blockbusters, Bafta has a tendency to do that,"" he said.

English hospital says no to Wales' patientsPeople in Wales will only be able to use the Countess of Chester Hospital in an emergency or a maternity case.Wales,"An English hospital has said it will no longer take in patients from Wales except emergencies and maternity cases. The Countess of Chester NHS Foundation Trust decision will impact on thousands of people in Flintshire who currently use it, with immediate effect. The decision follows a row over payments to the hospital for caring for patients from Wales. A Welsh Government spokesman said limiting access to Wales' patients on financial grounds was ""not acceptable"". GPs in Wales will no longer be able to refer patients for treatment over the border at the hospital. Wrexham Maelor Hospital and Ysbyty Glan Clwyd are the next closest hospitals for patients in the area. Chief executive of Countess of Chester Hospital, Susan Gilby, said it was ""a difficult decision"" down to ""unresolved funding issues"". ""Unfortunately, the trust is currently unable to accept any new elective work relating to patients living in Wales. ""We will of course honour any existing appointments so there will be no disruption for patients already waiting. ""This is a difficult decision that has been taken with great reluctance."" Funding Welsh patients 'hard to countenance' Chester hospital chief resigns over baby deaths inquiry 'Bed-blocking' by Welsh patients rises Ms Gilby added that contract negotiations were continuing and the trust was working with Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board in north Wales to resolve the issue. The trust's chairman, Sir Duncan Nichol, previously saidcaring for patients from Wales was ""hard to countenance"" due to costs. The trust told BBC Wales in October 2018 that 23,500 patients from Wales were treated over the border in 2016-17 for mainly secondary care, which cost Â£31.2m. Evan Moore, from Betsi Cadwaladr, said they were working to ""accommodate newly referred patients"" within existing services in Wales. ""We will be writing to all affected GPs and medical staff to inform them of these changes,"" he told theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Mr Moore added that the decision did not affect cancer patients, urgent elective patients already referred to COCH or non-elective patients such as A&E patients or maternity patients. A Welsh Government spokesperson, said it was not a decision they had taken themselves. ""Along with NHS Wales representatives, Welsh Government has agreed a process of engagement with Department of Health and Social Care officials and representatives from the English NHS to discuss cross-border payment arrangements,"" a spokesman said. ""In the context of ongoing engagement, any actions taken by English providers to limit access for Welsh patients on financial grounds are unacceptable and not in the spirit of reaching a cross-border agreement with English NHS representatives."" Labour MP for Alyn and Deeside, Mark Tami, said all parties must work towards ensuring patients from Wales can continue to be treated in Chester. ""The Countess of Chester was built to care for patients within its proximity - which included people in Flintshire. It's very important that this continues to be the case,"" he said. Doctors from the Marches Medical Practice said they were ""extremely disappointed"" at the decision. ""We feel strongly as a cross-border practice that patients should be free to choose where they are treated and are extremely disappointed that our patients could be adversely affected by this policy.""

Mental health tests for NZ attack suspect,"The suspect made an earlier court appearance in March (file photo) The man accused of killing 50 people in last month's attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, has been ordered to undergo mental health tests. He would be seen by experts to decide if he was fit to stand trial or insane, said high court judge Cameron Mander. The suspect faces 50 murder charges and 39 attempted murder charges. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, appeared in the courtroom - packed with relatives of some of the victims - via video link from prison. He was not required to enter a plea. It is the deadliest mass shooting attack New Zealand has ever seen. Christchurch shootings: How the attacks unfolded Members of Christchurch's Muslim community attended the court hearing New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arderncalled it one of New Zealand's ""darkest days"". She hasvowed to ban all types of semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles. On Friday morning, Judge Mander ordered that two assessments would be carried out to determine the state of the suspect's mental health. The suspect listened intently during the short court hearing. He made no comments. The suspect was able to see the judge and lawyers and hear the proceedings - but the camera was turned away from the public gallery. The judge remanded him in custody, and his next court appearance is now due on 14 June. Omar Nabi who lost a relative in the attack was at the court Omar Nabi lost his father in the attack on the Al Noor mosque. Speaking to reporters outside the court he said ""we don't want to kill him. We want him to suffer here"". ""We want him to be punished, you know, a punishment for a crime of killing 50 people and injuring how many."" Tofazzal Alam who survived the attack on the Linwood mosque also spoke to reporters outside the court. ""I lost 50 friends whom I use to see in the mosque every Friday. And during the shooting, I couldn't see him. I want to see how he feels after killing 50 people, so that's why I'm here today."" Fifty people lost their lives in the shootings at two mosques in the city. The child, the father, the aspiring footballer Video: 'The attacker killed my whole family' UK survivor 'cradled young woman' killed at mosque The suspect was arrested on 15 March for his involvement in the shootings at the Al Noor mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre, both located in Christchurch. He had allegedly first driven to the Al Noor mosque, parked nearby and began firing into the mosque as he walked in through the front entrance. What is known about NZ shooting suspect? He allegedly fired on men, women and children inside for about five minutes. He live-streamed the attack from a head-mounted camera and identified himself in the footage. Smashed windows at Linwood Mosque The suspect is then said to have driven about 5km (three miles) to the Linwood mosque where the second shooting occurred. The gunman, armed with semi-automatic rifles including an AR-15, is believed to have modified his weapons with high-capacity magazines - the part of the gun which stores ammunition - so they could hold more bullets. He is currently being kept in isolation at the Auckland Prison in Paremoremo, considered New Zealand's toughest. Less than a week after the attacks, Ms Ardern announced that New Zealand would ban all types of semi-automatic weapons and assault rifles. She said she expected new legislation to be in place by 11 April. An amnesty has been imposed so the owners of affected weapons can hand them in, and a buy-back scheme will follow. Many in the country are still coming to terms with the mass killings. The people killed as they prayed Brother hails NZ mosque victim 'hero' 'A leader with love on full display' More than 20,000 people had earlier last month attended a memorial service honouring the 50 victims of the shootings. Thousands turned up to a vigil in remembrance of the victims All 50 names of the victims who died in the attacks were read out at the event by members of the city's Muslim community. The victims included men, women and children from across the world. The youngest victim was just three years old.

"Ethiopia pilots 'could not stop nosedive'Pilots ""repeatedly"" tried recommended procedures to prevent the crash of flight ET302, a preliminary report finds.Business","This video can not be played The MCAS system explained The Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed last month nosedived several times before it hit the ground, a preliminary report has said. Pilots ""repeatedly"" followed procedures recommended by Boeing before the crash,according to the first official report into the disaster,external. Boeing's boss has admitted for the first time a failure in the jet's anti-stall system was a factor in the crash. Flight ET302 crashed after take-off from Addis Ababa, killing 157 people. Despite their efforts, pilots ""were not able to control the aircraft"", Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges said. It was the second crash of a Boeing 737 Max aircraft in five months. Last October, Lion Air flight JT 610 crashed into the sea near Indonesia killing all 189 people on board. Who are the victims of crash? What went wrong with Boeing 737 Max? What do the 737 crashes mean for Boeing? In a news conference in Addis Ababa, Ms Dagmawit said: ""The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly [that were] provided by the manufacturer but were not able to control the aircraft."" The 737 Max family of aircraft was grounded following the Ethiopian Airlines crash, a move affecting more than 300 planes. The preliminary report did not attribute blame for the crash. But it says the crew were fully qualified to conduct the flight, and that they performed all the expected procedures correctly. The report goes on to recommend that Boeing review the 737 Max's ""flight control system related to flight controllability"" and that aviation regulators ensure this is done before the aircraft goes back into the air. Crash investigators have focused their attention on the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) - software designed to help prevent the 737 Max from stalling. The software reacts when sensors in the nose of the aircraft show the jet is climbing at too steep an angle, which can cause a plane to stall. The report does not mention the MCAS by name, but it does detail during the minutes after take off the problems the pilots were having in trying to control the aircraft's angle of flight. At one point the captain called out three times ""pull up"", and seconds after instructed the first officer to tell Air Traffic Control that they had a flight control problem. In a statement on Thursday, the chief executive of Ethiopian Airlines, Tewolde GebreMariam, said he was ""very proud"" of the pilots' ""high level of professional performance"". ""It was very unfortunate they could not recover the airplane from the persistence of nosediving,"" the airline said in a statement. An investigation into the Lion Air flight suggested the system malfunctioned, and forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times before it crashed into the sea. The preliminary report from Indonesian investigators found that a faulty sensor on the aircraft wrongly triggered MCAS without the pilots' knowledge. Boeing has been working on an upgrade of the MCAS software since the Lion Air crash. It has said the system can be disabled - allowing pilots to regain control if there appears to be a problem. But the latest comments from Ethiopian officials suggest that pilots could not regain control, despite following procedures recommended by Boeing. By Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent Hundreds of 737 Maxs are grounded worldwide Two crashes, five months apart, with a total of 346 people dead. Both preliminary crash reports suggest a new design to the 737 Max 8 malfunctioned, pushing each plane repeatedly into a nosedive. One lawsuit has been filed. More are likely. The suffering of those who've lost loved ones can't be quantified. But the commercial toll for the manufacturer and damage to its reputation, at this stage, can't be either. Hundreds of 737 Maxs are grounded worldwide. Thousands of orders are, for now on ice, and some could even be in jeopardy. The Max was Boeing's answer to Airbus' A320: a single-aisle, fuel-efficient short-haul plane. But in the opinion of one experienced 737 pilot, the new anti-stall system, which was added to the aircraft and contributed to both crashes, was ""flawed"". Boeing is working to fix it. It needs to get the aircraft certified as safe and back in the air as soon as it can. Read more from Tom here. In a statement on Thursday, Boeing's chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said that following the release of the report it was ""apparent"" that in both flights, the MCAS software was ""activated in response to erroneous angle of attack information"". He added: ""As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment. It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it and we know how to do it."" Earlier, Boeing said in a statement: ""To ensure unintended MCAS activation will not occur again, Boeing has developed and is planning to release a software update to MCAS and an associated comprehensive pilot training and supplementary education program for the 737 MAX."" The company said the update ""adds additional layers of protection and will prevent erroneous data from causing MCAS activation. Flight crews will always have the ability to override MCAS and manually control the airplane"". Boeing has issued guidance to pilots on how to manage MCAS, and it plans to install an extra warning system on all 737 Max aircraft, which was previously an optional safety feature. It is also revising pilot training to provide ""enhanced understanding of the 737 Max"" flight system and crew procedures. The plane-maker says the upgrades are not an admission that MCAS caused the crashes. Boeing 737 Max MCAS system explained.

"Alesha MacPhail killer lodges appealAaron Campbell, 16, is challenging the 27-year sentence he received for the murder of six-year-old Alesha MacPhail.Glasgow & West Scotland","Campbell was arrested on 4 July last year, two days after the murder The teenager who abducted, raped and murdered Alesha MacPhail has lodged an appeal against his sentence. Aaron Campbell was ordered toserve a minimum of 27 yearsof a life sentence for killing the six-year-old on the Isle of Bute on 2 July last year. During his trial, Campbell denied ever meeting Alesha but, before he was sentenced, it emerged he had confessed. The judge, Lord Matthews, described him as a ""cold, callous, calculating, remorseless and dangerous individual"". The Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service confirmed Campbell had lodged a notice of appeal against his sentence. Alesha, from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, was only a few days into her summer holiday when she was lifted from her bed in the middle of the night. Her body was found in the grounds of a former hotel the following morning. A post-mortem examination later revealed she had been carried to her death and suffered 117 injuries. Campbell told a psychologist how Alesha woke after he had carried her from her room During his nine-day trial in February, Campbell lodged a special defence naming the 18-year-old girlfriend of Alesha's father as the killer. He also took the stand and told the jury his DNA must have been planted at the crime scene. But the prosecution case, built on compelling forensic evidence and CCTV provided by Campbell's mother, was overwhelming. The jury at the High Court in Glasgow took just three hours tounanimously convict the schoolboy. When he returned to the dock to be sentenced last month, the court heard Campbell had finally admitted the crime. This video can not be played Alesha MacPhail murder: Lord Matthews imposes life sentence Lord Matthews revealed in the 12 months prior to the murder, the teenager thought about ""doing something excessive"" including rape. And when he set eyes on the child sleeping in her grandparents' flat on Ardbeg Road, Rothesay, he saw it as a ""moment of opportunity"". Campbell told the psychologist: ""At any other time in life, murder wouldn't have been the conclusion. If I was a year younger I don't think I would have done it. ""All I thought about was killing her once I saw her."" It was disclosed that he told the psychologist he was ""quite satisfied with the murder"". Lord Matthews said the crime had caused ""revulsion and disbelief."" He also warned Campbell that he may never be freed. The judge said: ""Whether you will ever be released will be for others to determine, but as matters stand a lot of work will have to be done to change you before that could be considered. ""It may even be impossible."" Throughout his trial, Campbell could not be named as he was under the age of 18. After his conviction media outlets, including the BBC, launched asuccessful legal bidto reverse the court order which had protected his identity. What do we know about Alesha's killer?

"Hillsborough event halted to avoid 'risk'A commemoration with speeches, performances and prayers was planned for St George's Hall plateau.","Joe Anderson said it was an important milestone but he did not want to risk potential legal proceedings An event marking the 30th anniversary of Hillsborough has been cancelled after a jury failed to reach a verdict in the trial of the match commander. Former Ch Supt Duckenfield, 74, had denied the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans in the 1989 disaster. Lawyers for Mr Duckenfield have said they will oppose an application from prosecutors for a retrial. Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson took the decision to avoid any legal risk. A 10-week trial at Preston Crown Court ended on Wednesday after jurors were unable to agree on the charges against Mr Duckenfield. The jury failed to reach a verdict in the trial of the match commander former Ch Supt Duckenfield A commemoration with speeches, performances and prayers at St George's Hall plateau in Liverpool city centre was planned for the evening of 15 April - 30 years on from the crush which resulted in the deaths of 96 supporters. Mr Anderson said: ""The risk of the event inadvertently influencing any future decisions made regarding ongoing legal proceedings is a risk I do not want the city to take. ""Despite this being such an important milestone... we understand how sensitive the current environment is surrounding the case."" There will be a minute's silence in Liverpool at 15:.06 - the time the game was called off Liverpool City Council said there would still be a visual memorial at the front of St George's Hall for people to pay their respects between 14-18 April and a public memorial service at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral will take place as planned on 15 April at 14:45 BST. It said there would also be a minute's silence in Liverpool at 15:06 - the exact time the FA Cup semi-final game at Hillsborough was stopped. Flags on civic buildings will be flown at half-mast and bells at the town hall will ring 96 times. The Lime Street media wall, opposite Lime Street Station, and the M62 digital screens will also display the words ""Never Forgotten"".

Polls close in Newport West by-election,"This video can not be played Ruth Jones wants to reconnect with the people who did not vote Labour has held on to the Newport West parliamentary seat with a reduced majority following a by-election. Union official Ruth Jones won the south Wales seat, which fell vacant with thedeath of veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn in February. Labour saw its majority over the Conservatives fall to 1,951 from 5,658 at the 2017 general election. Mr Flynn had held the seat since 1987. Eleven candidates stood, with the 37% turnout higher than some had predicted. In her victory speech, Ms Jones, 56, said the by-election had taken place because of ""the sad passing of Paul Flynn, our friend"". ""There have been many tributes to him over the weeks but one saying stood out to me - 'everyone knew somebody who was helped by Paul Flynn',"" she said. Lion Mama: The woman who fought off her daughterâs rapists Sala pilot 'not qualified to fly at night' The neo-Nazi paedophile who plotted to kill ""These words have been an inspiration to me throughout the campaign.  That's what we're here for - to do our best to help others."" She added: ""Now that you've elected me to go to Parliament, I will do what I promise to do on the doorstep: I will stand up for the people, the jobs and the economy of Newport West."" Renew candidate June Davies (left) and Neil Hamilton of UKIP congratulate Ruth Jones Born and brought up in the constituency, Ms Jones, a NHS physiotherapist, has been a full-time union official with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy since 2016. She stood as the Labour candidate in Monmouth at the 2015 and 2017 general elections. ""Who knows what the next few days, weeks and months will bring,"" she added. ""But what I do know is that people have had enough after a decade of austerity."" ""They've had enough of cuts that have taken police off our streets, they've had enough of being made to feel worthless by universal credit and the bedroom tax. If I'm going to parliament it's with those people in my heart and Newport in my mind."" Newport West by-election: As it happened The result saw a swing from Labour to the Conservative of 2.4%. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Ms Jones would be a ""fantastic successor to Paul Flynn and will take up the tireless work he carried out for this community"". ""Tonight's result sends a clear message that the people of Newport and Wales are fed up of austerity which has robbed the Welsh economy of Â£1bn through needless cuts and shows support for Labour's alternative,"" he added. Conservative candidate Matthew Evans said he had ""never seen such anger and frustration"" on the doorstep as what he encountered over Brexit. ""People just want clarity and I've seen no appetite for another referendum or a general election,"" he said. Ruth Jones with her husband David after her win UKIP candidate Neil Hamilton, an AM for the party, came third with 2,023 votes. He campaigned saying the by-election was a chance to send a message to Westminster over its handling of the UK's departure from the EU. He said: ""To nearly quadruple our vote, I regard a success in itself even though we didn't win the election. ""I regard this as the start of a new era for my party and I look forward to the next election, whenever that may come."" Analysis by Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor This is a good hold for Labour and Ruth Jones will be pleased to be heading for Westminster with a majority of nearly 2,000 at a time of such an unpredictability. The Conservatives will be pleased to have held off the UKIP challenge for second place when the UK government is under such pressure over Brexit. But UKIP is taking encouragement from a vote share of more than 8%, which would be their baseline for keeping a presence in the Senedd at the next Welsh Assembly elections. What happened in this by-election should not be taken as a barometer for for future elections - politics is a rollercoaster right now. Ruth Jones will need to fasten her seat belt.

God of War wins best game at Bafta AwardsThe winners of the Bafta Games Awards were revealed at a glitzy ceremony in central London.Technology,"This video can not be played God of War won best game Action-adventure game God of War has won the sought-after Best Game prize at the 15th annual Bafta Games Awards. The game is rooted in ancient mythology and stars Kratos, the former Greek god of war, and his son Atreus. Fortnite, released in 2017, was named best evolving game. Despite receiving six nominations, UK-made western adventure Red Dead Redemption 2 walked away empty-handed at the glitzy ceremony in central London. This video can not be played Forza Horizon 4 won Best British Game The first God of War game was released in 2005. This eighth instalment in the series, developed by Santa Monica Studio, sees its iconic lead character Kratos - son of Zeus - as a struggling single parent. Cory Barlog, director of God of War, told the BBC winning the awards was ""amazing, overwhelming, and scary"". He said the win showed that story-led games could be as ""relevant"" as the presently popular Battle Royale style titles. Nintendo's Labo won two awards, one for best family game and the other for innovation. It is the cardboard toolkit that lets players explore the interactivity of the firm's Switch console, for example by creating a piano.

""A game of such depth and innovation (whether you finished it or not!) - their loss is the independent sector's gain. Tonight shows titles from smaller teams that manage to speak a certain truth to players can be just as successful (in awards terms - not cash!) as the big guns,"" he tweeted.

JK Rowling's PA to pay back fraud money,"Amanda Donaldson must pay Â£18,734 to JK Rowling with interest A former personal assistant to JK Rowling has been ordered to pay almost Â£19,000 to the Harry Potter author after fraudulently using her credit card. Amanda Donaldson, 35, from Coatbridge in North Lanarkshire, must pay Â£18,734 back with interest. The author pursued damages in a civil case at Airdrie Sheriff Court under her married name Joanne Murray. She said the money would be donated to her charity Lumos. Donaldson was dismissed from her job in Ms Rowling's Edinburgh office in 2017 over the incident. JK Rowling PA denies 'ridiculous' spending JK Rowling 'generous but unapproachable' JK Rowling's former PA was 'good liar' Sheriff Derek O'Carroll found Donaldson used a business credit card to purchase goods and withdraw money which were for her own use. He also found that she used Ms Rowling's business bank accounts to buy foreign currency which she kept for herself. The amount she has been ordered to repay includes Â£1,160 for cash withdrawals, Â£9,832 for point-of-sale purchases and Â£7,742 on foreign currency. However the sheriff said there was not enough evidence to prove Donaldson was responsible for a quantity of Harry Potter merchandise going missing. After the publication of the judgement, a statement issued on behalf of Ms Rowling said she was ""pleased"" with the ruling. It added: ""From the outset Ms Rowling made it clear that the decision to take this matter to court was a last resort and not for her personal benefit, but rather to protect the reputation of her existing staff, and to make sure Ms Donaldson is not in a position to breach the trust of another employer. ""Terms of the recovery will be decided in due course, and the money owed will be donated to JK Rowling's charity Lumos."" JK Rowling hired Amanda Donaldson to help organise her business and personal matters. During the court case, Donaldson accepted she had no entitlement to use the business credit card or bank accounts for her own benefit. However, she denied any form of fraud or dishonesty, contending that every transaction was for the business use or the personal benefit of Ms Rowling, and it was all authorised. She contended that every foreign currency purchase was authorised and was spent during foreign trips by Ms Rowling, her family and security staff or was retained by the writer or her family with a very limited amount left over. She denied any responsibility for missing Harry Potter merchandise. The judgement,externalconcluded: ""The sheriff accepted the evidence of the pursuer, her husband and her other witnesses as entirely credible and reliable. ""By contrast, the sheriff did not accept the defender's evidence as either credible or reliable. He found that her evidence was a conscious fabrication.""

Polls close in Newport West by-electionCounting is due to start with 11 candidates fighting to be the new MP for Newport West.Wales politics,"This video can not be played Ruth Jones wants to reconnect with the people who did not vote Labour has held on to the Newport West parliamentary seat with a reduced majority following a by-election. Union official Ruth Jones won the south Wales seat, which fell vacant with thedeath of veteran Labour MP Paul Flynn in February. Labour saw its majority over the Conservatives fall to 1,951 from 5,658 at the 2017 general election. Mr Flynn had held the seat since 1987. Eleven candidates stood, with the 37% turnout higher than some had predicted. In her victory speech, Ms Jones, 56, said the by-election had taken place because of ""the sad passing of Paul Flynn, our friend"". ""There have been many tributes to him over the weeks but one saying stood out to me - 'everyone knew somebody who was helped by Paul Flynn',"" she said. Lion Mama: The woman who fought off her daughterâs rapists Sala pilot 'not qualified to fly at night' The neo-Nazi paedophile who plotted to kill ""These words have been an inspiration to me throughout the campaign.  That's what we're here for - to do our best to help others."" She added: ""Now that you've elected me to go to Parliament, I will do what I promise to do on the doorstep: I will stand up for the people, the jobs and the economy of Newport West."" Renew candidate June Davies (left) and Neil Hamilton of UKIP congratulate Ruth Jones Born and brought up in the constituency, Ms Jones, a NHS physiotherapist, has been a full-time union official with the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy since 2016. She stood as the Labour candidate in Monmouth at the 2015 and 2017 general elections. ""Who knows what the next few days, weeks and months will bring,"" she added. ""But what I do know is that people have had enough after a decade of austerity."" ""They've had enough of cuts that have taken police off our streets, they've had enough of being made to feel worthless by universal credit and the bedroom tax. If I'm going to parliament it's with those people in my heart and Newport in my mind."" Newport West by-election: As it happened The result saw a swing from Labour to the Conservative of 2.4%. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Ms Jones would be a ""fantastic successor to Paul Flynn and will take up the tireless work he carried out for this community"". ""Tonight's result sends a clear message that the people of Newport and Wales are fed up of austerity which has robbed the Welsh economy of Â£1bn through needless cuts and shows support for Labour's alternative,"" he added. Conservative candidate Matthew Evans said he had ""never seen such anger and frustration"" on the doorstep as what he encountered over Brexit. ""People just want clarity and I've seen no appetite for another referendum or a general election,"" he said. Ruth Jones with her husband David after her win UKIP candidate Neil Hamilton, an AM for the party, came third with 2,023 votes. He campaigned saying the by-election was a chance to send a message to Westminster over its handling of the UK's departure from the EU. He said: ""To nearly quadruple our vote, I regard a success in itself even though we didn't win the election. ""I regard this as the start of a new era for my party and I look forward to the next election, whenever that may come."" Analysis by Felicity Evans, BBC Wales political editor This is a good hold for Labour and Ruth Jones will be pleased to be heading for Westminster with a majority of nearly 2,000 at a time of such an unpredictability. The Conservatives will be pleased to have held off the UKIP challenge for second place when the UK government is under such pressure over Brexit. But UKIP is taking encouragement from a vote share of more than 8%, which would be their baseline for keeping a presence in the Senedd at the next Welsh Assembly elections. What happened in this by-election should not be taken as a barometer for for future elections - politics is a rollercoaster right now. Ruth Jones will need to fasten her seat belt.

Street cannabis 'contains large amount of faeces',"The hashish obtained in Madrid was found to contain dangerous levels of E.coli bacteria Cannabis resin sold on the streets of Madrid is contaminated with dangerous levels of faecal matter, a study says. Traces of E.coli bacteria and the Aspergillus fungus were found by analysts who examined 90 samples bought in and around the Spanish capital. The samples of hashish were wrapped up in plastic ""acorns"" were the worst offenders, reportedly because of the way they are smuggled into the country. Some 40% of these also had the aroma of faeces, the study's lead author said. Buying, selling and importing cannabis is against the law in Spain, as is using it in public - although it is technically legal to grow it for personal use, provided it is not publicly visible, and to consume it in private. JosÃ© Manuel Moreno PÃ©rez, a pharmacologist from the Universidad Complutense in Madrid, collected hashish samples (also referred to as hash or resin) directly from street dealers, both in the city and the surrounding suburbs. The aim was to determine whether the drugs sold were suitable for human consumption. His research team then separated the contaminated samples by shape, with some of them resembling ""acorns"" and others ""ingots"", to see if one shape had more contaminates than the other. The study, co-authored with Pilar PÃ©rez-Lloret, Juncal GonzÃ¡lez-Soriano and Inmaculada Santos Ãlvarez, has been published in the journalForensic Science International,external. They found that 93% of the acorn-shaped samples contained dangerous levels of E.coli bacteria, as did 29.4% of the ingot samples. Some 10% of the cannabis samples were also contaminated with Aspergillus, a dangerous fungus that can cause serious health problems. Most of the samples tested - 88.3% - were not suitable for consumption. Coloured scanning electron micrograph of Escherichia coli (E.coli) 0157:H7 Mr PÃ©rez later explained the contamination - and the smell - to the Spanish newspaper El PaÃ­s. The acorns, he said, were more likely to be contaminated because of how they were brought into the country - the cannabis  is wrapped up in small plastic pellets and swallowed before the drug smugglers then ""take a laxative and expel"" them in a toilet. These are then sold by dealers. According to the study, the risks associated with E.coli and Aspergillus are serious enough to make the illegal street vending of hashish ""a public health issue"". The E.coli infection, for example, can cause diarrhoea, vomiting, stomach pains, fever, and blood in faeces - and for some people this can then lead to even more serious conditions. Potent cannabis 'increases risk of psychosis' Health risks of recreational cannabis Meanwhile, inhaling Aspergillus mould can cause serious problems for people who already have lung conditions, like asthma or cystic fibrosis, or in people who have low immunity. The study says this is particularly dangerous for cancer patients, who sometimes smoke cannabis to help with the symptoms of chemotherapy. ""These patients have a weakened immune system, meaning that an infection caused by the consumption of contaminated or adulterated hashish could be fatal,"" it adds. There are three main types of street cannabis - hash, herbal cannabis (weed, grass or marijuana) and high-potency cannabis or skunk.

Hillsborough event halted to avoid 'risk',"Joe Anderson said it was an important milestone but he did not want to risk potential legal proceedings An event marking the 30th anniversary of Hillsborough has been cancelled after a jury failed to reach a verdict in the trial of the match commander. Former Ch Supt Duckenfield, 74, had denied the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 Liverpool fans in the 1989 disaster. Lawyers for Mr Duckenfield have said they will oppose an application from prosecutors for a retrial. Liverpool mayor Joe Anderson took the decision to avoid any legal risk. A 10-week trial at Preston Crown Court ended on Wednesday after jurors were unable to agree on the charges against Mr Duckenfield. The jury failed to reach a verdict in the trial of the match commander former Ch Supt Duckenfield A commemoration with speeches, performances and prayers at St George's Hall plateau in Liverpool city centre was planned for the evening of 15 April - 30 years on from the crush which resulted in the deaths of 96 supporters. Mr Anderson said: ""The risk of the event inadvertently influencing any future decisions made regarding ongoing legal proceedings is a risk I do not want the city to take. ""Despite this being such an important milestone... we understand how sensitive the current environment is surrounding the case."" There will be a minute's silence in Liverpool at 15:.06 - the time the game was called off Liverpool City Council said there would still be a visual memorial at the front of St George's Hall for people to pay their respects between 14-18 April and a public memorial service at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral will take place as planned on 15 April at 14:45 BST. It said there would also be a minute's silence in Liverpool at 15:06 - the exact time the FA Cup semi-final game at Hillsborough was stopped. Flags on civic buildings will be flown at half-mast and bells at the town hall will ring 96 times. The Lime Street media wall, opposite Lime Street Station, and the M62 digital screens will also display the words ""Never Forgotten"".

My life as a Jewish teenager in NI,"This video can not be played Michael Walker, 16, explains what life is like for him as a young Jewish person in Northern Ireland. The Jewish community has had a presence in Northern Ireland since the mid-18th Century. At its peak, there were about 1,500 members but the population has been in sharp decline. The last remaining Northern Ireland synagogue, in north Belfast, has seen its numbers drop to just 76  - most of whom are elderly. Michael Walker, 16, is one of a handful of young Jewish people left in this tiny community. ""There aren't that many roughly my age - there are only about four or five of us,"" he said. ""We don't really see each other that often."" 150 years of Belfast's Jewish community The Last Minyan: The decline of Belfast's Jewish community Michael - wearing his tallit, the Jewish prayer shawl - takes part in traditional worship Michael has lived in Northern Ireland all his life and his ancestors are from Jewish communities in Great Britain. His grandmother is originally from London and his grandfather from Glasgow. Having had his Bar Mitzvah three years ago, he is beginning to feel the demands of early adulthood. For Michael now counts as part of the minyan - a quorum of 10 Jewish men needed for traditional public Jewish worship. Judaism is the religion or culture of Jewish people and the profession, practice, or doctrines of the Jewish religion. Alongside Islam and Christianity, it is one of the three Abrahamic religions. Judaism originated in the Middle East more than 3,500 years ago. According to non-profit organisation the Jewish Agency for Israel, as of 2018 there are 14.7m Jewish people worldwide. The Bar Mitzvah is a coming-of-age ritual which Jewish boys go through when they reach the age of 13 (Jewish girls go through it at 12), at which point they are seen as becoming responsible for their own actions. According to Jewish law, he or she is also now eligible to own property and to get married. He is often needed to complete the minyan as the community struggles to meet the quota. ""There's a bit of pressure to kind of turn up,"" he said. ""It's important that we get the minyan - sometimes they only get nine and they're kind of annoyed that they're missing one person. ""When the 10th person sometimes is me, they say, 'Hey, Michael's here, we can start'."" The Star of David features on the Albert Memorial Clock at Queen's Square in Belfast Michael admits he does not wear a traditional skullcap most of the time, to avoid getting ""funny looks"" from those not accustomed to Jewish customs. ""Being in Northern Ireland, everyone thinks about the Protestants and Catholics but no-one thinks about us,"" he said. ""As there's not that many people left in the Jewish community in Northern Ireland, it will probably stay like that unless people are educated more about other religions."" Belfast-born Steven Jaffe, 54, a consultant to the Jewish Leadership Council, said youthful celebrations like Bar Mitzvahs and weddings were now rare. In fact, he believes Michael's Bar Mitzvah may have been the last one held in Northern Ireland. Mr Jaffe said he, too, was part of the Jewish exodus from Northern Ireland and chose to raise his family in London partly because of the availability of Jewish schools and kosher restaurants. Recalling his own childhood, he said there was a sizeable young Jewish community in Belfast in the 1970s and 1980s. ""I was lucky when I was growing up, as there was about 30 of us although by the time I was 18 that had fallen to around 10,"" he said. It is ""amazing"" that Northern Ireland's Jewish community is continuing, says Steven Jaffe ""Having the absence of a cohort of Jewish friends his age must be very difficult for Michael. ""The ageing community is a result of young people graduating to the larger communities in London and Manchester, or assimilating. ""Many have drifted away from the Jewish community and some have gone to live in Israel."" Mr Jaffe said the community, distinctive because of its relative geographic isolation, had so far defied predictions that it would disappear. ""Twenty years ago, people were saying it did not have a future, yet in 2019 they have a minister, they have services every Sabbath,"" he added. ""It is amazing it is continuing.""

Amazon boss in record-breaking $35bn divorce,"The pair said that they had had a great life together The world's richest man, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and his wife MacKenzie have agreed a record-breaking divorce settlement of at least $35bn (Â£27bn). Ms Bezos keeps a 4% stake in the online retail giant, worth $35.6bn on its own. Amazon was founded by Jeff Bezos in Seattle in 1994, a year after the couple married, and Ms Bezos was one of its first employees. Both parties tweeted positive comments about the other in the wake of the announced settlement. The two did not provide any further financial details about the settlement. The Amazon shares alone will make Ms Bezos the world's third-richest woman while Jeff will remain the world's richest person, according to Forbes. Jeff Bezos, 55, and MacKenzie, 48, a novelist, married in 1993 and have four children. Ms Bezos' tweet is her first and only one since joining the microblogging website this month. In it she stated that she was ""grateful to have finished the process of dissolving my marriage to Jeff with support from each other"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Bezos is reportedly in a relationship with former Fox TV host Lauren SÃ¡nchez. After Mr Bezos and his wife announced in January that they would part, a US tabloid magazine published details, including private messages, of an extramarital affair with Ms SÃ¡nchez. Mr Bezos has accused the publisher of the magazine, American Media Incorporated, of blackmail. The publisher denies the claim.

Alesha MacPhail killer lodges appeal,"Campbell was arrested on 4 July last year, two days after the murder The teenager who abducted, raped and murdered Alesha MacPhail has lodged an appeal against his sentence. Aaron Campbell was ordered toserve a minimum of 27 yearsof a life sentence for killing the six-year-old on the Isle of Bute on 2 July last year. During his trial, Campbell denied ever meeting Alesha but, before he was sentenced, it emerged he had confessed. The judge, Lord Matthews, described him as a ""cold, callous, calculating, remorseless and dangerous individual"". The Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service confirmed Campbell had lodged a notice of appeal against his sentence. Alesha, from Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, was only a few days into her summer holiday when she was lifted from her bed in the middle of the night. Her body was found in the grounds of a former hotel the following morning. A post-mortem examination later revealed she had been carried to her death and suffered 117 injuries. Campbell told a psychologist how Alesha woke after he had carried her from her room During his nine-day trial in February, Campbell lodged a special defence naming the 18-year-old girlfriend of Alesha's father as the killer. He also took the stand and told the jury his DNA must have been planted at the crime scene. But the prosecution case, built on compelling forensic evidence and CCTV provided by Campbell's mother, was overwhelming. The jury at the High Court in Glasgow took just three hours tounanimously convict the schoolboy. When he returned to the dock to be sentenced last month, the court heard Campbell had finally admitted the crime. This video can not be played Alesha MacPhail murder: Lord Matthews imposes life sentence Lord Matthews revealed in the 12 months prior to the murder, the teenager thought about ""doing something excessive"" including rape. And when he set eyes on the child sleeping in her grandparents' flat on Ardbeg Road, Rothesay, he saw it as a ""moment of opportunity"". Campbell told the psychologist: ""At any other time in life, murder wouldn't have been the conclusion. If I was a year younger I don't think I would have done it. ""All I thought about was killing her once I saw her."" It was disclosed that he told the psychologist he was ""quite satisfied with the murder"". Lord Matthews said the crime had caused ""revulsion and disbelief."" He also warned Campbell that he may never be freed. The judge said: ""Whether you will ever be released will be for others to determine, but as matters stand a lot of work will have to be done to change you before that could be considered. ""It may even be impossible."" Throughout his trial, Campbell could not be named as he was under the age of 18. After his conviction media outlets, including the BBC, launched asuccessful legal bidto reverse the court order which had protected his identity. What do we know about Alesha's killer?

Germany 'stands with Ireland over Brexit'German Chancellor Angela Merkel was speaking after talks with Irish PM Leo Varadkar in Dublin.EuropeComments,"Angela Merkel is visiting Dublin for the first time in five years German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Germany will stand with Ireland ""every step of the way"" over Brexit. She was speaking following talks in Dublin with the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) about the current deadlock. Parliament is still no closer to passing a Brexit deal, with the UK scheduled to leave the EU on 12 April. Ms Merkel was asked if it was possible to protect the integrity of the single market without an Irish border being in place. She said: ""We will simply have to be able to do this. We hope for a solution we can agree together with Britain. Good Friday Agreement 'hard to protect' in a no deal Brexit: DUP accuses government of U-turn Brexit: Labour and Conservative talks end after 4.5 hours ""Where there's a will there's a way. We still hope for an orderly Brexit."" Ms Merkel said they hoped intensive ongoing discussions in London would lead to a situation by next Wednesday ""where Prime Minister Theresa May will have something to table to us on the basis of which we can continue to talk"". She added: ""Until the very last hour - I can say this from the German side - we will do everything in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit; Britain crashing out of the European Union. ""But we have to do this together with Britain and with their position that they will present to us."" Leo Varadkar restated his commitment to an open border in Ireland with free movement of people and frictionless trade, with no tariffs and no checks. He added:  ""We don't want Ireland to become a back door to the single market in the event of a hard Brexit."" He said the two leaders had discussed planning for a no-deal Brexit. Their meeting comes just days afterMr Varadkar held discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. On Wednesday, the EU said 12 April was ""the ultimate deadline"" for approving the Withdrawal Agreement. It has been rejected by MPs three times, with DUP MPs voting against it - while independent unionist MP for North Down, Lady Hermon, voted in favour. It was Angela Merkel's first visit to Dublin for five years Speaking ahead of Ms Merkel's visit to Dublin, the taoiseach said she was ""a strong and unwavering ally of Ireland"". Ahead of their meeting, the taoiseach and chancellor also held talks with people from Northern Ireland and the border area about the impact a no-deal Brexit could have on their livelihoods. Mr Varadkar said it was ""important"" to hear the voices of people who lived and worked along the Irish border. It is five years since the German chancellor was last in Dublin and although the Angela Merkel era is in its twilight she remains the most powerful politician in the EU. Both she and Leo Varadkar are among the EU leaders who most want to avoid the UK crashing out without a deal. She has been, as the taoiseach said an ""unwavering ally"", and most supportive of the Northern Ireland peace process. Mr Varadkar has admitted there are difficulties in protecting both the single market and the Good Friday peace agreement while preventing a hard Irish border.

The diets cutting one in five lives short,"The food we eat is putting 11 million of us into an early grave each year, an influential study shows. The analysis, in the Lancet,,externalfound that our daily diet is a bigger killer than smoking and is now involved in one in five deaths around the world. Salt - whether in bread, soy sauce or processed meals - shortened the highest number of lives. Researchers say this study is not about obesity, but ""poor quality"" diets damaging hearts and causing cancer. The Global Burden of Disease Study is the most authoritative assessment of how people are dying in every country in the world. The latest analysis used estimates of countries' eating habits to pin down how often diet was shortening lives. The dangerous diets were those containing: Too much salt - three million deaths Too few whole grains - three million deaths Too little fruit - two million deaths Low levels of nuts, seeds, vegetables, omega-3 from seafood and fibre were the other major killers. ""We find that diet is one of the dominant drivers of health around the world, it's really quite profound,"" Prof Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington told the BBC. The lifesaving food 90% arenât eating enough of A bit of meat, a lot of veg - the flexitarian diet to feed 10bn Can a family learn to like the planetary health diet? About 10 million out of the 11 million diet-related deaths were because of cardiovascular disease and that explains why salt is such a problem. Too much salt raises blood pressure and that in turn raises the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Salt is popular with fish and chips Salt can also have a direct effect on the heart and blood vessels, leading to heart failure when the organ does not work effectively. Whole grains, fruit and vegetables have the opposite effect - they are ""cardioprotective"" and lower the risk of heart problems. Cancers and type 2 diabetes made up the rest of the diet-related deaths. No country is perfect and each favours some part of a healthy diet more than others, but this is how far the world is from an optimal diet. The healthy foods missing from the most diets around the world were nuts and seeds, according to the study. Eager readers will have noticedthey featured heavily in the planetary health diet, unveiled in January,to save lives, save the planet and feed 10 billion people. So why don't we munch them? Prof Nita Forouhi, from the University of Cambridge, said: ""The perception is they are little packs of energy that will make you fat, whereas they are packed full of good fats. ""And most people don't see them as mainstream food; and the other issue is cost."" Nuts - they are not just for squirrels. The huge fat versus sugar debate and the link between red and processed meats with cancer have attracted huge headlines in recent years. ""These can be harmful as we show, but they are much smaller issues than low whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetable intake,"" said Prof Murray. Although, the study did show too many fizzy drinks were being drunk in every corner of the world. The researchers say it is time for health campaigns to switch from talking about nutrients like fat and sugar and instead promote healthy foods. Bad diets are knocking a couple of years off life expectancies around the world, according to the researchers. But Prof Murray warns this is just the average and says the real question we should be asking is: ""Am I going to die in my 50s from a heart attack? Or am I going to have some of the diet-related cancers in my 40s?"" Mediterranean countries, particularly France, Spain and Israel, have some of the lowest numbers of diet-related deaths in the world. Countries in South East, Southern and Central Asia are at the opposite end of the spectrum. Israel has the lowest diet-related deaths - 89 per 100,000 people a year Uzbekistan has the highest diet-related deaths - 892 per 100,000 people a year Japan and China have curiously contrasting fortunes that reflect their changing relationship with salt. China consumes enormous amounts of salt with soy and other salty sauces being a key part of the country's cuisine. But the rising popularity of processed foods is introducing yet more salt to their diet. It has the highest death rate because of salt of any country. Prof Murray said: ""Japan is very interesting because if you go back 30 to 40 years, they like China today had enormous salt intake. ""Salt is still their number one problem, but it has come down dramatically, ""And they have a diet that is higher in many of the things we think are protective for heart disease such as vegetables and fruit."" Soy sauce is high in salt The UK is behind countries like France, Denmark and Belgium. The biggest problems are a lack of whole grains, fruit, vegetables and nuts and seeds. The study estimates 14% of UK deaths are related to diet, with 127 diet-related deaths per 100,000 people a year. Prof Murray said: ""Diet quality matters no matter what weight you are. ""The really big story for people to act on is increase your whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetable intake and reduce salt if you can."" But money is an issue. It is estimated that having your five fruit and veg a day would take up 52% of household income in poorer countries. But Prof Forouhi warns: ""The public can make healthier choices if informed and have the resources, but if what is on the shelves as buy-one-get-one-free is always unhealthy, then that message will fall down. ""Cheaper options that are healthy are badly needed."" Both agreed there needed to be a shift from focusing on nutrients (fat/sugar/salt) and on to which actual foods people should eat.

Germany 'stands with Ireland over Brexit',"Angela Merkel is visiting Dublin for the first time in five years German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said Germany will stand with Ireland ""every step of the way"" over Brexit. She was speaking following talks in Dublin with the taoiseach (Irish prime minister) about the current deadlock. Parliament is still no closer to passing a Brexit deal, with the UK scheduled to leave the EU on 12 April. Ms Merkel was asked if it was possible to protect the integrity of the single market without an Irish border being in place. She said: ""We will simply have to be able to do this. We hope for a solution we can agree together with Britain. Good Friday Agreement 'hard to protect' in a no deal Brexit: DUP accuses government of U-turn Brexit: Labour and Conservative talks end after 4.5 hours ""Where there's a will there's a way. We still hope for an orderly Brexit."" Ms Merkel said they hoped intensive ongoing discussions in London would lead to a situation by next Wednesday ""where Prime Minister Theresa May will have something to table to us on the basis of which we can continue to talk"". She added: ""Until the very last hour - I can say this from the German side - we will do everything in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit; Britain crashing out of the European Union. ""But we have to do this together with Britain and with their position that they will present to us."" Leo Varadkar restated his commitment to an open border in Ireland with free movement of people and frictionless trade, with no tariffs and no checks. He added:  ""We don't want Ireland to become a back door to the single market in the event of a hard Brexit."" He said the two leaders had discussed planning for a no-deal Brexit. Their meeting comes just days afterMr Varadkar held discussions with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris. On Wednesday, the EU said 12 April was ""the ultimate deadline"" for approving the Withdrawal Agreement. It has been rejected by MPs three times, with DUP MPs voting against it - while independent unionist MP for North Down, Lady Hermon, voted in favour. It was Angela Merkel's first visit to Dublin for five years Speaking ahead of Ms Merkel's visit to Dublin, the taoiseach said she was ""a strong and unwavering ally of Ireland"". Ahead of their meeting, the taoiseach and chancellor also held talks with people from Northern Ireland and the border area about the impact a no-deal Brexit could have on their livelihoods. Mr Varadkar said it was ""important"" to hear the voices of people who lived and worked along the Irish border. It is five years since the German chancellor was last in Dublin and although the Angela Merkel era is in its twilight she remains the most powerful politician in the EU. Both she and Leo Varadkar are among the EU leaders who most want to avoid the UK crashing out without a deal. She has been, as the taoiseach said an ""unwavering ally"", and most supportive of the Northern Ireland peace process. Mr Varadkar has admitted there are difficulties in protecting both the single market and the Good Friday peace agreement while preventing a hard Irish border.

What the crashes mean for Boeing,"The Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft that crashed soon after take-off Boeing, a superpower of the aviation world, is in the midst of a profound crisis. A brand new 737-Max 8 crashing after a new system on the modified aircraft apparently malfunctioned is, if investigators initial findings are confirmed, a disaster. All the evidence is pointing towards a second case of the same model of plane apparently suffering a similar fate, just five months later, and that makes this a whole lot worse. While the investigations into the crash are not yet complete, the problems for Boeing are mounting. The new anti-stall mechanism on the Max relied on data from one single sensor at the front of the aircraft. It's believed that erroneous data from that single sensor activated an anti stall system on the Lion Air flight, pushing the nose of the plane down shortly after take-off. This video can not be played Boeing 737 crashes: What went wrong? The evidence suggests that could also be the case for Ethiopian Airlines flight 302. The automatic system was also designed to reactivate repeatedly, so when the pilots on Lionair flight 610 pulled the nose of the plane back up, the stall mechanism kicked-in again, pushing the nose of each aircraft back down. Flight ET 302 also nose-dived repeatedly and, according to the preliminary report into the crash, the pilots followed Boeing's procedures and that was not enough to regain control of the aircraft. For Capt Brady, author of the 'Boeing 737 technical guide', this saga presents a long list of issues which need to be looked at. ""The level of automation of the aircraft, the behind the scenes systems, the risk analysis processes gone through at Boeing, the oversight by the regulator, the conversion training, the level of training generally, the manual flying skills of the crews. All of it needs to be reviewed in light of these accidents,"" he says. Multiple inquiries are underway. At least two lawsuits have been filed and more are likely. The latest of those two lawsuits has been filed by Ralph Nader. His niece's daughter, 24 year old Samya Stumo, who was working in the global health sector was one of 157 people killed on board flight ET 302. ""She had leadership written all over her, she had compassion in an intellectually rigorous way."" ""She was driven to save lives and we'll never know how many lives have been lost because she's not helping in a systemic way for the next 50 years."" Mr Nader ran several times for the US presidency, he's an experienced lawyer and has form at taking on big companies and is threatening to take legal action against Boeing. Last week a suit was filed in a Chicago federal court by the family of one of the victims of the Ethiopian crash, Jackson Musoni, a citizen of Rwanda. It alleges that Boeing had defectively designed the automated flight control system. Multiple investigations will pore over the certification of the Max and its new anti-stall system. According to one former test pilot at Boeing there were thousands of hours of flight time during the test programme which went on for more than a year. He says there will be ""terabytes of data"" from test flights which can now be examined. ""Nothing is done by a rogue pilot"", the former Boeing employee said. ""If anything we overkill, when going over things in group discussions."" Boeing says it will install an extra warning system in the 737 Max 8 and is revising the company's pilot training plans. But the sign-off process this time around will be more rigorous and aviation regulators from outside the US will be much more active in the process. The protocol of other regulators accepting the Federal Aviation Administration's judgement will not necessarily apply. Europe's Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, will, on this occasion, make up its own mind before the Max is deemed safe enough to fly again through European skies. With hundreds of 737-Maxs grounded worldwide and thousands of orders now on ice, with some of those possibly in jeopardy, the commercial impact of this episode is still evolving. Airlines whose aircraft remain grounded will want financial compensation. The potential bill for Boeing will grow exponentially if this drags into the summer months, when flight schedules and therefore cost implications suddenly increase. That said, Boeing is a commercial giant. ""Boeing has a large enough balance sheet. It won't really hit them"", says Peter Lemme, a former flight engineer at Boeing. But he believes Boeing's reputation ""is tarnished by this."" In his opinion, getting the Max back in the air won't be straight forward. ""There's a little bit of uncertainty now over what it will take to satisfy the regulators."" And in the world of aviation, everything comes down to safety. For Capt Chris Brady, an experienced 737 pilot, this is a watershed moment. ""It's the processes which are flawed,"" he says. ""It could apply to any manufacturer anywhere and I'm quite sure Airbus will be looking at their own processes in light of this and asking, could this happen to us?"" Boeing has insisted that safety has always been its number one priority.

"The diets cutting one in five lives shortIsraelis are some of the world's healthiest eaters, Uzbekistanis some of the least healthy, a report says.HealthComments","The food we eat is putting 11 million of us into an early grave each year, an influential study shows. The analysis, in the Lancet,,externalfound that our daily diet is a bigger killer than smoking and is now involved in one in five deaths around the world. Salt - whether in bread, soy sauce or processed meals - shortened the highest number of lives. Researchers say this study is not about obesity, but ""poor quality"" diets damaging hearts and causing cancer. The Global Burden of Disease Study is the most authoritative assessment of how people are dying in every country in the world. The latest analysis used estimates of countries' eating habits to pin down how often diet was shortening lives. The dangerous diets were those containing: Too much salt - three million deaths Too few whole grains - three million deaths Too little fruit - two million deaths Low levels of nuts, seeds, vegetables, omega-3 from seafood and fibre were the other major killers. ""We find that diet is one of the dominant drivers of health around the world, it's really quite profound,"" Prof Christopher Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington told the BBC. The lifesaving food 90% arenât eating enough of A bit of meat, a lot of veg - the flexitarian diet to feed 10bn Can a family learn to like the planetary health diet? About 10 million out of the 11 million diet-related deaths were because of cardiovascular disease and that explains why salt is such a problem. Too much salt raises blood pressure and that in turn raises the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Salt is popular with fish and chips Salt can also have a direct effect on the heart and blood vessels, leading to heart failure when the organ does not work effectively. Whole grains, fruit and vegetables have the opposite effect - they are ""cardioprotective"" and lower the risk of heart problems. Cancers and type 2 diabetes made up the rest of the diet-related deaths. No country is perfect and each favours some part of a healthy diet more than others, but this is how far the world is from an optimal diet. The healthy foods missing from the most diets around the world were nuts and seeds, according to the study. Eager readers will have noticedthey featured heavily in the planetary health diet, unveiled in January,to save lives, save the planet and feed 10 billion people. So why don't we munch them? Prof Nita Forouhi, from the University of Cambridge, said: ""The perception is they are little packs of energy that will make you fat, whereas they are packed full of good fats. ""And most people don't see them as mainstream food; and the other issue is cost."" Nuts - they are not just for squirrels. The huge fat versus sugar debate and the link between red and processed meats with cancer have attracted huge headlines in recent years. ""These can be harmful as we show, but they are much smaller issues than low whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetable intake,"" said Prof Murray. Although, the study did show too many fizzy drinks were being drunk in every corner of the world. The researchers say it is time for health campaigns to switch from talking about nutrients like fat and sugar and instead promote healthy foods. Bad diets are knocking a couple of years off life expectancies around the world, according to the researchers. But Prof Murray warns this is just the average and says the real question we should be asking is: ""Am I going to die in my 50s from a heart attack? Or am I going to have some of the diet-related cancers in my 40s?"" Mediterranean countries, particularly France, Spain and Israel, have some of the lowest numbers of diet-related deaths in the world. Countries in South East, Southern and Central Asia are at the opposite end of the spectrum. Israel has the lowest diet-related deaths - 89 per 100,000 people a year Uzbekistan has the highest diet-related deaths - 892 per 100,000 people a year Japan and China have curiously contrasting fortunes that reflect their changing relationship with salt. China consumes enormous amounts of salt with soy and other salty sauces being a key part of the country's cuisine. But the rising popularity of processed foods is introducing yet more salt to their diet. It has the highest death rate because of salt of any country. Prof Murray said: ""Japan is very interesting because if you go back 30 to 40 years, they like China today had enormous salt intake. ""Salt is still their number one problem, but it has come down dramatically, ""And they have a diet that is higher in many of the things we think are protective for heart disease such as vegetables and fruit."" Soy sauce is high in salt The UK is behind countries like France, Denmark and Belgium. The biggest problems are a lack of whole grains, fruit, vegetables and nuts and seeds. The study estimates 14% of UK deaths are related to diet, with 127 diet-related deaths per 100,000 people a year. Prof Murray said: ""Diet quality matters no matter what weight you are. ""The really big story for people to act on is increase your whole grains, fruit, nuts, seeds and vegetable intake and reduce salt if you can."" But money is an issue. It is estimated that having your five fruit and veg a day would take up 52% of household income in poorer countries. But Prof Forouhi warns: ""The public can make healthier choices if informed and have the resources, but if what is on the shelves as buy-one-get-one-free is always unhealthy, then that message will fall down. ""Cheaper options that are healthy are badly needed."" Both agreed there needed to be a shift from focusing on nutrients (fat/sugar/salt) and on to which actual foods people should eat.

Tesla shares sink as car deliveries drop,"Some of Tesla's Model 3 cars were delayed entering China Tesla's share price closed down 8.2% after the electric carmaker warned on profits following a 31% drop in vehicle deliveries during the first quarter. The firm blamed problems with shipments to Europe and China, where it began selling its Model 3 car for the first time. Total deliveries hit 63,000 in the three months to March, below analysts' forecasts which had already been cut. Tesla now expects quarterly profits to be ""negatively impacted"". The company encountered problems shipping the Model 3 to China in March after customs authorities suspended clearance because of misprinted labels on certain cars. Tesla also saw shipments disrupted in Europe following strike action at the port of Zeebrugge, where its vehicles are delivered before being distributed to a number of countries in the EU. Tesla chief executive Elon Musk Tesla said that it had only delivered half the entire quarter's vehicles by 21 March, and that 10,600 cars were still ""in transit"" at the end of the quarter. The carmaker's shares dropped nearly 9% in early trading in New York to $265.9 each. Analysts had expected Tesla to deliver 82,000 vehicles between January and March, but this was then reduced to 71,350. In the fourth quarter, Tesla delivered 90,700 cars. The Model 3 is key to Tesla's future. It is the company's lowest-priced car and Tesla is building a manufacturing site in China which will allow it to cut shipment costs. However, analysts were also spooked by a sharp fall in deliveries of Tesla's Model S and Model X vehicles. In the fourth quarter, Tesla delivered 13,500 Model S models and 14,050 Model Xs. But in the first quarter, that dropped to a combined 12,100 cars, which analysts at banking group RBC said was ""very disappointing"". Meanwhile, Elon Musk appeared in a Manhattan court where a federal judge urged the billionaire to settle contempt allegations by the US Securities and Exchange Commission over his use of Twitter. The SEC has asked that Mr Musk be held in contempt of court for allegedlyviolating an agreement,externalwhich restricted his use of social media to talk about Tesla. It followed a tweet last August by Mr Musk that he could take Tesla private for $420 per share. In a subsequent tweet, Mr Musk said he expected Tesla to produce 500,000 cars this year. At the hearing the SEC stopped well short of recommending Mr Musk's removal as chief executive or even from the electric car company's board. District Judge Alison Nathan gave both sides two weeks to work out their differences, and said she could rule on whether Mr Musk violated his recent fraud settlement with the regulator if they failed. Mr Musk declined to discuss the hearing as he left the courthouse, surrounded by a horde of reporters, photographers and television cameras, but said ""I feel very loved here"".

The pilot who changed gender at 58,"This video can not be played Elderly transgender people ""need specific help"" Captain Cat Burton always knew she wanted to be a pilot after her father took her in a jet fighter when she was just six months old. She also wanted to live her life as a woman but that dream took much longer to realise. Cat, who worked for British Airways for 45 years, said coming out as trans to her colleagues when she was 58 was the ""hardest thing she's ever done"". She is now calling for more training for doctors so that they are better able to deal with people who are transitioning, especially older people. Cat said she took four months off work, living permanently as a woman, before realising she could not go back as her ""old self"". ""I liken it to stepping off a cliff in pitch darkness - and then finding out the cliff is only two inches high,"" she said. ""The support I had from my colleagues was incredible. When I got back to work I was called in by my chief pilot, which is always a bit of a worry - he said he'd had a string of first officers in to talk about flying with me since I came back to work. ""They all said how much easier I was to fly with now! I was a grumpy old so-and-so as a male captain - I used to sit on my side of the aeroplane and basically cut myself off, whereas now it's a case of you can't stop me talking."" Funeral for transgender WW2 veteran Do we need more than two genders? She said living two separate lives - as the ""old her"" in work and as Cat in her personal life was challenging. ""It was daunting contemplating transitioning, I'd buried all my gender issues when I was 14,"" she said. ""I'd locked them away in a little box in the back of my brain and I would never open this box but something opened it quite late in life - and I realised you only live once."" Cat, from the Vale of Glamorgan, said that while she had a generally positive experience with her GP, the wait for services was frustrating. She said her GP managed her primary health care while she self-medicated with drugs she bought on the internet. Cat believes more doctors need to be trained in transgender issues - especially for those over the age of 50 - and that they should be able to prescribe the relevant hormones so people don't have to wait so long to transition. Cat Burton had a 45 year career at British Airways before retiring in 2017 Research by The Trans Ageing and Care (Trac) project also says GPs need more training. A new report by the academics in Swansea and Bristol is the first of its kind in Wales. It looks at the unique issues that face people who are trans and over the age of 50. It says that responses from healthcare professionals to older trans people were mixed and that some GPs were even transphobic. Advice: Gender dysphoria and transgender How three generations transitioned Trans vicar: 'People relate to people' Dr Christine Dobbs, from the Centre for Innovative Ageing at Swansea University, said that often trans patients had to give their GPs information, rather than the other way around. ""We also had instances when there was very poor treatment of people who were mis-gendered, dead named using their old name, even front of house being called out to the appointment using the male name and there were lots of sources of prejudice even to the point of behavioural differences so I would say discrimination as well,"" said Dr Dobbs. Dr Nimish Shah, transgender lead for the BMA's General Practitioners Committee Wales, agreed there needed to be more trans awareness training and education for doctors as well as nurses, social care staff and society generally. He said up until now, doctors had to refer transgender patients to London, with long waiting times. But, he said they are waiting for a new gender team, based in Cardiff, with teams based in each individual health board, alongside an ""enhanced service for general practitioners who wish to prescribe for trans patients who are going through hormonal changes"". He added: ""So, hopefully we're going to have a more local system and a system with shorter waiting times. I think it will also increase awareness of trans issues."" Cat, now 66, says she worries about what it means for trans people when they age - especially if that means becoming incapable, living in a care home or with dementia. She said there were particular issues to consider for the ageing trans population such as facial hair growth or hair loss. Cat Burton is now a flying instructor There might also be issues with trans people with dementia, who might only have strong memories of their younger selves in another gender. ""Somebody who's transgender and has gone past the ability to either afford or manage that situation is going to be in a care home and perhaps have no hair but they are still them,"" she said. ""Are they going to be treated with dignity if they're going to be sitting there with male pattern baldness but identifying as female? Are they going to have to wear some grotty National Health acrylic wig? The dignity issues are enormous. We have specific needs which most care homes would not appreciate until they've got transgender patients in large numbers."" The report makes five recommendations to improve services including training for health and social care professionals as well as agencies agreeing a benchmark statement on the level of care and support that trans and gender diverse individuals can expect.

Asos threatens to block serial returners,"Online fashion giant Asos has changed its returns policy. It is lengthening the time allowed for returns of unwanted items, but is threatening to investigate and ""take action"" if it notices anything unusual. It says if it suspects someone is actually wearing and returning goods or ordering and returning ""loads"", it might deactivate the account. Late last year, the company, the biggest online retailer in the UK, warned profits growth was slowing. Asos stocks more than 850 brands and ships all over the world. It said in November that ""unprecedented"" discounting had hit its trading, adding that cutting prices to match rivals had not shifted more clothes. Online shoppers tend to overorder as a rulebecause size and fit differs between brands and they have the time and space to experiment with potential purchases in their homes. The BBC spoke last year to a shopper who regularly ordered Â£400 worth of clothes and generally returned half of them. Adding to the returns pile is the ""snap and send back"" trend, whereby customers post pictures on social media of themselves in new outfits. Certain users do not like being seen in the same outfit twice, making it tempting to use an outfit once and return it. The company's note to customers, sent this week, states: ""If we notice an unusual pattern of returns activity that doesn't sit right: eg we suspect someone is actually wearing their purchases and then returning them or ordering and returning loads - way, waaay more than even the most loyal Asos customer would order - then we might have to deactivate the account and any associated accounts. ""If this happens to you and you think we've made a mistake, please get in touch with customer care and we'll be happy to discuss it with you. ""We also need to make sure our returns remain sustainable for us and for the environment, so if we notice an unusual pattern, we might investigate and take action. ""It's unlikely to affect you, but we wanted to give you a heads up (more deets below). Thanks for being a great Asos shopper!""

Stadium face-off for Ukraine rivals,"This video can not be played Comedian v president in rare stadium event Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has agreed to debate rival candidate Volodymyr Zelensky in a rare stadium event. The incumbent has also agreed to take a drug and alcohol test on Friday. A date has not yet been arranged for the televised face-off, which will take place in Kiev's Olympiyskiy Stadium. It comes days after Mr Zelensky, a comedian with no political experience, won the most votes in the first round of Ukraine's presidential elections. Mr Zelensky has since called for their debate to be moderated by Yulia Tymoshenko, Ukraine's former prime minister who polled third in this week's voting. President Poroshenko responded by telling Mr Zelensky to ""be a man"" and ""not hide anymore... I am waiting!"" What would a comic president mean? Ukraine comic leads presidential poll first round Mr Poroshenko had earlier challenged Mr Zelensky to a debate before the first wave of voting. The challenge was initially accepted but Mr Zelensky later backtracked on his pledge, a move which drew criticism on social media. The debate is to be held at Kiev's 70,000 capacity Olympiyskiy Stadium Then, on Wednesday, Mr Zelensky threw down the gauntlet in a slick social media video. ""You thought I'd run and hide.... no I'm not you in 2014,"" he said, accepting the challenge and giving Mr Poroshenko 24 hours to reply. The presidential hopeful also demanded the debate be held, in front of all interested broadcasters, at Olympiyskiy Stadium. The venue can hold up to 70,000 people. This video can not be played Mr Zelensky spoke to the BBC after the exit polls were announced On Thursday, Mr Poroshenko responded with his own, more sombre video, insisting that the stadium event not become a ""show"". ""There's no room for jokes here,"" said Mr Poroshenko. ""Being a president and supreme commander is not a game... it means being responsible for the people, for the country."" Both candidates have agreed to cover the costs,externalof the event, as set out by Ukraine's civil society watchdog Opora. By Jonah Fisher, Kiev Correspondent Mr Zelensky's unusual strategy of avoiding conventional political campaigning in favour of carefully calibrated social media videos has been working so far. And then he challenged President Poroshenko to a debate - clearly thinking there was no way he would agree, and this ""offer"" would deflect attention from his own reluctance to participate. He badly miscalculated. Mr Poroshenko has nothing to lose and would dearly love to lock horns with the inexperienced Mr Zelensky. Perhaps it's the only way he might turn things around. Mr Poroshenko called the comedian's bluff. Mr Zelensky's team started to panic. They declared the medical clinic unacceptable and suggested another one. Then Mr Zelensky made an even stranger suggestion, that the defeated third-place candidate from the first round, Yulia Tymoshenko, should moderate the debate. She and Mr Poroshenko have a longstanding rivalry, making the idea a complete non-starter as well as ridiculous. This ""stadium debate"" affair may turn out to be simply a disastrous episode on Mr Zelensky's path to the presidency. But it is very strange that a man who has spent the campaign trying to convince people that he's not just a comedian and can be serious, now appears to be trying to turn campaigning into a complete farce.

Seaside towns 'desperate for reinvention',"This video can not be played What's it like to be young and live in a coastal town? Seaside towns have been neglected for too long and are in desperate need of reinvention, a parliament report said. Young people in coastal communities are being ""let down and left behind"" by issues like transport, housing and post-16 education, the document said. The House of Lords' plan suggested solving problems in Blackpool could prove key in tackling issues at bucket and spade resorts across England. ""If you can solve it there you can solve it anywhere,"" the report said. A single solution does not exist but if national and local government work together seaside towns could ""once again become prosperous and desirable places to live in and visit"", it said. Neil Jack, chief executive of Blackpool Council, said: ""We know from experience that with the right sort of interventions, we can create a vibrant destination."" The British seaside has been ""perceived as a sort of national embarrassment"" and deserves attention, theHouse of Lords select committee on regenerating seaside towns,externalfound. But places like Brighton and Bournemouth have shown the seaside can successfully reinvent itself, according to committee chairman Lord Bassam of Brighton. Russell Turner, 59 and Lorraine Turner, 60, who live in Bexhill-on-Sea on the East Sussex coast, said trains to London, Eastbourne or Brighton needed to be improved. ""It should be feasible to work in Brighton but you need to allow yourself a good hour, hour and a half [to get there] and that's with clear traffic,"" said Mrs Turner. The report said solving problems in Blackpool could help tackle issues at other coastal towns The report said limited access to further and higher education was ""severely curtailing opportunities and denting aspirations"" for young people in some coastal areas. The committee's solution was for the government to create partnerships between colleges and universities and local employers. Mr Turner said establishing a university would lower the town's average age and could also boost the restaurant and bar industry. ""But you would probably upset some of the older residents,"" he said. Fellow Bexhill resident Melanie Glass said the town ""needed a heart"". ""If you go to somewhere like Brighton or Hastings...there's things people want to go and see and do there,"" Ms Glass said. ""There's quite a cafÃ© and restaurant culture here but in terms of shopping there isn't really anything that entices you in."" What are English seaside resorts really like? Seaside towns: Your photos Scarborough: The enduring appeal of the English seaside The geography of coastal towns meant many communities felt ""at the end of the line"", according to the report. But it said this could be overcome by rolling out high-speed broadband. Existing housing should be regenerated and new builds should be of better quality, while improvements to the coastal transport network should also be prioritised, the committee said. Grimsby has received Â£67m to improve the dock area and to create thousands of jobs and homes The committee said it ""strongly supported"" aÂ£67m town deal piloted in Grimsbyto create 10,000 homes and create 8,000 jobs by 2032. An expansion of a similar town deal for Blackpool had been discussed and ministers thought that type of scheme could particularly ""lend itself to coastal towns"", the report said. When counting the number of visitor nights spent in seaside resorts, Blackpool ranked top by some distance followed by Brighton and Bournemouth, it found. Blackpool had been working hard to turn around its fortunes, with a revamped seafront, investment in its trams, a newly electrified direct rail link to London and investment in hotels. But the town suffered serious deprivation and the focus on developing tourism may have hindered regeneration efforts, the report found. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it was investing Â£36m in coastal communities. A spokeswoman said the department would ""carefully consider the committee's recommendations"". Young, on the coast and cut off.

JD Sports buys Oasis singer's fashion brand,"Pretty Green, the fashion brand founded by Liam Gallagher, has been rescued from administration by JD Sports. JD Sports will keep the flagship store in Manchester open, but 11 other stores and 33 concessions in House of Fraser will close, putting 97 jobs at risk.

"JK Rowling's PA to pay back fraud moneyThe 35-year-old must pay Â£18,734 back to the Harry Potter author after fraudulently using her credit card.Edinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","Amanda Donaldson must pay Â£18,734 to JK Rowling with interest A former personal assistant to JK Rowling has been ordered to pay almost Â£19,000 to the Harry Potter author after fraudulently using her credit card. Amanda Donaldson, 35, from Coatbridge in North Lanarkshire, must pay Â£18,734 back with interest. The author pursued damages in a civil case at Airdrie Sheriff Court under her married name Joanne Murray. She said the money would be donated to her charity Lumos. Donaldson was dismissed from her job in Ms Rowling's Edinburgh office in 2017 over the incident. JK Rowling PA denies 'ridiculous' spending JK Rowling 'generous but unapproachable' JK Rowling's former PA was 'good liar' Sheriff Derek O'Carroll found Donaldson used a business credit card to purchase goods and withdraw money which were for her own use. He also found that she used Ms Rowling's business bank accounts to buy foreign currency which she kept for herself. The amount she has been ordered to repay includes Â£1,160 for cash withdrawals, Â£9,832 for point-of-sale purchases and Â£7,742 on foreign currency. However the sheriff said there was not enough evidence to prove Donaldson was responsible for a quantity of Harry Potter merchandise going missing. After the publication of the judgement, a statement issued on behalf of Ms Rowling said she was ""pleased"" with the ruling. It added: ""From the outset Ms Rowling made it clear that the decision to take this matter to court was a last resort and not for her personal benefit, but rather to protect the reputation of her existing staff, and to make sure Ms Donaldson is not in a position to breach the trust of another employer. ""Terms of the recovery will be decided in due course, and the money owed will be donated to JK Rowling's charity Lumos."" JK Rowling hired Amanda Donaldson to help organise her business and personal matters. During the court case, Donaldson accepted she had no entitlement to use the business credit card or bank accounts for her own benefit. However, she denied any form of fraud or dishonesty, contending that every transaction was for the business use or the personal benefit of Ms Rowling, and it was all authorised. She contended that every foreign currency purchase was authorised and was spent during foreign trips by Ms Rowling, her family and security staff or was retained by the writer or her family with a very limited amount left over. She denied any responsibility for missing Harry Potter merchandise. The judgement,externalconcluded: ""The sheriff accepted the evidence of the pursuer, her husband and her other witnesses as entirely credible and reliable. ""By contrast, the sheriff did not accept the defender's evidence as either credible or reliable. He found that her evidence was a conscious fabrication.""

Judge warns US actresses in college scamThose accused as part of an admissions scandal are told to be wary of discussing it with their children.,"Lori Loughlin (L) is charged with her husband Mossimo Giannulli (R) Parents including two US actresses accused in a college admissions scandal have been told to be careful while discussing it with their children. A judge told defendants, including Felicity Huffman and Lori Loughlin, they should take care not to obstruct justice during family discussions. Prosecutors had wanted the wealthy parents to require a lawyer present. The first group of parents accused of paying $25m (Â£19m) in bribes appeared in Boston federal court on Wednesday. The elaborate scheme, which aimed to acquire places for children at elite US universities, was revealed by federal investigators last month. In total 50 people, including 33 parents and college athletic coaches, have been charged. The first 13 parents involved in the scandal appeared in court on Wednesday. They were told their legal rights, charges against them and possible penalties for the alleged crimes. During the hearing, US Magistrate Judge M Page Kelley imposed conditions on all the defendants' bail, ordering them to surrender their passports and not to have firearms in their homes. Prosecutors had wanted the accused banned from discussing the charges with their children. ""The kids in these cases are witnesses and this could raise obstruction of justice issues,"" prosecutor Eric Rosen argued in court. Felicity Huffman's husband, William H Macy, has not been charged But Judge Kelley said: ""I just don't think that's realistic."" She did, however, recommend the accused seek legal advice about any such family discussions so as to avoid the risk of interfering with the case. Some of the parents charged in the scheme have started plea negotiations with prosecutors. On Wednesday, packaged food entrepreneur Peter Sartorio became the first to say he will plead guilty. Ex-Yale coach pleads guilty in college scam Celebrity parents and the bizarre 'cheating' scandal The extreme lengths parents go to for college admissions Desperate Housewives star Ms Huffman, 56, did not speak as she left the court. Ms Loughlin, 54, an actor in US sitcom Full House, signed autographs for fans outside. Fans outside the court cheered when Ms Loughlin arrived in a black van Mackenzie Thomas and Vivi Bonomie hold signs while actress Lori Loughlin attends court The FBI code-named the investigation ""Operation Varsity Blues"" - ironically named after a 1990s film about the pressures of sports scholarships. The case relates to the period between 2011 and 2018, when investigators say parents tried to cheat the usual US admission process. They say parents paid bribes, had exams altered and even had their children edited onto stock photos to pretend they played sports. The US actresses are the most high-profile indictments, but others charged include prominent business executives. Ms Loughlin is accused along with her husband of paying nearly $500,000 in bribes to get their two daughters admitted to University of Southern California. Investigators say they helped them get in on rowing scholarships, even though neither student had actually participated in the sport. Spotlight on Loughlin's daughters after college probe Students react to college cheating scam Ms Huffman is accused of paying $15,000 to William ""Rick"" Singer - the confessed mastermind of the alleged scam - to have her daughter's exam answers covertly corrected in 2017. This video can not be played How US university admissions are broken Neither actress entered a plea, but both said they understood the charges against them. The pair have not commented publicly since the scandal. None of the students has been charged by investigators. The FBI said that some were kept in the dark about the lengths that their parents were secretly going to. The University of Southern California (USC) has said it will deny all applicants linked to the scam and is reviewing ""case-by-case"" those implicated who were already admitted or have graduated. One student, who was studying at Yale University, has already had their admission revokedover an alleged $1.2m (Â£907,000) bribe uncovered by the FBI probe. Parents going to extreme lengths to boost their children's academic success is not a uniquely US phenomenon. In China, parents have protested against the measures imposed to stop their children from cheating in notoriously difficult university entrance exams. Around 2,000 parents took to the streets in Hubei province in 2013 to demonstrate against enhanced anti-cheating measures. The protests werepart of a broader debate,externalabout the level of corruption in Chinese society, and the perception that cheating was so common that not doing so would put children at a disadvantage. In 2016, photos emerged showing parents scaling the walls of a school in India's Bihar state to pass notes to their children inside during exams. The photos led to the arrest of around 300 people, mostly parents and close relatives, after the images were shown in local media.

Missing SPF on eyelids a 'cancer risk',"Failing to apply moisturiser with sun protection factor (SPF) and sunscreen properly to the face, particularly around eyes, could be putting people at risk of skin cancer, a study suggests. Researchers found differences in the way people applied sunscreen and SPF moisturiser. More skin is missed with moisturiser - especially the eyelids, where the skin is thin and more vulnerable to cancer. Sunglasses with UV filters can help protect missed areas, the experts said. Many moisturisers are sold with SPFs of 30-50, similar to the level of traditional sunscreens, but they are not intended to be a replacement for sunscreen if spending long periods of time outdoors in the summer. The research team at the University of Liverpool studied how 84 people (62 women and 22 men) put on both moisturiser and sunscreen, then took photos with a UV-sensitive camera showing how well they had covered their faces. The researchers found that nearly 17% of the face was missed with SPF moisturiser compared with 11% for sunscreen. And there was 21% lower coverage of the area around the eyelids with moisturiser and 14% with sunscreen, the study inPLOS One,externalfound. A face photographed with a conventional camera, a UV sensitive camera, with sunscreen applied and moisturiser applied These are the areas most vulnerable to skin cancer, but people were unaware they had not covered them, said Austin McCormick, study author and consultant ophthalmic and oculoplastic surgeon, from Aintree University Hospital Trust. ""The eyelid skin is very thin and this puts it at risk of UV damage,"" he said. ""The area around the eyelashes and between the eyelids and the nose is least likely to be covered."" How does sunscreen work? Are you applying sun cream properly? Warning over suntan lotion application Sun cream: 'It takes two to do it properly' Mr McCormick said that eyelid cancers accounted for 10% of all basal cell carcinomas in the UK, the most common type of skin cancer, so people should pay particular attention to the eyelid area when putting on any SPF cream. Moisturiser may be used more sparingly because it is often expensive, sold in smaller amounts and is seen as a ""precious cream"", he said. ""If planning prolonged sun exposure, we advise sunscreen be used. ""If using moisturiser, we advise one with SPF: any SPF is better than none, but it should not be considered the equal of sunscreen,"" Mr McCormick said. Holly Barber, from the British Association of Dermatologists, said the formulas in SPF moisturisers were less likely to be rub-resistant and water-resistant if applied more thinly. But she said it was surprising that people were not more hesitant to apply sunscreen around the eyes - because it can make them sting. ""A good way to avoid problems such as sunburn in areas missed when applying sun protection is to make use of protective clothing such as sun hats and sunglasses, as well as reapplying regularly,"" she said. This video can not be played Are you applying sun cream properly? Sunscreen is really only necessary when planning to spend half an hour or more in summer sunshine. If you are just popping out at lunchtime it is unlikely that you will need sunscreen, especially if you applied a moisturiser with SPF that morning or are in and out of the shade of buildings and trees. They are fine for offering some protection if you are going out briefly. But if you intend spending some time outdoors, especially between April and September, then sunscreens are much more effective. Moisturisers providing SPF do not bind as well to the skin as sunscreen, and so are not intended to provide adequate protection for extended periods in the sun. In the winter months, UV protection in the UK is not necessary - except in people who are abnormally sensitive to sunlight. We all need some sun exposure, which provides us with important vitamin D. However, this has to be balanced with the risk of skin damage in hotter months. This is not directly related to how hot it is, but to the UV index. Although this is generally higher on cloudless, hot days than on cloudy, cool days, you should not rely on temperature alone as a guide to the need for sun protection.

SNP MSP Sandra White says there has been very intensive work done on a responsible transport bill that is now being incorporated in the Transport Bill. Ms White adds blocking kerbs being adopted in the Transport Bill is fantastic. She points out selfish parking on pavements can lead to blind people being stranded for hours or parents The SNP MSP says: ""People have to come first before cars. ""Pavements are for people, we have roads for cars."" Ms White originally proposed legislation making it illegal for vehicles to double park, which gained unanimous support before the 2016 elections. The Scottish government has defended plans that could see motorists taxed for parking at work amid claims that it will ""fleece"" workers for hundreds of pounds a year. Proposals for a workplace parking levy were included in this year's budget agreement between the SNP and Greens. Deputy First Minister John Swinney told MSPs that it would be up to individual councils whether to introduce it. The Conservatives said the tax would hit low-paid workers the hardest. Read more here. Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles Beginning with low emission zones, Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles says before introducing them sufficient public transport options must be in place. While the government agrees with this, it essentially says to local authorities ""over to you"" on doing it, he suggests. The government has not been ambitious with this bill on bus services the Lib Dem says and he adds he can't see any local authorities taking up what is offered. Mr Rumbles welcomes a ban on pavement parking but expresses concerns about exemptions, suggesting it provides a ""get out clause"" for unloading. It will make the ban ""hopeless ineffective"", he argues. Wrapping up the Lib Dem MSP criticises the workplace parking levy and worries the amendment, which has not yet been seen, will be voted through regardless of any evidence against it due to the balance of parties on the committee.

John Finnie says the Scottish Greens will back the principles of the Transport Bill at decision time. He does say there is no sense of crusading from the Scottish government, arguing it is too conservative. The Green MSP says the market stall prevails in terms of bus transport, it will be private profit with councils only able to pick up the scraps. He praises Lothian Buses which is run by the council to the benefit of the people of Edinburgh. Mr Finnie concludes saying the bill lacks ambition and must be amended. Allow Twitter content?

Green MSP John Finnie highlights Labour supported a parking levy in its manifestos for Glasgow and Edinburgh council elections. Mr Smyth says his concern is that people living in areas outside of Edinburgh but who work in Edinburgh will have to pay the tax. They won't have a say on whether it is introduced nor will any of the revenue be spent on public transport outside of the city, he explains. It is an attack on the take home pay of workers, Mr Smyth argues. It will allow higher earners to ""pay to pollute,"" he says. Labour MSP Colin Smyth says councils should be able to properly regulate transport with an integrated system for tickets. You can imagine these things but this ""timid"" bill will deliver none of them, adds the Labour MSP. He criticises the legislation in terms of LEZs, parking on pavement exemptions and bus services. The Labour MSP points out there has been a larger fall in bus patronage than in the rest of the UK. He argues the cuts to council budgets are behind this, as they have led to cuts to bus services. This bill does not end Margaret Thatcher's ban on councils running bus services, he argues. I don't think the top down method this bill is taking is the right way to go, Mr Greene states. Local authorities know their communities and their streets best, and they should be empowered he states. The Tory MSP insists the workplace parking levy should have been brought to the rural economy committee in stage 1 to allow it to scrutinise it. He says his party ""will oppose it at every stage of the proceedings"", labeling it a regressive tax on the workforce. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I think there is a role for local bus franchising,"" says Mr Greene. He regrets the bill only allows this where there is an unmet need. The Tory MSP argues there are so many unanswered questions, with the main one being: does the bill go far enough? He says the lack of an interconnected ticketing system shows the government has missed a trick. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tory MSP Jamie Greene Tory MSP Jamie Greene says that in many areas, the bill does not go far enough and instead ""tinkers"" with existing legislation. There is little which proposes a dramatic improvement of buses, railways, ferries or roads he argues. Turning to low emission zones, he says businesses are concerned about operating in the zones and we should listen to them. Mr Greene points to the high cost of an electric taxi as an example. We'd like to see a clear timetable for introduction of LEZs and phased transitions, he says. The Tory MSP also expresses concern that it will lead to disabled people have to pay to get into cities because their only option is to drive. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Mountain says on smart ticketing, the committee felt the government lack ambition to introduce an integrated transport system. This would require a single ticketing system across all forms of transport, which the government has robustly resisted, he explains. The Tory MSP doubts any tangible progress will be made. He pivots to pavement parking, calling on the government to bring an amendment at stage 2 to remove exemptions presenting impracticable. Further parking prohibitions could increase accessibility to urban areas, he says. In conclusion he says the committee back the general principles of the bill, with the caveat it needs improving.

Judge warns US actresses in college scamThose accused as part of an admissions scandal are told to be wary of discussing it with their children.US & Canada,"Lori Loughlin (L) is charged with her husband Mossimo Giannulli (R) Parents including two US actresses accused in a college admissions scandal have been told to be careful while discussing it with their children.

Spotlight on Loughlin's daughters after college probe Students react to college cheating scam Ms Huffman is accused of paying $15,000 to William ""Rick"" Singer - the confessed mastermind of the alleged scam - to have her daughter's exam answers covertly corrected in 2017. This video can not be played How US university admissions are broken Neither actress entered a plea, but both said they understood the charges against them. The pair have not commented publicly since the scandal. None of the students has been charged by investigators. The FBI said that some were kept in the dark about the lengths that their parents were secretly going to. The University of Southern California (USC) has said it will deny all applicants linked to the scam and is reviewing ""case-by-case"" those implicated who were already admitted or have graduated. One student, who was studying at Yale University, has already had their admission revokedover an alleged $1.2m (Â£907,000) bribe uncovered by the FBI probe. Parents going to extreme lengths to boost their children's academic success is not a uniquely US phenomenon. In China, parents have protested against the measures imposed to stop their children from cheating in notoriously difficult university entrance exams. Around 2,000 parents took to the streets in Hubei province in 2013 to demonstrate against enhanced anti-cheating measures. The protests werepart of a broader debate,externalabout the level of corruption in Chinese society, and the perception that cheating was so common that not doing so would put children at a disadvantage. In 2016, photos emerged showing parents scaling the walls of a school in India's Bihar state to pass notes to their children inside during exams. The photos led to the arrest of around 300 people, mostly parents and close relatives, after the images were shown in local media.

MPs back Brexit delay bill by one vote,"This video can not be played Former Labour minister Yvette Cooper's bill passed by 313 votes to 312 MPs have voted by a majority of one to force the prime minister to ask for an extension to the Brexit process, in a bid to avoid a no-deal scenario. Labour's Yvette Cooper led the move, which the Commons passed in one day. The bill is due to be considered by the Lords later and will need its approval to become law, but it is the EU which decides whether to grant an extension. It comes as talks between Conservative and Labour teams to end the Brexit deadlock continue. Discussions between Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesdaywere described as ""constructive"", but were criticised by MPs in both parties. How would another Brexit delay work? What are the Brexit sticking points? Can you have frictionless trade in a customs union? How did my MP vote on Brexit delay bill? Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told MPs he would hope the Lords would ""scrutinise this bill passed in haste with its constitutional flaws"". He added that there was ""no guarantee"" that the UK will not take part in the European elections in May and to participate would be a ""betrayal"" and ""inflict untold damage"". This video can not be played 'No guarantee' UK won't fight EU elections Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond has suggested that he expects Brussels to insist on a lengthy delay to Brexit. He also described a public vote to approve any final deal as ""a perfectly credible proposition"". But Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4 Today he was ""very strongly against"" a public vote and he would not want to see a long extension to the Brexit process. Ms Cooper's attempts to prevent a no-deal departure from the EU passed by 313 votes to 312. The draft legislation would force the prime minister to ask the EU for an extension to the Article 50 process beyond 12 April - and would give Parliament the power to decide the length of this delay to be requested. Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP  Tory Brexiteers expressed frustration at the unusual process of a backbench bill clearing all stages in the Commons in a matter of hours, rather than months. Mark Francois said: ""It's difficult to argue that you've had an extremely considered debate when you've rammed the bill through the House of Commons in barely four hours. That is not a considered debate, that is a constitutional outrage."" The government's attempt to limit the bill's powers resulted in a 180-vote defeat - the second biggest defeat for a government in modern times. Responding to the Commons vote, the government said the bill would place a ""severe constraint"" on its ability to negotiate an extension to the Brexit deadline before 12 April, the date the UK is due to exit. It comes as talks between government negotiators and Labour continue throughout Thursday after Mrs May and Mr Corbyn agreed a ""programme of work"". A No 10 spokesman said on Wednesday that both parties showed ""flexibility"" and ""a commitment to bring the... uncertainty to a close"". Mr Corbyn said the meeting was ""useful, but inconclusive"", adding there had not been ""as much change as [he] had expected"" in the PM's position. The prime minister wants to agree a policy with the Labour leader for MPs to vote on before 10 April - when the EU will hold an emergency summit on Brexit. But if they cannot reach a consensus, she has pledged to allow MPs to vote on a number of options, including the withdrawal agreement she has negotiated with the EU, which has already been rejected three times by MPs. In either event, Mrs May said she would ask the EU for a further short extension to Brexit in the hope of getting an agreement passed by Parliament before 22 May, so that the UK does not have to take part in European elections. This video can not be played Corbyn: May meeting ""useful but inconclusive"" The cross-party talks have provoked strong criticism from MPs in both parties, with two ministers resigning on Wednesday. Chris Heaton-Harris quit on Wednesday,externalafternoon, claiming his job at the Department for Exiting the European Union had become ""irrelevant"" if the government is not prepared to leave without a deal. Wales Minister Nigel Adams also resigned, saying the government was at risk of failing to deliver ""the Brexit people voted for"". Reports in papers includingthe Sun,externalsuggest as many as 15 more - including several cabinet ministers - could follow if Mrs May strayed too far from previous commitments. Among her ""red lines"" was leaving the EU's customs union, which allows goods to move between member states without being subject to tariffs. It also imposes the same tariffs on goods from outside countries. Labour wants a new permanent customs union with the EU, while Northern Ireland'sDemocratic Unionist Party - which has propped up Mrs May's government - indicated on Wednesday that it could support the idea. In an interview on ITV's Peston programme, Mr Hammond said that - while the Conservative manifesto had pledged to leave the EU customs union - ""some kind of customs arrangement"" was always going to be part of the future structure. Critics say remaining part of a European customs union would stop the UK negotiating its own trade agreements with the rest of the world. May and Corbyn: Brexit talks 'constructive' Sturgeon warns about 'bad Brexit compromise' Merkel to visit Dublin for Brexit talks Mr Corbyn is coming under pressure from senior colleagues in his party to make a further referendum a condition of signing up to any agreement. Demanding the shadow cabinet hold a vote on the issue, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said not backing a confirmatory vote would be a ""breach"" of the policy agreed by party members at its last conference. The party's deputy leader, Tom Watson, told the Peston programme that Labour members would ""find it unforgiveable"" for ""us to sign off on Theresa May's deal without a concession that involves the people"". However, party chairman Ian Lavery is reported to have warned against the idea, arguing that it could split the party. European leaders will continue deciding how to respond to Brexit, with Ireland's prime minister, Leo Varadkar, hosting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Dublin later. The UK has until 12 April to propose a plan to the EU - which must be accepted by the bloc - or it will leave without a deal on that date.

Brexit cross-party talks enter second day,"Labour's Sir Keir Starmer told reporters: ""We will be having further discussions with the government"" Talks between Conservative and Labour teams have taken place for a second day, in a bid to end Brexit deadlock. The discussions, which lasted 4.5 hours, were described as ""detailed and productive"" by the government. Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer said earlier that the idea of a ""confirmatory"" referendum on any Brexit deal would be discussed. MPs backed a bill on Wednesday which would force the PM to seek a new delay to Brexit. The House of Lords are debating it in general terms -  but detailed line-by-line scrutiny, when they will have the chance to propose changes to the bill, will not take place until Monday. Will Labour push for a public vote? How would another Brexit delay work? What are the Brexit sticking points? Merkel visiting Dublin for Brexit talks Leaving the cross-party talks, Sir Keir did not answer questions about what had been discussed, telling reporters: ""We have had further discussions and we will be having further discussions with the government."" A Labour spokesman said the talks ""are continuing and the teams are planning to meet again"". A Downing Street spokesman said: ""Today both sets of negotiating teams met for four and a half hours of detailed and productive technical talks in the Cabinet Office, supported by the civil service."" The talks were attended on the Labour side by shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey. The government's negotiating team was senior cabinet minister David Lidington, Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay, chief whip Julian Smith, Business Secretary Greg Clark and Gavin Barwell - the prime minister's chief of staff. Thursday's meeting followed discussions between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday. Friday:More talks between Labour and the government expected to take place Wednesday 10 April:Emergency summit of EU leaders to consider any UK request for further extension Friday 12 April:Brexit day, if UK does not seek - or the EU does not grant - further delay The UK is due to leave the EU on 12 April, and as yet, no withdrawal deal is in place. But ministers have warned that the backbench bill - put forward by Labour's Yvette Cooper - could increase ""the risk of an accidental no-deal"". No 10 says Ms Cooper's bill, passed by the Commons with a majority of one vote on Wednesday, would deny the PM the power to agree a deal with EU leaders on April 10, as MPs would have to agree to any new Brexit date. Any Brexit delay will require the unanimous backing of all 28 EU leaders at a summit next Wednesday. If they agree - but suggest a different date to the one backed by MPs - the prime minister would have to bring it back to the Commons for further approval on Thursday 11 April. ""By April 11, the European Council will have concluded and the leaders will have returned to their member states. In the words of the secretary of state, the bill could increase the risk of an accidental no-deal exit,"" the prime minister's spokesman said. The main item of business in the last frantic 24 hours has been the cross-party talks between the Conservatives and the Labour Party. From both sides, it sounds like they are serious and genuine, and negotiators got into the guts of both their positions and technical details on Thursday. Remember, behind the scenes there isn't as much difference between the two sides' versions of Brexit as the hue and cry of Parliament implies. But the political, not the policy, distance between the two is plainly enormous. Read more from Laura The backbench bill, which was steered through the Commons in one day, will need the approval of the House of Lords if it is to become law. Peers were expected to sit late into the night on Thursday as they hold their second reading debate on the bill. The government's chief whip in the Lords, Lord Taylor said: ""The proceedings on Monday the 8th should be concluded in a timely fashion to allow the House of Commons to consider any amendments made by this House."" It is the EU which decides whether to grant an extension, and German ChancellorAngela Merkel has met Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar for talks in Dublin. Mr Varadkar said any further extension ""must require and must have a credible and realistic way forward"". Mrs Merkel said she still hoped for an ""orderly Brexit"" adding: ""I can say this from the German side - we will do everything in order to prevent a no-deal Brexit; Britain crashing out of the European Union. ""But we have to do this together with Britain and with their position that they will present to us."" Labour chair offered to quit over Brexit May and Corbyn: Brexit talks 'constructive' Sturgeon warns about 'bad Brexit compromise' 'I can't sleep because of Brexit' Shadow Treasury minister Clive Lewis told BBC Radio 4's World at One that Labour would not be talking to the government if a ""confirmatory referendum"" wasn't an option. But it has emerged that party chairman Ian Laveryoffered to quit the shadow cabinet, after twice defying orders to vote in favour of another referendum. And 25 Labour MPs - including former minister Caroline Flint and a number MPs for Leave-voting seats in the North and Midlands - have written to Jeremy Corbyn, saying another referendum should not be included in any compromise Brexit deal. This video can not be played 'No guarantee' UK won't fight EU elections Meanwhile, Downing Street has announced a series of ministerial appointments, to replace ministers who quit over the government's Brexit strategy and Brexit votes. Among them, party deputy chairman James Cleverly has been made a Brexit minister; Justin Tomlinson has been appointed as a minister in the Department for Work and Pensions; and Seema Kennedy has been made a health minister.

"Turkey's rulers are bad losers, says election 'winner'","This video can not be played Ekrem Imamoglu says the AK Party's conduct is impolite Istanbul is currently a city of parallel realities. In daily press conferences - and on his Twitter biography - Ekrem Imamoglu of the opposition CHP party says he's the new mayor. Preliminary results from the election board show he won the local election here last weekend by some 25,000 votes. But across the city the ruling AK Party has put up victory posters, with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and candidate Binali Yildirim thanking Istanbul for the win. The government has challenged the Istanbul results and ordered recounts. Although it won most votes across Turkey, it lost the capital city of Ankara, and Izmir. The AKP is also contesting the CHP victory in Ankara. Erdogan disputes Turkey poll results in big cities Why Erdogan's big ambitions could come tumbling down President Erdogan, it seems, is not ready to let go of Istanbul - Turkey's economic powerhouse and his home city, which he himself once ran as mayor. ""It's not polite behaviour,"" Ekrem Imamoglu said of the AK Party posters. ""We have the results from the electoral board and we know who is in the lead,"" he told me in a BBC interview. AK Party posters have gone up across the city saying ""Thank you Istanbul"" The AK Party says invalid votes across polling stations have jeopardised the result, calling it ""the biggest stain in Turkish democratic history"". ""Of course I don't agree,"" says Mr Imamoglu. ""Up until yesterday, the government and the ruling party were claiming that Turkey had the most credible voting system and they were giving it the highest praise. One million people were on duty at polling stations that night. ""If there was any suspicious activity, they would record it and make a written report - that's the official procedure here. ""Now the only explanation I have is that they are making excuses for their failure."" The challenge by the government has led to allegations of hypocrisy. It denied the opposition the right to challenge the disputed local election result in Ankara in 2014. And in the 2017 referendum on changing Turkey's political system to favour President Erdogan, the state-run election board ruled during counting that unstamped ballot papers would be accepted. Opposition CHP supporters held a rally on Tuesday to celebrate what they are adamant is victory in Istanbul Opposition parties again cried foul - but were quickly shouted down by the government. The loss of Ankara, Istanbul and several other cities would be a serious blow to Mr Erdogan and could be a turning point after 16 years of his rule. So is it, I ask Ekrem Imamoglu, the beginning of the end of the president's hold on power. ""Everything comes to an end,"" he replies. ""Parties, governments, life itself. Mr Erdogan has finished his 17th year in power. There are problems and things we don't like - but it's a political success. Of course there will be an end to it one day."" The CHP's apparent success in Istanbul and Ankara has rejuvenated the opposition long written off as moribund and fractured. And it has broken Mr Erdogan's aura of invincibility. Is Ekrem Imamoglu, I ask, the next president of Turkey. ""God knows,"" he says with a chuckle. We know who's winning - Turkey opposition.

"Civil servants offered Brexit counsellingThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs spent ÃÂ£40k to provide support for staff.","British civil servants were offered specialised support to deal with the strain of preparing for a no-deal Brexit, the BBC has learned. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spent Â£40,000 on counselling services in London, York and Bristol. The surgeries were primarily for those working on ""emergency preparedness in case of a no deal scenario"". The government said the well-being of its staff was ""always a priority"". The three-month contract, which was awarded to Gloucester-based employee assistance firm Care First, was brought to the BBC's attention by the data firm Tussell. It was designed to bolster Defra's in-house mental health services while the department made changes to its support programmes, and ended on 31 January. A Defra spokesperson told the BBC that the department was committed to the mental health, safety and well-being of its employees, and had ""a range of services on offer to support staff's mental health"". A spokeswoman for the Charity for Civil Servants, which has been offering a ""Brexit well-being kit"" to government employees, told the BBC that it was responding to ""the impact that current pressures are having on the mental health and well-being of civil servants"". Michael Gove's department has awarded several Brexit-related contracts Last year, the Civil Service announcedit had trained 2,200 staff to be ""Mental Health First Aiders"".,external With responsibility for food and water, animal movements and waste strategies, Defra is one of the Whitehall departments with the largest no-deal Brexit workload. More than 1,300 employees have been recruited to assist with its contingency preparations. In February, analysis by Tussell found that Defra had awarded 19 Brexit-related contracts to professional services firms - the highest number among government departments. One agreement, worth Â£15,000, was awarded to help the department to assess ""the impact of Brexit on the milling wheat and malting barley supply chain"". In January, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who is in charge of Defra, warned that farmers and food producers would face ""considerable turbulence"" if the UK left the EU without a deal. He told the Oxford Farming Conference it was a ""grim and inescapable fact"" there would be tariffs on exports and new sanitary and other border checks.

"Don't inflame Brexit tensions, police warnPoliticians and campaigners should take care not to ""inflame"" tensions around Brexit, a police chief says.","Police lined up outside the House of Commons in Parliament Square Politicians and campaigners should take care not to ""inflame"" tensions in the UK caused by Brexit, a senior police chief has warned. Chairman of the National Police Chief Council (NPCC), Martin Hewitt, said people should think carefully to avoid inciting others to violence. Police have 10,000 officers ready to deploy at 24 hours' notice as part of possible no-deal Brexit preparations. However, police chiefs said the measures were only a precaution. Mr Hewitt said the NPCC was preparing for the ""worst case scenario"" and was not predicting major problems. Chief Constable Charlie Hall, the NPCC lead for operations, also said there was no intelligence to suggest there would be a rise in crime or disorder because of Brexit, although forces were ""prepared to respond to any issues that may arise"". What preparations are being made for a no-deal? Brexit: A really simple guide The warnings follow increased concern about intimidation of MPs. Mr Hewitt said the UK was in ""an incredibly febrile atmosphere"" as a result of the debate over leaving the EU and there was a lot of ""angry talk"" on social media. He said: ""I think there is a responsibility on those individuals that have a platform and have a voice to communicate in a way that is temperate and is not in any way going to inflame people's views."" Officers in charge of policing Parliament said they had seen an increase in abuse aimed at politicians and several MPs have requested increased security. Only a small number of crimes have been linked directly to Brexit, police said, with about half being malicious communications, while the rest included verbal abuse, harassment and offences committed during protests. But hate crimes remain higher than before the 2016 EU referendum. In 2017-18, there were 94,098 hate crimes recorded, a 17% rise that is thought to have also been fuelled by the terror attacks in London and Manchester. After warnings of disruptions at the border and to food supply chainsif the UK leaves without a deal, police said they had plans to deal with incidents such as problems on the roads, major protests or even rioting and looting. This video can not be played Anna Soubry: ""This is astonishing. This is what has happened to our country"" They said they would be able to deploy 1,000 officers at an hour's notice, or more than 10,000 drawn from across England, Wales and Scotland within 24 hours - more than were used in the 2011 London riots. Specialised teams such as dog handlers, armed police and search-trained officers would be available, while 1,000 officers have received extra training so they could be deployed to Northern Ireland. But Mr Hall said he has warned those in charge of supply chains for food, fuel and other essentials to make their own preparations as officers will only be used ""if absolutely necessary"". Prime Minister Theresa May condemned ""harassment and intimidation"" by protesters after Remain-supporting MPAnna Soubry was verbally abusedat Westminster, whileone pro-Brexit MP took to wearing a body cameraon his way in and out of Parliament. MPs have also been warned to take care over their own language, after a backbencher was quoted saying the prime minister should ""bring her own noose"" to a meeting.

Vaccine linked to huge cervical disease drop,"The routine vaccination of girls with the HPV vaccine in Scotland has led to a ""dramatic"" drop in cervical disease in later life, new research suggests. Human papilomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted infection and some types are linked to cervical cancer. Researchers said the vaccine has nearly wiped out cases of cervical pre-cancer in young women since an immunisation programme was introduced 10 years ago. They found the vaccine had led to a 90% cut in pre-cancerous cells. And they said the effects of the programme had ""exceeded expectations"". HPV vaccination to be offered to Scottish boys Busting the myths around HPV Would you know if you had HPV? Over the last decade, schoolgirls across the UK have routinely received the HPV vaccine when they are 12 or 13. The uptake of the vaccine in Scotland is about 90%. A team of academics - from Strathclyde, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow Caledonian universities - analysed vaccination and screening records for 140,000 women who went for their first cervical screen from 2008-2016. Their study, published by the BMJ, concluded that Scotland's HPV vaccination programme has led to ""a dramatic reduction in preinvasive cervical disease"". It adds that the vaccine is ""highly effective"" and should greatly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in the future. HPV is the name given to a common group of viruses; there are more than 100 types of HPV Many women will be with infected with HPV over the course of their lifetime without any ill-effect In the vast majority of cases, there will be no symptoms and the infection will clear on its own, but in some cases persistent infection can lead to cervical disease Some types of HPV are high risk because they are linked to the development of some cancers Nearly all cervical cancers (99.7%) are caused by infection from a high risk HPV Many types of HPV affect the mouth, throat or genital area. They're easy to catch - you can get HPV from sexual contact. Source:NHS Choices,external Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women under 35 in UK. ""The findings will need to be considered by cervical cancer prevention programmes worldwide"", the study reports. When the vaccination programme began, researchers thought that the vaccine would knock out two types of HPV, which cause 80% of pre-cancerous conditions. Instead, they have found it knocks out another three types as well, which means it eliminates nearer 90% of cervical pre-cancer in Scotland. Dr Kevin Pollock said the virus was being eliminated Unvaccinated women also showed a reduction in disease, suggesting that the interruption of HPV transmission in Scotland has created substantial ""herd protection"", researchers said. Recent studies have also suggested that HPV plays a part in causing other cancers, particularly head-and-neck, vulvo-vaginal and anal cancers. Dr Kevin Pollock, of Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ""impressive"" figures confirm that ""the HPV vaccine should significantly reduce cervical cancer in the next few years"". He added: ""The main message is that the vaccine works. As long as the high uptake continues, the virus has got nowhere to go and it is being eliminated. ""We assessed 140,000 women in this study and because we can link status of vaccination to the disease its impact is indisputable."" Laura McAdam was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2016 Laura McAdam, 33, said she wishes the HPV vaccine had been available when she was at school. In 2016, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer after a routine smear test found changes in her cervix - despite having no symptoms. Laura said she wished she had the opportunity to get the HPV vaccine at school. She said: ""If this injection they are giving at schools now is wiping this out then that is amazing news and I'm definitely all for it. ""I think it's a great idea. I don't see why anybody wouldn't want to get it. ""I would take it in a heartbeat if it's going to stop anyone going through what I've been through."" ""You never expect it to happen to you"", she added. Due to complications she was unable to have chemotherapy or radiotherapy, so to remove the cancer she had laser treatment, a hysterectomy and lymph nodes removed. Ms McAdam, from Ayrshire, does not know whether her cancer will return, so has to have checks every six months. She added: ""Although I've had treatment I don't think my nightmare will ever really be over as I'll constantly be worrying if they got all the cancer or if it's come back. ""I would advise all girls to get vaccinated because there is proof that it works. I would also advise women to go for smear tests. It was a smear test that saved my life. ""I wouldn't wish what has happened to me on my worst enemy."" The research has been welcomed by Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust. The charity's chief executive Robert Music said: ""The findings of this research are highly exciting and clearly demonstrate the impact of the HPV vaccine in protecting the cervical health of future generations. ""We are lucky to have such an effective prevention programme which means the elimination of cervical cancer is firmly on the horizon. ""Focusing on communities and areas where take up is below the national average should be a priority."" This video can not be played HPV: Would you know if you had the virus? Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick MSP said he welcomed the report in the BMJ. He said it demonstrated ""the significant and continued benefits of our vaccination programme"". The study showed the programme ""will save lives"" and that plans were in place to ""build on this success"" by extending the HPV vaccine programme to boys later this year. He added: ""It remains important that women continue to take up the invitation for their regular cervical screening as we know it saves lives. ""The test is unique as it can prevent the disease before it even begins, and treatment as a result of screening prevents eight out of 10 cervical cancers from developing.""

Calls to regulate homeowner charges,"Janine Jones spent Â£140 on maintenance costs last year - and expects to pay even more in future The amount of money homeowners can be charged for maintenance work by housing developers should be regulated by the Welsh Government, an AM has said. Currently, people have no control over how much money estate management groups can charge for maintenance work and there is no appeals process. Hefin David, AM for Caerphilly, said a cap on the charges residents face should be introduced. The Welsh Government said it was looking at estate management changes. 'Fleecehold' homes: A scandal in waiting? 'I own a home but feel like I'm renting' Five surprises about your housing costs Janine Jones, from Caerphilly, has spent five years campaigning to change the system after being forced to pay for the upkeep of open spaces on her estate. Developers often hand the management of communal areas, such as grass verges and roads, to estate management companies, who then charge a yearly maintenance fee. But these costs can change every year and are unlimited - something that has been dubbed ""fleecehold"" by critics, Residents often have to pay a fee for the maintenance of communal areas, such as grass verges Currently, leaseholders who own the property but not the land it is on, can appeal any charges they feel are unfair via tribunals, but as a freeholder, Ms Jones cannot. Ms Jones said she paid Â£140 last year, twice as much as five years ago. She said: ""The standards are set by the management company and the costs to maintain those standards are set by the management company. ""However good or bad your relationship is with the management company, the residents have zero control. The loophole has to be closed"". Hefin David said the Welsh Government should regulate estate management companies Mr David wants to see estate management charges abolished and has raised the issue with the Welsh Government. ""I think the Welsh Government has the power to take action. There needs to be at the very least a cap on those charges and the rights of residents to have a method of complaint."" He added it was a problem in several counties in Wales and in England, where MP Helen Goodman is attempting to change the law. The Welsh Government said: ""Our Leasehold Reform Group is already examining estate management changes and will report to us in the summer."" 'Fleecehold' homes: A scandal in waiting?

Ghosn arrested over new claims in Japan,"Former Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn has been re-arrested in Tokyo while out on bail pending trial over claims of financial misconduct. Prosecutors said the 65-year-old had been detained over suspicions he caused Nissan $5m (Â£3.8m) in losses, according to reports. In a statement, Mr Ghosn said his re-arrest was ""outrageous and arbitrary"". Mr Ghosn's lawyer told a news conference they would strongly appeal against the latest arrest. Junichiro Hironaka also said that Tokyo prosecutors had confiscated the passport and mobile phone of Carlos Ghosn's wife, Reuters reported. Mr Ghosn, who denies any wrongdoing, was recently released on bail after 108 days in custody. Ex-Nissan boss was 'too powerful' Ghosn released after 108 days in custody Five charts on the Carlos Ghosn scandal Ghosn says 'plot and treason' behind arrest Tokyo prosecutors entered Mr Ghosn's residence before 06:00 local time on Thursday (21:00 GMT Wednesday) and took him to their office on suspicion he had misappropriated Nissan funds for personal use, Japanese broadcaster NHK reported. Mr Ghosn's lawyer said it was almost unheard of to arrest someone after being released on bail. ""I am innocent of the groundless charges and accusations against me,"" Mr Ghosn said in a statement released by his representatives. He said the arrest was ""part of another attempt by some individuals at Nissan to silence me by misleading the prosecutors"". ""Why arrest me except to try to break me? I will not be broken."" The move is the latest twist in a case that has attracted global attention. Mr Ghosn was the architect of the alliance between Nissan and French carmaker Renault, and brought Mitsubishi on board in 2016. He is credited with turning around the fortunes of Nissan and Renault over several years. Prosecutors said Mr Ghosn's latest arrest related to transfers of Nissan funds totalling $15m between 2015 and 2018. They suspect $5m of that amount was used by Mr Ghosn for personal expenditure. Local media had previously said that authorities had been building a new case against him involving payments to a dealership in Oman. In Japan, prosecutors are permitted to re-arrest a suspect on a slightly different accusation, with approval from the courts. The clock is then reset and another 20 days of interrogation can begin. Mr Ghosn was first arrested in November for understating his pay. He was re-arrested twice in December and faces three charges. He wasfirst charged with underreporting his pay packagefor the five years to 2015. In January,a fresh chargeclaimed he understated his compensation for another three years and he was also indicted on a new, more serious charge of breach of trust. Mr Ghosn denies any wrongdoing. He was released on $9m (Â£6.8m) bail in March. The auto executive also said on Wednesday on a newly created Twitter account that he was planning a press conference on 11 April ""to tell the truth about what's happening"". The latest arrest comes after Renault publicly criticised its former star executive for the first time, accusing him of ""questionable and concealed practices"". Mr Ghosnonly resigned from the French carmaker in January,while Nissan and Mitsubishi removed him as chairman shortly after his arrest. Renault had initially questioned Nissan's allegations, but carried out its own internal inquiry. But on Wednesday, it piled pressure on Mr Ghosn when it accused him of ""violations of the group's ethical principles"". The carmaker said it would stop Mr Ghosn's pension, thought to be worth â¬765,000 a year, adding that it reserved the right to bring action against him in the courts. Renault said it had also ""informed the French judicial authorities of potential issues concerning payments made to one of Renault's distributors in the Middle East"". However, in an interview with French TV stations TF1 and LCI, Mr Ghosn -  who holds French, Lebanese and Brazilian citizenship - said: ""I am innocent. It's hard, I have to admit it, and I call on the French government to defend me, and to defend my rights as a citizen.""

Civil servants offered Brexit counselling,"British civil servants were offered specialised support to deal with the strain of preparing for a no-deal Brexit, the BBC has learned. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) spent Â£40,000 on counselling services in London, York and Bristol. The surgeries were primarily for those working on ""emergency preparedness in case of a no deal scenario"". The government said the well-being of its staff was ""always a priority"". The three-month contract, which was awarded to Gloucester-based employee assistance firm Care First, was brought to the BBC's attention by the data firm Tussell. It was designed to bolster Defra's in-house mental health services while the department made changes to its support programmes, and ended on 31 January. A Defra spokesperson told the BBC that the department was committed to the mental health, safety and well-being of its employees, and had ""a range of services on offer to support staff's mental health"". A spokeswoman for the Charity for Civil Servants, which has been offering a ""Brexit well-being kit"" to government employees, told the BBC that it was responding to ""the impact that current pressures are having on the mental health and well-being of civil servants"". Michael Gove's department has awarded several Brexit-related contracts Last year, the Civil Service announcedit had trained 2,200 staff to be ""Mental Health First Aiders"".,external With responsibility for food and water, animal movements and waste strategies, Defra is one of the Whitehall departments with the largest no-deal Brexit workload. More than 1,300 employees have been recruited to assist with its contingency preparations. In February, analysis by Tussell found that Defra had awarded 19 Brexit-related contracts to professional services firms - the highest number among government departments. One agreement, worth Â£15,000, was awarded to help the department to assess ""the impact of Brexit on the milling wheat and malting barley supply chain"". In January, Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who is in charge of Defra, warned that farmers and food producers would face ""considerable turbulence"" if the UK left the EU without a deal. He told the Oxford Farming Conference it was a ""grim and inescapable fact"" there would be tariffs on exports and new sanitary and other border checks.

increase pressure on pilots while flying the plane. ""As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS

And of course, itâs more profitable for companies if we regularly buy replacements.

The governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, made a flying visit to Cumbria this morning and was told fewer than half the county's businesses in a survey had started preparing for Brexit. At a working breakfast he met a number of business representatives including Julian Whittle, from Cumbria Chamber of Commerce, who told him that while 57% of firms in the county expected leaving the EU to harm their prospects, only 19% expected to benefit. âMost of those are in the tourism sector where a further fall in the value of the pound could attract more overseas visitors while encouraging Brits to take holidays in the UK,â said Mr Whittle.

Last week,Iceland's WOW Air ceased operatingand today the country's central bank is warning about the impact on the local economy, ""Risk in the financial system has been considered relatively moderate in the recent term,
albeit subject to change if economic shocks should strike. Some of that risk has now
materialised in the failure of the capelin [fish] catch and the collapse of WOW Air. These developments
make it clear that export revenues and GDP growth will be weaker than was
assumed in the Central Bankâs February forecast. There are still risks that have not yet
materialised but could do so in the near future,"" the bank says inits financial stability report,external. ""Although WOW Airâs collapse will cause some losses in the banking system, it had
already been established that the direct impact on Icelandâs systemically important banks
would be limited. ""The indirect impact â including the impact of the capelin catch failure
and other potential shocks â is more difficult to assess at this juncture. It will depend in
part on how quickly and to what extent other airlines fill the gap left by WOW Air, and
the extent to which economic policy and other policy actions mitigate the effects of the
shock"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Brexit: What happens now?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

The fallout from Boeing's 737 Max crisis,"The Boeing 737 Max-8 aircraft that crashed soon after take-off Boeing, a superpower of the aviation world, is in the midst of a profound crisis. A brand new 737-Max 8 crashing after a new system on the modified aircraft apparently malfunctioned is, if investigators initial findings are confirmed, a disaster. All the evidence is pointing towards a second case of the same model of plane apparently suffering a similar fate, just five months later, and that makes this a whole lot worse. While the investigations into the crash are not yet complete, the problems for Boeing are mounting. The new anti-stall mechanism on the Max relied on data from one single sensor at the front of the aircraft. It's believed that erroneous data from that single sensor activated an anti stall system on the Lion Air flight, pushing the nose of the plane down shortly after take-off. This video can not be played Boeing 737 crashes: What went wrong? The evidence suggests that could also be the case for Ethiopian Airlines flight 302. The automatic system was also designed to reactivate repeatedly, so when the pilots on Lionair flight 610 pulled the nose of the plane back up, the stall mechanism kicked-in again, pushing the nose of each aircraft back down. Flight ET 302 also nose-dived repeatedly and, according to the preliminary report into the crash, the pilots followed Boeing's procedures and that was not enough to regain control of the aircraft. For Capt Brady, author of the 'Boeing 737 technical guide', this saga presents a long list of issues which need to be looked at. ""The level of automation of the aircraft, the behind the scenes systems, the risk analysis processes gone through at Boeing, the oversight by the regulator, the conversion training, the level of training generally, the manual flying skills of the crews. All of it needs to be reviewed in light of these accidents,"" he says. Multiple inquiries are underway. At least two lawsuits have been filed and more are likely. The latest of those two lawsuits has been filed by Ralph Nader. His niece's daughter, 24 year old Samya Stumo, who was working in the global health sector was one of 157 people killed on board flight ET 302. ""She had leadership written all over her, she had compassion in an intellectually rigorous way."" ""She was driven to save lives and we'll never know how many lives have been lost because she's not helping in a systemic way for the next 50 years."" Mr Nader ran several times for the US presidency, he's an experienced lawyer and has form at taking on big companies and is threatening to take legal action against Boeing. Last week a suit was filed in a Chicago federal court by the family of one of the victims of the Ethiopian crash, Jackson Musoni, a citizen of Rwanda. It alleges that Boeing had defectively designed the automated flight control system. Multiple investigations will pore over the certification of the Max and its new anti-stall system. According to one former test pilot at Boeing there were thousands of hours of flight time during the test programme which went on for more than a year. He says there will be ""terabytes of data"" from test flights which can now be examined. ""Nothing is done by a rogue pilot"", the former Boeing employee said. ""If anything we overkill, when going over things in group discussions."" Boeing says it will install an extra warning system in the 737 Max 8 and is revising the company's pilot training plans. But the sign-off process this time around will be more rigorous and aviation regulators from outside the US will be much more active in the process. The protocol of other regulators accepting the Federal Aviation Administration's judgement will not necessarily apply. Europe's Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, will, on this occasion, make up its own mind before the Max is deemed safe enough to fly again through European skies. With hundreds of 737-Maxs grounded worldwide and thousands of orders now on ice, with some of those possibly in jeopardy, the commercial impact of this episode is still evolving. Airlines whose aircraft remain grounded will want financial compensation. The potential bill for Boeing will grow exponentially if this drags into the summer months, when flight schedules and therefore cost implications suddenly increase. That said, Boeing is a commercial giant. ""Boeing has a large enough balance sheet. It won't really hit them"", says Peter Lemme, a former flight engineer at Boeing. But he believes Boeing's reputation ""is tarnished by this."" In his opinion, getting the Max back in the air won't be straight forward. ""There's a little bit of uncertainty now over what it will take to satisfy the regulators."" And in the world of aviation, everything comes down to safety. For Capt Chris Brady, an experienced 737 pilot, this is a watershed moment. ""It's the processes which are flawed,"" he says. ""It could apply to any manufacturer anywhere and I'm quite sure Airbus will be looking at their own processes in light of this and asking, could this happen to us?"" Boeing has insisted that safety has always been its number one priority.

"Breaking|Breaking newsEthiopian crash jet crew 'followed procedure'Ethiopian Airlines crew in Boeing 737 crash ""could not control"" jet despite following procedures, report findsBusiness","This video can not be played The MCAS system explained The Ethiopian Airlines plane that crashed last month nosedived several times before it hit the ground, a preliminary report has said. Pilots ""repeatedly"" followed procedures recommended by Boeing before the crash,according to the first official report into the disaster,external. Boeing's boss has admitted for the first time a failure in the jet's anti-stall system was a factor in the crash. Flight ET302 crashed after take-off from Addis Ababa, killing 157 people. Despite their efforts, pilots ""were not able to control the aircraft"", Transport Minister Dagmawit Moges said. It was the second crash of a Boeing 737 Max aircraft in five months. Last October, Lion Air flight JT 610 crashed into the sea near Indonesia killing all 189 people on board. Who are the victims of crash? What went wrong with Boeing 737 Max? What do the 737 crashes mean for Boeing? In a news conference in Addis Ababa, Ms Dagmawit said: ""The crew performed all the procedures repeatedly [that were] provided by the manufacturer but were not able to control the aircraft."" The 737 Max family of aircraft was grounded following the Ethiopian Airlines crash, a move affecting more than 300 planes. The preliminary report did not attribute blame for the crash. But it says the crew were fully qualified to conduct the flight, and that they performed all the expected procedures correctly. The report goes on to recommend that Boeing review the 737 Max's ""flight control system related to flight controllability"" and that aviation regulators ensure this is done before the aircraft goes back into the air. Crash investigators have focused their attention on the Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS) - software designed to help prevent the 737 Max from stalling. The software reacts when sensors in the nose of the aircraft show the jet is climbing at too steep an angle, which can cause a plane to stall. The report does not mention the MCAS by name, but it does detail during the minutes after take off the problems the pilots were having in trying to control the aircraft's angle of flight. At one point the captain called out three times ""pull up"", and seconds after instructed the first officer to tell Air Traffic Control that they had a flight control problem. In a statement on Thursday, the chief executive of Ethiopian Airlines, Tewolde GebreMariam, said he was ""very proud"" of the pilots' ""high level of professional performance"". ""It was very unfortunate they could not recover the airplane from the persistence of nosediving,"" the airline said in a statement. An investigation into the Lion Air flight suggested the system malfunctioned, and forced the plane's nose down more than 20 times before it crashed into the sea. The preliminary report from Indonesian investigators found that a faulty sensor on the aircraft wrongly triggered MCAS without the pilots' knowledge. Boeing has been working on an upgrade of the MCAS software since the Lion Air crash. It has said the system can be disabled - allowing pilots to regain control if there appears to be a problem. But the latest comments from Ethiopian officials suggest that pilots could not regain control, despite following procedures recommended by Boeing. By Tom Burridge, BBC transport correspondent Hundreds of 737 Maxs are grounded worldwide Two crashes, five months apart, with a total of 346 people dead. Both preliminary crash reports suggest a new design to the 737 Max 8 malfunctioned, pushing each plane repeatedly into a nosedive. One lawsuit has been filed. More are likely. The suffering of those who've lost loved ones can't be quantified. But the commercial toll for the manufacturer and damage to its reputation, at this stage, can't be either. Hundreds of 737 Maxs are grounded worldwide. Thousands of orders are, for now on ice, and some could even be in jeopardy. The Max was Boeing's answer to Airbus' A320: a single-aisle, fuel-efficient short-haul plane. But in the opinion of one experienced 737 pilot, the new anti-stall system, which was added to the aircraft and contributed to both crashes, was ""flawed"". Boeing is working to fix it. It needs to get the aircraft certified as safe and back in the air as soon as it can. Read more from Tom here. In a statement on Thursday, Boeing's chairman and chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said that following the release of the report it was ""apparent"" that in both flights, the MCAS software was ""activated in response to erroneous angle of attack information"". He added: ""As pilots have told us, erroneous activation of the MCAS function can add to what is already a high workload environment. It's our responsibility to eliminate this risk. We own it and we know how to do it."" Earlier, Boeing said in a statement: ""To ensure unintended MCAS activation will not occur again, Boeing has developed and is planning to release a software update to MCAS and an associated comprehensive pilot training and supplementary education program for the 737 MAX."" The company said the update ""adds additional layers of protection and will prevent erroneous data from causing MCAS activation. Flight crews will always have the ability to override MCAS and manually control the airplane"". Boeing has issued guidance to pilots on how to manage MCAS, and it plans to install an extra warning system on all 737 Max aircraft, which was previously an optional safety feature. It is also revising pilot training to provide ""enhanced understanding of the 737 Max"" flight system and crew procedures. The plane-maker says the upgrades are not an admission that MCAS caused the crashes. Boeing 737 Max MCAS system explained.

Firms rush to meet gender pay deadlineThousands of firms have yet to report their gender pay gap ahead of a Thursday night deadline.,"Hundreds of UK companies have yet to publish their gender pay figures before Thursday's midnight deadline. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) said it would take enforcement action against all firms that missed the deadline. The median pay gap among companies that have so far reported is 9.7%, flat against last year. Big firms with the largest gaps include Easyjet, Lloyds Bank, Clydesdale Bank and British Gas, BBC analysis found. The BBC looked at companies' median pay gaps. Of businesses with more than 5,000 employees, some with the biggest increase in the pay gap compared with last year include Kwik Fit and Interserve FS. The median pay gap is not the same as paying women less than men to do the same work, which is illegal in the UK. But using the median pay measure is helpful in understanding the number of women in companies who hold senior roles. Want to find out the gender pay gap where you work? Try the calculator below. All British companies with 250 or more employees have to report their gender pay gaps. Last year 78% disclosed that they paid men more than they paid women. Type in a company name below  ...for every £10 the average man earns... ...the average woman takes home [[PercOfMen]]    Number of companies by pay gap   If you cannot see the calculator, please click here,external More than 9,500 private sector employers have reported their figures ahead of the deadline, leaving some 500 still to do so. The EHRC has vowed to act against companies that do not comply. Chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath said: ""Gender pay gap reporting is not optional. It is a legal requirement and there's simply no excuse for employers failing to comply with the regulations this year. ""We will be taking enforcement action against all organisations that have not filed by the deadline requiring them to report immediately. ""Employers that don't report on time not only risk enforcement action and potential financial penalties; they are letting down the women who work for them. They should be prepared for an unhappy workforce and potential reputational damage."" Of the companies that had reported by mid-afternoon on 4 April: 78% report a pay gap which favours men 14% have a pay gap favouring women 8% report no pay gap. By law, companies, charities and public sector departments of 250 employees or more must publish their gender pay gap figures. The first set were based on a snapshot taken in April 2017, and the most recent data relates to April 2018. Public sector firms had to report by 30 March, and charitable and private firms by 5 April. The BBC's analysis looked at private sector firms which had gender pay gap data and a consistent registration at Companies House for April 2017 and April 2018. At the garage chain Kwik Fit, the previous year's pay gap of 15.2% had favoured women, indicating that there were a high number in senior roles. But the latest data shows a reversal, with a 14% gap in favour of men. A company spokeswoman said the industry had been ""historically more appealing to men"", although it was trying to recruit more women. ""We are keen to both promote from within the company as well as recruit more women to help redress this balance,"" the spokeswoman said. The gap at Interserve FS, part of the Interserve Group, widened from 0.6% to 14.9%. Interserve FS is one of 21 entities that make up the outsourcing giant. A spokesman for Interserve Group said: ""We are committed to addressing the issues on gender pay and through the leadership of our chief executive, Debbie White, we are making good progress."" Countrywide Surveyors had the largest gap of the available reported data at 60.6%. The firm had not responded to a request for comment at the time of writing. Easyjet had a pay gap of 47.9%. The firmsaid in March,externalthat the gap had widened from 45.5% as more female cabin crew had been recruited since the last pay snapshot. Most of the airline's pilots are male, and are more highly paid than cabin crew. The firm is making efforts to recruit more female pilots. Low-cost airline Jet2 had a 41.9% pay gap, compared with 49.7%. Although still a wide gap, it was also one of the businesses to have made the biggest strides in closing the division. UPS, New Look, Capita and EE also narrowed the gap. Barclays Investment Bank had a large pay gap of 44.1%. In its 2018 gender pay gap report, Barclays said it would introduce an ""accelerator programme"" for promising mid-level employees and try to recruit more female managing directors. It also said it would try to understand why women left Barclays. The pay gap at Lloyds Bank was 41.7%, while the gap at Lloyds Banking Group as a whole was flat at 32.8%. A spokesperson for the bank group said it was ""committed to attracting and retaining the best talent,"" adding that ""there is still more work to do"". ""We were the first FTSE 100 organisation to make a public commitment to having 40% of senior roles filled by women by 2020, and remain committed to both our gender target and closing the pay gap,"" the spokesperson added. While airlines and banks, including RBS, dominated the list of firms with the largest pay gaps, other businesses were in the top 10. British Gas, for example, had a pay gap of 37.5%. British Gas-owner Centrica said: ""Our gender pay gap is not due to unequal pay. It is driven by a greater proportion of men in traditionally male-dominated and higher-paid technical roles, such as gas and electrical engineering."" The Fawcett Society, a charity which campaigns for gender equality, called for tougher regulations to close the gender pay gap. ""It is disappointing, but not surprising, that there are so many employers in the UK with large pay gaps and that these pay gaps aren't being closed,"" said Sam Smethers, Fawcett Society chief executive. ""The regulations are not tough enough. It's time for action plans not excuses."" She added: ""Government needs to require employers to publish action plans that we can hold them accountable to, with meaningful sanctions in place for those who do not comply."" Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI employers' group, said: ""The business case for equality is watertight and gender pay reporting must act as a catalyst for change. ""Some of the practical action companies are taking - like setting themselves stretching targets - are having an immediate and positive impact. Other important steps like helping more women enter male-dominated sectors will make pay gaps bigger in the short term."" Median pay gap The median pay gap is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man. If you place all the men and women working at a company into two lines in order of salary, the median pay gap will be the difference in salary between the woman in the middle of her line and the man in the middle of his. Mean pay gap The mean pay gap is the difference between a company's total wage spend-per-woman and its total spend-per-man. The number is calculated by taking the total wage bill for each and dividing it by the number of men and women employed by the organisation. Pay gap v equal pay The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay. Unequal pay is giving women less than men for the same work. That has been against the law since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970. A company's gender pay gap can also be caused by other things, for example fewer women in senior or highly-paid roles or more women in part-time jobs. The individual company data reflects information submitted by companies to the Government Equalities Office. The data submitted each year is based on figures drawn from a specific date - called the 'snapshot date' - the previous year. 5 April is the snapshot date for businesses and charities. 31 March is the snapshot date for public sector organisations. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees.

"Seaside towns 'desperate for reinvention'A House of Lords report says if you can solve the problem in Blackpool ""you can solve it anywhere"".England","This video can not be played What's it like to be young and live in a coastal town? Seaside towns have been neglected for too long and are in desperate need of reinvention, a parliament report said. Young people in coastal communities are being ""let down and left behind"" by issues like transport, housing and post-16 education, the document said. The House of Lords' plan suggested solving problems in Blackpool could prove key in tackling issues at bucket and spade resorts across England. ""If you can solve it there you can solve it anywhere,"" the report said. A single solution does not exist but if national and local government work together seaside towns could ""once again become prosperous and desirable places to live in and visit"", it said. Neil Jack, chief executive of Blackpool Council, said: ""We know from experience that with the right sort of interventions, we can create a vibrant destination."" The British seaside has been ""perceived as a sort of national embarrassment"" and deserves attention, theHouse of Lords select committee on regenerating seaside towns,externalfound. But places like Brighton and Bournemouth have shown the seaside can successfully reinvent itself, according to committee chairman Lord Bassam of Brighton. Russell Turner, 59 and Lorraine Turner, 60, who live in Bexhill-on-Sea on the East Sussex coast, said trains to London, Eastbourne or Brighton needed to be improved. ""It should be feasible to work in Brighton but you need to allow yourself a good hour, hour and a half [to get there] and that's with clear traffic,"" said Mrs Turner. The report said solving problems in Blackpool could help tackle issues at other coastal towns The report said limited access to further and higher education was ""severely curtailing opportunities and denting aspirations"" for young people in some coastal areas. The committee's solution was for the government to create partnerships between colleges and universities and local employers. Mr Turner said establishing a university would lower the town's average age and could also boost the restaurant and bar industry. ""But you would probably upset some of the older residents,"" he said. Fellow Bexhill resident Melanie Glass said the town ""needed a heart"". ""If you go to somewhere like Brighton or Hastings...there's things people want to go and see and do there,"" Ms Glass said. ""There's quite a cafÃ© and restaurant culture here but in terms of shopping there isn't really anything that entices you in."" What are English seaside resorts really like? Seaside towns: Your photos Scarborough: The enduring appeal of the English seaside The geography of coastal towns meant many communities felt ""at the end of the line"", according to the report. But it said this could be overcome by rolling out high-speed broadband. Existing housing should be regenerated and new builds should be of better quality, while improvements to the coastal transport network should also be prioritised, the committee said. Grimsby has received Â£67m to improve the dock area and to create thousands of jobs and homes The committee said it ""strongly supported"" aÂ£67m town deal piloted in Grimsbyto create 10,000 homes and create 8,000 jobs by 2032. An expansion of a similar town deal for Blackpool had been discussed and ministers thought that type of scheme could particularly ""lend itself to coastal towns"", the report said. When counting the number of visitor nights spent in seaside resorts, Blackpool ranked top by some distance followed by Brighton and Bournemouth, it found. Blackpool had been working hard to turn around its fortunes, with a revamped seafront, investment in its trams, a newly electrified direct rail link to London and investment in hotels. But the town suffered serious deprivation and the focus on developing tourism may have hindered regeneration efforts, the report found. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said it was investing Â£36m in coastal communities. A spokeswoman said the department would ""carefully consider the committee's recommendations"". Young, on the coast and cut off.

May and Corbyn talks 'constructive',"This video can not be played Corbyn: May meeting ""useful but inconclusive"" Talks between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to break the Brexit deadlock have been called ""constructive"". The two leaders met on Wednesday afternoon and agreed a ""programme of work"" to try to find a way forward to put to MPs for a vote. It is understood that each party has appointed a negotiating team, which are meeting tonight before a full day of discussions on Thursday. A spokesman for No 10 said both sides were ""showing flexibility"". And he added that the two parties gave ""a commitment to bring the current Brexit uncertainty to a close"". Speaking after the meeting, Mr Corbyn said there had not been ""as much change as [he] had expected"" in the PM's position. He said the meeting was ""useful, but inconclusive"", and talks would continue. Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond has said a confirmatory referendum on a Brexit deal was a ""perfectly credible"" idea. He told ITV's Peston programme he was not sure if the majority of MPs would back it, but ""it deserves to be tested in Parliament"". This video can not be played Attorney General Geoffrey Cox: ""Once we are out, we are out"" This evening, MPs have debated legislation which would require Mrs May to seek an extension to Article 50 and give the Commons the power to approve or amend whatever was agreed. The bill passed its first parliamentary hurdle by 315 to 310 votes, and MPs are now voting on a raft of amendments. Supporters of the bill, tabled by Labour's Yvette Cooper, are trying to fast-track the bill through the Commons in the space of five hours, in a move which has angered Tory Brexiteers. Kuenssberg: PM chooses a deal over party unity Carney: No deal risk 'alarmingly high' Brexitcast: Theresa's Choice We must leave the EU, says attorney general Mr Corbyn said he raised a number of issues with Mrs May, including future customs arrangements, trade agreements and the option of giving the public the final say over the deal in another referendum. The Labour leader is coming under pressure from senior colleagues to make a referendum a condition of signing up to any agreement. Demanding the shadow cabinet hold a vote on the issue, Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said not backing a confirmatory vote would be a ""breach"" of the policy agreed by party members at its last conference. The UK has until 12 April to propose a plan to the EU - which must be accepted by the bloc - or it will leave without a deal on that date. The PM proposed the talks in a statement on Tuesday night. She wants to agree a policy with the Labour leader for MPs to vote on before 10 April - when the EU will hold an emergency summit on Brexit. If there is no agreement between the two leaders, Mrs May said a number of options would be put to MPs ""to determine which course to pursue"". In either event, Mrs May said she would ask the EU for a further short extension to hopefully get an agreement passed by Parliament before 22 May, so the UK does not have to take part in European elections. The two leaders also met Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP leader said she had ""good"" and ""open"" conversations with both, and while she believed Mr Corbyn would ""drive a hard bargain"", she was ""still not entirely clear"" where the prime minister was willing to compromise. The SNP leader, who backs a further referendum and wants to remain in the EU, told reporters: ""My concern is that in the rush to reach some compromise with the clock ticking, what will happen over the next few days... is a bad compromise will be reached."" The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Green Party, Plaid Cymru and the Independent Group have also held a joint press conference, calling for any decision made by the leaders to be put to a public vote. But some Tory Brexiteers have condemned the talks, with two ministers resigning over the issue. Chris Heaton-Harris quit on Wednesday afternoon,external, claiming his job at the Department for Exiting the European Union had become ""irrelevant"" if the government is not prepared to leave without a deal. Wales Minister Nigel Adams also resigned earlier, saying the government was at risk of failing to deliver ""the Brexit people voted for"".

Barrier Reef 'coral babies' in mass decline,"The Great Barrier Reef suffered mass bleaching events in 2016 and 2017 The number of new corals on Australia's Great Barrier Reef has plunged by 89% since unprecedented bleaching events in 2016 and 2017, scientists say. The events, which damaged two-thirds of the world's largest reef system, are now being blamed for triggering a collapse in coral re-growth last year. ""Dead corals don't make babies,"" said lead author Prof Terry Hughes, from Queensland's James Cook University. The scientists blame the problem on rising sea temperatures. The research, published in journal Nature,externalon Thursday, was carried out by a group of scientists last year. It measured how many adult corals along the reef had survived following the mass bleaching events, and the number of new corals that had been produced. Coral reefs head for 'knock-out punch' Heatwaves 'cook' Barrier Reef corals Could killing rats save reefs? ""Across the length of the Great Barrier Reef, there was an average 90% decline from historical [1990s] levels of recruitment,"" co-author Prof Andrew Baird told the BBC. The study highlights the link between coral vulnerability and rising sea temperatures resulting from sustained global warming, and recommends increased international action to reduce carbon emissions. Coral bleaching is caused by rising temperatures and occurs when corals under stress drive out the algae - known as zooxanthellae - that give them colour. If normal conditions return, the corals can recover. But it can take decades, and if the stress continues the corals can die. Prof Baird said the ""pretty extraordinary"" decline was unexpected. It was most likely the reef's first re-growth problem on a mass scale, he added. Scientists measured the number of coral ""babies"" in 2018 ""Babies can travel over vast distances, and if one reef is knocked out, there are usually plenty of adults in another reef to provide juveniles,"" Prof Baird said. However,the bleaching in 2016 and 2017 affected a 1,500km (900 miles) stretch of the reef. ""Now, the scale of mortality is such that there's nothing left to replenish the reef,"" Prof Baird said. The study also found that the mix of baby coral species had changed. It found a 93% drop in Acropora, a species which typically dominates a healthy reef and provides habitats for thousands of other species. This video can not be played What causes coral bleaching? The researchers said coral replenishment could recover over the next five to 10 years if there were no future bleaching events. However, given current estimates, this likelihood was ""almost inconceivable"", said Prof Baird. Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Carbon dioxide levels threaten reefs What could be wiped out by temperature rise ""We've gotten to the point now where local solutions for the reef are almost pointless - the only thing that matters is action on climate change,"" Prof Baird said. The reef - a vast collection of thousands of smaller coral reefs stretching from the northern tip of Queensland to the state's southern city of Bundaberg - was given World Heritage status in 1981. The UN says it is the ""most biodiverse"" of all the World Heritage sites, and of ""enormous scientific and intrinsic importance"".

Kremlin questions figures showing scale of poverty,"Seasonally appropriate shoes are out of reach for a third of Russians, data shows The Kremlin press secretary has said he cannot understand a survey that shows that Russians struggle to afford new shoes. Dmitry Peskov was commenting on a report by state statistics agency Rosstat. It found that a third of households polled could not afford two pairs of shoes per person, per year. The data also revealed that 80% of Russian families found it difficult to make ends meet. The survey actually indicates a slight improvement in some areas of family finances. But its stark headline figures - and Mr Peskov's annoyance - have captured attention, suggesting that officials are out of touch with everyday reality. Asked to comment on the findings, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman sighed deeply before saying that the Kremlin ""struggled"" to understand the data. ""Why shoes? Why one third? Where are these figures from?"" Mr Peskov asked, adding that he would be ""grateful"" for an explanation from Rosstat. Icy Siberia reveals cracks in Putin's Russia Watch: Keeping faith in Putin despite poverty Life in Putin's Russia explained in 10 charts The details are clearly available online, alongside the agency's ""monitoring of living standards"" survey, conducted every two years. The latest figures are from a poll conducted in September 2018 which covers some 60,000 homes across the Russian Federation. Amongst its findings, the survey reveals that close to half of all households cannot run to a week's annual holiday, even staying with friends or family. About 10% of those questioned could not afford to eat meat or fish three times a week, and 12.6% of homes either shared a communal toilet or had an outside loo. In rural Russia, where many village homes still have an outhouse, that figure is above 38%. The Kremlin's irritation with the statistics partly stems from an awareness that economic difficulties now present a significant challenge to President Putin. After overseeing a period of economic growth during his first terms in office, fuelled by high oil prices, Mr Putin's approval rating has fallen as Russian families live through a fifth straight year of shrinking incomes. That daily reality lies behind the latest polling data, including the fact that 52.9% households can't cope with unexpected expenses - including house repairs or medical costs. In 2016, when the last survey was conducted, that figure was 44.2%. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Two years ago, 15% of families had no indoor toilet and 54% were unable to afford a holiday. But the harsh facts still jar with the positive spin pumped into Russian kitchens by state television channels, and with the president's own pledge to slash poverty in half by 2024. Talk of difficulty buying shoes is also a long way from the designer boots that Mr Putin's spokesman himself has been photographed in; their cost online is close to double the monthly minimum wage.

DUP alludes to customs union support,"This video can not be played Customs union 'temporary staging post' The DUP has held out the prospect of supporting a customs union as talks continue between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to break the Brexit deadlock. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson made the suggestion to BBC News NI on Wednesday evening. It came as the Tory and Labour leaders agreed a ""programme of work"" to try to find a way forward to put to MPs. Earlier, the DUP called the prime minister's handling of the overall Brexit negotiations ""lamentable"". Late on Wednesday,MPs voted by a majority of oneto force the prime minister to ask for an extension to the Brexit process, in a bid to avoid any no-deal scenario. Can you have frictionless trade in a customs union? DUP criticises PM's 'lamentable' Brexit plans MPs push to prevent no-deal Brexit in law Earlier on Wednesday evening, Sir Jeffrey said his party would have preferred a form of Brexit that enables the UK to negotiate new trade agreements with other countries. ""That's part of the reason for Brexit and maybe a customs union might be a temporary staging post towards that objective,"" he told BBC Newsline. ""We will wait to see what the prime minister brings before Parliament but we are very clear, we want a Brexit that delivers for all of the United Kingdom and that keeps the United Kingdom together - that is our objective."" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button The DUP MP earlier told BBC Radio Ulster that regardless of what emerges in the coming days, the DUP's stance on the union was ""un-persuadable"" and they remained in an ""influential position"" because of the government's fragile working majority in Parliament. MPs have been debating legislation which would require Mrs May to seek an extension to Article 50 and give the Commons the power to approve or amend whatever was agreed. Wednesday's knife-edge parliamentary vote to ask the EU for a longer Brexit extension was on a bill brought by Labour's Yvette Cooper. It was fast-tracked through all Commons stages - a process that can take months - in one day and is now going through the Lords. It will still be up to the EU to decide whether to grant an extension. If the UK joined a customs union with the EU, this would lessen the need for the Irish border backstop, but would not remove it altogether. On its own, a customs union would unequivocally not eliminate the potential for border checks in Ireland. Customs are not the only things which could be enforced at the border - checks on food products to see if they meet EU standards would still remain an outstanding issue. That is a matter that only some sort of continued single market access would grant. On Monday, the DUP voted against an indicative vote proposing a customs union, but it was not binding. If Mrs May and Mr Corbyn cannot agree a compromise, the government will put forward its own series of indicative votes - which will be binding - and could include Mrs May's own deal versus a series of other options. Supporting one union to secure another. Might this be the new DUP tactic? First, Nigel Dodds said he would rather remain in the EU than risk the union. Now the party whip is saying a customs union ""could be a temporary staging  post"" to the ""preferred form of Brexit"". On the same day, the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox suggested he, too, could live with a customs union if it helped deliver Brexit. For the DUP, it's about preserving the union first, delivering Brexit second. But supporting a customs union in the political declaration, which is not legally binding, may just be a negotiating tactic. And as a ""staging post"" it may disappear when Theresa May's replacement takes over the negotiation. Meanwhile, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said it was an ""article of faith"" that the UK must leave the EU to honour the referendum result. He told theBBC a customs union was ""not desirable"" but if that was the only way of leaving the EU, he would take it. The comments come a day after Mrs May saidthat she will ask the EU for a further extension to Brexit. Talks between the prime minister and Jeremy Corbyn on Wednesday were said to be ""constructive"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I recognise that she has made a move... I recognise my responsibility"" It is understood that each party has appointed a negotiating team, and they are meeting before a full day of discussions on Thursday. Mr Corbyn had said he was ""very happy"" to meet Mrs May, and would ensure plans for a customs union and protection of workers' rights were on the table. The DUP has supported the government in a confidence-and-supply pact since June 2017, after a snap general election. But it is at odds with the prime minister and her Brexit deal, because of the Irish border backstop in the withdrawal agreement. The party opposes the plan because if it took effect, it would lead to trade differences between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, which the DUP said poses a risk to the integrity of the union. This video can not be played The DUP: Partners in government The UK is still scheduled to leave the EU on 12 April, unless the EU agrees to another extension. But it is likely to demand that the UK takes part in European elections, which are due to take place on 23 May. However, Mrs May said she wanted any further extension to be ""as short as possible"" - before 22 May so the UK does not have to take part in the elections. Both the UK and EU have continued preparations for a no deal, in the event that a breakthrough cannot be reached in time.

"Vaccine linked to huge cervical disease dropHPV immunisation has nearly wiped out the virus in vaccinated young women within a decade, researchers say.Scotland","The routine vaccination of girls with the HPV vaccine in Scotland has led to a ""dramatic"" drop in cervical disease in later life, new research suggests. Human papilomavirus (HPV) is a sexually transmitted infection and some types are linked to cervical cancer. Researchers said the vaccine has nearly wiped out cases of cervical pre-cancer in young women since an immunisation programme was introduced 10 years ago. They found the vaccine had led to a 90% cut in pre-cancerous cells. And they said the effects of the programme had ""exceeded expectations"". HPV vaccination to be offered to Scottish boys Busting the myths around HPV Would you know if you had HPV? Over the last decade, schoolgirls across the UK have routinely received the HPV vaccine when they are 12 or 13. The uptake of the vaccine in Scotland is about 90%. A team of academics - from Strathclyde, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Glasgow Caledonian universities - analysed vaccination and screening records for 140,000 women who went for their first cervical screen from 2008-2016. Their study, published by the BMJ, concluded that Scotland's HPV vaccination programme has led to ""a dramatic reduction in preinvasive cervical disease"". It adds that the vaccine is ""highly effective"" and should greatly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in the future. HPV is the name given to a common group of viruses; there are more than 100 types of HPV Many women will be with infected with HPV over the course of their lifetime without any ill-effect In the vast majority of cases, there will be no symptoms and the infection will clear on its own, but in some cases persistent infection can lead to cervical disease Some types of HPV are high risk because they are linked to the development of some cancers Nearly all cervical cancers (99.7%) are caused by infection from a high risk HPV Many types of HPV affect the mouth, throat or genital area. They're easy to catch - you can get HPV from sexual contact. Source:NHS Choices,external Cervical cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women under 35 in UK. ""The findings will need to be considered by cervical cancer prevention programmes worldwide"", the study reports. When the vaccination programme began, researchers thought that the vaccine would knock out two types of HPV, which cause 80% of pre-cancerous conditions. Instead, they have found it knocks out another three types as well, which means it eliminates nearer 90% of cervical pre-cancer in Scotland. Dr Kevin Pollock said the virus was being eliminated Unvaccinated women also showed a reduction in disease, suggesting that the interruption of HPV transmission in Scotland has created substantial ""herd protection"", researchers said. Recent studies have also suggested that HPV plays a part in causing other cancers, particularly head-and-neck, vulvo-vaginal and anal cancers. Dr Kevin Pollock, of Glasgow Caledonian University, said the ""impressive"" figures confirm that ""the HPV vaccine should significantly reduce cervical cancer in the next few years"". He added: ""The main message is that the vaccine works. As long as the high uptake continues, the virus has got nowhere to go and it is being eliminated. ""We assessed 140,000 women in this study and because we can link status of vaccination to the disease its impact is indisputable."" Laura McAdam was diagnosed with cervical cancer in 2016 Laura McAdam, 33, said she wishes the HPV vaccine had been available when she was at school. In 2016, she was diagnosed with cervical cancer after a routine smear test found changes in her cervix - despite having no symptoms. Laura said she wished she had the opportunity to get the HPV vaccine at school. She said: ""If this injection they are giving at schools now is wiping this out then that is amazing news and I'm definitely all for it. ""I think it's a great idea. I don't see why anybody wouldn't want to get it. ""I would take it in a heartbeat if it's going to stop anyone going through what I've been through."" ""You never expect it to happen to you"", she added. Due to complications she was unable to have chemotherapy or radiotherapy, so to remove the cancer she had laser treatment, a hysterectomy and lymph nodes removed. Ms McAdam, from Ayrshire, does not know whether her cancer will return, so has to have checks every six months. She added: ""Although I've had treatment I don't think my nightmare will ever really be over as I'll constantly be worrying if they got all the cancer or if it's come back. ""I would advise all girls to get vaccinated because there is proof that it works. I would also advise women to go for smear tests. It was a smear test that saved my life. ""I wouldn't wish what has happened to me on my worst enemy."" The research has been welcomed by Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust. The charity's chief executive Robert Music said: ""The findings of this research are highly exciting and clearly demonstrate the impact of the HPV vaccine in protecting the cervical health of future generations. ""We are lucky to have such an effective prevention programme which means the elimination of cervical cancer is firmly on the horizon. ""Focusing on communities and areas where take up is below the national average should be a priority."" This video can not be played HPV: Would you know if you had the virus? Public Health Minister Joe FitzPatrick MSP said he welcomed the report in the BMJ. He said it demonstrated ""the significant and continued benefits of our vaccination programme"". The study showed the programme ""will save lives"" and that plans were in place to ""build on this success"" by extending the HPV vaccine programme to boys later this year. He added: ""It remains important that women continue to take up the invitation for their regular cervical screening as we know it saves lives. ""The test is unique as it can prevent the disease before it even begins, and treatment as a result of screening prevents eight out of 10 cervical cancers from developing.""

ÃÂ£300m boost for station disabled accessLifts and adjustable ticket counters will be among the upgrades at 73 stations across Britain.,"Access is to be improved at 73 rail stations in Britain as part of a Â£300m investment, the government says. Lifts and adjustable ticket counters will be among the new measures brought in over the next five years. The changes, part of an ""inclusive transport strategy"", will help disabled passengers as well as those travelling with children or luggage. Liverpool Central and Luton in England, Barry Town in Wales, and Dumfries in Scotland areamong the stations chosen,external. The Department for Transport says the sites were selected based on criteria which included their usage, level of local disability and value for money of the work. Train stations are a nightmare for people like me Disabled rail users 'an afterthought' MP hopes for station lift 'within a year' Transport accessibility minister Nusrat Ghani said: ""Transport is vital for connecting people with work, friends and family, but also to enable them to enjoy visiting some of the wonderful cultural, historical and natural sites across the UK. ""We want the 13.9 million disabled people in Britain to be empowered to travel independently."" Since the Access for All programme was launched in 2006 accessible routes have been introduced at more than 200 stations. A further 1,500 stations have had smaller individual upgrades including accessible toilets and improvements to help those with a visual or hearing impairment. Chloe Ball-Hopkins, Team GB Paralympian and freelance reporter, wrote aboutthe difficulty of getting around the UK's rail stationslast year. ""Using the train is supposed to be an easy and relaxed way to get about but instead it ends up being frustrating and deflating. ""I know some stations that are older buildings struggle with putting things like ramps and lifts in place, but that doesn't give them an excuse not to try and find a way to cater for everyone. ""Whether that's someone like myself who can't use the ramp they have put in place because it's too steep, or a blind person who has to try and manage flights of steps that they can't see. ""The staff at the stations can be the friendliest people going but it doesn't resolve the situation if someone in a wheelchair is sat at the top or bottom of the steps with a train to catch in a matter of minutes."" Read more from Chloe However, the disability charity Leonard Cheshire says that its research shows disabled people cannot use 40% of railway stations in the UK because of a lack of step-free access. Chief executive Neil Heslop said that while disabled people will welcome these improvements, ""inaccessible public transport will continue to force many to miss out on everyday events which others take for granted, from employment opportunities to simply spending time with family and friends"". The Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee, which works with the government on accessibility issues, said that there must also be ""clear and practical information"" about the improvements so that disabled people know what additional transport options are available.

Eyelid 'cancer risk' from SPF moisturiser,"Failing to apply moisturiser with sun protection factor (SPF) and sunscreen properly to the face, particularly around eyes, could be putting people at risk of skin cancer, a study suggests. Researchers found differences in the way people applied sunscreen and SPF moisturiser. More skin is missed with moisturiser - especially the eyelids, where the skin is thin and more vulnerable to cancer. Sunglasses with UV filters can help protect missed areas, the experts said. Many moisturisers are sold with SPFs of 30-50, similar to the level of traditional sunscreens, but they are not intended to be a replacement for sunscreen if spending long periods of time outdoors in the summer. The research team at the University of Liverpool studied how 84 people (62 women and 22 men) put on both moisturiser and sunscreen, then took photos with a UV-sensitive camera showing how well they had covered their faces. The researchers found that nearly 17% of the face was missed with SPF moisturiser compared with 11% for sunscreen. And there was 21% lower coverage of the area around the eyelids with moisturiser and 14% with sunscreen, the study inPLOS One,externalfound. A face photographed with a conventional camera, a UV sensitive camera, with sunscreen applied and moisturiser applied These are the areas most vulnerable to skin cancer, but people were unaware they had not covered them, said Austin McCormick, study author and consultant ophthalmic and oculoplastic surgeon, from Aintree University Hospital Trust. ""The eyelid skin is very thin and this puts it at risk of UV damage,"" he said. ""The area around the eyelashes and between the eyelids and the nose is least likely to be covered."" How does sunscreen work? Are you applying sun cream properly? Warning over suntan lotion application Sun cream: 'It takes two to do it properly' Mr McCormick said that eyelid cancers accounted for 10% of all basal cell carcinomas in the UK, the most common type of skin cancer, so people should pay particular attention to the eyelid area when putting on any SPF cream. Moisturiser may be used more sparingly because it is often expensive, sold in smaller amounts and is seen as a ""precious cream"", he said. ""If planning prolonged sun exposure, we advise sunscreen be used. ""If using moisturiser, we advise one with SPF: any SPF is better than none, but it should not be considered the equal of sunscreen,"" Mr McCormick said. Holly Barber, from the British Association of Dermatologists, said the formulas in SPF moisturisers were less likely to be rub-resistant and water-resistant if applied more thinly. But she said it was surprising that people were not more hesitant to apply sunscreen around the eyes - because it can make them sting. ""A good way to avoid problems such as sunburn in areas missed when applying sun protection is to make use of protective clothing such as sun hats and sunglasses, as well as reapplying regularly,"" she said. This video can not be played Are you applying sun cream properly? Sunscreen is really only necessary when planning to spend half an hour or more in summer sunshine. If you are just popping out at lunchtime it is unlikely that you will need sunscreen, especially if you applied a moisturiser with SPF that morning or are in and out of the shade of buildings and trees. They are fine for offering some protection if you are going out briefly. But if you intend spending some time outdoors, especially between April and September, then sunscreens are much more effective. Moisturisers providing SPF do not bind as well to the skin as sunscreen, and so are not intended to provide adequate protection for extended periods in the sun. In the winter months, UV protection in the UK is not necessary - except in people who are abnormally sensitive to sunlight. We all need some sun exposure, which provides us with important vitamin D. However, this has to be balanced with the risk of skin damage in hotter months. This is not directly related to how hot it is, but to the UV index. Although this is generally higher on cloudless, hot days than on cloudy, cool days, you should not rely on temperature alone as a guide to the need for sun protection.

"Kremlin questions figures showing scale of povertyRussian leaders ""struggle"" with statistics that show a third of Russians can't afford two pairs of shoes.Europe","Seasonally appropriate shoes are out of reach for a third of Russians, data shows The Kremlin press secretary has said he cannot understand a survey that shows that Russians struggle to afford new shoes. Dmitry Peskov was commenting on a report by state statistics agency Rosstat. It found that a third of households polled could not afford two pairs of shoes per person, per year. The data also revealed that 80% of Russian families found it difficult to make ends meet. The survey actually indicates a slight improvement in some areas of family finances. But its stark headline figures - and Mr Peskov's annoyance - have captured attention, suggesting that officials are out of touch with everyday reality. Asked to comment on the findings, President Vladimir Putin's spokesman sighed deeply before saying that the Kremlin ""struggled"" to understand the data. ""Why shoes? Why one third? Where are these figures from?"" Mr Peskov asked, adding that he would be ""grateful"" for an explanation from Rosstat. Icy Siberia reveals cracks in Putin's Russia Watch: Keeping faith in Putin despite poverty Life in Putin's Russia explained in 10 charts The details are clearly available online, alongside the agency's ""monitoring of living standards"" survey, conducted every two years. The latest figures are from a poll conducted in September 2018 which covers some 60,000 homes across the Russian Federation. Amongst its findings, the survey reveals that close to half of all households cannot run to a week's annual holiday, even staying with friends or family. About 10% of those questioned could not afford to eat meat or fish three times a week, and 12.6% of homes either shared a communal toilet or had an outside loo. In rural Russia, where many village homes still have an outhouse, that figure is above 38%. The Kremlin's irritation with the statistics partly stems from an awareness that economic difficulties now present a significant challenge to President Putin. After overseeing a period of economic growth during his first terms in office, fuelled by high oil prices, Mr Putin's approval rating has fallen as Russian families live through a fifth straight year of shrinking incomes. That daily reality lies behind the latest polling data, including the fact that 52.9% households can't cope with unexpected expenses - including house repairs or medical costs. In 2016, when the last survey was conducted, that figure was 44.2%. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

Two years ago, 15% of families had no indoor toilet and 54% were unable to afford a holiday. But the harsh facts still jar with the positive spin pumped into Russian kitchens by state television channels, and with the president's own pledge to slash poverty in half by 2024. Talk of difficulty buying shoes is also a long way from the designer boots that Mr Putin's spokesman himself has been photographed in; their cost online is close to double the monthly minimum wage.

Â£300m boost for station disabled access,"Access is to be improved at 73 rail stations in Britain as part of a Â£300m investment, the government says. Lifts and adjustable ticket counters will be among the new measures brought in over the next five years.

"May and Corbyn: Brexit talks 'constructive'A ""programme of work"" is agreed while Jeremy Corbyn calls the talks ""useful but inconclusive"".UK Politics","This video can not be played Corbyn: May meeting ""useful but inconclusive"" Talks between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn to break the Brexit deadlock have been called ""constructive"". The two leaders met on Wednesday afternoon and agreed a ""programme of work"" to try to find a way forward to put to MPs for a vote. It is understood that each party has appointed a negotiating team, which are meeting tonight before a full day of discussions on Thursday. A spokesman for No 10 said both sides were ""showing flexibility"". And he added that the two parties gave ""a commitment to bring the current Brexit uncertainty to a close"". Speaking after the meeting, Mr Corbyn said there had not been ""as much change as [he] had expected"" in the PM's position. He said the meeting was ""useful, but inconclusive"", and talks would continue. Meanwhile, Chancellor Philip Hammond has said a confirmatory referendum on a Brexit deal was a ""perfectly credible"" idea. He told ITV's Peston programme he was not sure if the majority of MPs would back it, but ""it deserves to be tested in Parliament"". This video can not be played Attorney General Geoffrey Cox: ""Once we are out, we are out"" This evening, MPs have debated legislation which would require Mrs May to seek an extension to Article 50 and give the Commons the power to approve or amend whatever was agreed. The bill passed its first parliamentary hurdle by 315 to 310 votes, and MPs are now voting on a raft of amendments. Supporters of the bill, tabled by Labour's Yvette Cooper, are trying to fast-track the bill through the Commons in the space of five hours, in a move which has angered Tory Brexiteers. Kuenssberg: PM chooses a deal over party unity Carney: No deal risk 'alarmingly high' Brexitcast: Theresa's Choice We must leave the EU, says attorney general Mr Corbyn said he raised a number of issues with Mrs May, including future customs arrangements, trade agreements and the option of giving the public the final say over the deal in another referendum. The Labour leader is coming under pressure from senior colleagues to make a referendum a condition of signing up to any agreement. Demanding the shadow cabinet hold a vote on the issue, Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry said not backing a confirmatory vote would be a ""breach"" of the policy agreed by party members at its last conference. The UK has until 12 April to propose a plan to the EU - which must be accepted by the bloc - or it will leave without a deal on that date. The PM proposed the talks in a statement on Tuesday night. She wants to agree a policy with the Labour leader for MPs to vote on before 10 April - when the EU will hold an emergency summit on Brexit. If there is no agreement between the two leaders, Mrs May said a number of options would be put to MPs ""to determine which course to pursue"". In either event, Mrs May said she would ask the EU for a further short extension to hopefully get an agreement passed by Parliament before 22 May, so the UK does not have to take part in European elections. The two leaders also met Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP leader said she had ""good"" and ""open"" conversations with both, and while she believed Mr Corbyn would ""drive a hard bargain"", she was ""still not entirely clear"" where the prime minister was willing to compromise. The SNP leader, who backs a further referendum and wants to remain in the EU, told reporters: ""My concern is that in the rush to reach some compromise with the clock ticking, what will happen over the next few days... is a bad compromise will be reached."" The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Green Party, Plaid Cymru and the Independent Group have also held a joint press conference, calling for any decision made by the leaders to be put to a public vote. But some Tory Brexiteers have condemned the talks, with two ministers resigning over the issue. Chris Heaton-Harris quit on Wednesday afternoon,external, claiming his job at the Department for Exiting the European Union had become ""irrelevant"" if the government is not prepared to leave without a deal. Wales Minister Nigel Adams also resigned earlier, saying the government was at risk of failing to deliver ""the Brexit people voted for"".
