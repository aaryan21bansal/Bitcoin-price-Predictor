I'm surplus to requirements - Hart,"This video can not be played Manchester City: Joe Hart says Pep Guardiola's treatment of him 'not a surprise' England goalkeeper Joe Hart says he is ""surplus to requirements"" at Manchester City and does not see himself playing for the Premier League club again. Hart joined Italian side Torinoon a season-long loan in August after being told he wasfree to leave City by manager Pep Guardiola. The 29-year-old added that he saw the Spaniard's decision to drop him coming. ""If you're not going to win there is no point in fighting, especially someone as powerful as that,"" Hart said. However, Hart believes the decision was ""nothing personal"" and said he respected Guardiola's honesty. ""He didn't do it to ruin my life, he did it because he thought that was what was right for him to win as a manager,"" he told the BBC's Premier League Show. Guardiola was asked about the situation at his Friday news conference, but reiterated his stance that no decision had yet been made. ""I have said many times, at the end of the season we will see which players are happy or unhappy,"" the manager said. ""He is a Man City player. We will decide at the end of the season."" Watch The Premier League Show on iPlayer Hart's 33-year-old replacement, Claudio Bravo has been criticised for his performances since hisÂ£15.4m arrival from Barcelonain August, with Willy Caballero, 35, preferred in the Premier League and Champions League since 21 January. Guardiola has said he will not make a decision on Hart's futureuntil the end of the season- but it is expected the keeper will leave the club for good in the summer. Hart, who has 68 England caps, has been linked with various Premier League and European clubs but said he has had ""no communication with anyone"" about a transfer after his loan spell at Torino ends in May. When asked about a return to the Premier League, Hart replied: ""I know it really well but I wouldn't say it was top of my wish list. ""Top of my wish list is to play for a club that wants me to be their goalkeeper."" This video can not be played Joe Hart gets 'positive vibes' from fans in Turin Match of the Day commentator Steve Bower: How difficult was it to discover Pep Guardiola didn't want to make you number one and you would have to go somewhere else? Joe Hart: I want to say it was really bad but it wasn't because I saw it coming. SB: From the moment Guardiola walked through the door? JH: No but you just pick up vibes and it certainly wasn't a surprise to me. It was something that I wanted to change and felt I was more than capable of changing - but to get results he needed to have a team he felt comfortable with and a team he wanted. I didn't fall into that category and that's no problem. I'd have loved to have stayed and fought and shown what I can do, but I don't have that time. You don't have that time to do it - especially as a goalkeeper. You can't come off the bench for 10 minutes and prove your worth - it's either you're in or you're out. I'm up for a fight - I'll fight my corner all day - but if you're not going to win then there is no point in fighting, especially someone as powerful as that at Manchester City. I know it's nothing personal on me, he's not that kind of guy. SB: Do you respect his honesty? JH: Yes of course. He did what he had to do, he did what he felt was right. He didn't do it to ruin my life, he did it because he thought that was what was right for him to win as a manager. So I had to look elsewhere and here I am. Joe Hart has made 348 appearances for Manchester City, the most recent one coming against Steaua Bucharest in August SB: What did you say when your agent said Torino were interested? JH: I said, 'look into it'. I didn't have many options - things happened very late with Manchester City. For a goalkeeper that's difficult, everyone is pretty settled with goalkeepers, it's an early bit of business and there is only one spot. My name wasn't necessarily out in the transfer market because people probably presumed that I would be at Manchester City - like I did. But I wasn't going to play at Manchester City, that was pretty obvious - I was third, if not fourth choice at the time so I wanted to play football and Torino gave me the opportunity and I just thought, 'I'm going to go for it.' SB: There will be Manchester City fans thinking, 'Will you ever play for our team again?' JH: I'd say I'm pretty much surplus to requirements at my parent club at the moment. SB: Do you see that changing? JH: Not really. I've got to be realistic. I love that club and I've always said that as long as they wanted me, I would be there. But I was always cautious when I said that because I'm aware that at the big, big clubs stuff can change quickly, as can opinions and people in charge. Not everyone is going to like you, not everyone is going to want to play you and that's the business side of it, which I've grown into and I'm certainly not going to take personally. I want to play football, I love to play football so if that opportunity is not going to be given there then I'm going to have to look elsewhere and may have to make somewhere else my home. SB: Where you at in terms of a transfer at the moment? JH: It's frustrating to see my name thrown around so much when I'm just trying to get on with what I'm doing for now and then whatever needs to be taken care of will hopefully be taken care of one way or another. I've still got a parent club that I need to respect and I need to work with. I understand that's the football business now - everyone has got an opinion, a small comment can be used in an article. I don't know where my future lies - I've certainly had no communication with anyone. The best thing I can do is work hard, be ready to train every day, do my best for Torino, do my best when I represent my country and then hopefully the rest will take care of itself. SB: How important is it for you to be playing regular football next season to keep your position as England goalkeeper? JH: [England boss] Gareth Southgate is not the kind of guy to say: 'You need to be doing this or that or you're out.' He's such a positive, interesting person. He came to see me out here, which was good of him, just for an afternoon, just to check in and he wants what's best for the country. The only way I can be a part of that is if I'm playing well, playing regularly and improving. We've got some really good, strong English keepers at the moment. I'd like to think we're pushing each other and if my levels drop then I'm gone and I understand that. I don't need any threats, I know how the game works as I've been a part of it for a while now. SB: As a goalkeeper do you have to wait for someone to leave a club for a place to go? JH: Yes, unfortunately. Especially the top teams because every top team has got at least one top keeper. You need people to move, managers to change. You need something to happen for something to happen. You can't just charge in somewhere. SB: Would returning to the Premier League be top of your wish list? JH: I'm open. I love the Premier League, I absolutely love Premier League games. Removing myself a footballer, I watch the Premier League. It's a great league, fantastic football is played in it. I know it really well but I wouldn't say it was top of my wish list. Top of my wish list is to play for a club that wants me to be their goalkeeper.

Thatcher to inspire UK's Brexit 'divorce bill' talks?,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Britain has an ""illustrious precedent"" As Theresa May arrived at her last Brussels summit before pushing the button on Brexit, it is enough to give you a splitting headache. Not just the complexity of actually getting a deal done, but the ceiling of the brand new European Council HQ in Brussels, decked out in a crazy patchwork of rainbow colours. The architect told the BBC he hopes his design will lead to ""joyful meetings"" in a space ""where politicians' deep talents can be expressed like poets"". Harsh words and hard bargaining are more likely to be a feature of the next two years despite the architect's dreams. Even if there is goodwill on both sides, as British ministers increasingly hope, the technicalities of doing a deal are impossible to dismiss. Brexit: Britain's Biggest Dealis on BBC Two from 21:00 GMT and is thenavailable to watch on BBC iPlayer First off there's an exit process to negotiate, with a likely exit bill of as much as Â£50bn. Ministers have been careful so far not to say too much. But Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told me Britain has an ""illustrious precedent"" and should reject the demands - just as Margaret Thatcher did at thefabled summit in 1984,externalwhen she wielded her handbag and didn't just ask for money back, she threatened to walk out if she didn't get her way. He told me: ""We have illustrious precedent in this matter... I think you can recall the 1984â¦ summit in which Mrs Thatcher said she wanted her money back and I think that is exactly what we will, we will get."" A rather more provocative way of telling the rest of the EU that the contentious demands expected to be made just aren't going to happen and - by mentioning the Fontainbleu incident - implying at least that it is possible the UK could walk out over the cash. That's before we start to untangle four decades when our countries, laws, rules and regulations have been becoming more and more enmeshed. Then there are the prospects of getting a deal on the future of our relationships done. What happens to security arrangements, information sharing, rules and regulations, our entire legal system, our future immigration system, fishing, farming, air traffic control, water quality rules, Europol, continent-wide arrest warrants? The list goes on and on. Theresa May has arrived at her last Brussels summit before pushing the button on Brexit Then, asour interview with Nicola Sturgeonmakes plain, the constitutional implications at home are only starting to be understood. There are fights too for powers in Northern Ireland with risks of destabilising the peace process, argues Tony Blair. And if those two nations are fighting for more powers as control returns from Brussels, can Wales sit and just play along? The hardest solutions to find though are on trade. It's true that those who were ardent Remainers now in government say privately they are more hopeful. A senior figure told me: ""It's like a divorce. At the start you say, I hate you, I never want to see you again. Then you say, I still don't like you, but we need to talk about the kids."" There is no question that, in Westminster at least, the expectation is that individual members of the EU are softening their resistance. That's why part of the UK government's strategy is unquestionably to divide and conquer. But there isn't much sign of any softening, or at least anyone willing to say so in public. That's why, despite their optimism, there is a realism in government too, and they are preparing to think about having to walk away, with the Brexit Secretary David Davis admitting to me, he is very hopeful of ""Plan A"", but that ministers ""have to do the work for the so-called Plan B or C"". He also reiterated the government's position that there is no way they will agree to a deal on EU citizens in Britain without agreement from the other side of the table. He claims the ""highest probability"" is of getting a deal done. For the many ministers and officials we've spoken to, they believe - for some of them it's more accurately a hope - that a good deal can be reached because in the end, money talks. Just as Vote Leave argued, the belief at the highest levels of government is that whether it's German cars or Italian prosecco, European politicians will come willingly to an agreement because they rely on the buying power of the British consumer. That is the argument that's continually cited and the ultimate irony. Britain's politicians are relying on the EU to put economics before politics. One of the reasons Britain chose to leave the EU is the perpetual frustration felt on our side of the Channel that continental politicians are incapable of doing just that. It's a gamble perhaps that Theresa May didn't have much choice but to take. But if she's wrong, the government, arguably the country, will need Mr Davis' Plan B. And the dreams of an architect might in fact be the start of a nightmare.

The window cleaner who survived 47-storey fall,"Only half of the people who fall three storeys survive. From 10 storeys almost no-one does. This is the tale of a window cleaner who survived a 47-floor fall from the roof of a New York skyscraper. ""I loved to see the windows really clean,"" Alcides Moreno says. ""I liked the water and the soap, how you press the squeegee. ""We would start at the top and clean all the way to the bottom, I loved it."" Moreno and his younger brother Edgar set out to clean the windows of the 47-floor luxury Solow Tower building in Manhattan's Upper East side on the morning of 7 December 2007. They took the lift up to the top and walked out on to the roof, the temperature hovering around freezing. But moments later, disaster struck. When they climbed on to the 16ft-wide (4.9m) washing platform the cables holding it in place ""slipped from their attachment point"", according to the United States Department of Labor accident report. ""On the left side the cable came off first. That was my brother's part. My brother fell off, all the way down,"" Alcides Moreno says. Edgar plummeted 472ft (144m), landing in a narrow alley. By the time he reached the ground it's estimated he would have been travelling at more than 120mph. Alcides Moreno's side of the scaffold broke loose soon after, and he too started accelerating towards the ground. At street level, firefighters and paramedics found a harrowing scene. Edgar Moreno had landed on a wooden fence, his body was severed and he couldn't be helped. Alcides Moreno was found crouching among a pile of twisted metal, clutching the scaffold controls. Still breathing, he is said to have tried, unsuccessfully, to stand up. Rabbit hole in farmer's field leads to 'mystery caves' Rock arch featured in Game of Thrones collapses into the sea Five-year-old girl makes history as youngest US Spelling Bee finalist Firefighters recall how they began to move him in small increments ""like a fragile egg"", knowing that one wrong move could have killed him. The men's safety harnesses and lifelines, together with some soap and a bucket of hot water - the steam still rising from it - were discovered on the roof next to the scaffold rig. Alcides Moreno (centre) met the New York Fire Department members who rescued him in 2008 Alcides Moreno was rushed to a nearby hospital and induced into a coma. He had sustained injuries to his brain, spinal column, chest and abdomen, and had fractures to his ribs, right arm and both legs. He underwent numerous operations, including having a catheter inserted in his brain to reduce swelling. He received 24 pints of blood. ""If you're looking for a medical miracle, this certainly qualifies,"" Dr Herbert Pardes, the then president and CEO of New York-Presbyterian Hospital told a press conference at the time. ""The survival rate even from a four-storey fall is not very good,"" Dr Glenn Asaeda from the New York City Fire Department said. ""A higher hand was in control here."" Alcides Moreno spoke to the BBC World Service programmeOutlook Listen again to the interview Alcides Moreno woke up nearly three weeks later, on Christmas Day 2007, with his wife, Rosario, at his bedside. ""My mind was so blurry,"" he says. He has no recollection of the fall itself. Did he know what had happened to his brother? ""I understood that he must be dead because I looked around and saw only me and my wife,"" he says. Alcides Moreno, his wife, Rosario, and one of their sons An investigation into the accident found that the scaffolding hadn't been properly maintained and that new motorised cables, which attached the window washing platform to the building, had not been properly anchored to the roof. Accident investigators also concluded that although Alcides Moreno had stepped on to the scaffold without wearing a safety harness, this did not prove that he had refused to use it. Since he had also not yet retrieved his window washing equipment from the roof they said that he might still have intended to go back and put on the harness before starting work. Speculation continues as to how he survived. By holding tight as he fell, did the scaffolding take most of the impact? Did the scaffolding somehow surf the air? Did Alcides Moreno bounce off the side of the building on the way down, slowing his fall? The two brothers, originally from Ecuador, had arrived in the US in the 1990s looking for work. Edgar Moreno (left) and Alcides ""Losing him was a big deal for me,"" Alcides Moreno explains. ""Edgar lived with me in New Jersey, and we shared a lot of things. He worked with me and died working with me. ""I believe I felt melancholic for about three years. That's how long it took me to recover and accept his death. It was like losing a child, because he was younger than me."" Alcides Moreno received a substantial compensation payout and he and his family moved to Phoenix, Arizona. He says the warm weather there is good for his bones. ""I have all the scars on my body and because of the back injuries, I can't run, only walk,"" he says. ""I'm not like I used to be. But thank God I can walk, that is amazing for me."" Now 46, Moreno says he would clean windows again if he could - he doesn't have a problem with heights. But he doesn't work for health reasons. He estimates that he is 80% of the person he used to be. Alcides Moreno is not afraid of heights ""When I ask something, I don't finish the question,"" he says. ""There are things I don't do well. It must be a consequence [of the accident]."" The experience on 7 December 2007 changed his life in other ways too. ""I used to think a lot about me and only me,"" Moreno says. ""I would provide for the family and think that was good enough. Then I realised how important my wife and kids are."" This video can not be played Listen: Alcides Moreno describes the moment disaster struck Last year, Alcides Moreno became a father for the fourth time. He seems overjoyed when talking about his boy of eight months. ""I keep asking myself why I lived. I have a new baby - he must be the reason, to raise this kid and tell him my history.""

Do 60% benefit from changes in National Insurance?,"The claim:60% of self-employed people will pay less National Insurance as a result of these changes. Reality Check verdict:60% of people according to Treasury estimates will pay less, but only if you combine the abolition of Class 2 National Insurance contributions, which was announced in 2016, with the increase in Class 4 contributions announced on Wednesday. Nobody will pay less National Insurance as a result of the changes announced in Wednesday's Budget alone. Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond was on the BBC's Breakfast programme on Thursday, talking about the changes made in his Budget. He said that 60% of self-employed people would pay less National Insurance as a result of the changes. What changed on Wednesday was that in April 2018, Class 4 National Insurance contributions will rise from 9% of profits earned between Â£8,060 and Â£43,000 a year, to 10%. The following year it will rise again to 11%. National Insurance of 2% will still be payable on earnings above Â£43,000. George Osborne announced the previous year that Class 2 National Insurance contributions, which are paid at a flat rate of Â£2.80 a week by self-employed people earning profits of more than Â£5,965 a year, would be abolished from April 2018. Mr Hammond was keen to combine the effects of these two changes, describing the net effect as raising Â£145m a year by 2020-21. TheBudget documents,externalpredict that just raising Class 4 contributions will raise Â£495m in 2020-21, with the measure raising a total of just over Â£2bn over the next five years. If you look at the two changes together, the Treasury says that 2.6 million people will be better off by an average of Â£115 a year, while 1.6 million people will lose out by an average of Â£240 a year. Thelatest labour market figures,externalestimated that there were a total of 4.8 million self-employed workers, but some of them will be earning less than Â£5,965 so will be neither better off nor worse off, which means the total is feasible. From those figures, it appears that 60% of self-employed people could be paying less in National Insurance. But it would be a bit surprising if all self-employed people looked at it like that. They were expecting a tax cut in April next year, and as a result of this Budget, 40% of them will now face a tax increase instead. It will be the higher-earning, self-employed people who lose out. The Institute for Fiscal studies has worked out that anyone earning profits of less than Â£15,570 a year will be better off, while the maximum loss will be Â£589 a year. UPDATE 15 March: More figures emerged in the following days and the policy was reversed a week later. Find more details in thisReality Check.

What is the true meaning of 'Essex girl'?,"The hackneyed clichÃ© of white stilettos is a thing of the past ""Essex girls"" have long been mocked as thick, promiscuous and lacking in class. But a campaign to turn the hackneyed clichÃ©s on their heads is fast gathering pace. The BBC's Jodie Halford asks whether being from Essex is a disadvantage in modern life? A few years ago, I was talking to a colleague over the phone when he asked me my name. ""Jodie,"" I replied. ""Wow, that's an appropriate name for someone from Essex,"" he said. ""Conjures up images of white stilettos and fake tans."" If I had hailed from elsewhere in England, I am confident he would not have made such a remark. But then, ""Essex girls"" have come to expect a certain amount of sneering when our origins are discovered. It is all the fault of a decades-old stereotype which is so ingrained in British culture that it has its own entry in the dictionary. The Oxford English Dictionary definition of Essex girl The origins of this label possibly lie with the concept of Essex man - that almost forgotten relative of the Essex girl - which reared its head in the early 1990s. Journalist Simon Heffer used the term to denote a new type of Conservative voter who was ""young, industrious, mildly brutish and culturally barren"". Such men were typically self-made and had benefitted from the policies of Margaret Thatcher, he said. The county's women were soon to be stereotyped too. An article in The Independent from November 1991 related the recent ""craze"" for Essex girl jokes. They often went something like this: ""How does an Essex girl turn on the light afterwards? She kicks open the car door."" The newspaper said the jokes had been imported from the United States, where they had originated as ""blonde"" jokes before being adapted for a British audience. Add to that shows like Birds of a Feather - and later The Only Way is Essex - and the reputation of the county's women was firmly cemented. Dr Terri Simpkin said Essex girl's negative meaning was developed in the 1980s and 90s Dr Terri Simpkin, a lecturer in leadership and corporate education at Anglia Ruskin University, said the term Essex girl was first recorded in 1892 but its modern connotations date from the late 1980s. ""There's that connection between post-war migration out of London into the new towns and elsewhere with the decline of manufacturing and the rise of professional occupations,"" she said. ""Essex became a corridor between dormitory towns and London, so we saw a rise in people having social mobility. ""Out of that came a level of snobbery and a disparaging view of people who had become more aspirational and affluent. ""But with women, there was gender discrimination as well, because so-called Essex girls weren't wilting wallflowers - they were more overt as sexual beings, they took control of their own sexuality."" Southend-on-Sea playwright Sadie Hasler says the Essex girl stereotype is ""utterly moronic"" Sadie Hasler, 36, a playwright and columnist from Southend-on-Sea, has encountered her fair share of Essex girl prejudice. ""The most common thing when you mention where you're from to people who aren't from there is that initial glimmer in their eyes,"" she says. ""You can't hear the word Essex without having a cognitive flash of all the stereotypes. It's part of the battle, all those years of history behind the word."" Ms Hasler, who has worked as an actor and comedy performer, said she moved away from the industry because her accent and age meant she was being given a narrow range of roles where she was ""asked to wear PVC catsuits, go topless, always be sexual"". ""If I'd been from another county, I don't think that would have happened,"" she said. ""When I was touring, and doing lots of character comedy, I saw more Essex stereotypes far more widely in other parts of the country than in Southend."" ""Travelling into London, people are always surprised to learn I have a brain,"" she adds. ""It's almost like they're saying: 'Well done, you've escaped Essex!' ""It makes no sense for people to feel that way - it's utterly moronic, in fact."" Essex is about more than just stereotypes, as this image of Landermere Wharf in the Tendring district shows Last autumn, Essex girls were splashed across newspapers and television screens once more, when two bloggers started a petition to remove the definition from the dictionaries. The Oxford English Dictionary refers to her as ""unintelligent, promiscuous, and materialistic"", while Collins adds ""devoid of taste"" to the mix. Juliet Thomas and Natasha Sawkins, from Motherhub, decided to do something about it. ""We asked the dictionary if there was another example of a stereotype defining someone from a particular area,"" Ms Thomas said. ""There wasn't. ""It's not for us to define what it means, but people have started to reclaim it and give it a far more positive meaning - it's just that there's currently no alternative definition."" Juliet Thomas and Natasha Sawkins are campaigning to change or remove the dictionary definition of Essex girl The Essex Girl petition was run alongside a social media campaign with tweets from hundreds of women who wanted to reclaim the term. Great British Bake Off winner Jo Wheatley, writer and vlogger Giovanna Fletcher and Olympic sailor Saskia Clark were among those who threw their support behind #iamanessexgirl. ""We didn't feel successful women in Essex were being talked about enough, with most of the focus going to the lazy stereotypes,"" said Mrs Thomas. Another organisation celebrating the county's women is the Essex Women's Advisory Group (EWAG), a charitable foundation set up to ""challenge negative stereotypes by promoting the confidence and achievements of Essex women and girls"". Its chair, Juliet Townsend, said she had heard of young women pretending they were from elsewhere when going for jobs outside of the county. ""They're not confident to say they're from Essex, or they feel their accent or what they wear is the subject of ridicule,"" she said. ""I'm so proud to be an Essex girl. Silly jokes about it are really boring, and make me judge whoever who cracks them. ""But there are so many people who don't have that confidence to brush off the comments and jokes - we want to empower those people to have the confidence not to feel that way."" Shows like The Only Way is Essex were criticised for playing up to the stereotype So what does it really mean to be an Essex girl in 2017? Emmerdale actress Zoe Henry believes Essex girls are ""strong, successful and independent"". She grew up in Ilford - part of the London borough of Redbridge since 1965, but still considered Essex in many people's hearts. ""I left home at 21 and moved to Manchester,"" she recalled, ""and I was embarrassed to tell people where I was from. The stereotype had informed how I felt. ""But the older I got, the more confident and proud I became to tell people. We're strong minded, strong willed - and we know how to have a great time."" Mrs Thomas and Mrs Sawkins - who were born outside of the county but have lived there for a number of years - simply want people to continue to ""reclaim the term"" and give it a more positive meaning. ""We knew getting the dictionary changed wouldn't happen overnight - it wasn't about that,"" said Mrs Sawkins. ""It's about bringing it to people's attention, and celebrating the success of women from Essex - real women doing amazing things"". The Essex Way runs from Harwich (pictured) to Epping Wednesday was International Women's Day and Ms Townsend, from EWAG, said she planned to raise awareness of her campaign through a sponsored walk along the Essex Way - an 81 mile (130km) trek from Epping to Harwich. ""My version of being an Essex girl can be completely different to someone else's,"" she said. ""There's no right or wrong way of being an Essex girl. ""It's important to remember the clichÃ©, the heightened version, exists because Essex girls can be proud of looking good while having brains."" Playwright Ms Hasler believes work should be done in schools in the county to give pupils, both male and female, a degree of assertiveness, and to teach them ""it's ok to challenge the stereotype."" ""If you could take every negative stereotype about Essex girls, and turn them into positives, it would be amazing to see Essex girl come out and say love your body, make the most of what you've got, own it, don't take lip from anyone, say what you think, defend yourself and don't be a wallflower,"" she said. ""The thing about Essex girl is she actually represents lots of positive messages for women - but they're currently dressed up in the most hideous way.""

The 'robot lawyerâ giving free legal advice to refugees,"A technology initially used to fight traffic fines is now helping refugees with legal claims. When Joshua Browder developedDoNotPay,externalhe called it ""the world's first robot lawyer"". It's a chatbot - a computer program that carries out conversations through texts or vocal commands - and it uses Facebook Messenger to gather information about a case before spitting out advice and legal documents. It was originally designed to help people wiggle out of parking or speeding tickets. But now Browder - a 20-year-old British man currently studying at Stanford University - has adapted his bot to help asylum seekers. In the US and Canada, it's helping refugees complete immigration applications, and in the UK, it can aid asylum seekers in obtaining financial support from the government. Browder developed the chatbot through the help of lawyers from each of the countries. ""It works by asking a series of questions to determine if a refugee is eligible for asylum protection under international law,"" he tells BBC Trending, ""for example: 'are you afraid of being subjected to torture in your home country?' ""Once it knows a user can claim asylum, it takes down hundreds of details and automatically fills in a completed immigration application. Crucially, all the questions that the bot asks are in plain English and artificial intelligence generated feedback appears during the conversation."" The bot suggests ways the asylum seeker can answer questions to maximise their chances of having applications accepted, for example: ""The best answer for your situation will include a description of when the mistreatment started in your home country."" Visit theTrending Facebook page,external In addition to a completed application, a refugee also receives location specific submission instructions, details of additional documentation needed and resources for further help. Currently, the lawyer bot is available via the Facebook Messenger app, making it accessible to Android and Apple device users. Browder says that he hopes to roll the service out to more languages and apps in the future, including Whatsapp. DoNotPay got plenty of attention after it wasfirst launched in March 2016, and Browder says hundreds of thousands of people have used the app to challenge parking tickets. His own brushes with traffic police inspired him to create the bot. ""When I started driving at 18, I began to receive a large number of parking tickets and created the the service as a side project,"" he says, ""I could never have imagined that just over a year later, it would successfully appeal over 250,000 tickets."" He expanded the service to help with emergency housing in August of last year. DoNotPay creator Joshua Browder says he was moved to work on legal advice for asylum seekers because his grandmother was a refugee from Austria during the Holocaust However, some tech industry experts say that Browder's creation may struggle to achieve the same level of popularity with asylum seekers. ""Browder's chatbot is a great example of tech to help those in need,"" saysOliver Smith,external, senior reporter at tech and business siteThe Memo,external. ""However, as refugees are often among the least internet-connected groups in society, a Facebook chatbot may not be the best way to help them. ""While governments moving their services online and into digital formats is a boon for people living in a country with consistent wifi or internet-connected smartphones, those who have fled their home countries often struggle to get online in refugee camps or when travelling across countries."" The UNhas said,externalthat for refugees, connectivity is ""as vital to them as food, water, or shelter"", but just 39% have mobile internet access.

Undercover cop: A Samurai sword was at my throat,"""I've had a samurai sword to my throat, a knife in my groin, stripped naked at gun point."" For 14 years, Neil Woods infiltrated UK drug gangs for the police, at great personal risk. Posing as an addict to infiltrate some of the UK's biggest drug gangs is not for the faint-hearted. It takes resolve, courage, and an ability to think on your feet in the most high-pressure of environments. But for Neil Woods, it was not a life calling that led him to devote 14 years to this cause, but a failure to perform in his normal role. ""I wasn't a very successful uniform cop,"" he tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""I struggled, so I got an attachment with the drugs squad. They suggested trying one of the undercover jobs of buying crack cocaine."" It was 1993, and this form of undercover work was rare in the UK. For Mr Woods, however, it was a niche that played to his strengths. ""I really enjoyed the work, I found I was good at it,"" he says. ""I was developing the tactics for it - such as building a cover story, but not acting. Learning to play a different version of yourself. ""It all relies on empathy - 'weaponising' empathy to get close to them."" A shot of Neil Woods undercover, in around 1995 Mr Woods admits he had a ""completely prejudiced view"" of drug users when he first took the job, but as he began to meet addicts, he saw a different side to those who had been caught up in that world. ""Beforehand, I saw them as people who had made the wrong decision, who didn't have willpower. I thought that it was their fault,"" he says. ""But then you start to realise some of their life stories - that they had been self-medicating for child abuse, for example. ""Two-thirds of heroin users have a history of abuse."" At the time, however, this did not alter his approach to work. ""I still carried on manipulating them,"" he says. ""They were collateral damage. ""They would get wrapped into the investigation and end up in jail. ""I justified to myself that the end would justify the means."" The reason for this becomes clear when you consider the type of gang members he was looking to put behind bars. In 2004, he helped bring six members of the notorious Burger Bar Boys to justice. They operated in the Birmingham area, and were ""horrendous criminals"", according to Mr Woods. ""They were raping people as punishment for drug debt,"" he says. Mr Woods spent 14 years undercover Mr Woods worked across inner cities around the UK, and often found himself in dangerous situations. ""I've had a samurai sword to my throat, a knife in my groin, stripped naked at gun point,"" he says. ""Once, my hidden camera was found by a particularly vicious gangster. ""He brought two mates to a meet-up who didn't know me. ""They searched me and found the camera. ""I had to react quickly, I just launched into a torrent of abuse. ""It created confusion so I could escape. ""Then they came after me in the car and they tried to run me over. ""I later learned that they had a gun in the car."" Mr Woods says his work has led to more than a combined 1,000 years of jail time for the criminals he helped to lock away. When he became a father, however, he says he found it difficult to juggle his job with his family life. ""I would do this work in the week, then at the weekends be a dad. I would go swimming with my kids,"" Mr Woods says. Eventually, after 14 years, he decided to leave the profession. He came to see his work as futile, given the greater picture. ""I interrupted the drug supply for no more than two hours in any city. So what's the point?"" he says. ""Some of those arrested were organised criminals - but many were just victims of the 'war on drugs', the vulnerable problematic users."" For several months, he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of what he had seen undercover. Mr Woods is in favour of Durham Police's plans to provide heroin to addicts in medically supervised conditions Despite leaving the police, however, he still feels ""duty bound"" to continue to stop the spread of drugs on UK streets. Mr Woods is now the chairman of Leap UK, which campaigns for drugs policy reform. It supports Durham Police's plan to give heroin addicts the class-A drug in supervised ""shooting galleries"" in a bid to tackle drug-related crime. Opponents say trials suggest such initiatives do not have significant, long-term benefits, but Mr Woods argues the move will enable police to ""get a grip on heroin, get it away from criminals"". ""The drug supply is currently in the hands of organised criminals,"" he says, ""it's so dangerous."" It is very different from his former job, but - as he explains - his time undercover has made a lasting impression. ""I have this unique experience,"" he says. ""Now, I just use it in a different way."" Watchthe Victoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

Laura Marling: 'I'm unsure of my femininity',"Laura Marling's latest album was recorded in her adopted home of Los Angeles, so coming back to London to promote it in mid-February has been something of a rude awakening. ""I stupidly got on my bike this morning and got the sleet right in my face,"" she winces. Having dried off and freshened up, she settles down to chat. Marling has a reputation for being a shy, sometimes reluctant interviewee - but LA clearly has rubbed off on her. She chews gum as we talk, laughing bawdily as she discusses her penchant for dating drummers. (""What do they bring to a relationship? Rhythm!"") The 27-year-old also reveals her mum keeps a ""very meticulous scrapbook"" of her career, and admits to cooking up her own brand of Halloumi cheese. ""I'm aiming for direct competition with Alex James,"" she says, referring to the cheese-making Blur bassist. ""But bloody hell, what a boring thing to talk about"". Marling released her first album - Alas, I Cannot Swim - in 2007 So instead we circle back to that new album. It's her sixth, and possibly best, record since she emerged at the age of 17 as part of the indie folk movement that also spawned Mumford and Sons, Lucy Rose and Noah and the Whale. Sumptuous and sensual, Semper Femina adds a hint of West Coast sheen to her delicate, acoustic melodies. Marling generously credits her band and producer Blake Mills for the progression. ""All of the musicality of the album is down to them,"" she says. ""I wanted to be in the middle of it, but for someone else to be painting the picture around it."" If you don't have a Latin textbook to hand, the album's title is taken from a line in Virgil's epic poem The Aeneid. The line is ""varium et mutabile semper femina"", which translates as ""woman is always fickle and changeable"". ""I thought that was very jolly,"" says Marling, apparently without sarcasm. She came across the phrase years ago and had a truncated version - ""Semper Femina"", or ""always a woman"" - tattooed on her leg when she was 21. The singer has Virgil's phrase tattooed on her leg It's a fitting title for a record that explores femininity in all its forms, from the archetypal wild teenager to the artist's muse, while reflecting on female friendships and betrayals. Marling prompted a lot of speculation when she announced in a press release that the album was written during a ""masculine time"" in her life, after she had ""gone on this trip of abandoning any sexuality"". She clarifies that today, saying she was simply trying to write about women from a ""neutral perspective"". But she admits LA prompted a period of androgyny. ""People there are just a bit more far-out,"" she explains. ""Nobody's got a job, they can dress however they want. A lot of my friends are queer or gender-fluid. So I was picking up on that. ""Then there was also my natural relationship with [womanhood]. I'm unsure. I'm unsure of my own femininity or masculinity. ""There are some circumstances in which I employ more of a masculine approach in order to protect myself; and there are circumstances where I indulge in my more feminine side because that vulnerability seems more important. ""I'm interested in the differences between men and women, of which there are plenty, and they need to be understood better."" Such as? ""Well, I was talking to my producer, Blake, and he said he started playing guitar to impress girls. I think when I started playing guitar, it was to impress my dad. ""So Blake's relationship to his instrument is very different to mine and his reason for writing songs is very different to mine but, at the same time, he is extraordinary. And so those differences can be great. ""You can reduce it down to an Eastern idea that men expend energy and women are self-perpetuating."" Marling grew up in rural Hampshire One of the album's big themes is how women are observed - both by men and each other. On Wild Fire, Marling talks about a friend who keeps a ""pen behind her ear"" and constantly jots down her thoughts in a notepad. ""Of course the only part that I want to read is about her time spent with me,"" the singer drawls. ""Wouldn't you die to know how you're seen? Are you getting away with who you're trying to be?"" That's a perennial question for a performer - especially one who seems so cautious of the limelight. ""Would I die to know how I'm seen?"" she asks herself, when the lyric is brought up. ""I don't know! ""I'm aware, obviously, that I'm looked at and considered and reviewed and criticised. But I'm pretty good at steering pretty clear of those [articles], unless they're delivered to me by my mother."" On Nouel, she turns the tables - objectifying one of her real-life friends as a classic muse. ""Oh Nouel, you sing so well / Sing only for me?"" Marling pleads, going on to compare her friend to Gustave Courbet's Origine Du Monde - an 1866 painting of a woman sprawled naked on a bed. This video can not be played Laura Marling performs Nouel, from her new album Semper Femina, for BBC Radio 4's Mastertapes. ""I was interested in what it is like to be made a muse,"" says Marling. ""Nouel is a person who exists, a visual artist I know in Los Angeles, and I took her essence and I exaggerated it into a fantasy. ""She [Nouel] was very flattered by it - but then again she was able to remove herself from it. ""It's her but it's not her. I haven't painted a picture of her - it's my projection of my feelings about how extraordinary I feel she is."" Watch more performances from Semper Femina on BBC Music In black and white this all seems very intellectual and, well, pretentious. Marling is quite aware of how it comes across, poking fun at the ""pseudo-science"" and ""pop psychology"" she espouses. On the album she even sings, ""Lately I wonder if all my pondering takes up too much ground?"" But the music breathes warm life into these high concepts, resulting in a romantic, confessional suite of songs. By the last track, Nothing Not Nearly, Marling has put all the contemplation aside to observe: ""Nothing matters more than love. No nothing. Not nearly."" It reflects her current, contented state of mind. ""I'm loving my late twenties,"" she says. ""The closer I get to 30, the more at ease I feel with myself."" Each of her albums has contributed to that sense of self, she continues. ""This one was about understanding femininity and masculinity. The last one was understanding solitude. ""Before that was heartbreak, before that was freedom and before that was anger. It's like I'm tackling the world one emotion at a time!"" So what's next? Rebellion? Passion? Paranoia? ""Possibly. Or fear, given the era that we're seemingly stepping into,"" she says. ""It's not been good."" Marling won a Brit award for best British female in 2011 She talks about the ""horrifying but unbearably addictive quality"" of President Trump, saying she's constantly checking her phone for the latest update. While the Trump era has already prompted a surge in political protest songs, Marling has trouble viewing this as a positive. ""I don't think anyone would wish that on the world for the sake of writing a good song. That's not the purpose of art - to encounter animosity for the sake of having something to do. ""A singer, who's now a big singer, once said to me: 'It'd be so cool to be really heartbroken because it'd be good for my songwriting."" ""I was like, 'You silly, naive wally!' Never wish that on yourself. It's unbearable."" Semper Femina is out on 10 March. Laura Marling is currently on tour around the UK.

'She was playing in the restaurant. Then she was shot',"Sofia was with her parents in a popular restaurant when a shootout between the police and a suspected criminal erupted On a summer night in January, Sofia's family took her to a restaurant in Iraja, a suburb of Rio, where she could use the play area outdoors. It had a big, colourful slide, where children could climb up some stairs and come out through a tunnel to the ground. From inside the restaurant, Sofia's parents watched their two-year-old daughter. The play area was protected from the street by a gate so, in a city with shocking levels of crime, families felt the children were relatively safe there. Being safe in Rio is always a top concern. Iraja, a busy middle and lower middle-class neighbourhood of around 100,000 people in northern Rio, is surrounded by some of the city's most violent areas, and criminals are quite active there. Like on that Saturday night. Police were sent to the streets next to the restaurant to investigate a car robbery, something frequent in that area: an average of four cars a day were robbed there in 2016. Police officers had set up a barricade after identifying a suspect, but the man did not obey calls to stop and, according to reports, tried to escape. A chase began. Sofia's parents described her as a ""smart"" girl who loved to enjoy herself Sofia's father, Felipe Amaral Fernandes, said she was especially happy on that night. ""She had told my wife: 'Mummy, I'm very happy today'. She didn't even want to eat."" Herica, the mother, was proud of her daughter, who could already count from one to 10 in English. Sofia also enjoyed dancing to music clips in front of the television, and was in love with the pink, purple and blue scooter ""Papai Noel"", or Santa Claus, had given her last Christmas. ""She was smart, intense. Sometimes she didn't even want to sleep because she only wanted to enjoy herself,"" Ms Fernandes said. One time, she said, Sofia was asked about what she loved the most in her life. Sofia replied: ""Enjoy myself"". Sofia was playing on the slide when the police chase neared the restaurant. At around 22:00, a shooting started. The sound of gunfire was loud and close, and the families who were in the restaurant went to the play area to pick up their children. Sofia's parents, now also outside, waited for her to come through the slide. ""I screamed 'Sofia, Sofia!',"" Ms Fernandes said. But her daughter did not answer. Sofia's father looked inside the tunnel, but she was not there. He went to the other side of the slide, and climbed it. ""That's when I saw my daughter up there, motionless, bloodied. I broke into the toy, took her from there and ran."" Sofia had been shot in the face. This video can not be played Sofia is one of 31 children who have been killed by stray bullets in Rio, activists say ""I got desperate seeing my little daughter there. I felt impotent,"" said Mr Fernandes, a police officer. ""I'm used to violence around me but I never thought this was going to happen to my daughter. When it happened I thought: 'My goodness, not with me'."" He carried Sofia in his arms. People in the restaurant stopped a police car that was passing nearby, and it took father and daughter to the hospital. The crowd watched in disbelief. Shootouts are part of life in Rio. Despite Brazil's tight gun laws, rights groups saymillions of weapons,externalare in the hands of criminals. Tougher regulations were approved in 2004, banning the carrying of guns in public and controlling illegal ownership. But activists say they are incapable of curbing illegal gun trade and that bandits have been largely unaffected. The reasons for shootouts vary. Some are the result of clashes between rival criminals; others, of armed robberies, like the one in Iraja. But rights advocates say they mainly occur during police operations against heavily armed drug gangs in impoverished neighbourhoods, where some groups are the de-facto rulers. And civilians often find themselves in the crossfire. ""These police operations are badly planned. In many times they happen at daylight, in densely populated areas, with war weaponry being used,"" said Antonio Carlos Costa, president of Rio de Paz, or Rio of peace, a local human rights group. Shootouts between the police and criminals often happen during the day Last year, researcher Cecilia Oliveira, who works with rights group Amnesty International, was looking for reliable data about shootouts in Rio. But numbers were hard to come by as there were no official statistics. So last July, she helped create Fogo Cruzado, Portuguese for ""crossfire"", an app for people to report gunfire in their neighbourhoods. Between its launch and January this year,according to Amnesty,,external50,000 people downloaded it. The numbers gave a sense of the fear that millions of people live in: there were 2,517 notifications, an average of almost 14 a day. The reports included 539 deaths and 570 injured. Most alerts came from poor neighbourhoods and shantytowns, or favelas, places notorious for their violence. ""I was shocked by the numbers. This level of violence is alarming for a city that is not in a war zone. And civilians are the most affected, their freedom and human rights are systematically violated,"" Ms Oliveira said. She too blamed poor police operations against criminals for most of the shootouts. Interestingly, the data showed that the hardest-hit areas shared a common profile, she said. ""It's very clear that the people being affected by this violence are young and black. You don't see this type of police operation in neighbourhoods that are not favelas."" Notifications made on Fogo Cruzado app show the number of shootings in Rio between July of last year and January Rio's military police rejected the criticism towards its operations, saying they are all ""meticulously planned"" to avoid casualties among civilians. ""In order to prevent criminal actions, systematic operations are needed in places where the criminal wave is more recurrent. And shootings against policemen when they enter these areas, in many cases, result in victims on both sides,"" they said in a statement to the BBC. Many shootouts take place in close proximity to civilians Lives are often put on hold, as basic services such as electricity, water and transport are frequently interrupted by shootings. Rio's train operator said last year it was planning to stop services on one line indefinitely because of gun violence next to the tracks. Shops and hospitals are also forced to shut. In 2011, a suspected drug trafficker who was exchanging fire with police stormed a public health clinic in an attempt to hide himself, terrifying patients inside - he was later arrested and nobody was hurt. The clinic then temporarily suspended works due to insecurity. Schools and universities in dangerous neighbourhoods have often cancelled classes, sometimes for days, affecting thousands of students. In some areas, teachers and children were being taught at school how to look for cover in the case of gun fights. Two years ago, shootings around some schools in Mare, one of Rio's most violent areas, were so frequent that teachers decided to cut the classes short: they would start later, at 08:00, and finish one hour earlier, at 15:30. That, they said, was because shootouts often occurred at 07:00, when police officers changed shifts. In many neighbourhoods of Rio, criminal gangs are the de-facto rulers ""Civilians in Rio's favelas end up in the crossfire, being victims in their own houses. They are forced to live under these circumstances, which is absurd,"" said Ivan Marques, executive director of human rights group Instituto Sou da Paz. ""The anti-drug policy in Brazil chose this wrong option, of militarising the issue. You have an enemy, not a criminal. And this is the collateral effect of this war between police and the organised crime."" And then there are the stray bullets. In 2003, Luciana Novaes was in the canteen at her university in a neighbourhood in northern Rio next to a favela, when a shootout erupted between drug traffickers and police. Shops nearby had closed because of the violence, but the university had not. It was around 09:00. Ms Novaes, who was 19 at the time, was in a break between exams when a stray bullet hit her in the jaw. She said she could not miss the exam because of the scholarship she had from the university. The bullet went on to injure her vertebrae, leaving her quadriplegic. ""It's a very difficult situation. There is no day, no time, no place. I was inside the university when it happened. People usually avoid getting out at night, but it's risky at anytime,"" Ms Novaes said. The police say all operations are ""meticulously planned"" to avoid casualties among civilians She spent a year and a half in the intensive care unit of a hospital, where doctors had put her chance of recovery at 1%. If Ms Novaes managed to survive, they said, she would be in a vegetative state for the rest of her life. That did not quite happen. She slowly recovered her speech and the ability to eat. She is still dependent on mechanical ventilation and on two nurses, day and night. She also undergoes two physiotherapy sessions every day and two speech therapies a week - the university was forced by the Brazilian justice system to pay for her treatment. And last year, at 33, she was elected the first ever paraplegic councilwoman for Rio - it was such a novelty that the historic building had to be adapted to her needs. ""What we're living in is calamity,"" Ms Novaes said. ""People are crying out for help."" Many favelas are dangerous - but children still find the space to play Hers is a remarkable case of overcoming the odds, but it is an exception. Brazil was the country with the largest number of deaths by stray bullets in Latin America and the Caribbean between 2014 and 2015, according to aUnited Nations report.,external The study, which looked into online media reports, said there were 197 incidents, 98 dead and 115 injured - someone is considered a victim when they had no involvement or influence in the shooting. Nothing new to the people of Rio. In the 1990s, incidents with stray bullets were so frequent that then-Mayor Cezar Maia famously said in a newspaper interview that the city had become a ""tropical Bosnia"". Rio's geography, as Ms Novaes' case shows, is an unexpected contributing factor. Numerous favelas have been built on the hills that overlook the city, meaning that the violence up there, where many of the shootings take place, is felt by those sometimes in neighbourhoods metres away. The most recent official statistics about stray bullets publicly available are from 2011, when five people died and 41 others were injured. But Rio de Paz, the NGO, has documented incidents involving children: in the past ten years, 31 died in the city, 18 of them between 2015 and 2017 alone. Activists say the worst affected are often black and young people who live in poor neighbourhoods ""The shootings have a devastating impact. This is a generation that lives under threat, under fear of seeing themselves in the crossfire,"" Mr Costa, from Rio de Paz, said. ""And this tragedy has colour and a social component: it often affects the poorest. The society ignores it because it happens, by and large, away from the richest regions."" Sofia arrived at the hospital already dead. The senselessness of her death caused an outcry even in Rio, where residents have become so used to crime that they rarely react to violence. ""But this is not an isolated case,"" said Mr Costa. ""We live in an environment of fear. Families live in constant mourning, looking at the picture of the victim hanging on the wall, with the face of a child that will never be seen again."" His group organised a demonstration remembering the victims of stray bullets, and signs with the names of the 31 children killed were put on Copacabana beach in January. The car being chased by police that night in Iraja stopped only when it flipped on the street. The suspect was arrested and officials seized a gun. Police said they were investigating how the shootout unfolded and, almost two months on, it was still unclear where the shot that killed Sofia came from. But activists say many cases end up unsolved, with those responsible for the deaths rarely identified or punished. In many neighbourhoods, shootouts have become a part of daily life Sofia's parents are now trying to resume their lives. ""We live surrounded by violence. We see it in newspapers, on television. It's a calamity,"" her father said. ""We don't want this to happen with anyone else, a child or an adult."" ""But we're sure that our daughter is in a place better than ours. She was too good to be in this world."" All pictures copyrighted. An education clouded by violence Â© 2025 BBC.

"Kuenssberg: A question of when, not if for indyref2?","Nicola Sturgeon has hardly made a secret of her belief that Scotland's different attitude to the EU possibly justifies a second independence referendum. At Westminster and Holyrood in recent months there's been a building sense that she has made up her mind to call a vote. Those close to her are careful to emphasise that there is no final decision. She, herself, is at pains to say she has not reached a conclusion. But even if it's still an ""if"", she seems clearer on the ""when"". In a documentary tonight, the first minister told me the ""common sense time"" for such a vote would be in autumn 2018. Others have speculated as much, but she is in charge. And her more explicit remarks display how expectation is building. If Ms Sturgeon is now willing to discuss the timing of a second vote in public, consideration of another independence referendum is far beyond the hypothetical. The crucial facet of that calculation is that the SNP believes its best chance of winning is before the EU negotiations are complete. Senior sources suggest Theresa May will be at her most vulnerable when the UK government is consumed with the Brexit negotiations, and that if Scotland is to be offered independence again, that choice must be made before the UK has actually left the European Union. There is though not just the problem that just as her supporters may be enthused, many other Scots will be enraged by being asked to go there again. Just as the first independence referendum galvanised Scottish politics, for others it was divisive, even distressing. But also, it's up to the Westminster government to permit another referendum. There are huge risks for them in denying it, but ministers in London certainly would not grant a vote at the time of the SNP's choosing without a fight. My interview with Nicola Sturgeon will be broadcast onBritain's Biggest Dealon BBC 2 at 21.00 GMT. I have also spoken to  Boris Johnson, David Davis and Tony Blair among others.

Laura Marling: Music to watch girls by,"Laura Marling's latest album was recorded in her adopted home of Los Angeles, so coming back to London to promote it in mid-February has been something of a rude awakening. ""I stupidly got on my bike this morning and got the sleet right in my face,"" she winces. Having dried off and freshened up, she settles down to chat. Marling has a reputation for being a shy, sometimes reluctant interviewee - but LA clearly has rubbed off on her. She chews gum as we talk, laughing bawdily as she discusses her penchant for dating drummers. (""What do they bring to a relationship? Rhythm!"") The 27-year-old also reveals her mum keeps a ""very meticulous scrapbook"" of her career, and admits to cooking up her own brand of Halloumi cheese. ""I'm aiming for direct competition with Alex James,"" she says, referring to the cheese-making Blur bassist. ""But bloody hell, what a boring thing to talk about"". Marling released her first album - Alas, I Cannot Swim - in 2007 So instead we circle back to that new album. It's her sixth, and possibly best, record since she emerged at the age of 17 as part of the indie folk movement that also spawned Mumford and Sons, Lucy Rose and Noah and the Whale. Sumptuous and sensual, Semper Femina adds a hint of West Coast sheen to her delicate, acoustic melodies. Marling generously credits her band and producer Blake Mills for the progression. ""All of the musicality of the album is down to them,"" she says. ""I wanted to be in the middle of it, but for someone else to be painting the picture around it."" If you don't have a Latin textbook to hand, the album's title is taken from a line in Virgil's epic poem The Aeneid. The line is ""varium et mutabile semper femina"", which translates as ""woman is always fickle and changeable"". ""I thought that was very jolly,"" says Marling, apparently without sarcasm. She came across the phrase years ago and had a truncated version - ""Semper Femina"", or ""always a woman"" - tattooed on her leg when she was 21. The singer has Virgil's phrase tattooed on her leg It's a fitting title for a record that explores femininity in all its forms, from the archetypal wild teenager to the artist's muse, while reflecting on female friendships and betrayals. Marling prompted a lot of speculation when she announced in a press release that the album was written during a ""masculine time"" in her life, after she had ""gone on this trip of abandoning any sexuality"". She clarifies that today, saying she was simply trying to write about women from a ""neutral perspective"". But she admits LA prompted a period of androgyny. ""People there are just a bit more far-out,"" she explains. ""Nobody's got a job, they can dress however they want. A lot of my friends are queer or gender-fluid. So I was picking up on that. ""Then there was also my natural relationship with [womanhood]. I'm unsure. I'm unsure of my own femininity or masculinity. ""There are some circumstances in which I employ more of a masculine approach in order to protect myself; and there are circumstances where I indulge in my more feminine side because that vulnerability seems more important. ""I'm interested in the differences between men and women, of which there are plenty, and they need to be understood better."" Such as? ""Well, I was talking to my producer, Blake, and he said he started playing guitar to impress girls. I think when I started playing guitar, it was to impress my dad. ""So Blake's relationship to his instrument is very different to mine and his reason for writing songs is very different to mine but, at the same time, he is extraordinary. And so those differences can be great. ""You can reduce it down to an Eastern idea that men expend energy and women are self-perpetuating."" Marling grew up in rural Hampshire One of the album's big themes is how women are observed - both by men and each other. On Wild Fire, Marling talks about a friend who keeps a ""pen behind her ear"" and constantly jots down her thoughts in a notepad. ""Of course the only part that I want to read is about her time spent with me,"" the singer drawls. ""Wouldn't you die to know how you're seen? Are you getting away with who you're trying to be?"" That's a perennial question for a performer - especially one who seems so cautious of the limelight. ""Would I die to know how I'm seen?"" she asks herself, when the lyric is brought up. ""I don't know! ""I'm aware, obviously, that I'm looked at and considered and reviewed and criticised. But I'm pretty good at steering pretty clear of those [articles], unless they're delivered to me by my mother."" On Nouel, she turns the tables - objectifying one of her real-life friends as a classic muse. ""Oh Nouel, you sing so well / Sing only for me?"" Marling pleads, going on to compare her friend to Gustave Courbet's Origine Du Monde - an 1866 painting of a woman sprawled naked on a bed. This video can not be played Laura Marling performs Nouel, from her new album Semper Femina, for BBC Radio 4's Mastertapes. ""I was interested in what it is like to be made a muse,"" says Marling. ""Nouel is a person who exists, a visual artist I know in Los Angeles, and I took her essence and I exaggerated it into a fantasy. ""She [Nouel] was very flattered by it - but then again she was able to remove herself from it. ""It's her but it's not her. I haven't painted a picture of her - it's my projection of my feelings about how extraordinary I feel she is."" Watch more performances from Semper Femina on BBC Music In black and white this all seems very intellectual and, well, pretentious. Marling is quite aware of how it comes across, poking fun at the ""pseudo-science"" and ""pop psychology"" she espouses. On the album she even sings, ""Lately I wonder if all my pondering takes up too much ground?"" But the music breathes warm life into these high concepts, resulting in a romantic, confessional suite of songs. By the last track, Nothing Not Nearly, Marling has put all the contemplation aside to observe: ""Nothing matters more than love. No nothing. Not nearly."" It reflects her current, contented state of mind. ""I'm loving my late twenties,"" she says. ""The closer I get to 30, the more at ease I feel with myself."" Each of her albums has contributed to that sense of self, she continues. ""This one was about understanding femininity and masculinity. The last one was understanding solitude. ""Before that was heartbreak, before that was freedom and before that was anger. It's like I'm tackling the world one emotion at a time!"" So what's next? Rebellion? Passion? Paranoia? ""Possibly. Or fear, given the era that we're seemingly stepping into,"" she says. ""It's not been good."" Marling won a Brit award for best British female in 2011 She talks about the ""horrifying but unbearably addictive quality"" of President Trump, saying she's constantly checking her phone for the latest update. While the Trump era has already prompted a surge in political protest songs, Marling has trouble viewing this as a positive. ""I don't think anyone would wish that on the world for the sake of writing a good song. That's not the purpose of art - to encounter animosity for the sake of having something to do. ""A singer, who's now a big singer, once said to me: 'It'd be so cool to be really heartbroken because it'd be good for my songwriting."" ""I was like, 'You silly, naive wally!' Never wish that on yourself. It's unbearable."" Semper Femina is out on 10 March. Laura Marling is currently on tour around the UK.

The rise of unusual business qualifications,"You can now do an MBA in horseracing Steve Gibson says he has made it clear that people should never approach him for any betting advice. ""I'm a terrible punter!"" he insists. The 36-year-old does, however, often get asked for tips because of the university course he is enrolled on - an MBA (Master of Business Administration) in thoroughbred horseracing industries. Launched in 2015, the two-year course at Liverpool University has been specially designed for people who want to take up a senior administrative or leadership role in the sport. A sister MBA at the college is called football industries. While the two courses sound like a most enjoyable way to spend your time at university, they are in fact part of a growing trend - the rise of specialised MBAs. MBAs have long been considered a must-have for ambitious young people seeking a fast-tracked and successful career in business. The celebrated post-graduate qualification is supposed to teach you all you need to be a future company leader, and places on MBA courses at the world's most prestigious universities are highly sought after, and therefore very difficult to get accepted on. Mr Gibson is juggling the MBA with working for the British Horseracing Association Yet while it used to be the case that having a standard MBA was all you needed, such has been the rise in the number of colleges offering them, and people gaining the qualification, that specialised MBAs are now being increasingly offered with the aim of giving people an advantage in the industry they wish to join. ""Specialisation gives universities and students a way to stand out,"" says Anke Arnaud, associate professor of management at Embry-Riddle Aeronautics University in Florida. ""If everyone is offering an MBA programme, you have to find a way to differentiate, to innovate. ""It starts with attracting lecturers who have a depth of knowledge, and courses that are hip, in the now, and sexy. ""There's a need to offer something different to cater to specific careers."" At Liverpool University the horseracing MBA includes the study of marketing, sponsorship, the media, sports law, regulation, and horse welfare, explains the head of the course, Neil Coster. Students also go on a number of field trips, including seeing behind the scenes at a race day at Haydock Park, near Liverpool, and a visit to the UK's National Stud in Newmarket, in the east of England, the country's centre of racehorse breeding. The idea for the course came from industry bodies the British Horseracing Authority and the Horseracing Betting Levy Board. Mr Coster says: ""They saw a need for a master's level education programme that would assist people already working in the industry to prepare and upskill for senior management positions, and help career changers to facilitate a move into the industry."" Neil Coster, left, says the horseracing MBA covers all aspects of the industry Those enrolled on the football MBA at Liverpool get to visit the headquarters of European football governing body Uefa, which is based in the Swiss town of Nyon. And if that wasn't prestigious enough, last year they also visited nearby Tranmere Rovers. Liverpool's football MBA is in fact one of the oldest specialised versions of the qualification, and is now in its 20th year. The football MBA can be a big help in the big business world of football ""There was clearly a need for graduates with an excellent knowledge of management disciplines and their applications to football,"" says Babatunde Buraimo, a senior lecturer on the course. The football MBA takes one year to complete full time, and costs Â£15,000 for UK nationals, or Â£21,500 for overseas students. The horseracing qualification costs from Â£7,500 per annum for two years. Marie-Pierre Serret says she knows all about the value of a specialised MBA because without one she had struggled to secure a fulfilling job in the aviation industry. Despite having a masters degree in international business and marketing, the 43-year-old Frenchwoman says she spent a number of years being bumped from job to job, including working as a flight attendant and a check-in clerk. Marie-Pierre Serret says the aviation MBA helped her secure a good job So a few years ago she sold her house and enrolled on an MBA in aviation management at Florida's Embry-Riddle Aeronautics University. It wasn't cheap, costing Â£33,000 for the course, which takes between one-and-a-half and two years. ""This specialised MBA is the missing link,"" says Ms Serret, who now works as a research assistant for an Embry-Riddle aviation business professor. Projects she has been involved in include working out the marketability of an aeroplane prototype, and advising the Puerto Rican government. Some 1,200 miles (2,000km) north of Florida, Schulich Business School in Toronto, Canada, offers a 16-month MBA in global mining. Marcia Annisette, associate professor of accounting at Schulich, says: ""A cookie cutter MBA is so popular now that there's a push to have a strong subset of skills."" Despite the rising popularity of specialist MBAs, they do have their critics, who argue that as so much time is dedicated to focusing on the specific industry, not enough hours are dedicated to teaching business fundamentals. Schulich Business School says the mining industry asked for its specialist MBA ""With only so much classroom time, taking a focused MBA would lead one to miss valuable lessons,"" says John Paul Engel, lecturer of entrepreneurship at the University of Iowa. Meanwhile, Michal Strahilevitz, marketing professor at Duke University in North Carolina, cautions that she has seen scores of individuals who have pursued specialisation only to then discover that the specific profession wasn't quite for them. Others warn that holders of specialised MBAs may struggle to secure the really senior jobs because the qualifications don't yet have the kudos of a general MBA. Marlena Corcoran, chief executive of Athena Mentor, an international university admission counselling company, says: ""A person with a specialised MBA is likely to wind up working for a person with a [general] MBA.""

The window cleaner who fell 47 storeys and lived,"Only half of the people who fall three storeys survive. From 10 storeys almost no-one does. This is the tale of a window cleaner who survived a 47-floor fall from the roof of a New York skyscraper. ""I loved to see the windows really clean,"" Alcides Moreno says. ""I liked the water and the soap, how you press the squeegee. ""We would start at the top and clean all the way to the bottom, I loved it."" Moreno and his younger brother Edgar set out to clean the windows of the 47-floor luxury Solow Tower building in Manhattan's Upper East side on the morning of 7 December 2007. They took the lift up to the top and walked out on to the roof, the temperature hovering around freezing. But moments later, disaster struck. When they climbed on to the 16ft-wide (4.9m) washing platform the cables holding it in place ""slipped from their attachment point"", according to the United States Department of Labor accident report. ""On the left side the cable came off first. That was my brother's part. My brother fell off, all the way down,"" Alcides Moreno says. Edgar plummeted 472ft (144m), landing in a narrow alley. By the time he reached the ground it's estimated he would have been travelling at more than 120mph. Alcides Moreno's side of the scaffold broke loose soon after, and he too started accelerating towards the ground. At street level, firefighters and paramedics found a harrowing scene. Edgar Moreno had landed on a wooden fence, his body was severed and he couldn't be helped. Alcides Moreno was found crouching among a pile of twisted metal, clutching the scaffold controls. Still breathing, he is said to have tried, unsuccessfully, to stand up. Rabbit hole in farmer's field leads to 'mystery caves' Rock arch featured in Game of Thrones collapses into the sea Five-year-old girl makes history as youngest US Spelling Bee finalist Firefighters recall how they began to move him in small increments ""like a fragile egg"", knowing that one wrong move could have killed him. The men's safety harnesses and lifelines, together with some soap and a bucket of hot water - the steam still rising from it - were discovered on the roof next to the scaffold rig. Alcides Moreno (centre) met the New York Fire Department members who rescued him in 2008 Alcides Moreno was rushed to a nearby hospital and induced into a coma. He had sustained injuries to his brain, spinal column, chest and abdomen, and had fractures to his ribs, right arm and both legs. He underwent numerous operations, including having a catheter inserted in his brain to reduce swelling. He received 24 pints of blood. ""If you're looking for a medical miracle, this certainly qualifies,"" Dr Herbert Pardes, the then president and CEO of New York-Presbyterian Hospital told a press conference at the time. ""The survival rate even from a four-storey fall is not very good,"" Dr Glenn Asaeda from the New York City Fire Department said. ""A higher hand was in control here."" Alcides Moreno spoke to the BBC World Service programmeOutlook Listen again to the interview Alcides Moreno woke up nearly three weeks later, on Christmas Day 2007, with his wife, Rosario, at his bedside. ""My mind was so blurry,"" he says. He has no recollection of the fall itself. Did he know what had happened to his brother? ""I understood that he must be dead because I looked around and saw only me and my wife,"" he says. Alcides Moreno, his wife, Rosario, and one of their sons An investigation into the accident found that the scaffolding hadn't been properly maintained and that new motorised cables, which attached the window washing platform to the building, had not been properly anchored to the roof. Accident investigators also concluded that although Alcides Moreno had stepped on to the scaffold without wearing a safety harness, this did not prove that he had refused to use it. Since he had also not yet retrieved his window washing equipment from the roof they said that he might still have intended to go back and put on the harness before starting work. Speculation continues as to how he survived. By holding tight as he fell, did the scaffolding take most of the impact? Did the scaffolding somehow surf the air? Did Alcides Moreno bounce off the side of the building on the way down, slowing his fall? The two brothers, originally from Ecuador, had arrived in the US in the 1990s looking for work. Edgar Moreno (left) and Alcides ""Losing him was a big deal for me,"" Alcides Moreno explains. ""Edgar lived with me in New Jersey, and we shared a lot of things. He worked with me and died working with me. ""I believe I felt melancholic for about three years. That's how long it took me to recover and accept his death. It was like losing a child, because he was younger than me."" Alcides Moreno received a substantial compensation payout and he and his family moved to Phoenix, Arizona. He says the warm weather there is good for his bones. ""I have all the scars on my body and because of the back injuries, I can't run, only walk,"" he says. ""I'm not like I used to be. But thank God I can walk, that is amazing for me."" Now 46, Moreno says he would clean windows again if he could - he doesn't have a problem with heights. But he doesn't work for health reasons. He estimates that he is 80% of the person he used to be. Alcides Moreno is not afraid of heights ""When I ask something, I don't finish the question,"" he says. ""There are things I don't do well. It must be a consequence [of the accident]."" The experience on 7 December 2007 changed his life in other ways too. ""I used to think a lot about me and only me,"" Moreno says. ""I would provide for the family and think that was good enough. Then I realised how important my wife and kids are."" This video can not be played Listen: Alcides Moreno describes the moment disaster struck Last year, Alcides Moreno became a father for the fourth time. He seems overjoyed when talking about his boy of eight months. ""I keep asking myself why I lived. I have a new baby - he must be the reason, to raise this kid and tell him my history.""

Just as the first independence referendum galvanised Scottish politics, for others it was divisive, even distressing. But also, it's up to the Westminster government to permit another referendum.
