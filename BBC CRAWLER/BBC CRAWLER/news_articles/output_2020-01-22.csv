LiveLiveOpening statements in Trump impeachment trial4 minutes ago4 minutes ago Wednesday round-upWednesday round-up39 minutes ago Not a great poll for the presidentNot a great poll for the president49 minutes ago No respite for under-caffeinated senatorsNo respite for under-caffeinated senators,"The third impeachment trial in US history is under way with the case against President Trump Democrat Adam Schiff said Founding Father Alexander Hamilton devised impeachment to stop someone like Trump From Switzerland, President Trump decried the trial as a ""disgrace"" Trump is accused of seeking help from Ukraine to get himself re-elected and of obstructing Congress Holly Honderich and Max Matza That's it from us for today. To recap, House Democrats have opened arguments in the Trump impeachment trial. Adam Schiff urged Republican senators to join them in voting to remove Trump from office to ""protect our democracy"". He warned that senators would ""also undermine our global standing""
if they do not oust the Republican president. Attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump jokingly warned he might confront Democrats by coming to ""sit right in the front row and stare at their corrupt faces"". Democrats have up to three days to make their case. Trump's
defence team will have three days after that for rebuttal. The trial could conclude as soon as next week. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer speaks to reporters during a recess in the Senate trial Just as the Senate trial gets underway, slightly more Americans say that President Trump should be removed from office, according to the latest poll from Pew Research Center. 51%of Americans say the president should be removed by the Senate trial, while46%say Trump should stay. These results are starkly divided along partisan lines:85%of Democrats think Trump should be kicked out while86%of Republican voters think he should stay. The country is more united when it comes to Trump's alleged wrongdoing. 63%of Americans say Trump has ""definitely"" or ""probably"" done something illegal. An even larger majority -70%- say he has ""definitely"" or ""probably"" done something unethical. Joel GunterBBC News, at the trial By late afternoon, some senators in the chamber had begun to
look like the long hours of detailed evidence were taking their toll. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas congresswoman and Democratic impeachment manager, was walking senators through the movements of various
players in the Ukraine scandal, interspersing her prepared statement with audio
and video clips. It's a convoluted story to follow, even for those already
familiar. And there is a lot more evidence to get through - the Democratic House
managers laid out their case slowly and meticulously today, as they did
yesterday. The brief they submitted before the trial was more than 100 pages of
heavily footnoted evidence. By contrast, the president's team submitted seven
pages, with no references. The defence will begin its oral arguments on
Saturday. If witnesses and new evidence are admitted, senators may sit
through these sessions for several more weeks. They are allowed only water and
milk - no coffee - to keep them going, and the occasional piece of chocolate
from the bipartisan Senate confectionery draw. So young staffers ferry glasses of
water constantly around the chamber. Plus one glass of milk, while I was
inside, for the Republican Senator Tom Cotton. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

During the recess, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer approached microphones only to find that top Republican John Cornyn was already being interviewed. So he waited patiently for his turn. When Cornyn made a remark about witnesses testifying to Congress, Schumer chimed in to say he agrees. Yup, you read that right - a top Democrat concurred with a top Republican. Congress may be bitterly split over impeachment, but it seems the two parties in the upper chamber can occasionally agree on something. Allow Twitter content?

Joel GunterBBC Journalist, World Long-serving Democratic senator from Delaware Tom Carper spoke to the BBC's Joel Gunter during a recess, to discuss what the atmosphere was like in
the chamber amid a deeply partisan process. ""A lot of people think we just fight in the Senate and
in the House, but we are actually friends for the most part. It's a friendly
atmosphere,"" he said. ""As I sat there today listening to Senator Schiff
speak, for a long time, I was impressed - the members didn't start reading, or
talking, they weren't sitting smiling or rolling their eyes. They were
intent."" The Senate sat in session for 12 hours last night. Senator
Carper said he held his concentration by writing hourly summaries of the
testimony in his journal. ""I felt stronger as the night wore on. Somebody
asked me, 'What are you on?' I said, 'I'm on Democracy!"" Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer is shooting down suggestions that a witness swap will take place to allow Democrats to get a witness to testify in exchange for a Republican-picked witness. Democrats hope to get former US National Security Adviser John Bolton into the witness chair, while Republicans want to speak to the son of former US Vice-President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, whose work for a Ukrainian energy firm spawned accusations of corruption from Trump and his allies. ""Witnesses should have something to do with and direct knowledge of the charges against the president,"" said Schumer, referring to rumours of ""witness reciprocity"". ""You know, we donât need to have witnesses that have nothing to do with this that are trying to distract Americans from the truth."" Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy has warned Fox News viewers to beware of people throwing ""monkey dust... trying to distract from what is the crux of the issue"". ""If we look at the crux and remain focused on that crux, then we'll establish whether the president did something illegal or not."" It's unclear whether Cassidy, a medical doctor, is aware that ""monkey dust"" is also the street name for an illegal synthetic drug (methylenedioxypyrovalerone) that is also known as ""bath salts"".

Jon SopelBBC North America Editor Why is Trump weighing in from Switzerland? There was one thing in particular that Trump said which was kind of like a red rag to a bull. It's when he said basically: ""Well things are going very well, we have all the information, and they [Democrats] have none of it."" Well, if you want a fair trial, then maybe that information should be made available. We keep using the word ""trial"", and the words ""jurors"" and ""witnesses"" and ""evidence"", but we must not lose sight that this is a political process. We saw that clearly last night when the first votes started coming in. In a vote that split completely along party lines, 53 Republicans said ""no we should not be able to subpoena the White House for documents"", while 47 Democrats said ""yes we should"". So we have Donald Trump kind of goading and saying: ""Look I've got the information. We know what happened, but we're not going to tell you."" I think this might inflame public opinion. Polls are already indicating that a clear majority believe that evidence should be handed over and witnesses should be called. Are journalists overstating the significance of all this? Politicians always over-estimate the extent to which the general public are paying attention to their words. It is a condition not unique to the United States of America. It is a global phenomenon that whatever politicians say, they think the public will find tremendously important and fantastically interesting. But, amazingly, members of the public are getting on with their lives. That is an important thing to bear in mind. Some of us - obsessive forlorn political journalists like me - are watching in immense detail, while other people are just getting on with it. Some people will be watching this for its historical important. But for the overwhelming majority of Americans, I expect there to be just a few fleeting moments of attention paid to the serious discussion taking place in Washington. It doesn't seem to be changing the lives, or minds, of the American people all that much.    Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff, representing Democrats, has just wrapped up about 2.5 hours of opening arguments, leading to Leader Mitch McConnell to announce a short recess. ""If we don't stand up to this peril today, we will write the history of our decline with our own hand,"" he warned the senators who will serve as Trump's jury. Meanwhile, Trump has tweeted in reference to his July call with the Ukrainian leader. ""NO PRESSURE"" Trump wrote, referring to the Ukrainian president's statement that he did not feel pressured to open political investigations into Trump's domestic opponent Joe Biden, in exchange for the unfreezing of US military aid. A letter signed by 21 Republican state attorneys general and released on Wednesday argues that impeachment ""threatensallfuture elections and establishes a dangerous historical precedent"" for US politics. ""That new precedent will erode the separation of powers shared by the executive and legislative branches by subjugating future Presidents to the whims of the majority opposition party in the House of Representatives,"" wrote the top lawmen of 21 states. They claim the abuse of power charge ""is based upon a constitutionally-flawed theory"" that is ""infinitely expansive and subjective"" because it is based on the president's alleged motivations. They say the other charge - obstructing justice - is ""equally flawed"" because it would render executive privilege ""meaningless"". ""Impeachment should never be a partisan response to one party losing a presidential election,â the 14-page letter says. ""If successful, an impeachment proceeding nullifies the votes of millions of citizens."" The only Republican attorneys general not to sign the letter come from Arizona, Idaho, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Carolina, Utah and Wyoming Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse (right) holds up his coffee, which is banned from the Senate floor Amy Klobuchar has taken a break from 2020 campaigning to serve as a trial juror Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow is searched on his way into the Capitol building A protester holds a sign on Capitol Hill with the Supreme Court in the background Supreme Court Judge John Roberts oversaw a case earlier on Wednesday before coming to Congress to oversee impeachment Republican leader Mitch McConnell walks the Senate halls earlier on Wednesday In his opening remarks, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff kept mentioning Founding Father Alexander Hamilton. But what does Hamilton - the first US treasury secretary and now the subject of an award-winning musical - have to do with Donald Trump's impeachment? Hamilton penned the two essays devoted to impeachment in the Federalist papers. Hamilton wrote that a political impeachment trial is different to a criminal trial. In other words, an illegal act is not required for impeachment. ""Hamilton seems to have predicted the rise of Donald Trump with staggering prescience,"" Schiff said. Joel GunterBBC Journalist Adam Schiff began his opening remarks by
sombrely quoting Alexander Hamilton: ""When a man unprincipled in private
life desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper, possessed of considerable
talents... When such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity - to
join in the cry of danger to liberty..."" Though the president was not in the dock, the target of Schiff's history lesson
was impossible to miss. The Democratic congressman went on to rehearse the impeachment
managers' arguments against President Trump, from the scandal with Russia to
the Hunter Biden business in Ukraine. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell sat still, fixing an unbroken glare on Schiff. No desk in the Senate chamber was empty. All the Senate Democratic presidential
candidates were there - Amy Klobuchar took notes; Elizabeth Warren sat upright,
attentively; Bernie Sanders sat low in his seat, yawning occasionally and
holding his head in his hands; and Michael Bennet was there, too. Schiff returned to Alexander Hamilton later in his remarks, saying Trump had
""acted precisely as Hamilton and his contemporaries had feared"" when
they framed the remedy of impeachment. He implored the gathered senators to act
impartially. ""It is up to you to be the tribunal that Hamilton envisioned,"" he
said. He quoted John F Kennedy: ""With a good conscience our
only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds..."" The senior Republican senators
showed no reaction. This video can not be played Trump impeachment trial: Five possible twists ahead President Donald Trump is accused of an abuse of power and
obstructing Congress and most believe it's a foregone conclusion that
Trump will be acquitted at the end of this process, because his party controls
the Senate. But
could the trial go off script? The BBC's Anthony Zurcher and Shrai Popat take a
front-row seat. Senators were just warned that they are ""commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment,"" but quite a few say they will find it rather difficult to abide by the stringent rules ""Every senator will have some trouble - we are not, by nature, silent,"" Missouri Republican Senator Roy Blunt toldthe New York Times,external. ""The desire to hear the sound of your own voice will be frustrated by that rule."" In addition to the vow of silence, senators are also banned from using cell phones and are required to leave them outside the chamber in cubbies. In a possible violation of the rules, several senators have been seen wearing smartwatches. After Senator Ted Cruz was criticised because his official Twitter account continued posting during Tuesday's hearing, his team posted a cartoon of a cell phone with the caption ""come and take it"". That slogan is popularly used by gun rights activists, but it actually originates in the 1835 Battle of Gonzales that took place during the Texas Revolution. Allow Twitter content?

A Monmouth University poll released this week shows that a majority of the country thinks the trial should allow new evidence, but that support is deeply partisan. Here are the key stats: Lead impeachment manager, Democrat Adam Schiff lays out the timeline of events leading to Trump's impeachment. Schiff has emphasised Trump's ""infamous"" 25 July phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky - at the centre of today's trial. So what's he talking about? A rough transcript of this conversation, released in September, revealed Trump had urged President Zelensky to investigate former US Vice-President Joe Biden, the front-runner to take on Trump in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son, who held a board position with a Ukrainian gas firm. Just 91 minutes after this phone call, the White House sought to freeze aid to Ukraine, a newly disclosed government email suggested last month. Democrats argue that the $391m (Â£316m) in military aid temporarily blocked to Ukraine is proof of Trump's abuse of office. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff begins by thanking senators for their ""patience"" in listening to arguments until 2am local time on Wednesday. He then quotes US Founding Father Alexander Hamilton about the need for impeachment as a mechanism to remove ""a despot"" from office. ""They did not intend for the matter of impeachment to be used frequently or as a matter of policy,"" he says, but it was put in the constitution ""for a reason"". The writers of the constitution, he said, ""devised a remedy as powerful as the evil it was meant to combat - impeachment"". In a clear reference to Trump, he said the impeachment clause was placed there for ""a man who would would seek to subvert the interests of the nation, a man who would... seek office by cheating at an election.""

Trade tensions rise as US threatens car tariffs,"Trade tensions with the US have spiralled after the chancellor, Sajid Javid, took a defiant stance at Davos. US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin has threatened new tariffs on UK carmakers after the chancellor defied pressure to cancel a new tax on tech firms. Mr Javid said the UK would not back down over the tax which will hit US firms like Apple, Amazon and Facebook. A trade deal with the EU would take priority over one with the US after the UK leaves the EU this month, he added. Both officials said Boris Johnson and Donald Trump would discuss the trade agreement and the tech tax this week during the World Economic Forum in Davos. The UK government sees a new trade deal with the US as a high priority after Britain leaves the European Union at the end of this month. But some parts of the UK economy are closely integrated with the EU, its largest trading partner. UK told to 'hold fire' on April tech tax France agrees to delay tax on tech giants The comments from Mr Javid and Mr Mnuchin came during a panel discussion at the annual gathering of business and government representatives in Switzerland. The new tax is aimed at firms that do a lot of business in the UK but don't pay taxes based on the size of their sales. The US is considering retaliatory tariffs on European car exports if a new tech tax is imposed France this week agreed to suspend a similar measure after the US had threatened to impose new levies on French exports of wine, cheese and handbags. France will not levy their tech tax until the end of the year to allow time for a multilateral coordinated agreement on tax reform to be agreed. Mr Javid said that while the UK would like to see an international agreement, he planned to go ahead with the introduction of the new multibillion pound tax, which is due to take effect in April. Mr Javid described the new tax as ""proportionate"". US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said: ""We think the digital tax is discriminatory in nature... if people want to arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies we'll consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies."" Former UK chancellor, George Osborne, told the BBC that he thought the government would be wary of provoking the US over the new tax. ""It will be a very brave British government that walks into a trade war with the United States at the very moment when centrepiece of its economic policy is to strike a trade deal with the United States,"" he told the Today Programme. The UK, along with several other European countries, wants to limit the tech giants' ability to avoid taxes. They argue taxes should be based on where the digital activity takes place, not where firms have their headquarters. So if a UK consumer searches for a product or posts things online, and advertising is sold alongside those pages, the business should count - for tax purposes - as taking place in the UK. But it has proven difficult to agree exactly how a new system would work. So some countries including the UK, France, Italy, Austria and Turkey, have considering imposing unilateral levies. But trade officials in Washington say US firms are being unfairly targeted. The UK is under pressure to follow France's example and delay its plan to levy tax worth 2% of the revenues of search engines, social media companies and online marketplaces, a change which would bolster public finances by Â£500m a year. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is overseeing efforts to find a joint solution, has urged national governments to wait for a multilateral agreement. Secretary General Angel Gurriatold the BBCthat without that there would be a ""cacophony and a mess"" of 40 countries going their own way with ""tensions rising all over the place"". Mr Gurria said that the UK government should ""absolutely hold fire and contribute to a multilateral solution"". Industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) called for the UK and US ""to explore all options that avoid restrictive measures"" in order to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war developing. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: ""The US is one of UK automotive's most important global partners, second only to the EU in trade terms, so the continued threat of additional tariffs that could endanger the viability of our sector is of huge concern.""

Monty Python's Flying Circus, the groundbreaking comedy series that made Jones and his fellow cast members international stars, first aired on BBC One in October 1969. Surreal, anarchic and bawdily irreverent, the show's blend of live-action sketches and animated interludes mocked both broadcasting conventions and societal norms. Jones and Palin had met at Oxford, while Cleese, Graham Chapman and Eric Idle studied at Cambridge. After university, they took part in various comedy shows before forming Monty Python with US-born animator Terry Gilliam. After four series, the troupe moved to the big screen to make Arthurian spoof Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Monty Python's Life of Brian, a controversial parody of Biblical epics. Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, their final film as a collective, returned to the original series' sketch-based format. The surviving members reunited periodically after Chapman's death in 1989, most notably for a run of live shows at the O2 in London in 2014. ""Now, you listen here! He's not the Messiah.

Monty Python's Flying Circus, the groundbreaking comedy series that made Jones and his fellow cast members international stars, first aired on BBC One in October 1969. Surreal, anarchic and bawdily irreverent, the show's blend of live-action sketches and animated interludes mocked both broadcasting conventions and societal norms. Jones and Palin had met at Oxford, while Cleese, Graham Chapman and Eric Idle studied at Cambridge. After university, they took part in various comedy shows before forming Monty Python with US-born animator Terry Gilliam. After four series, the troupe moved to the big screen to make Arthurian spoof Monty Python and the Holy Grail and Monty Python's Life of Brian, a controversial parody of Biblical epics. Monty Python's The Meaning of Life, their final film as a collective, returned to the original series' sketch-based format. The surviving members reunited periodically after Chapman's death in 1989, most notably for a run of live shows at the O2 in London in 2014. ""Now, you listen here! He's not the Messiah.

"UK has 'crossed Brexit finish line', says Johnson","Boris Johnson has said the UK has ""crossed the Brexit finish line"" after Parliament passed legislation implementing the withdrawal deal. The EU Bill, which paves the way for the country to leave the bloc on 31 January, is now awaiting royal assent. The PM said the UK could now ""move forwards as one"" and put ""years of rancour and division behind it"". The EU's top officials are expected to sign the agreement in the coming days, while MEPs will vote on it next week. The European Parliament will meet on 29 January to debate the agreement, which sets out the terms of the UK's ""divorce"" settlement with the EU, the rights of EU nationals resident in the UK and British expats on the continent and arrangements for Northern Ireland. Its ratification is expected to prove a formality. The UK will officially leave the bloc at 23:00 GMT on 31 January - more than three and a half years after the country voted for Brexit in a referendum in June 2016. What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? Devolution politicians reject PM's Brexit bill Government loses first votes since election From 1 February, the UK will enter into an 11-month transition period in which it will continue to follow EU rules but without representation in the bloc's institutions. This arrangement will come to an end on 1 January 2021, by which point the two sides hope to have completed negotiations on their future economic and security partnership, at the heart of which the government believes will be an ambitious free trade deal. The government's Brexit Bill, which enshrines the agreement reached by Mr Johnson in October, is one step away from becoming law after completing its passage through Parliament without any changes. MPs overwhelmingly rejected all the changes made to the bill in the House of Lords earlier this week - on citizens' rights, the power of UK courts to diverge from EU law, the independence of the judiciary after Brexit and the consent of the UK's devolved administrations. MPs also removed an amendment which would have obliged the government to negotiate an agreement with the EU to allow unaccompanied children who have claimed asylum elsewhere but have a relative in the UK to be re-united with their family. The bill, as agreed by Parliament, would only compel the government to make a statement on the issue within two months. Ministers insisted they backedthe principle of the Dubs amendment, tabled by the Labour peer Lord Dubs, but argued that there was no point legislating before the UK reached an agreement with the EU on future numbers. Lord Dubs, who has been campaigning on the issue for years, said the outcome was ""bitterly disappointing"" while Green Party MP Caroline Lucas said the government had shown a ""compassion by-pass"". The ratification process will be completed over the next week in time for the 31 January deadline. Belgian politician Charles Michel, who represents the 27 remaining states as president of the European Council, is expected to sign the document in the coming days as will European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Mr Johnson will also sign officially the agreement on behalf of the UK government. The prime minister, who became Tory leader in July on the back of a promise to ""get Brexit done"" and won an overwhelming victory at last month's general election, said Parliamentary approval was a major milestone. ""Parliament has passed the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, meaning we will leave the EU on 31 January and move forwards as one United Kingdom. ""At times it felt like we would never cross the Brexit finish line, but we've done it. Now we can put the rancour and division of the past three years behind us and focus on delivering a bright, exciting future.""

Trade tensions rise as US threatens car tariffsThe US has warned it could start taxing UK car exports if UK's tech tax goes ahead.BusinessComments,"Trade tensions with the US have spiralled after the chancellor, Sajid Javid, took a defiant stance at Davos. US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin has threatened new tariffs on UK carmakers after the chancellor defied pressure to cancel a new tax on tech firms. Mr Javid said the UK would not back down over the tax which will hit US firms like Apple, Amazon and Facebook. A trade deal with the EU would take priority over one with the US after the UK leaves the EU this month, he added. Both officials said Boris Johnson and Donald Trump would discuss the trade agreement and the tech tax this week during the World Economic Forum in Davos. The UK government sees a new trade deal with the US as a high priority after Britain leaves the European Union at the end of this month. But some parts of the UK economy are closely integrated with the EU, its largest trading partner. UK told to 'hold fire' on April tech tax France agrees to delay tax on tech giants The comments from Mr Javid and Mr Mnuchin came during a panel discussion at the annual gathering of business and government representatives in Switzerland. The new tax is aimed at firms that do a lot of business in the UK but don't pay taxes based on the size of their sales. The US is considering retaliatory tariffs on European car exports if a new tech tax is imposed France this week agreed to suspend a similar measure after the US had threatened to impose new levies on French exports of wine, cheese and handbags. France will not levy their tech tax until the end of the year to allow time for a multilateral coordinated agreement on tax reform to be agreed. Mr Javid said that while the UK would like to see an international agreement, he planned to go ahead with the introduction of the new multibillion pound tax, which is due to take effect in April. Mr Javid described the new tax as ""proportionate"". US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said: ""We think the digital tax is discriminatory in nature... if people want to arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies we'll consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies."" Former UK chancellor, George Osborne, told the BBC that he thought the government would be wary of provoking the US over the new tax. ""It will be a very brave British government that walks into a trade war with the United States at the very moment when centrepiece of its economic policy is to strike a trade deal with the United States,"" he told the Today Programme. The UK, along with several other European countries, wants to limit the tech giants' ability to avoid taxes. They argue taxes should be based on where the digital activity takes place, not where firms have their headquarters. So if a UK consumer searches for a product or posts things online, and advertising is sold alongside those pages, the business should count - for tax purposes - as taking place in the UK. But it has proven difficult to agree exactly how a new system would work. So some countries including the UK, France, Italy, Austria and Turkey, have considering imposing unilateral levies. But trade officials in Washington say US firms are being unfairly targeted. The UK is under pressure to follow France's example and delay its plan to levy tax worth 2% of the revenues of search engines, social media companies and online marketplaces, a change which would bolster public finances by Â£500m a year. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is overseeing efforts to find a joint solution, has urged national governments to wait for a multilateral agreement. Secretary General Angel Gurriatold the BBCthat without that there would be a ""cacophony and a mess"" of 40 countries going their own way with ""tensions rising all over the place"". Mr Gurria said that the UK government should ""absolutely hold fire and contribute to a multilateral solution"". Industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) called for the UK and US ""to explore all options that avoid restrictive measures"" in order to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war developing. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: ""The US is one of UK automotive's most important global partners, second only to the EU in trade terms, so the continued threat of additional tariffs that could endanger the viability of our sector is of huge concern.""

"Tesla market value passes Volkswagen to hit $100bnTesla sold more than 367,000 cars last year, just a fraction of its competitors.","Tesla has displaced Volkswagen as the world's second most valuable carmaker, after a dramatic rise in share price pushed its market value to more than $100bn (Â£76.1bn). The milestone sets the stage for chief Elon Musk to collect billions in pay tied to hitting that target. Tesla's share price has more than doubled since October, whenthe firm reported a rare quarterly profit. Shares rose 4% on Wednesday, making its valuation second only to Toyota. Although Mr Musk's company has some way to go to catch up with the Japanese car making giant. Toyota has a stock market valuation of more than $230bn. Some analysts say the rise in price reflects Tesla's performance in recent months, during which it has opened a factory in Shanghai and met its production goals. This month, Tesla said it had delivered more than 367,500 cars last year - up 50% from 2018. Investors expect the new factory to act as a springboard that will allow it to capture more of the Chinese market. Despite the increase, Tesla's sales remain small compared to those of its competitors. Volkswagen delivered almost 11 million vehicles last year,external, whileToyota sold more than 9 million,externalin the first 11 months of 2019. Tesla has also never made an annual profit and it is facing investigations after complaints about battery fires and unexpected acceleration. The company is due to report its latest quarterly results to investors this month. If Tesla sustains the $100bn valuation, it could unlock the first piece of a $2.6bn compensation package for Mr Musk. The plans calls for Mr Musk to receive payouts in shares over 10 years, with the first award contingent on the firm reaching $100bn in market capitalisation and sustaining that value over both a month, and six-month average. Tesla also had to reach $20bn in revenue and earn $1.5bn, after adjusting for items like taxes - thresholds the carmaker reached in 2018. Tesla was valued at about $55bn when the pay deal was approved.

Prince Charles meets Greta Thunberg at Davos,"The Prince of Wales has met teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg at the World Economic Forum in Davos. The pair were introduced after Prince Charles delivered a speech at the event in Switzerland, where sustainability is the main theme. A ""paradigm shift"" is needed in the way the world deals with climate change, he said. He outlined an initiative to encourage ""rapid"" decarbonisation and a shift towards sustainable markets. This video can not be played Prince Charles: 'Do we want to go down in history as the people who did nothing?' Clarence Housetweeted photos of his meeting,externalwith Miss Thunberg, who addressed delegates at the event on Tuesday. Speaking shortly after US President Donald Trump,she strongly criticised politicians and business leadersfor what she said were continuous ""empty words and promises"". Prince Charles, the heir to throne, travelled around 80 miles to Davos from the Swiss city St Gallen in an electric Jaguar to deliver a keynote address to business and political leaders. He said he is launching a ""Sustainable Markets Initiative"", which will bring together private and public sector leaders, heads of charities, and investors to work towards decarbonisation and a transition to sustainable markets. He added that taxes could be used, as well as policies and regulations, to accelerate this shift. His sons, the Duke of Cambridge and Duke of Sussex, and grandchildren have been in his mind throughout his environmental campaigning, he said. He called for 2020 to be ""the year that we put ourselves on the right track"" and for the private sector to ""lead the world out of the approaching catastrophe into which we have engineered ourselves"".

Lloyds joins crowd with new 40% overdraft rates,"The City regulator has stressed that seven out of 10 bank customers will be better off or unchanged as another big bank announces its new overdraft rates. Customers of Lloyds Banking Group will be charged ""personalised"" rates of up to 49.9% from April, but most will pay a rate of 39.9% to go into the red. The latter is the same rate as planned by many of the major High Street banks. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), whichdemanded changes from banks, said the new system was much simpler. ""Customers at some large banks were charged effective arranged overdraft rates in excess of 80% per year once fees and charges are factored in,"" the FCA said. ""Our changes expose the true cost of an overdraft. We have eliminated high prices for unarranged overdrafts. This will result in a fairer distribution of charges, helping vulnerable consumers."" Santander latest bank to set 40% overdraft rate Banks told to stop short-changing loyal savers Banks and building societies will no longer be allowed to charge higher prices for unarranged overdrafts than for arranged overdrafts. The new rules, which come into force in April, require providers to charge a simple annual interest rate on all overdrafts and to get rid of fixed fees. Most banks and building societies have chosen to set a rate very close to 40%. Lloyds Banking Group, which includes the Halifax brand, is no different, with the majority of its customers paying a new annual rate of 39.9% - in effect paying Â£39.90 for each Â£100 borrowed in an overdraft for a whole year. However, there will be various tiers, with Club Lloyds customers paying 27.5% but other customers paying up to 49.9%. The banking giant will look at customers' past financial behaviour when determining which rate to offer. Lloyds said risk-based pricing was standard practice for loans and credit cards and meant it could continue to offer overdrafts to a wider range of customers. In 2017, Lloyds scrapped unarranged overdraft fees and returned item fees - a charge after a customer attempts to make a transaction when they do not have sufficient funds in their account. Christopher Woolard, executive director of strategy and competition at the FCA, said overdrafts were not designed to be used for large amounts for long periods of time and consumers should consider other methods of credit if they find they needed to borrow for longer.

Wuhan: City where the virus began,"The Yangtze (brown) and Han rivers (blue) merge in Wuhan Wuhan may not be a well-known Chinese mega-city like Beijing or Shanghai. But the place where the coronavirus outbreak emerged is, in fact, a crowded metropolis with connections to every part of the globe. Estimates vary on the exact size of the population, with local government officials putting the figure at 11 million, though UN data from 2018 says8.9 million people live in the central Chinese city,external. Either way, the city is around the same size as London, but much bigger than Washington DC. One estimate makes it the42nd biggest city in the world,external, and the seventh biggest in China. And it's the size - and economic clout - of Wuhan that explains why the virus has travelled quickly across Asia, and even to the US. In short, the virus has spread so widely because lots of people visit Wuhan and take the virus home with them. Wuhan was a host city for the 2019 Basketball World Cup - including this match between Argentina and Nigeria Wuhan international airport handled20 million passengers in 2016,external, and offers direct flights to London, Paris, Dubai, and other cities around the world. The city is built along the Yangtze river and,according to its website,external, it is a ""foundation of in both hi-tech manufacturing and traditional manufacturing"". It has a series of industrial zones, 52 ""institutions of higher learning"", and claims more than 700,000 students - including, reportedly, thelargest number of undergraduates in the country,external. Some 230 of the world's 500 biggest companies (as measured by the Fortune Global list) have invested there. There is also notable investment from France - which had a foreign concession in Hankou, in today's Wuhan, between 1886 and 1943. More than 100 French firms have invested in the city andPeugeot-Citroen has a Chinese joint-venture plant there,external. Wuhan can also serve as a gateway to the Three Gorges - a tourist region and home to a huge hydroelectric dam. New China virus 'could mutate and spread further' New China virus: Your questions answered Chinese virus: How worried should we be? So, although the coronavirus originated in a local seafood market, the flow of people in and out of Wuhan has ensured its spread. The US patient, for example, had recently visited Wuhan, as had both Japanese patients. The Korean patient lived there. The case in Thailand is a Chinese tourist from Wuhan. The huge flow of people in and out of Wuhan will only increase as Chinese New Year approaches, and millions of people return home to celebrate. China's National Health Commission said travellers should avoid Wuhan, and that Wuhan residents should not leave the city. But Wuhan's status as one of the biggest - and most connected - places in the world means international cases will almost certainly continue to emerge.

China drug makers soar on virus contagion fears,"A woman wears a mask while walking past the closed Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which has been linked to cases of Coronavirus, in Wuhan Shares in Chinese drug makers have risen sharply as concerns grow over a new virus spreading across the country. Several pharmaceutical giants on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges have risen by their 10% daily limit. The moves follow the confirmation thatthe new strain of coronavirus can pass from person to person. The number of people infected tripled over the weekend, with the outbreak spreading from Wuhan to other major cities. Millions of Chinese people are preparing to travel both within the country and abroad for the New Year holidays. Jiangsu Sihuan Bioengineering, Shandong Lukang Pharmaceutical, and Hengrui Medicine were among the drug makers that gained 10%. Meanwhile, face mask manufacturers Tianjin Teda and Shanghai Dragon also rose by 10%. Stock prices are constrained in China by limits that allow them to move by a maximum of 10% higher or lower in a day. These latest gains follow sharp rises in Chinese pharmaceutical companies' shares yesterday. On the other hand, Chinese airlines, tour and hotel companies have fallen. Shares in state-owned Air China added to yesterday's losses. BTG Hotels Group, which also fell yesterday, has lost more ground today.

Experts in the UK told the BBCthe number of people infected could still be far greater than official figures suggest. In the early 2000s Sars, another coronavirus, killed 774 people across dozens of countries, mostly in Asia.

Virus-hit Chinese city to shut public transport,"This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus Wuhan, a Chinese city of eleven million people, has temporarily shut down its public transport as it tries to halt the outbreak of a new strain of virus. Those living in the city have been advised not to leave, in a week when millions of Chinese are travelling for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. The respiratory illness has spread to other parts of China, with some cases in other countries including the US. There are more than 500 confirmed cases and 17 people have died. Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Chinese virus: How worried should we be? Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began Known for now as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. The Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome) virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus, as is the common cold. All the fatalities so far have been in Hubei, the province around Wuhan. Meanwhile, after a day of discussions in Geneva, the World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee has announced it will not yet declare a ""global emergency"" over the new virus. Director general Dr Tedros Ghebreyesus said more information was needed about the spread of the infection. The committee of health experts will meet again on Thursday. A global emergency is the highest level of alarm the WHO can sound and has previously been used in response to swine flu, Zika virus and Ebola. From Thursday, all flights and passenger train services out of Wuhan have been stopped. Bus, subway and ferry services all shut down from 10:00 local time (02:00 GMT). A special command centre in Wuhan set up to contain the virus said the move was meant to ""resolutely contain the momentum of the epidemic spreading"". Those living in Wuhan had already been told to avoid crowds and minimise public gatherings. State news agency Xinhua said tourist attractions and hotels in the city had been told to suspend large-scale activities while libraries, museums and theatres were cancelling exhibitions and performances. A Lunar New Year prayer-giving ceremony at the city's Guiyuan Temple, which attracted 700,000 people last year, has also been cancelled. The hashtag ""Wuhan is sealed off"" was trending on Chinese social media website Weibo. One user said worries about food and disinfectant made it feel like ""the end of the world"", while another said they were on the ""verge of tears"" when Chinese officials announced the shut-down. The WHO's Dr Ghebreyesus described the latest measures as ""very strong"" and said they would ""not only control the outbreak, they will minimise spread internationally"". Chinese officials said the country was now at the ""most critical stage"" of prevention and control. ""Basically, do not go to Wuhan. And those in Wuhan please do not leave the city,"" said National Health Commission vice-minister Li Bin in one of the first public briefings since the beginning of the outbreak. By James Gallagher, BBC health and science correspondent Wuhan is starting to look like a city in quarantine. Officials had already warned residents not to leave the city and visitors not to come. Now the reported public transport ban - which includes flights - slams many of the routes in and out of the city shut. Subways in Wuhan will be temporarily shut It is a significant attempt to stop the spread of this new virus, which we now know can spread from person to person. Limiting transport will cut the chance of the virus reaching other cities in China and other countries around the world. This all comes just as millions of people are travelling across China for the week-long holiday that is Lunar New Year. If you're struggling for context - imagine shutting down London in the week before Christmas. The big question left is the roads - and whether any of Wuhan's 11 million inhabitants will be able to simply drive away. Officials inHong Kong reported the territory's first two cases,externalon Wednesday and one case was reported in the nearby city of Macau. The patient in Macau is said to be a businesswoman who arrived from Wuhan over the weekend. The first US case was confirmed on Tuesday. President Donald Trump said the situation was ""totally under control"" and that he trusted the information being provided by Chinese authorities. There have been three cases in Thailand, one in Korea, one in Japan and one in Taiwan. Although only about 500 cases have been confirmed, calculations by scientists at the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London suggest there are 4,000 people sick with the virus in Wuhan.

Obituary: Master of the absurd,"Terry Jones had a love of the absurd that contributed much to the anarchic humour of Monty Python's Flying Circus. His style of visual comedy, leavened with a touch of the surreal, inspired many comedians who followed him. It was on Python that he honed his directing skills, notably on Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life. A keen historian, he wrote a number of books and fronted TV documentaries on ancient and medieval history. Python star Terry Jones dies aged 77 Terence Graham Parry Jones was born in Colwyn Bay in north Wales on 1 February 1942. His grandparents ran the local amateur operatic society and staged Gilbert and Sullivan concerts on the town's pier each year His family moved to Surrey when he was four but he always felt nostalgic about his native land. Jones (R) with Palin and Idle in Do Not Adjust Your Set ""I couldn't bear it and for the longest time I wanted Wales back,"" he once said. ""I still feel very Welsh and feel it's where I should be really."" After leaving the Royal Grammar School in Guildford, where he captained the school, he went on to read English at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. However, as he put it, he ""strayed into history"", the subject in which he graduated. While at Oxford he wrote sketches for the Oxford Revue and performed alongside a fellow student, Michael Palin. Jones also got to know Graeme Garden, who suggested that he and Palin join a team of writers and performers on Twice a Fortnight, a BBC sketch show that aired for 10 weeks at the end of 1967. He also wrote for The Frost Report, the series that first saw the future Pythons working together, and in the ITV sketch show, Do Not Adjust Your Set. He and Palin went on to write another show, The Complete and Utter History of Britain, which aired on the London region of ITV in 1969. He grew frustrated with The Complete and Utter History of Britain His frustration at the way the show was put together made Jones decide he wanted to take charge of his own projects. ""It got me really convinced that you have to control everything,"" he said later. ""You not only act in the things, you've got to actually start directing the things as well."" He had the opportunity when Monty Python's Flying Circus launched in October 1969. It was Jones who was the driving force behind abandoning punch lines at the end of sketches and developing what became the show's trademark stream of consciousness. This also took a lot of pressure off the writers, who no longer had to dream up a killer line to round off a sketch. Graham Chapman would appear as an army colonel and declare the sketch over because it was ""too silly"". Alternatively an armoured knight would wander on and hit someone over the head with a rubber chicken. Jones also appeared naked, apart from a collar and tie, playing an organ as a form of punctuation between sketches. The gluttonous Mr Creosote was one of his most memorable Python characters He made something of a speciality of playing middle-aged women, often one of the screeching harridans that populated the show. Possibly his most memorable appearance was in The Meaning of Life as the exploding Mr Creosote who, after a gargantuan feast, misguidedly accepted ""just one wafer thin mint"". Like many of the Pythons, he later found it hard to fathom why the show became such cult viewing ""The thing is we never thought Python was a success when it was actually happening - it was only with the benefit of hindsight."" The Monty Python films enabled Jones to further his skills as a director. After co-directing Monty Python and the Holy Grail he took sole charge of Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life. He remained bemused at the fierce opposition to Life of Brian expressed by many religious groups. ""It wasn't about what Christ was saying, but about the people who followed him,"" he said. ""The ones who for the next 2,000 years would torture and kill each other because they couldn't agree on what he was saying about peace and love."" He often appeared as one of Python's screeching female characters The council at one town in his native Wales, Aberystwyth, actually banned the showing of the film for 30 years. In 1987 he directed the film Personal Services, loosely based on the real-life story of Cynthia Payne, who achieved notoriety after being charged with running a brothel in suburban London He went on to direct a comedy fantasy film, Erik the Viking, which featured a diverse cast including Mickey Rooney, Imogen Stubbs and Eartha Kitt. In 1996 he wrote and directed an adaptation of The Wind in the Willows, in which he also played the part of Mr Toad. The film struggled initially, getting few showings in the UK, but received a positive welcome in the United States, where it won top prize at the Chicago International Children's Film Festival. Jones established himself as a popular children's author with a number of books, including Nicobobinus, the story of a boy who can do anything, and The Saga of Erik the Viking, which won the Children's Book Award in 1984. He also wrote historical books such as Chaucer's Knight: The Portrait of a Medieval Mercenary, which debunked the notion that medieval knights were paragons of Christian virtue Retracing the history of the Crusades for BBC TV He also wrote and presented Crusades, a four-part documentary series that ran on BBC TV in 1995. The latter featured scenes of Jones dressing in period costume to illustrate some of the events he was describing. ""My constant theme is that the medieval world is similar to ours in that the same people always take advantage of the same people,"" Jones said. ""Humanity doesn't change all through the centuries."" He enjoyed exploring alternative views of history such as his Emmy Award-winning Medieval Lives, in which he argued the Middle Ages had a more sophisticated culture than previously imagined. Jones was an active anti-war campaigner and wrote a number of newspaper articles condemning the war in Iraq. In 2016 it was announced he was suffering from dementia, a cruel blow for a man for whom communication was his lifeblood. He received a standing ovation in October that year when he appeared on stage to receive a Bafta Cymru Award for his outstanding contribution to film and television. During an interview at the BFI & Radio Times Television Festival in 2017, Palin revealed that Jones was no longer able to speak. Jones was asked in a 2011 interview how, out of all his various achievements, he would best like to be remembered. ""Maybe a description of me as a writer of children's books or some of my academic stuff,"" he replied. ""Or maybe as the man who restored Richard II's reputation. ""He was a terrible victim of 14th Century political spin, you know.""

Probe of Saudi prince urged over Bezos phone hackThe UN experts' call comes amid reports Mohammed bin Salman's phone was used to hack the Amazon boss.US & Canada,"Ties between Jeff Bezos and Mohammed bin Salman soured after Jamal Khashoggi's murder UN human rights experts have demanded an immediate investigation into allegations Saudi Arabia's crown prince hacked Amazon boss Jeff Bezos's phone. They said Mohammed bin Salman should also be investigated for ""continuous, direct and personal efforts to target perceived opponents"". A message from a phone number used by the prince has been implicated in a breach of Mr Bezos's data. The kingdom's US embassy has denied the ""absurd"" story. But the independent UN experts - Agnes Callamard, special rapporteur on summary executions and extrajudicial killings, and David Kaye, special rapporteur on freedom of expression - said the crown prince's ""possible involvement"" had to be investigated. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Mr Bezos - who also owns the Washington Post - worsened after Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government and one of the newspaper's staff, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. Saudis sentence five over Khashoggi murder How Saudi Arabia's crown prince rose to power The killing took place months after the alleged cyber-hack took place. Mr Bezos's phone was hacked after he received a WhatsApp message in May 2018 that was sent from the crown prince's personal account,according to the Guardian newspaper, which broke the story.,external An investigation into the data breach reportedly found that the billionaire's phone began secretly sharing huge amounts of data after he received the encrypted video file. In a statement, Ms Callamard and Mr Kaye said: ""The information we have received suggests the possible involvement of the crown prince in surveillance of Mr Bezos, in an effort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post's reporting on Saudi Arabia."" It said the allegations reinforced ""other reporting pointing to a pattern of targeted surveillance of perceived opponents and those of broader strategic importance to the Saudi authorities"". Was Jeff Bezos the weak link in cyber-security? Saudi Arabia accused over Bezos hack What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? The experts linked the case heavily to the Khashoggi murder, saying the Post reporter's phone had been hacked at the same time as Mr Bezos's. They said there had been ""a massive, clandestine online campaign against Mr Bezos and Amazon, apparently targeting him principally as the owner of the Washington Post"". The statement also called for ""rigorous control"" of the ""unconstrained marketing, sale and use of spyware"". The UN experts cited ""a 2019 forensic analysis of Mr Bezos' iPhone that assessed with 'medium to high confidence' that his phone was infiltrated on 1 May 2018 via an MP4 video file sent from a WhatsApp account utilised personally by Mohammed bin Salman"". This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" The crown prince and Mr Bezos had reportedly exchanged numbers a month earlier and within hours of the MP4's arrival, there was a ""massive and unprecedented exfiltration of data"" from Mr Bezos's phone. The analysis cited by the experts says the crown prince then ""sent WhatsApp messages to Mr Bezos... in which he allegedly revealed private and confidential information about Mr Bezos' personal life"". Private information was then leaked to the American tabloid, the National Enquirer. In February 2019 Mr Bezos accused it of ""extortion and blackmail"" after it published text messages between him and his girlfriend, former Fox television presenter Lauren SÃ¡nchez. A month earlier he and MacKenzie Bezos, his wife of 25 years, had announced that they planned to divorce having been separated for a ""long period"". The Twitter account of the kingdom's US embassy,externalissued an outright denial of the allegations against the crown prince. ""We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out,"" the embassy said. Mr Bezos has made no response to the UN experts' statement, but did tweet an image of himself with Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, along with the tag #Jamal: Allow Twitter content?

Analysis by Jane Wakefield, BBC News technology reporter A hack such as this was ""horribly easy to do once the vulnerability involved had been discovered,"" says computer expert Prof Alan Woodward. The seemingly innocent video would have contained malware that surreptitiously installed itself on the targeted phone. From there it would have been possible for the hacker to gain access to all the functions of the phone, from the GPS locator, to the camera, to the banking facilities and messaging apps. Such access is made possible via bugs in the code and, last year,a security flaw in WhatsApp was revealedthat would have allowed hackers to hide malicious code inside video files. Phone hacking is, says Prof Woodward, all too common in certain countries that are keen to keep an eye on journalists, dissidents and other activists perceived to be a threat to their regimes. So-called stalkerware is available off the shelf to these governments. But what about the involvement of the Saudi crown prince? Was it really him who installed the malware? It is unlikely that he set the phone up himself. So was his phone also being spied on? Or was he simply a vessel being used by the Saudi authorities? The plot thickens.

Long-Bailey: I can sell 'hope for the future',"This video can not be played Labour needs to sell a message of aspiration to voters, says Long-Bailey Labour had ""a great set of policies"" at the general election but got its ""messaging"" wrong, Rebecca Long-Bailey has told the BBC. ""We should have been talking about aspiration,"" the Labour leadership contender said, but too often talked about ""handouts"" instead. She said she had the ability to sell ""a positive vision"" and ""hope for the future"" that wins elections. The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn is down to four after Jess Phillips quit. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy have made it on the final leadership ballot, after securing the necessary trade union and affiliated group support. Emily Thornberry and Mrs Long-Bailey have yet to reach the threshold. Ms Phillips said she would be happy with either Ms Nandy or Sir Keir as leader, but argued that Mrs Long-Bailey would be the wrong choice for Labour at this moment. Nandy joins Starmer on Labour leadership ballot Jess Phillips quits Labour leadership race Who will be Labour's next leader? Mr Corbyn announced he would be standing down after Labour suffered its worst defeat, in terms of seats, since 1935 in December's election. But Mrs Long-Bailey - whose campaign is backed by grassroots organisation Momentum - refused to blame the party's manifesto, saying she was ""proud"" of the policies in it. Labour's ""compromise position"" on Brexit ""didn't satisfy our communities and meant that we weren't trusted,"" she told the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. And, she added: ""We didn't tackle anti-Semitism and we weren't trusted to deal with that issue within our own party."" The manifesto policies - which included nationalising utilities and a big increase in tax-funded public spending - were not drawn together into an ""overarching narrative"" that chimed with the electorate, she said. ""Our messaging really didn't resonate with voters. We should have been talking about aspiration and how all of the things within our manifesto would improve your life, would improve the outcome for businesses in our areas, but we didn't say that. ""Quite often we talked about handouts and how we will help people, rather than providing that broad positive vision of the future."" She said Labour had a history of talking ""about how bad the Conservatives are"" without ""showing that real vision and hope for the future"". ""That's what wins general elections, showing that real vision and hope for the future. And I know that I can do that and that's why I'm standing to be the leader of the party."" The shadow business secretary said Labour did not do enough to ""sell"" her flagship policy, the Green Industrial Revolution, which she said ""would have transformed our economy and delivered investment in regions and nations"". This video can not be played Rebecca Long-Bailey says she supports gender self-identification ""Whoever becomes leader, we have to reunite the party to make sure that we're unified in the message that we're putting forward. But we had many of the right answers to the right questions."" She also hit back at claims she was not forceful enough to be prime minister. ""I'm not shy. I mean, I have spent last four years, you know, locked in a room developing many of the policies that we've been trying to push forward as a party, but I don't think you could ever describe me as shy."" She said she believed her ""forensic approach"" to politics would be a challenge to Boris Johnson, whom she described as having ""a bit of a struggling relationship with the truth and with detail"". On the prospect of being PM herself one day, she said she could picture herself living in 10 Downing Street, ""chilling out"" in her pyjamas on a Friday night, with ""Netflix and a Chinese takeaway"". In a wide-ranging interview, Mrs Long-Bailey was asked whether she had any Conservative friends in Parliament. ""Not really, no,"" she replied, but added: ""I'm friendly to everyone."" She said her non-political friends would not tell her if they supported the Tories ""because I'd be angry"". She also reiterated her belief that women had a ""right to choose"" when it came to abortion and she was not in favour of changing the law, after arow over comments she madeto Catholic priests during the general election. And she backed a change in the law to allow transgender people to self-identify without the need for medical evidence. This video can not be played Four candidates remain in the race for the Labour leadership Labour's manifesto committed to reform of the Gender Recognition Act to allow self-identification, but critics warn it will make it easier for someone born as a man but now identifying as a woman to gain access to women-only spaces such as toilets, changing rooms, prisons and domestic violence refuges. Asked whether she had any concerns about the policy, Mrs Long-Bailey said she understood the arguments, but Labour must ""fully support our trans community"".

LiveLiveOpening arguments in Trump impeachment trial9 minutes ago9 minutes ago The 'infamous' phone callThe 'infamous' phone call23 minutes ago Removing a 'despot' from officeRemoving a 'despot' from office33 minutes ago Democrats on a 'crusade'Democrats on a 'crusade'Live Opening arguments in Trump impeachment trial  9 minutes ago,"The third impeachment trial in US history is under way with the case against President Trump Democrat Adam Schiff said Founding Father Alexander Hamilton devised impeachment to stop someone like Trump From Switzerland, President Trump decried the trial as a ""disgrace"" Trump is accused of seeking help from Ukraine to get himself re-elected and of obstructing Congress Holly Honderich and Max Matza That's it from us for today. To recap, House Democrats have opened arguments in the Trump impeachment trial. Adam Schiff urged Republican senators to join them in voting to remove Trump from office to ""protect our democracy"". He warned that senators would ""also undermine our global standing""
if they do not oust the Republican president. Attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Trump jokingly warned he might confront Democrats by coming to ""sit right in the front row and stare at their corrupt faces"". Democrats have up to three days to make their case. Trump's
defence team will have three days after that for rebuttal. The trial could conclude as soon as next week. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer speaks to reporters during a recess in the Senate trial Just as the Senate trial gets underway, slightly more Americans say that President Trump should be removed from office, according to the latest poll from Pew Research Center. 51%of Americans say the president should be removed by the Senate trial, while46%say Trump should stay. These results are starkly divided along partisan lines:85%of Democrats think Trump should be kicked out while86%of Republican voters think he should stay. The country is more united when it comes to Trump's alleged wrongdoing. 63%of Americans say Trump has ""definitely"" or ""probably"" done something illegal. An even larger majority -70%- say he has ""definitely"" or ""probably"" done something unethical. Joel GunterBBC News, at the trial By late afternoon, some senators in the chamber had begun to
look like the long hours of detailed evidence were taking their toll. Sylvia Garcia, a Texas congresswoman and Democratic impeachment manager, was walking senators through the movements of various
players in the Ukraine scandal, interspersing her prepared statement with audio
and video clips. It's a convoluted story to follow, even for those already
familiar. And there is a lot more evidence to get through - the Democratic House
managers laid out their case slowly and meticulously today, as they did
yesterday. The brief they submitted before the trial was more than 100 pages of
heavily footnoted evidence. By contrast, the president's team submitted seven
pages, with no references. The defence will begin its oral arguments on
Saturday. If witnesses and new evidence are admitted, senators may sit
through these sessions for several more weeks. They are allowed only water and
milk - no coffee - to keep them going, and the occasional piece of chocolate
from the bipartisan Senate confectionery draw. So young staffers ferry glasses of
water constantly around the chamber. Plus one glass of milk, while I was
inside, for the Republican Senator Tom Cotton. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

During the recess, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer approached microphones only to find that top Republican John Cornyn was already being interviewed. So he waited patiently for his turn. When Cornyn made a remark about witnesses testifying to Congress, Schumer chimed in to say he agrees. Yup, you read that right - a top Democrat concurred with a top Republican. Congress may be bitterly split over impeachment, but it seems the two parties in the upper chamber can occasionally agree on something. Allow Twitter content?

Joel GunterBBC Journalist, World Long-serving Democratic senator from Delaware Tom Carper spoke to the BBC's Joel Gunter during a recess, to discuss what the atmosphere was like in
the chamber amid a deeply partisan process. ""A lot of people think we just fight in the Senate and
in the House, but we are actually friends for the most part. It's a friendly
atmosphere,"" he said. ""As I sat there today listening to Senator Schiff
speak, for a long time, I was impressed - the members didn't start reading, or
talking, they weren't sitting smiling or rolling their eyes. They were
intent."" The Senate sat in session for 12 hours last night. Senator
Carper said he held his concentration by writing hourly summaries of the
testimony in his journal. ""I felt stronger as the night wore on. Somebody
asked me, 'What are you on?' I said, 'I'm on Democracy!"" Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer is shooting down suggestions that a witness swap will take place to allow Democrats to get a witness to testify in exchange for a Republican-picked witness. Democrats hope to get former US National Security Adviser John Bolton into the witness chair, while Republicans want to speak to the son of former US Vice-President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden, whose work for a Ukrainian energy firm spawned accusations of corruption from Trump and his allies. ""Witnesses should have something to do with and direct knowledge of the charges against the president,"" said Schumer, referring to rumours of ""witness reciprocity"". ""You know, we donât need to have witnesses that have nothing to do with this that are trying to distract Americans from the truth."" Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy has warned Fox News viewers to beware of people throwing ""monkey dust... trying to distract from what is the crux of the issue"". ""If we look at the crux and remain focused on that crux, then we'll establish whether the president did something illegal or not."" It's unclear whether Cassidy, a medical doctor, is aware that ""monkey dust"" is also the street name for an illegal synthetic drug (methylenedioxypyrovalerone) that is also known as ""bath salts"".

Jon SopelBBC North America Editor Why is Trump weighing in from Switzerland? There was one thing in particular that Trump said which was kind of like a red rag to a bull. It's when he said basically: ""Well things are going very well, we have all the information, and they [Democrats] have none of it."" Well, if you want a fair trial, then maybe that information should be made available. We keep using the word ""trial"", and the words ""jurors"" and ""witnesses"" and ""evidence"", but we must not lose sight that this is a political process. We saw that clearly last night when the first votes started coming in. In a vote that split completely along party lines, 53 Republicans said ""no we should not be able to subpoena the White House for documents"", while 47 Democrats said ""yes we should"". So we have Donald Trump kind of goading and saying: ""Look I've got the information. We know what happened, but we're not going to tell you."" I think this might inflame public opinion. Polls are already indicating that a clear majority believe that evidence should be handed over and witnesses should be called. Are journalists overstating the significance of all this? Politicians always over-estimate the extent to which the general public are paying attention to their words. It is a condition not unique to the United States of America. It is a global phenomenon that whatever politicians say, they think the public will find tremendously important and fantastically interesting. But, amazingly, members of the public are getting on with their lives. That is an important thing to bear in mind. Some of us - obsessive forlorn political journalists like me - are watching in immense detail, while other people are just getting on with it. Some people will be watching this for its historical important. But for the overwhelming majority of Americans, I expect there to be just a few fleeting moments of attention paid to the serious discussion taking place in Washington. It doesn't seem to be changing the lives, or minds, of the American people all that much.    Lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff, representing Democrats, has just wrapped up about 2.5 hours of opening arguments, leading to Leader Mitch McConnell to announce a short recess. ""If we don't stand up to this peril today, we will write the history of our decline with our own hand,"" he warned the senators who will serve as Trump's jury. Meanwhile, Trump has tweeted in reference to his July call with the Ukrainian leader. ""NO PRESSURE"" Trump wrote, referring to the Ukrainian president's statement that he did not feel pressured to open political investigations into Trump's domestic opponent Joe Biden, in exchange for the unfreezing of US military aid. A letter signed by 21 Republican state attorneys general and released on Wednesday argues that impeachment ""threatensallfuture elections and establishes a dangerous historical precedent"" for US politics. ""That new precedent will erode the separation of powers shared by the executive and legislative branches by subjugating future Presidents to the whims of the majority opposition party in the House of Representatives,"" wrote the top lawmen of 21 states. They claim the abuse of power charge ""is based upon a constitutionally-flawed theory"" that is ""infinitely expansive and subjective"" because it is based on the president's alleged motivations. They say the other charge - obstructing justice - is ""equally flawed"" because it would render executive privilege ""meaningless"". ""Impeachment should never be a partisan response to one party losing a presidential election,â the 14-page letter says. ""If successful, an impeachment proceeding nullifies the votes of millions of citizens."" The only Republican attorneys general not to sign the letter come from Arizona, Idaho, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Carolina, Utah and Wyoming Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse (right) holds up his coffee, which is banned from the Senate floor Amy Klobuchar has taken a break from 2020 campaigning to serve as a trial juror Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow is searched on his way into the Capitol building A protester holds a sign on Capitol Hill with the Supreme Court in the background Supreme Court Judge John Roberts oversaw a case earlier on Wednesday before coming to Congress to oversee impeachment Republican leader Mitch McConnell walks the Senate halls earlier on Wednesday In his opening remarks, lead impeachment manager Adam Schiff kept mentioning Founding Father Alexander Hamilton. But what does Hamilton - the first US treasury secretary and now the subject of an award-winning musical - have to do with Donald Trump's impeachment? Hamilton penned the two essays devoted to impeachment in the Federalist papers. Hamilton wrote that a political impeachment trial is different to a criminal trial. In other words, an illegal act is not required for impeachment. ""Hamilton seems to have predicted the rise of Donald Trump with staggering prescience,"" Schiff said. Joel GunterBBC Journalist Adam Schiff began his opening remarks by
sombrely quoting Alexander Hamilton: ""When a man unprincipled in private
life desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper, possessed of considerable
talents... When such a man is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity - to
join in the cry of danger to liberty..."" Though the president was not in the dock, the target of Schiff's history lesson
was impossible to miss. The Democratic congressman went on to rehearse the impeachment
managers' arguments against President Trump, from the scandal with Russia to
the Hunter Biden business in Ukraine. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell sat still, fixing an unbroken glare on Schiff. No desk in the Senate chamber was empty. All the Senate Democratic presidential
candidates were there - Amy Klobuchar took notes; Elizabeth Warren sat upright,
attentively; Bernie Sanders sat low in his seat, yawning occasionally and
holding his head in his hands; and Michael Bennet was there, too. Schiff returned to Alexander Hamilton later in his remarks, saying Trump had
""acted precisely as Hamilton and his contemporaries had feared"" when
they framed the remedy of impeachment. He implored the gathered senators to act
impartially. ""It is up to you to be the tribunal that Hamilton envisioned,"" he
said. He quoted John F Kennedy: ""With a good conscience our
only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds..."" The senior Republican senators
showed no reaction. This video can not be played Trump impeachment trial: Five possible twists ahead President Donald Trump is accused of an abuse of power and
obstructing Congress and most believe it's a foregone conclusion that
Trump will be acquitted at the end of this process, because his party controls
the Senate. But
could the trial go off script? The BBC's Anthony Zurcher and Shrai Popat take a
front-row seat. Senators were just warned that they are ""commanded to keep silence, on pain of imprisonment,"" but quite a few say they will find it rather difficult to abide by the stringent rules ""Every senator will have some trouble - we are not, by nature, silent,"" Missouri Republican Senator Roy Blunt toldthe New York Times,external. ""The desire to hear the sound of your own voice will be frustrated by that rule."" In addition to the vow of silence, senators are also banned from using cell phones and are required to leave them outside the chamber in cubbies. In a possible violation of the rules, several senators have been seen wearing smartwatches. After Senator Ted Cruz was criticised because his official Twitter account continued posting during Tuesday's hearing, his team posted a cartoon of a cell phone with the caption ""come and take it"". That slogan is popularly used by gun rights activists, but it actually originates in the 1835 Battle of Gonzales that took place during the Texas Revolution. Allow Twitter content?

A Monmouth University poll released this week shows that a majority of the country thinks the trial should allow new evidence, but that support is deeply partisan. Here are the key stats: Lead impeachment manager, Democrat Adam Schiff lays out the timeline of events leading to Trump's impeachment. Schiff has emphasised Trump's ""infamous"" 25 July phone call with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky - at the centre of today's trial. So what's he talking about? A rough transcript of this conversation, released in September, revealed Trump had urged President Zelensky to investigate former US Vice-President Joe Biden, the front-runner to take on Trump in the 2020 election, as well as Mr Biden's son, who held a board position with a Ukrainian gas firm. Just 91 minutes after this phone call, the White House sought to freeze aid to Ukraine, a newly disclosed government email suggested last month. Democrats argue that the $391m (Â£316m) in military aid temporarily blocked to Ukraine is proof of Trump's abuse of office. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff begins by thanking senators for their ""patience"" in listening to arguments until 2am local time on Wednesday. He then quotes US Founding Father Alexander Hamilton about the need for impeachment as a mechanism to remove ""a despot"" from office. ""They did not intend for the matter of impeachment to be used frequently or as a matter of policy,"" he says, but it was put in the constitution ""for a reason"". The writers of the constitution, he said, ""devised a remedy as powerful as the evil it was meant to combat - impeachment"". In a clear reference to Trump, he said the impeachment clause was placed there for ""a man who would would seek to subvert the interests of the nation, a man who would... seek office by cheating at an election.""

"UK to monitor China flights as virus precautionPrecautionary measures will apply to flights from Wuhan to Heathrow, the government says.UKComments","This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus The UK is to monitor flights arriving from China, as part of a series of precautionary measures after the spread of a new coronavirus. The measures, announced by the Department of Health, will apply to flights from Wuhan to London Heathrow. The flights will be met in an isolated part of Terminal 4, with a health team available to check for symptoms. Public Health England said the current risk to the UK has been changed from ""very low"" to ""low"". The health team will check for symptoms of coronavirus and provide information to all passengers about symptoms. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan. The first flight to arrive in the UK after the measures were announced landed just after 18:00 GMT. A spokesman for Heathrow said the airport was working with the government to ""support the implementation of the measures"". He added: ""We would like to reassure passengers that the government assesses the risk of a traveller contracting coronavirus to be low."" Passengers on a flight from Wuhan were handed a leaflet about the infection as they arrived In Geneva, the World Health Organization's emergency committee is meeting on Thursday to assess the global risks posed by the virus and decide if it should be declared an international public health emergency - as happened with swine flu and Ebola. How worried should we be about the virus? New China virus: Your questions answered Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began Wuhan, the city at the heart of the outbreak, is totemporarily shut public transportin an attempt to halt the spread of the virus. The airport and train stations and other modes of transport will be closed to outgoing passengers from 10:00 local time on Thursday. There are estimated to have been 4,000 cases of the virus since the outbreak began, according to Professor Neil Ferguson, director of the Medical Research Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis. However he said it was difficult to assess the numbers and Chinese hospitals would probably now be overwhelmed with suspected cases. The outbreak has killed 17 people, and there are more than 500 confirmed cases. At least 15 medical workers in Wuhan have also been infected with the virus The vast majority of cases have been in Wuhan and Chinese authorities believe the virus originated from a seafood market that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"". However it has also spread to other Chinese cities and a handful of cases have been identified abroad, including in Japan andthe US.There have been no cases in Britain. On Tuesday, authorities in China confirmed for the first time that human-to-human transmission of the virus had taken place. On Wednesday, the Department of Health announced there will be an ""enhanced monitoring"" package in place for all direct flights from China to the UK because of the threat of coronavirus. In a statement, the government said the measures will include: A health team to meet each direct flight from Wuhan to London Heathrow Passengers on flights will hear an announcement and be given a leaflet to encourage them to report if they are ill Aircraft will land in an isolated area of Heathrow Terminal 4 that ""better lends itself to any health contingencies"" There are currently three direct flights a week from Wuhan to London Heathrow. The monitoring of direct flights will be kept ""under continuous review"" and expanded to other Chinese departure points if necessary, the government added. Individuals ""should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China or on their return to the UK"", according to Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of Public Health England's National Infection Service. He added: ""They should phone ahead before attending any health services and mention their recent travel to the city."" Dr Nathalie MacDermott, a clinical lecturer at King's College London, said screening for symptoms at the airport was ""limited"" as it will only identify people who have symptoms at the point they transit through the airport. ""It is therefore important that Public Health England are able to trace [travellers] in the future to determine if they have gone on to develop any symptoms,"" she said. Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 5live said it was important to ""stay ahead of the issue"" and monitor the situation very carefully. Professor Calum Semple, an expert in outbreak medicine at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, said it could be difficult to spot passengers infected with the virus because it takes about five days for symptoms to appear and during this initial period someone could seem completely healthy. He told the BBC that these symptoms, which include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, can also be difficult to differentiate from seasonal flu. It comes as authorities in several countries, including Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan have stepped up screening of air passengers from Wuhan. US authorities last week announced similar measures at airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. They have now announced plans to introduce similar measures at airports in Chicago and Atlanta this week. This type of coronavirus is a new strain that hasn't been seen in humans before, which means doctors still have lots to learn about it. The first human cases were identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. There have not been any other suspected human cases reported prior to this. The incubation period (how long it takes for symptoms to appear after catching the infection) is days, rather than weeks. It is not yet known how or when the virus became infectious to people. Experts believe the first cases were transmitted by an animal. Other coronaviruses, such as Sars and Mers, came from civet cats and camels respectively. At the moment, there is no vaccine that can protect people against it, but researchers are looking to develop one. The UK's expected measures do not appear to include a medical screening of passengers at the airport for signs of the virus, asthe UK did in 2014following the Ebola outbreak. Then, screening involved taking people's temperatures to check whether they have a fever and asking several questions to assess their risk. New China virus 'could mutate and spread further' China - which is stepping up containment measures - has still not been able to confirm the exact source of the virus. But the country's National Health Commission vice-minister Li Bin said there was evidence that the disease was ""mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract"".

Probe of Saudi prince urged over Bezos phone hackThe UN experts' call comes amid reports Mohammed bin Salman's phone was used to hack the Amazon boss.,"Ties between Jeff Bezos and Mohammed bin Salman soured after Jamal Khashoggi's murder UN human rights experts have demanded an immediate investigation into allegations Saudi Arabia's crown prince hacked Amazon boss Jeff Bezos's phone. They said Mohammed bin Salman should also be investigated for ""continuous, direct and personal efforts to target perceived opponents"". A message from a phone number used by the prince has been implicated in a breach of Mr Bezos's data. The kingdom's US embassy has denied the ""absurd"" story. But the independent UN experts - Agnes Callamard, special rapporteur on summary executions and extrajudicial killings, and David Kaye, special rapporteur on freedom of expression - said the crown prince's ""possible involvement"" had to be investigated. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Mr Bezos - who also owns the Washington Post - worsened after Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government and one of the newspaper's staff, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. Saudis sentence five over Khashoggi murder How Saudi Arabia's crown prince rose to power The killing took place months after the alleged cyber-hack took place. Mr Bezos's phone was hacked after he received a WhatsApp message in May 2018 that was sent from the crown prince's personal account,according to the Guardian newspaper, which broke the story.,external An investigation into the data breach reportedly found that the billionaire's phone began secretly sharing huge amounts of data after he received the encrypted video file. In a statement, Ms Callamard and Mr Kaye said: ""The information we have received suggests the possible involvement of the crown prince in surveillance of Mr Bezos, in an effort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post's reporting on Saudi Arabia."" It said the allegations reinforced ""other reporting pointing to a pattern of targeted surveillance of perceived opponents and those of broader strategic importance to the Saudi authorities"". Was Jeff Bezos the weak link in cyber-security? Saudi Arabia accused over Bezos hack What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? The experts linked the case heavily to the Khashoggi murder, saying the Post reporter's phone had been hacked at the same time as Mr Bezos's. They said there had been ""a massive, clandestine online campaign against Mr Bezos and Amazon, apparently targeting him principally as the owner of the Washington Post"". The statement also called for ""rigorous control"" of the ""unconstrained marketing, sale and use of spyware"". The UN experts cited ""a 2019 forensic analysis of Mr Bezos' iPhone that assessed with 'medium to high confidence' that his phone was infiltrated on 1 May 2018 via an MP4 video file sent from a WhatsApp account utilised personally by Mohammed bin Salman"". This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" The crown prince and Mr Bezos had reportedly exchanged numbers a month earlier and within hours of the MP4's arrival, there was a ""massive and unprecedented exfiltration of data"" from Mr Bezos's phone. The analysis cited by the experts says the crown prince then ""sent WhatsApp messages to Mr Bezos... in which he allegedly revealed private and confidential information about Mr Bezos' personal life"". Private information was then leaked to the American tabloid, the National Enquirer. In February 2019 Mr Bezos accused it of ""extortion and blackmail"" after it published text messages between him and his girlfriend, former Fox television presenter Lauren SÃ¡nchez. A month earlier he and MacKenzie Bezos, his wife of 25 years, had announced that they planned to divorce having been separated for a ""long period"". The Twitter account of the kingdom's US embassy,externalissued an outright denial of the allegations against the crown prince.

Probe of Saudi prince urged over Bezos phone hack,"Ties between Jeff Bezos and Mohammed bin Salman soured after Jamal Khashoggi's murder UN human rights experts have demanded an immediate investigation into allegations Saudi Arabia's crown prince hacked Amazon boss Jeff Bezos's phone. They said Mohammed bin Salman should also be investigated for ""continuous, direct and personal efforts to target perceived opponents"". A message from a phone number used by the prince has been implicated in a breach of Mr Bezos's data. The kingdom's US embassy has denied the ""absurd"" story. But the independent UN experts - Agnes Callamard, special rapporteur on summary executions and extrajudicial killings, and David Kaye, special rapporteur on freedom of expression - said the crown prince's ""possible involvement"" had to be investigated. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Mr Bezos - who also owns the Washington Post - worsened after Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government and one of the newspaper's staff, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. Saudis sentence five over Khashoggi murder How Saudi Arabia's crown prince rose to power The killing took place months after the alleged cyber-hack took place. Mr Bezos's phone was hacked after he received a WhatsApp message in May 2018 that was sent from the crown prince's personal account,according to the Guardian newspaper, which broke the story.,external An investigation into the data breach reportedly found that the billionaire's phone began secretly sharing huge amounts of data after he received the encrypted video file. In a statement, Ms Callamard and Mr Kaye said: ""The information we have received suggests the possible involvement of the crown prince in surveillance of Mr Bezos, in an effort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post's reporting on Saudi Arabia."" It said the allegations reinforced ""other reporting pointing to a pattern of targeted surveillance of perceived opponents and those of broader strategic importance to the Saudi authorities"". Was Jeff Bezos the weak link in cyber-security? Saudi Arabia accused over Bezos hack What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? The experts linked the case heavily to the Khashoggi murder, saying the Post reporter's phone had been hacked at the same time as Mr Bezos's. They said there had been ""a massive, clandestine online campaign against Mr Bezos and Amazon, apparently targeting him principally as the owner of the Washington Post"". The statement also called for ""rigorous control"" of the ""unconstrained marketing, sale and use of spyware"". The UN experts cited ""a 2019 forensic analysis of Mr Bezos' iPhone that assessed with 'medium to high confidence' that his phone was infiltrated on 1 May 2018 via an MP4 video file sent from a WhatsApp account utilised personally by Mohammed bin Salman"". This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" The crown prince and Mr Bezos had reportedly exchanged numbers a month earlier and within hours of the MP4's arrival, there was a ""massive and unprecedented exfiltration of data"" from Mr Bezos's phone. The analysis cited by the experts says the crown prince then ""sent WhatsApp messages to Mr Bezos... in which he allegedly revealed private and confidential information about Mr Bezos' personal life"". Private information was then leaked to the American tabloid, the National Enquirer. In February 2019 Mr Bezos accused it of ""extortion and blackmail"" after it published text messages between him and his girlfriend, former Fox television presenter Lauren SÃ¡nchez. A month earlier he and MacKenzie Bezos, his wife of 25 years, had announced that they planned to divorce having been separated for a ""long period"". The Twitter account of the kingdom's US embassy,externalissued an outright denial of the allegations against the crown prince. ""We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out,"" the embassy said.

UK to monitor China flights as virus precaution,"This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus The UK is to monitor flights arriving from China, as part of a series of precautionary measures after the spread of a new coronavirus. The measures, announced by the Department of Health, will apply to flights from Wuhan to London Heathrow. The flights will be met in an isolated part of Terminal 4, with a health team available to check for symptoms. Public Health England said the current risk to the UK has been changed from ""very low"" to ""low"". The health team will check for symptoms of coronavirus and provide information to all passengers about symptoms. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan. The first flight to arrive in the UK after the measures were announced landed just after 18:00 GMT. A spokesman for Heathrow said the airport was working with the government to ""support the implementation of the measures"". He added: ""We would like to reassure passengers that the government assesses the risk of a traveller contracting coronavirus to be low."" Passengers on a flight from Wuhan were handed a leaflet about the infection as they arrived In Geneva, the World Health Organization's emergency committee is meeting on Thursday to assess the global risks posed by the virus and decide if it should be declared an international public health emergency - as happened with swine flu and Ebola. How worried should we be about the virus? New China virus: Your questions answered Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began Wuhan, the city at the heart of the outbreak, is totemporarily shut public transportin an attempt to halt the spread of the virus. The airport and train stations and other modes of transport will be closed to outgoing passengers from 10:00 local time on Thursday. There are estimated to have been 4,000 cases of the virus since the outbreak began, according to Professor Neil Ferguson, director of the Medical Research Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis. However he said it was difficult to assess the numbers and Chinese hospitals would probably now be overwhelmed with suspected cases. The outbreak has killed 17 people, and there are more than 500 confirmed cases. At least 15 medical workers in Wuhan have also been infected with the virus The vast majority of cases have been in Wuhan and Chinese authorities believe the virus originated from a seafood market that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"". However it has also spread to other Chinese cities and a handful of cases have been identified abroad, including in Japan andthe US.There have been no cases in Britain. On Tuesday, authorities in China confirmed for the first time that human-to-human transmission of the virus had taken place. On Wednesday, the Department of Health announced there will be an ""enhanced monitoring"" package in place for all direct flights from China to the UK because of the threat of coronavirus. In a statement, the government said the measures will include: A health team to meet each direct flight from Wuhan to London Heathrow Passengers on flights will hear an announcement and be given a leaflet to encourage them to report if they are ill Aircraft will land in an isolated area of Heathrow Terminal 4 that ""better lends itself to any health contingencies"" There are currently three direct flights a week from Wuhan to London Heathrow. The monitoring of direct flights will be kept ""under continuous review"" and expanded to other Chinese departure points if necessary, the government added. Individuals ""should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China or on their return to the UK"", according to Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of Public Health England's National Infection Service. He added: ""They should phone ahead before attending any health services and mention their recent travel to the city."" Dr Nathalie MacDermott, a clinical lecturer at King's College London, said screening for symptoms at the airport was ""limited"" as it will only identify people who have symptoms at the point they transit through the airport. ""It is therefore important that Public Health England are able to trace [travellers] in the future to determine if they have gone on to develop any symptoms,"" she said. Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 5live said it was important to ""stay ahead of the issue"" and monitor the situation very carefully. Professor Calum Semple, an expert in outbreak medicine at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, said it could be difficult to spot passengers infected with the virus because it takes about five days for symptoms to appear and during this initial period someone could seem completely healthy. He told the BBC that these symptoms, which include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, can also be difficult to differentiate from seasonal flu. It comes as authorities in several countries, including Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan have stepped up screening of air passengers from Wuhan. US authorities last week announced similar measures at airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. They have now announced plans to introduce similar measures at airports in Chicago and Atlanta this week. This type of coronavirus is a new strain that hasn't been seen in humans before, which means doctors still have lots to learn about it. The first human cases were identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. There have not been any other suspected human cases reported prior to this. The incubation period (how long it takes for symptoms to appear after catching the infection) is days, rather than weeks. It is not yet known how or when the virus became infectious to people. Experts believe the first cases were transmitted by an animal. Other coronaviruses, such as Sars and Mers, came from civet cats and camels respectively. At the moment, there is no vaccine that can protect people against it, but researchers are looking to develop one. The UK's expected measures do not appear to include a medical screening of passengers at the airport for signs of the virus, asthe UK did in 2014following the Ebola outbreak. Then, screening involved taking people's temperatures to check whether they have a fever and asking several questions to assess their risk. New China virus 'could mutate and spread further' China - which is stepping up containment measures - has still not been able to confirm the exact source of the virus. But the country's National Health Commission vice-minister Li Bin said there was evidence that the disease was ""mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract"".

Sonos speaker update sparks anger,"Owners of Sonos products have reacted angrily to the firm's announcement that it will no longer issue software updates for its older devices from May. Many say they have spent hundreds of pounds on Sonos speaker products for their homes over the years. Newer Sonos products connected with the older ones will also be left out of future updates. The change affects four models sold between 2006 and 2015, including the Connect:Amp and Connect. Without the updates, they will eventually lose functionality. Access to other services will also become limited. Sonos said,externalthe hardware had been ""stretched to its technical limits in terms of memory and processing power"". And affected customers can upgrade to a newer device with a 30% discount in return forrecycling the old product. But the news has annoyed many Sonos owners. Richard Street told the BBC he had spent Â£1,000 ($1,300) on two Play 5 speakers. Even with the upgrade discount he believes it would cost him around Â£700 to replace them. ""This is money my family and I just don't have,"" he said. ""There is a feeling among the community that if Sonos gets away with this then they will do the same with all kit over time.""

Long-Bailey: Labour must sell message of aspiration,"This video can not be played Labour needs to sell a message of aspiration to voters, says Long-Bailey Labour had ""a great set of policies"" at the general election but got its ""messaging"" wrong, Rebecca Long-Bailey has told the BBC. ""We should have been talking about aspiration,"" the Labour leadership contender said, but too often talked about ""handouts"" instead. She said she had the ability to sell ""a positive vision"" and ""hope for the future"" that wins elections. The race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn is down to four after Jess Phillips quit. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy have made it on the final leadership ballot, after securing the necessary trade union and affiliated group support. Emily Thornberry and Mrs Long-Bailey have yet to reach the threshold. Ms Phillips said she would be happy with either Ms Nandy or Sir Keir as leader, but argued that Mrs Long-Bailey would be the wrong choice for Labour at this moment. Nandy joins Starmer on Labour leadership ballot Jess Phillips quits Labour leadership race Who will be Labour's next leader? Mr Corbyn announced he would be standing down after Labour suffered its worst defeat, in terms of seats, since 1935 in December's election. But Mrs Long-Bailey - whose campaign is backed by grassroots organisation Momentum - refused to blame the party's manifesto, saying she was ""proud"" of the policies in it. Labour's ""compromise position"" on Brexit ""didn't satisfy our communities and meant that we weren't trusted,"" she told the BBC's political editor, Laura Kuenssberg. And, she added: ""We didn't tackle anti-Semitism and we weren't trusted to deal with that issue within our own party."" The manifesto policies - which included nationalising utilities and a big increase in tax-funded public spending - were not drawn together into an ""overarching narrative"" that chimed with the electorate, she said. ""Our messaging really didn't resonate with voters. We should have been talking about aspiration and how all of the things within our manifesto would improve your life, would improve the outcome for businesses in our areas, but we didn't say that. ""Quite often we talked about handouts and how we will help people, rather than providing that broad positive vision of the future."" She said Labour had a history of talking ""about how bad the Conservatives are"" without ""showing that real vision and hope for the future"". ""That's what wins general elections, showing that real vision and hope for the future. And I know that I can do that and that's why I'm standing to be the leader of the party."" The shadow business secretary said Labour did not do enough to ""sell"" her flagship policy, the Green Industrial Revolution, which she said ""would have transformed our economy and delivered investment in regions and nations"". This video can not be played Rebecca Long-Bailey says she supports gender self-identification ""Whoever becomes leader, we have to reunite the party to make sure that we're unified in the message that we're putting forward. But we had many of the right answers to the right questions."" She also hit back at claims she was not forceful enough to be prime minister. ""I'm not shy. I mean, I have spent last four years, you know, locked in a room developing many of the policies that we've been trying to push forward as a party, but I don't think you could ever describe me as shy."" She said she believed her ""forensic approach"" to politics would be a challenge to Boris Johnson, whom she described as having ""a bit of a struggling relationship with the truth and with detail"". On the prospect of being PM herself one day, she said she could picture herself living in 10 Downing Street, ""chilling out"" in her pyjamas on a Friday night, with ""Netflix and a Chinese takeaway"". In a wide-ranging interview, Mrs Long-Bailey was asked whether she had any Conservative friends in Parliament. ""Not really, no,"" she replied, but added: ""I'm friendly to everyone."" She said her non-political friends would not tell her if they supported the Tories ""because I'd be angry"". She also reiterated her belief that women had a ""right to choose"" when it came to abortion and she was not in favour of changing the law, after arow over comments she madeto Catholic priests during the general election. And she backed a change in the law to allow transgender people to self-identify without the need for medical evidence. This video can not be played Four candidates remain in the race for the Labour leadership Labour's manifesto committed to reform of the Gender Recognition Act to allow self-identification, but critics warn it will make it easier for someone born as a man but now identifying as a woman to gain access to women-only spaces such as toilets, changing rooms, prisons and domestic violence refuges. Asked whether she had any concerns about the policy, Mrs Long-Bailey said she understood the arguments, but Labour must ""fully support our trans community"".

Watchdog 'missed opportunity to stop abuse',"Whorlton Hall was a 17-bed unit for adults with learning difficulties and autism The care watchdog was wrong not to publish an inspection report raising concerns about Whorlton Hall, four years before a Panorama investigation suggested alleged abuse, a review says. Former Care Quality Commission inspector Barry Stanley-Wilkinson said not publishing his 2015 report was a ""missed opportunity"" to prevent abuse. Last year's undercover filmingappeared to show patients with learning difficulties being mistreated. Ten workers were later arrested. The County Durham hospital, which has now been closed, treated patients with severe learning difficulties and autism. Mr Stanley-Wilkinson said opportunities were missed to potentially prevent abuse The CQC commissioned David Noble QSO to carry outan independent review,externalinto how it dealt with the concerns raised by Mr Stanley-Wilkinson's draft inspection report and how they were addressed by senior personnel. Care firm's leadership criticised by Care Quality Commission Whorlton Hall abuse: Watchdog defends inspection Whorlton Hall abuse: Care watchdog launches investigations The unpublished 2015 reportfound the hospital, near Barnard Castle, ""required improvement"", raising a number of concerns, including inadequate staffing levels, a lack of training and a failure to follow patients' care plans. But a subsequent report the following year gave the privately-run, NHS-funded unit an overall rating of ""good"". The Noble review makes seven recommendations relating to the security and availability of notes from CQC inspections, information provided to inspectors about services, and the internal whistleblowing processes of the CQC. It said one of the main reasons Mr Stanley-Wilkinson's report was not published was that it was considered to be ""not of publishable quality"" and lacked evidence to back up some of the findings. This video can not be played Tony spoke out after his daughter was treated at Whorlton Hall But Mr Stanley-Wilkinson, who later resigned from the CQC, said the failure to publish his 2015 report ""was a missed opportunity to potentially prevent the abusive practices that we saw in the Panorama documentary"". He said: ""I'm still struggling to understand why that inspection report was never published. ""The CQC has said there wasn't sufficient evidence within the report. I was never asked to make any further amendments, I was never asked to supplement the report with further evidence. ""For them to say there was insufficient evidence within the report, that wasn't the responsibility of just my managers to make that decision, it was the responsibility of a quality panel to make that decision. ""But it never went to a quality panel."" The undercover Panorama filming at Whorlton Hall shook the sector. It came eight years after an expose at a similar facility, Winterbourne View. That scandal prompted ministers, inspectors and senior people in the learning disability sector to promise it would not happen again. People would be moved out of these type of units and tougher regulation would ensure these vulnerable patients were treated with dignity and respect. So the fact that warnings over the care being provided at Whorlton Hall went unheeded seems unforgiveable and prompt even more questions about how these institutions are regulated. After the BBC programme was aired, the Care Quality Commission claimed it was incredibly difficult to spot the signs of problems in the closed cultures that characterise these sort of institutions. But it is now clear the evidence the CQC needed to prompt them to take a closer look was under their noses all along. If the concerns of Barry Stanley-Wilkinson had been acted on, his bosses at the Care Quality Commission would surely have been compelled to keep a closer eye on what was going on at Whorlton Hall long before the BBC did. Sir Stephen Bubb, who wrote areport into the Winterbourne View scandal, said: ""In 2014 I recommended that the government close these institutions. They are by their nature abusive and I said we needed to develop community facilities. ""The government accepted that report but have done very little about it. ""You don't need more reviews. You need action to close them."" Whorlton Hall had at least 100 visits by official agencies in the year before the abuse was discovered.

The drive to stop plastic pollution growing in new forests,"An area of new planting in the Highlands using plastic protection Scotland's forestry industry says it is taking action to reduce the plastic pollution caused by tree planting. Hundreds of thousands of plastic tube tree guards are used every year to protect saplings from being eaten by deer, rabbits and voles. Most are made from single-use plastics and are often left to disintegrate in the open when a tree grows. Forestry and Land Scotland said it would now use recyclable tubes or those containing half as much plastic. Scotland marks 100 years of public forestry Tree planting target met for first time Planting trees is widely seen as environmentally beneficial, so it is ironic that it can also be a source of vast quantities of plastic waste. Findhorn-based charity Trees for Life has planted more than 1.6 million trees in the Highlands as part of efforts to regenerate native forests. It hardly ever uses plastic tree tubes. Instead, it uses fencing to keep hungry deer away from saplings. Plastic guards are used to protect saplings from being eaten by deer, rabbits and voles Trees for Life conservation manager Alan McDonnell said it was very easy to put tree guards out and then forget about them. He said: ""If people are carrying out very large planting projects and relying on tree tubes then they are bringing a lot of plastic into the landscape. For years all you see is these cylinders sticking up."" He said the tube would eventually burst or the tree would fail inside it. He added: ""The tube will stand there for years, then slowly fall down, break up and then gradually it will degrade. ""Those plastics will be left in the soil and just get absorbed into the environment. Then you get these localised pockets of plastic pollution, which are bad news."" The Scottish government has a target for 24,710 acres (10,000 hectares) of new forest to be planted each year, and plastic tree guards are often used by the public sector. For example, about 16,000 trees and shrubs have been planted in tubes alongside the new dual carriageway stretch of the A9 between Kincraig to Dalraddy in the Cairngorms National Park. However, efforts are being made to tackle the pollution created by single use plastic tree guards. The Scottish government wants to create large areas of new forest Public body Forestry and Land Scotland said it used tree guards to aid the establishment of young trees in certain circumstances - depending on tree species and local deer, rabbit, hare or vole populations. A spokesman said: ""Of the 25 million trees that we plant annually when restocking or when creating new woodlands, only 1.6% of them will require tree guards. ""However, as a responsible land manager we are always looking for environmentally friendly ways of working and have recently started using new products that use half as much plastic or which are recyclable. ""We would certainly be very interested in trialling any effective and wholly biodegradable product that would meet the need to protect young trees for the necessary amount of time. Ideally, if a viable alternative was to become available, we'd like to stop using tree guards altogether."" He added: ""However, until such time as a suitable product becomes available, we will continue to look at minimising the use of tree guards, maintaining them in situ, removing them when trees are established and then disposing of them appropriately."" Plastic tree guards, which were invented in Scotland, remain popular as they not only protect saplings from browsing animals but also encourage growth by creating a miniature greenhouse effect. Manufacturer Berry Global is developing ways to reduce their environmental impact. Marketing director James Taylor said the key to this was ensuring responsible collection and disposal. He said: ""We are working at the moment to see how we can collect used tree guards after their five to eight-year lifespan."" ""We want to make sure it is as easy as possible for people to deposit them somewhere locally so we can collect them and reprocess them into new products to try to close the loop and get closer to that circular economy.""

"Watchdog 'missed opportunity to stop abuse'An unpublished report on a hospital for vulnerable adults could have prevented abuse, a review finds.Tees","Whorlton Hall was a 17-bed unit for adults with learning difficulties and autism The care watchdog was wrong not to publish an inspection report raising concerns about Whorlton Hall, four years before a Panorama investigation suggested alleged abuse, a review says. Former Care Quality Commission inspector Barry Stanley-Wilkinson said not publishing his 2015 report was a ""missed opportunity"" to prevent abuse. Last year's undercover filmingappeared to show patients with learning difficulties being mistreated. Ten workers were later arrested. The County Durham hospital, which has now been closed, treated patients with severe learning difficulties and autism. Mr Stanley-Wilkinson said opportunities were missed to potentially prevent abuse The CQC commissioned David Noble QSO to carry outan independent review,externalinto how it dealt with the concerns raised by Mr Stanley-Wilkinson's draft inspection report and how they were addressed by senior personnel. Care firm's leadership criticised by Care Quality Commission Whorlton Hall abuse: Watchdog defends inspection Whorlton Hall abuse: Care watchdog launches investigations The unpublished 2015 reportfound the hospital, near Barnard Castle, ""required improvement"", raising a number of concerns, including inadequate staffing levels, a lack of training and a failure to follow patients' care plans. But a subsequent report the following year gave the privately-run, NHS-funded unit an overall rating of ""good"". The Noble review makes seven recommendations relating to the security and availability of notes from CQC inspections, information provided to inspectors about services, and the internal whistleblowing processes of the CQC. It said one of the main reasons Mr Stanley-Wilkinson's report was not published was that it was considered to be ""not of publishable quality"" and lacked evidence to back up some of the findings. This video can not be played Tony spoke out after his daughter was treated at Whorlton Hall But Mr Stanley-Wilkinson, who later resigned from the CQC, said the failure to publish his 2015 report ""was a missed opportunity to potentially prevent the abusive practices that we saw in the Panorama documentary"". He said: ""I'm still struggling to understand why that inspection report was never published. ""The CQC has said there wasn't sufficient evidence within the report. I was never asked to make any further amendments, I was never asked to supplement the report with further evidence. ""For them to say there was insufficient evidence within the report, that wasn't the responsibility of just my managers to make that decision, it was the responsibility of a quality panel to make that decision. ""But it never went to a quality panel."" The undercover Panorama filming at Whorlton Hall shook the sector. It came eight years after an expose at a similar facility, Winterbourne View. That scandal prompted ministers, inspectors and senior people in the learning disability sector to promise it would not happen again. People would be moved out of these type of units and tougher regulation would ensure these vulnerable patients were treated with dignity and respect. So the fact that warnings over the care being provided at Whorlton Hall went unheeded seems unforgiveable and prompt even more questions about how these institutions are regulated. After the BBC programme was aired, the Care Quality Commission claimed it was incredibly difficult to spot the signs of problems in the closed cultures that characterise these sort of institutions. But it is now clear the evidence the CQC needed to prompt them to take a closer look was under their noses all along. If the concerns of Barry Stanley-Wilkinson had been acted on, his bosses at the Care Quality Commission would surely have been compelled to keep a closer eye on what was going on at Whorlton Hall long before the BBC did. Sir Stephen Bubb, who wrote areport into the Winterbourne View scandal, said: ""In 2014 I recommended that the government close these institutions. They are by their nature abusive and I said we needed to develop community facilities. ""The government accepted that report but have done very little about it. ""You don't need more reviews. You need action to close them."" Whorlton Hall had at least 100 visits by official agencies in the year before the abuse was discovered. A separate review of the CQC's regulation of the hospital between 2015 and 2019 has yet to be published. Danshell Group ran the 17-bed hospital unit in 2015 and was taken over by Cygnet in 2018. Cygnet said it was ""shocked and deeply saddened"" by the abuse allegations.

UN experts demand phone hack probe of Saudi prince,"Ties between Jeff Bezos and Mohammed bin Salman soured after Jamal Khashoggi's murder UN human rights experts have demanded an immediate investigation into allegations Saudi Arabia's crown prince hacked Amazon boss Jeff Bezos's phone. They said Mohammed bin Salman should also be investigated for ""continuous, direct and personal efforts to target perceived opponents"". A message from a phone number used by the prince has been implicated in a breach of Mr Bezos's data. The kingdom's US embassy has denied the ""absurd"" story. But the independent UN experts - Agnes Callamard, special rapporteur on summary executions and extrajudicial killings, and David Kaye, special rapporteur on freedom of expression - said the crown prince's ""possible involvement"" had to be investigated. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Mr Bezos - who also owns the Washington Post - worsened after Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government and one of the newspaper's staff, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. Saudis sentence five over Khashoggi murder How Saudi Arabia's crown prince rose to power The killing took place months after the alleged cyber-hack took place. Mr Bezos's phone was hacked after he received a WhatsApp message in May 2018 that was sent from the crown prince's personal account,according to the Guardian newspaper, which broke the story.,external An investigation into the data breach reportedly found that the billionaire's phone began secretly sharing huge amounts of data after he received the encrypted video file. In a statement, Ms Callamard and Mr Kaye said: ""The information we have received suggests the possible involvement of the crown prince in surveillance of Mr Bezos, in an effort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post's reporting on Saudi Arabia."" It said the allegations reinforced ""other reporting pointing to a pattern of targeted surveillance of perceived opponents and those of broader strategic importance to the Saudi authorities"". Was Jeff Bezos the weak link in cyber-security? Saudi Arabia accused over Bezos hack What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? The experts linked the case heavily to the Khashoggi murder, saying the Post reporter's phone had been hacked at the same time as Mr Bezos's. They said there had been ""a massive, clandestine online campaign against Mr Bezos and Amazon, apparently targeting him principally as the owner of the Washington Post"". The statement also called for ""rigorous control"" of the ""unconstrained marketing, sale and use of spyware"". The UN experts cited ""a 2019 forensic analysis of Mr Bezos' iPhone that assessed with 'medium to high confidence' that his phone was infiltrated on 1 May 2018 via an MP4 video file sent from a WhatsApp account utilised personally by Mohammed bin Salman"". This video can not be played Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" The crown prince and Mr Bezos had reportedly exchanged numbers a month earlier and within hours of the MP4's arrival, there was a ""massive and unprecedented exfiltration of data"" from Mr Bezos's phone. The analysis cited by the experts says the crown prince then ""sent WhatsApp messages to Mr Bezos... in which he allegedly revealed private and confidential information about Mr Bezos' personal life"". Private information was then leaked to the American tabloid, the National Enquirer. In February 2019 Mr Bezos accused it of ""extortion and blackmail"" after it published text messages between him and his girlfriend, former Fox television presenter Lauren SÃ¡nchez. A month earlier he and MacKenzie Bezos, his wife of 25 years, had announced that they planned to divorce having been separated for a ""long period"". The Twitter account of the kingdom's US embassy,externalissued an outright denial of the allegations against the crown prince. ""We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out,"" the embassy said. Mr Bezos has made no response to the UN experts' statement, but did tweet an image of himself with Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, along with the tag #Jamal: Allow Twitter content?

Analysis by Jane Wakefield, BBC News technology reporter A hack such as this was ""horribly easy to do once the vulnerability involved had been discovered,"" says computer expert Prof Alan Woodward. The seemingly innocent video would have contained malware that surreptitiously installed itself on the targeted phone. From there it would have been possible for the hacker to gain access to all the functions of the phone, from the GPS locator, to the camera, to the banking facilities and messaging apps. Such access is made possible via bugs in the code and, last year,a security flaw in WhatsApp was revealedthat would have allowed hackers to hide malicious code inside video files. Phone hacking is, says Prof Woodward, all too common in certain countries that are keen to keep an eye on journalists, dissidents and other activists perceived to be a threat to their regimes. So-called stalkerware is available off the shelf to these governments. But what about the involvement of the Saudi crown prince? Was it really him who installed the malware? It is unlikely that he set the phone up himself. So was his phone also being spied on? Or was he simply a vessel being used by the Saudi authorities? The plot thickens.

UK vows tech tax will go ahead despite US pressure,"Trade tensions with the US have spiralled after the chancellor, Sajid Javid, took a defiant stance at Davos. US treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin has threatened new tariffs on UK carmakers after the chancellor defied pressure to cancel a new tax on tech firms. Mr Javid said the UK would not back down over the tax which will hit US firms like Apple, Amazon and Facebook. A trade deal with the EU would take priority over one with the US after the UK leaves the EU this month, he added. Both officials said Boris Johnson and Donald Trump would discuss the trade agreement and the tech tax this week during the World Economic Forum in Davos. The UK government sees a new trade deal with the US as a high priority after Britain leaves the European Union at the end of this month. But some parts of the UK economy are closely integrated with the EU, its largest trading partner. UK told to 'hold fire' on April tech tax France agrees to delay tax on tech giants The comments from Mr Javid and Mr Mnuchin came during a panel discussion at the annual gathering of business and government representatives in Switzerland. The new tax is aimed at firms that do a lot of business in the UK but don't pay taxes based on the size of their sales. The US is considering retaliatory tariffs on European car exports if a new tech tax is imposed France this week agreed to suspend a similar measure after the US had threatened to impose new levies on French exports of wine, cheese and handbags. France will not levy their tech tax until the end of the year to allow time for a multilateral coordinated agreement on tax reform to be agreed. Mr Javid said that while the UK would like to see an international agreement, he planned to go ahead with the introduction of the new multibillion pound tax, which is due to take effect in April. Mr Javid described the new tax as ""proportionate"". US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said: ""We think the digital tax is discriminatory in nature... if people want to arbitrarily put taxes on our digital companies we'll consider arbitrarily putting taxes on car companies."" Former UK chancellor, George Osborne, told the BBC that he thought the government would be wary of provoking the US over the new tax. ""It will be a very brave British government that walks into a trade war with the United States at the very moment when centrepiece of its economic policy is to strike a trade deal with the United States,"" he told the Today Programme. The UK, along with several other European countries, wants to limit the tech giants' ability to avoid taxes. They argue taxes should be based on where the digital activity takes place, not where firms have their headquarters. So if a UK consumer searches for a product or posts things online, and advertising is sold alongside those pages, the business should count - for tax purposes - as taking place in the UK. But it has proven difficult to agree exactly how a new system would work. So some countries including the UK, France, Italy, Austria and Turkey, have considering imposing unilateral levies. But trade officials in Washington say US firms are being unfairly targeted. The UK is under pressure to follow France's example and delay its plan to levy tax worth 2% of the revenues of search engines, social media companies and online marketplaces, a change which would bolster public finances by Â£500m a year. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which is overseeing efforts to find a joint solution, has urged national governments to wait for a multilateral agreement. Secretary General Angel Gurriatold the BBCthat without that there would be a ""cacophony and a mess"" of 40 countries going their own way with ""tensions rising all over the place"". Mr Gurria said that the UK government should ""absolutely hold fire and contribute to a multilateral solution"". Industry body the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) called for the UK and US ""to explore all options that avoid restrictive measures"" in order to avoid a tit-for-tat trade war developing. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said: ""The US is one of UK automotive's most important global partners, second only to the EU in trade terms, so the continued threat of additional tariffs that could endanger the viability of our sector is of huge concern.""

'Failing' rail firm faces public ownership,"The transport secretary said South Western Railway's performance was ""significantly below expectation"" A rail firm could be taken in to public ownership should it fail financially, the government has said. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said South Western Railway's (SWR) franchise was now ""not sustainable in the long term"" Thecompany recently declared a Â£137m loss. It said it was involved in ""ongoing and constructive discussions"" with the government over remedies for the problems with its franchise. Contingency measures include issuing a short-term contract to SWR's owners or moving its operations to the Department for Transport, Mr Shapps said. SWR services were disrupted for 27 days in December by the latest in a series of strikes over the future of guards. By Paul Clifton, BBC South transport correspondent It's pretty clear SWR's franchise is not going to survive in its present form. The government has three choices. It can tear up the South Western franchise, and agree a new one. It can hand the same people a short-term management contract in which the government bears the financial risk, and the operator receives a fee. That's how neighbouring Govia Thameslink Railway is run. Or, as a last resort, it can strip SWR of its contract and run the trains directly. Changing the owner won't alter the underlying problems. They're also partly down to Network Rail, partly down to new and refurbished trains arriving late, and partly down to the RMT union's two years of strikes. Do you blame the company for signing an ambitious deal that turned out to be undeliverable? Or do you blame the Department for Transport for not doing its due diligence and demanding the impossible? You choose. Either way, how this railway is run is going to change. Mr Shapps said SWR had ""not yet failed to meet their financial commitments"" but the department ""must prepare suitable contingency measures"". He said poor punctuality and reliability combined with slower revenue growth has led to the operator's financial performance being ""significantly below expectation"" since the franchise began in August 2017. SWR's operations could also be moved to the Operator of Last Resort (OLR), a public sector operator wholly owned by the Department for Transport. Rail firm could lose franchise after Â£137m loss Strike-hit rail company boss to be replaced He insisted the moves would ""not impact on the railway's day-to-day operations"" for passengers and staff. Earlier this monthSWR's accounts,external, for the year ending 31 March 2019, showed a loss after tax of Â£136.9m. The firm operates routes between London Waterloo, Reading, Bristol, Exeter, Weymouth, and Portsmouth, as well as Island Line on the Isle of Wight. SWR's owners FirstGroup and MTR were awarded the franchise in August 2017, after outbidding previous operator Stagecoach. In a statement FirstGroup and MTR said: ""We continue to be in ongoing and constructive discussions with the Department for Transport regarding potential commercial and contractual remedies for the franchise and what happens next as we seek to ensure the right outcome for our customers, our shareholders and the government."" The RMT union, which is in dispute with SWR over the role of guards on its trains, said the government was ""throwing good public money after bad and trying to breathe life into the rotting corpse of privatised rail"". General secretary Mick Cash said: ""Instead of dreaming up new ways to subsidise private sector profits by attacking civil liberties, [Grant Shapps] should stop pushing cost-cutting driver only operation and bring SWR into public ownership, running it in the interests of passengers and workers not his mates in the City.""

Wuhan: Where the virus began,"The Yangtze (brown) and Han rivers (blue) merge in Wuhan Wuhan may not be a well-known Chinese mega-city like Beijing or Shanghai. But the place where the coronavirus outbreak emerged is, in fact, a crowded metropolis with connections to every part of the globe. Estimates vary on the exact size of the population, with local government officials putting the figure at 11 million, though UN data from 2018 says8.9 million people live in the central Chinese city,external. Either way, the city is around the same size as London, but much bigger than Washington DC. One estimate makes it the42nd biggest city in the world,external, and the seventh biggest in China. And it's the size - and economic clout - of Wuhan that explains why the virus has travelled quickly across Asia, and even to the US. In short, the virus has spread so widely because lots of people visit Wuhan and take the virus home with them. Wuhan was a host city for the 2019 Basketball World Cup - including this match between Argentina and Nigeria Wuhan international airport handled20 million passengers in 2016,external, and offers direct flights to London, Paris, Dubai, and other cities around the world. The city is built along the Yangtze river and,according to its website,external, it is a ""foundation of in both hi-tech manufacturing and traditional manufacturing"". It has a series of industrial zones, 52 ""institutions of higher learning"", and claims more than 700,000 students - including, reportedly, thelargest number of undergraduates in the country,external. Some 230 of the world's 500 biggest companies (as measured by the Fortune Global list) have invested there. There is also notable investment from France - which had a foreign concession in Hankou, in today's Wuhan, between 1886 and 1943. More than 100 French firms have invested in the city andPeugeot-Citroen has a Chinese joint-venture plant there,external. Wuhan can also serve as a gateway to the Three Gorges - a tourist region and home to a huge hydroelectric dam. New China virus 'could mutate and spread further' New China virus: Your questions answered Chinese virus: How worried should we be? So, although the coronavirus originated in a local seafood market, the flow of people in and out of Wuhan has ensured its spread. The US patient, for example, had recently visited Wuhan, as had both Japanese patients. The Korean patient lived there. The case in Thailand is a Chinese tourist from Wuhan. The huge flow of people in and out of Wuhan will only increase as Chinese New Year approaches, and millions of people return home to celebrate. China's National Health Commission said travellers should avoid Wuhan, and that Wuhan residents should not leave the city. But Wuhan's status as one of the biggest - and most connected - places in the world means international cases will almost certainly continue to emerge.

UK told to 'hold fire' on April tech tax,"The UK has been told to ""hold fire"" on a new tax on big technology firms planned for April. The OECD said that there needs to be a global agreement on technology company tax. Without such an agreement, there would be the risk of ""a cacophony"" with countries going their own way. The warning came as Franceagreed to delay a new taxon multinational technology firms after an angry response from Washington. The organisation charged with brokering a global compromise on an issue threatening a transatlantic trade war has said the UK should hold fire on its digital sales tax. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer arrived at the World Economic Forum in Davos, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)'s Secretary General Angel Gurria told the BBC that without a global solution to technology companies paying less than a fair share of tax, there would be a ""cacophony and a mess"" of 40 countries going their own way with ""tensions rising all over the place"". In regards to the UK plan to levy a 2% tax on the UK revenues of search engines, social media companies and online marketplaces from April, Gurria, said that the government should ""absolutely hold fire and contribute to a multilateral solution"". France agrees to delay tax on tech giants Elsewhere at the World Economic Forum, there were indications that the French Government will delay its implementation of a tech tax to until the end of the year. The UK, France and several other European countries want to make sure that technology giants pay their ""fair share"" of tax in countries where they operate. These governments are concerned that technology giants - the largest of which are US companies - are avoiding taxes in the European Union. They argue taxes should be based on where digital activity takes place not where firms have their European headquarters. Italy, Austria and Turkey are also considering imposing new levies. Washington is opposed to the tax which it says unfairly targets US firms. However, Chancellor Sajid Javid has on Wednesday said the UK would push ahead with its digital tax, which could generate revenues of Â£500m a year. Mr Gurria is hosting a meeting between the French finance minister Bruno Le Maire and US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to confirm a ceasefire that should prevent a tit for tat trade war between the US and Europe. But Mr Mnuchin, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, warned other countries including the UK that ""they'll find themselves faced with President Trump's tariffs. We'll be having similar conversations with them"". However, tech companies are queuing up to say the tax system should change. Microsoft President Brad Smith told the BBC ""it does make sense for big tech companies to pay appropriate taxes"". And Apple chief executive Tim Cook in Ireland on Tuesday backed the OECD's effort to find a global solution. Officials preparing US-UK trade talks have expressed concern that the US would raise its objections to a UK digital sales tax in trade negotiations. The Treasury said: ""We've committed to introduce our Digital Services Tax from April 2020. It will be repealed once a global solution is in place"".

Super-rich elites making London 'off-limits',"London has become the ""epicentre of the elites"" in the UK, making it ""off limits"" for young people from poorer backgrounds, says a social mobility charity. The Sutton Trust says the high cost of housing has become a social barrier. A report, using London School of Economics research, says social mobility is easier outside the capital. Trust founder, Sir Peter Lampl, said the idea of going to London to ""move up in the world"" had become ""a myth"". The report says it is increasingly difficult for young people to move to London to get the high-paying jobs concentrated in the capital. ""Those that benefit most from opportunities in London were either born there or are the economically privileged from other parts of the country,"" said Sir Peter. ""London is essentially off-limits to ambitious people from poorer backgrounds who grow up outside the capital."" Inequality undermining trust in democracy London's population: Why do so many people leave the capital? Middle classes getting squeezed by ultra-rich This is exacerbated by practices such as unpaid internships, which are available only to those who can afford to live and work in London without earning. The report - Elites in the UK: Pulling Away? - highlights the rise of the ultra-rich in London in recent decades, with their wealth often deriving from finance and banking. London-born quantity surveyor Yusuf Vardalia says the city is now ""off limits for normal people"". While he was earning ""decent money"" living in London, buying property there was not an option. ""It was ridiculous. So in 2018 my wife and I decided to move to Leicester where we were able to get onto the property ladder and start building our life, which if we had decided to stick with London would have been an impossible dream,"" he said. Madison Hughes, a teaching assistant, says she can only afford to live in London because her parents pay her rent. ""My rent alone is over half my monthly salary and with bills and the general cost of living in London I would essentially be in debt every month,"" she said. ""I am so lucky to have generous parents who have the money to help me. ""My friends are all exactly the same - all the girls I live with either have parents paying their rent, or all their expenses."" She added that something needs to be done about London rent prices ""ASAP"". But James Marsh, who moved to the capital eight years ago, said ""if you're hard-working enough and have the drive to succeed, you will do well"". He had no financial help from his family and was in debt when he arrived in the city. ""It wasn't that easy at first living off Â£100 a week in London, for food and drinks, but it's not impossible,"" he said. ""It isn't unbalanced to other struggles you'd find in other major cities and quite frankly it's not the poverty line either."" He adds that if he had stayed in his home town ""I would not have got anywhere even close to where I am now, either at career level or financially"". The study suggests a lack of wider awareness among this wealthy elite - reinforced by the small, self-reflecting circles in which they move. These top earners do not see themselves as ""especially fortunate"" because they are ""surrounded by numerous other people like themselves"", says the study. The report warns of a social and geographical separation, with very affluent people in London having infrequent contact with those facing much tougher circumstances. They are likely to espouse values of meritocracy, while being part of a process that has seen social mobility becoming less likely. But if social mobility has become difficult in London, the report says there seems to have been much greater opportunities for progress outside the capital. Two thirds of the most socially mobile - who have come from working class backgrounds and then entered high-status professions - have done so by staying near to where they grew up. This ladder of progress has been more available for people not moving far from their home towns, rising up into jobs such as in medicine or law. ""In spite of the dominance of London, over two thirds of the socially mobile have never made a long-term move,"" says Sir Peter.

Sainsbury's boss to quit after six years,"Sainsbury's has announced its chief executive Mike Coupe will retire from the supermarket group. Mr Coupe has led Sainsbury's for almost six years, during which time he oversaw afailed attempt to mergewith rival supermarket Asda. The head of Sainsbury's retail and operations, Simon Roberts, will take over from Mr Coupe. ""This has been a very difficult decision for me personally,"" Mr Coupe said. ""There is never a good time to move on, but as we and the industry continue to evolve, I believe now is the right time for me to hand over to my successor."" Sainsbury's blames toy sales for quiet Christmas Sainsbury's named cheapest supermarket of 2019 Mr Coupe will step down as chief executive at the end of May and retire from Sainsbury's in July. His exit was announced a day after Sainsbury's said it wascutting ""hundreds"" of management rolesto reduce costs. It said the cuts were largely due to its integration of Argos, the catalogue store that it bought in 2016. Mr Roberts, who is due to take over on 1 June, has been involved in integrating Sainsbury's and Argos. He was also the former president of retailer Boots UK. In a statement, Mr Coupe said he was ""confident"" his chosen successor was ""the right choice for our customers, our colleagues and our investors"". Mr Coupe will continue to collect his Â£962,000 a year salary until he leaves. His successor will begin the role with a smaller Â£875,000 pay cheque. Mr Coupe gained a reputation for being deal-hungry after he successfully led talks to buy Argos and Nectar, the loyalty-card scheme used by Sainsbury's. But other deals were less fruitful - most notably the proposed Â£12bn merger with Asda. News of the deal sent the supermarket's share price up by as much as 20% and Mr Coupe had appeared confident when it was announced in 2018. He was even caught on camera singing ""We're in the money"" ahead of a media interview to discuss the merger. But Mr Coupe's optimism was short-lived. And, in April last year, the UK competition regulator blocked the merger. ""Just when you thought being caught on camera singing 'We're in the money' was a low point, the Asda merger subsequently didn't happen and Coupe was left scrabbling for a plan B,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. He said Mr Coupe ""may unfortunately be remembered for his singing rather than retailing"". ""He did the dance with Argos and Nectar but tripped up with attempts to marry Asda,"" he said. In the past year, the value of Sainsbury's shares has fallen by 22%. On Wednesday, its share price fell by 1.3% to 210p. Mike Coupe took the reins at J Sainsbury at what should have been an auspicious moment. A few months earlier Philip Clarke had been forced out as chief executive of Tesco, and Sainsbury's biggest commercial rival was in upheaval. Not only had Mr Clarke's chaotic reign left internal morale and profits at a low ebb, but there was a looming accounting scandal. All should have been set fair for Mr Coupe, but the reality was much tougher. There was a new competitive threat in the shape of Aldi and Lidl, German-owned discounters that have steadily taken market share in the UK. Morrisons was beginning its revival, and once Dave Lewis was established at Tesco it quickly got back into its stride. Sainsbury's was again in a fiercely competitive battle, squeezed by large mainstream rivals and upstart competitors. Mr Coupe's answer was to try to diversify the company's sources of income, a plan that became real with the successful purchase of Argos. He then thought he could add scale through a merger with Asda. The time was right - Asda's American owner, Walmart, was eager to sell, and the UK competition regulator had approved Tesco's purchase of the wholesaler Booker. A deal would have created a chain big enough to frighten Tesco, but Mr Coupe misjudged the situation. The Competition and Markets Authority rejected the tie-up in brutal fashion, leaving many investors wondering how the board could ever have thought it would go through. From that moment the clock was ticking for Mr Coupe, and his departure is not a surprise. His successor, Simon Roberts, inherits the same basic problem - how to make Sainsbury's stand out in the crowded middle ground of the UK grocery market. Mr Coupe's exit did not come as a shock to Maureen Hinton, a retail analyst at GlobalData. She thought the timing had been planned to allow for a period of stability at the supermarket following the failed Asda deal. ""The fact that they've got a candidate to take over makes it seem much more like it's been planned,"" she told the BBC. She said Sainsbury's had probably timed the announcement to give customers, staff and investors a period of ""stability"" after the failure of the Asda tie-up. She expected Mr Roberts would try to make further cost cuts and attract more shoppers, although she said some believed the grocery market was becoming saturated. ""There's only so much we can eat,"" she said.

New safety code for kids' online toys and apps,"Social media sites, online games and streaming services used by children will have to abide by a new privacy code set by the UK's data watchdog. Elizabeth Denham, the information commissioner, said future generations will be ""astonished to think that we ever didn't protect kids online"". She said the new Age Appropriate Design Code will be ""transformational"". The father of Molly Russell, 14, who killed herself after viewing graphic content online, welcomed the standards. The Information Commissioner's Office - the UK's data privacy regulator -published the new code of conduct,externalon Wednesday, after a draft which was first revealed last April. It hopes the changes will come into force by autumn 2021, once Parliament approves it, with large fines for breaches. The dad of Molly Russell, who took her own life aged 14, welcomed the code The code includes a list of 15 standards that companies behind online services are expected to comply with to protect children's privacy. Examples of online services which are included are toys which are connected to the internet, apps, social media platforms, online games, educational websites and streaming service. Firms who design, develop or run such products must provide a ""baseline"" of data protection for children, the code says. The standards also include: Location settings that would allow a child's location to be shared should be switched off by default Privacy settings to be set to high by default and nudge techniques to encourage children to weaken their settings should not be used ""I believe that it will be transformational,"" Ms Denham told the Press Association. ""I think in a generation from now when my grandchildren have children they will be astonished to think that we ever didn't protect kids online. I think it will be as ordinary as keeping children safe by putting on a seat belt."" Children ""are using an internet that was not designed for them,"" says Ms Denham Ms Denham said the move was widely supported by firms, although added that the gaming industry and some other tech companies expressed concern about their business model. She added: ""We have an existing law, GDPR, that requires special treatment of children and I think these 15 standards will bring about greater consistency and a base level of protection in the design and implementation of games and apps and websites and social media."" Doctors demand social media firms hand over data BBC launches 'digital wellbeing' app for children Social-media use 'disrupts teen sleep and exercise' The new standards follow concerns over young people suffering from grooming by predators, data misuse, problem gambling and access to damaging content which could affect their mental health. Ian Russell believes his daughter Molly's use of Instagram was a factor in her suicide aged 14 in 2017. After she died, her family found graphic posts about suicide and self-harm on her account. This video can not be played Molly Russell's father Ian travels to the United States and meets other parents bereaved by suicide The response following her deathled to Instagram pledgingto remove images, drawings and even cartoons showing methods of self-harm or suicide. Welcoming the code, Mr Russell said: ""Although small steps have been taken by some social media platforms, there seems little significant investment and a lack of commitment to a meaningful change, both essential steps required to create a safer world wide web. ""The Age Appropriate Design Code demonstrates how the technology companies might have responded effectively and immediately."" Andy Burrows, the NSPCC's head of child safety online policy, said the code would force social networks to ""finally take online harm seriously and they will suffer tough consequences if they fail to do so"". He said: ""For the first time, tech firms will be legally required to assess their sites for sexual abuse risks, and can no longer serve up harmful self-harm and pro-suicide content. ""It is now key that these measures are enforced in a proportionate and targeted way."" Facebook said it welcomed ""the considerations raised"", adding: ""The safety of young people is central to our decision-making, and we've spent over a decade introducing new features and tools to help everyone have a positive and safe experience on our platforms, including recent updates such as increased Direct Message privacy settings on Instagram. ""We are actively working on developing more features in this space and are committed to working with governments and the tech industry on appropriate solutions around topics such as preventing underage use of our platforms.""

Young people's career aspirations 'disconnected',"Too many people are aspiring to work in art, culture and entertainment, the report says The career hopes and dreams of young people in the UK are at odds with the types of jobs available, a study warns. Research by the charity Education and Employers suggests five times as many 17- and 18-year-olds in the UK want to work in art, culture, entertainment and sport as there are jobs available. And this disconnect means far too many are ""destined for disappointment"". The report,Disconnected: Career aspirations and jobs in the UK,external, is based on a survey of 7,000 teenagers. Also using data from the Office for National Statistics, the charity found the greatest excess of aspiration related to jobs in art and culture, entertainment and sport, where five times as many 17- and 18-year-olds want to work (15.6%) compared with the projected demand in the economy (3.3%). And for most of those (51%), this was the only sector in which they expressed an interest. Young people's career aspirations need to be ""constructively challenged"", the report says The analysis suggests the greatest shortfall of interest is in accommodation and catering, which needs ""almost seven times as many students (9.7% of the economy) as are expressing an interest (1.5%)"". It also says: ""Wholesale and retail trade similarly sees a very large shortfall - 2.6% expressing interest against 15.1% required."" Career ambitions 'already limited by age of seven' How do career dreams really work out? 'Ugandan children more ambitious than UK' The report says young people's aspirations are set early - as young as age seven - and do not change enough over time to meet demand. And this consistency of young peoples' career choices throughout their teenage years (and the frustrations and wasted energy it produces) will need significant effort to resolve. The research says young people's career aspirations need to ""be engaged with and, if necessary, constructively challenged"". It says a ""concerted effort"" is needed to address what it calls an aspiration-reality disconnect and calls for: significant expansion of career-related learning in primary schools more support for careers guidance in secondary schools better labour-market information for young people. The report says: ""From age seven, we need to ensure that children get to meet a range of people from different backgrounds and doing different jobs. The government says early careers advice can help young people ""set out on the right path"" ""People who can help bring learning to life, show them how the subjects they are studying are relevant to their futures. ""We need to stop children ruling out options because they believe, implicitly or explicitly, that their future career choices are limited by their gender, ethnicity or socio-economic background. ""This is not about providing 'careers advice' in primary schools but breaking down barriers, broadening horizons and raising aspirations, giving children a wide range of experiences of the world including the world of work."" A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""Young people are rarely short of ambition and we want them to have the skills and direction to match. ""As the report suggests, early careers advice can help young people set out on the right path to the job that channels their interests and unlocks their potential. ""That's why we're committed to having career leaders and have announced new funding for jobcentres to provide advice to more schools across the country."" The Education and Employers report is launched alongside new analysis of Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) data by international economics think tank the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which is being presented during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Andreas Schleicher, the OECD's director of education and skills, said: ""There are many interesting future-oriented jobs that British students are not seeing, particularly disadvantaged kids, and you can't be what you can't see.

Wuhan: The city where the virus began,"The Yangtze (brown) and Han rivers (blue) merge in Wuhan Wuhan may not be a well-known Chinese mega-city like Beijing or Shanghai. But the place where the coronavirus outbreak emerged is, in fact, a crowded metropolis with connections to every part of the globe. Estimates vary on the exact size of the population, with local government officials putting the figure at 11 million, though UN data from 2018 says8.9 million people live in the central Chinese city,external. Either way, the city is around the same size as London, but much bigger than Washington DC. One estimate makes it the42nd biggest city in the world,external, and the seventh biggest in China. And it's the size - and economic clout - of Wuhan that explains why the virus has travelled quickly across Asia, and even to the US. In short, the virus has spread so widely because lots of people visit Wuhan and take the virus home with them. Wuhan was a host city for the 2019 Basketball World Cup - including this match between Argentina and Nigeria Wuhan international airport handled20 million passengers in 2016,external, and offers direct flights to London, Paris, Dubai, and other cities around the world. The city is built along the Yangtze river and,according to its website,external, it is a ""foundation of in both hi-tech manufacturing and traditional manufacturing"". It has a series of industrial zones, 52 ""institutions of higher learning"", and claims more than 700,000 students - including, reportedly, thelargest number of undergraduates in the country,external. Some 230 of the world's 500 biggest companies (as measured by the Fortune Global list) have invested there. There is also notable investment from France - which had a foreign concession in Hankou, in today's Wuhan, between 1886 and 1943. More than 100 French firms have invested in the city andPeugeot-Citroen has a Chinese joint-venture plant there,external. Wuhan can also serve as a gateway to the Three Gorges - a tourist region and home to a huge hydroelectric dam. New China virus 'could mutate and spread further' New China virus: Your questions answered Chinese virus: How worried should we be? So, although the coronavirus originated in a local seafood market, the flow of people in and out of Wuhan has ensured its spread. The US patient, for example, had recently visited Wuhan, as had both Japanese patients. The Korean patient lived there. The case in Thailand is a Chinese tourist from Wuhan. The huge flow of people in and out of Wuhan will only increase as Chinese New Year approaches, and millions of people return home to celebrate. China's National Health Commission said travellers should avoid Wuhan, and that Wuhan residents should not leave the city. But Wuhan's status as one of the biggest - and most connected - places in the world means international cases will almost certainly continue to emerge.

China warns against travel to virus-hit Wuhan,"This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus Chinese authorities have urged people to stop travelling in and out of Wuhan, the city at the centre of a new virus outbreak that has killed 17 people. Those living in the city of 8.9 million people have also been told to avoid crowds and minimise public gatherings. The new virus has spread from Wuhan to several Chinese provinces, as well as the US, Thailand and South Korea. There are 440 confirmed cases, with the origin a seafood market that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"". Late on Wednesday the Chinese authorities confirmed the number of dead had almost doubled - from nine - in the space of a day. All fatalities so far have been in Hubei, the province around Wuhan. Officials inHong Kong also reported the territory's first two cases,external. Meanwhile, in Geneva, the World Health Organization's emergency committee is meeting to assess the global risks posed by the virus and decide if it should be declared an international public health emergency - as happened with swine flu and Ebola. Such a declaration, if made, could see advice issued on travel or trade restrictions. China drug makers soar on virus contagion fears Chinese virus: How worried should we be? Chinese social media users worry over virus Chinese authorities admitted the country was now at the ""most critical stage"" of prevention and control. ""Basically, do not go to Wuhan. And those in Wuhan please do not leave the city,"" said National Health Commission vice-minister Li Bin in one of the first public briefings since the beginning of the outbreak. Earlier this week, China confirmed that human-to-human transmission of the virus had taken place. The virus, known also as 2019-nCoV, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans. The Sars virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus. Signs of infection with the new virus include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. The first US case was confirmed on Tuesday. President Donald Trump said the situation was ""totally under control"" and that he trusted the information being provided by Chinese authorities. This video can not be played China health officials: ""Don't go to Wuhan, don't leave Wuhan"" Mr Li said there was evidence that the disease was ""mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract"". In general, coughs and sneezes are a highly effective way for viruses to spread. But China has still not been able to confirm the exact source of the virus. ""Though the transmission route of the virus is yet to be fully understood, there is a possibility of virus mutation and a risk of further spread of the epidemic,"" said Mr Li. He added that there were 2,197 people who were known to have come into contact with infected patients. No ""super spreader"" - a patient who has transmitted the virus to more than 10 people - has been discovered so far. At least 15 medical workers in Wuhan, who presumably came into contact with patients, are known to be infected. It's not a Chinese mega-city as well known as Beijing or Shanghai, but Wuhan has connections with every part of the globe. Only slightly smaller than London, the city is home to an international airport that handles tens of millions of passengers each year. These global links explain why the cases of the virus abroad have all involved people either from Wuhan or who had recently visited it. The city has economic clout too - nearly half of the world's 500 biggest companies have invested there. Read more about Wuhan There's no way to know but it's likely to be exacerbated by the millions of people across China who are travelling within the country for the Lunar New Year week-long holiday. Thousands are also travelling abroad. Authorities confirmed that human-to-human transmission of the virus had taken place Mr Li added that the festival would ""increase the risk of the disease spreading and the difficulty of prevention and control"". He said strict measures to control the disease would be put in place, calling for those in Wuhan to ""avoid crowds and minimise public gatherings"". These measures include temperature screening for all those leaving Wuhan, and improved sterilisation and ventilation at major transport hubs. New China virus: Your questions answered A ban on the trade of live poultry and wild animals has also been implemented in the city. State media reports said police were conducting spot checks to make sure this was enforced. The disease may have originally been passed from an animal to a human, said Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak is believed to have come from a market trading illegal wildlife in Wuhan There have been a handful of global cases: three cases in Thailand, one in Korea, one in Japan, one in Taiwan and one in the US. On Wednesday, the city of Macau also reported its first confirmed case of the virus. The patient is said to be a businesswoman who arrived from Wuhan over the weekend. Authorities in many places, including Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the US, Russia and Japan have stepped up screening of air passengers from Wuhan. The UK is expected to begin screening passengersarriving at London's Heathrow airport from Wuhan. Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers In Australia, a man who had travelled to Wuhan has been placed in isolation and is undergoing tests. Experts say there could be many cases going undetected and they expect the official numbers to rapidly increase. Researchers from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London now estimate that there have probably been about 4,000 cases in Wuhan. The centre's director, Prof Neil Ferguson, however said that the Chinese authorities had been ""remarkably open"" amid an ""enormously demanding situation"". 31 December:China alerts the WHO about a spate of pneumonia-like cases in Wuhan 1 January:The seafood/animal market believed to be at the centre of the outbreak is closed 9 January: WHO says the infection is caused by a new type of coronavirus 11 January:First death confirmed 13 January:Virus spreads abroad, with a suspected case in Thailand 16 January:A case in Japan is confirmed 17 January:Second death - a 69-year-old in Wuhan 20 January:Number of cases triples to more than 200, and outbreak spreads to Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai; third death confirmed; Chinese officials confirm human-to-human transmission 21 January:US authorities announce the first case in North America - a man who had visited Wuhan 22 January:Death toll climbs to 17, with more than 400 cases confirmed What is your question about the coronavirus?

UK 'to monitor China flights' as virus precaution,"This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus The UK is to monitor flights arriving from China, as part of a series of precautionary measures after the spread of a new coronavirus. The measures, announced by the Department of Health, will apply to flights from Wuhan to London Heathrow. The flights will be met in an isolated part of Terminal 4, with a health team available to check for symptoms. Public Health England said the current risk to the UK has been changed from ""very low"" to ""low"". The health team will check for symptoms of coronavirus and provide information to all passengers about symptoms. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan. The first flight to arrive in the UK after the measures were announced landed just after 18:00 GMT. A spokesman for Heathrow said the airport was working with the government to ""support the implementation of the measures"". He added: ""We would like to reassure passengers that the government assesses the risk of a traveller contracting coronavirus to be low."" Passengers on a flight from Wuhan were handed a leaflet about the infection as they arrived In Geneva, the World Health Organization's emergency committee is meeting on Thursday to assess the global risks posed by the virus and decide if it should be declared an international public health emergency - as happened with swine flu and Ebola. How worried should we be about the virus? New China virus: Your questions answered Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began Wuhan, the city at the heart of the outbreak, is totemporarily shut public transportin an attempt to halt the spread of the virus. The airport and train stations and other modes of transport will be closed to outgoing passengers from 10:00 local time on Thursday. There are estimated to have been 4,000 cases of the virus since the outbreak began, according to Professor Neil Ferguson, director of the Medical Research Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis. However he said it was difficult to assess the numbers and Chinese hospitals would probably now be overwhelmed with suspected cases. The outbreak has killed 17 people, and there are more than 500 confirmed cases. At least 15 medical workers in Wuhan have also been infected with the virus The vast majority of cases have been in Wuhan and Chinese authorities believe the virus originated from a seafood market that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"". However it has also spread to other Chinese cities and a handful of cases have been identified abroad, including in Japan andthe US.There have been no cases in Britain. On Tuesday, authorities in China confirmed for the first time that human-to-human transmission of the virus had taken place. On Wednesday, the Department of Health announced there will be an ""enhanced monitoring"" package in place for all direct flights from China to the UK because of the threat of coronavirus. In a statement, the government said the measures will include: A health team to meet each direct flight from Wuhan to London Heathrow Passengers on flights will hear an announcement and be given a leaflet to encourage them to report if they are ill Aircraft will land in an isolated area of Heathrow Terminal 4 that ""better lends itself to any health contingencies"" There are currently three direct flights a week from Wuhan to London Heathrow. The monitoring of direct flights will be kept ""under continuous review"" and expanded to other Chinese departure points if necessary, the government added. Individuals ""should seek medical attention if they develop respiratory symptoms within 14 days of visiting Wuhan, either in China or on their return to the UK"", according to Dr Nick Phin, deputy director of Public Health England's National Infection Service. He added: ""They should phone ahead before attending any health services and mention their recent travel to the city."" Dr Nathalie MacDermott, a clinical lecturer at King's College London, said screening for symptoms at the airport was ""limited"" as it will only identify people who have symptoms at the point they transit through the airport. ""It is therefore important that Public Health England are able to trace [travellers] in the future to determine if they have gone on to develop any symptoms,"" she said. Earlier, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Radio 5live said it was important to ""stay ahead of the issue"" and monitor the situation very carefully. Professor Calum Semple, an expert in outbreak medicine at Alder Hey Children's Hospital, said it could be difficult to spot passengers infected with the virus because it takes about five days for symptoms to appear and during this initial period someone could seem completely healthy. He told the BBC that these symptoms, which include fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties, can also be difficult to differentiate from seasonal flu. It comes as authorities in several countries, including Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan have stepped up screening of air passengers from Wuhan. US authorities last week announced similar measures at airports in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York. They have now announced plans to introduce similar measures at airports in Chicago and Atlanta this week. This type of coronavirus is a new strain that hasn't been seen in humans before, which means doctors still have lots to learn about it. The first human cases were identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. There have not been any other suspected human cases reported prior to this. The incubation period (how long it takes for symptoms to appear after catching the infection) is days, rather than weeks. It is not yet known how or when the virus became infectious to people. Experts believe the first cases were transmitted by an animal. Other coronaviruses, such as Sars and Mers, came from civet cats and camels respectively. At the moment, there is no vaccine that can protect people against it, but researchers are looking to develop one. The UK's expected measures do not appear to include a medical screening of passengers at the airport for signs of the virus, asthe UK did in 2014following the Ebola outbreak. Then, screening involved taking people's temperatures to check whether they have a fever and asking several questions to assess their risk. New China virus 'could mutate and spread further' China - which is stepping up containment measures - has still not been able to confirm the exact source of the virus. But the country's National Health Commission vice-minister Li Bin said there was evidence that the disease was ""mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract"".

"Michelle O'Neill says MLA pay rise 'unjustifiable'NI's deputy first minister says MLAs had not sought the salary increase and it ""should not be paid"".Northern Ireland","Party leaders issued a joint statement Stormont's five main party leaders have asked that a Â£1,000 pay rise in MLAs' salaries is ""immediately deferred"". MLAs' pay is due to rise from Â£49,500 to Â£50,500 but the five leaders jointly asked the Assembly Commission to halt this until the decision is reviewed. Stormont's Speaker Alex Maskey has now called commission members to a meeting on Thursday to discuss the issue. The current rules on MLAs' salaries and expenses were set by the Independent Financial Review Panel (IFRP) in 2016. Stormont's devolved government collapsed the following year and the panel's members terms later expired, but the IFRP's determination from 2016 still applies. That determination provides MLAs with a Â£500 annual increase to their salaries, but pay rises were blocked while devolution was suspended after a request from the Assembly Commission to the then Secretary of State Karen Bradley. With devolution restored, MLAs are due to automatically receive a Â£1,000 uplift - for the two years they did not get the additional money while Stormont was not running. However, many of the 90 MLAs have said they did not have any input into this decision and have offered to donate the money to charity. The assembly sat for the first time in three years on 11 January In a joint statement on Wednesday, the five main party leaders said: ""We share the broad public dismay at this development, only a matter of days after the Assembly and institutions have been fully restored. ""We have had a range of concerns over time around recommendations emerging from the Independent Financial Review Panel. ""We are jointly asking the Assembly Commission that any pay proposal is immediately deferred until the work of the Financial Review Panel has been comprehensively reviewed, and a new panel has the opportunity to consider this matter again and produce a fresh determination. ""We recognise that a number of MLAs and parties have indicated if the proposed pay increase cannot be halted, they will donate any additional sum to local causes and charities."" Assembly members to get Â£1,000 pay rise Â£15m paid in MLA salaries 'unacceptable' NI assembly members' pay drops by 15% On Wednesday evening, a spokesperson for the Northern Ireland Assembly said: ""The Speaker is mindful of the concerns expressed by the five main political parties in relation to the Independent Financial Review Panel's inflationary increases to MLA salaries arising from its 2016 determination. ""He has therefore invited Assembly Commission members and those members who are due to be appointed to the commission, to attend a meeting tomorrow afternoon, to discuss how those concerns might be addressed."" TheIFRP was established by the Assembly Commission in 2011,externalto make independent determinations in relation to MLAs' salaries, allowances and pensions. Under its 2016 determination, MLAs are due to receive another Â£500 rise in April 2020, unless the assembly establishes another mechanism to deal with MLA pay. Earlier, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in both said they would look at ways to stop the Â£1,000 pay increase. Sinn FÃ©in vice president Michelle O'Neill said it was ""unjustifiable"". The DUP said it was ""totally opposed"" to it, ""in light of the very recent restoration of the assembly"". The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in said they would explore ways to stop or return the pay rise The DUP said it supported ""the concept that pay levels should be entirely independent of any MLA input"". However, the statement added: ""We are currently examining options to see whether this rise can be returned and if not then it is the view of our members that they will not keep any additional salary but instead support local causes."" Speaking on BBC NI's Good Morning Ulster, Economy Minister Diane Dodds said: ""Whoever thought that this was a good thing to do, at this particular juncture, was way off the mark. ""It is incredibly unfortunate that this has jarred with the start of what has been quite a positive opening to the assembly."" Ms O'Neill tweeted on Tuesday that assembly members had ""no input into this decision, nor did they seek it"". In a statement on Wednesday, the party said it was ""actively exploring options to stop it"". ""If that's not possible then we'll see if the money can be returned to public funds or donated to charity,"" it added. This is quite the move by the party leaders. While it's clear they are doing this to try to curtail some of the public ire, how they are going about it might make some uncomfortable. MLAs stopped having an input into how their pay is set in 2011, when the independent body was established. Under the law, it states that the panel should not be ""subject to the direction or control of"" the Northern Ireland Assembly, or the Assembly Commission. But this statement is an indication that the politicians want to undo - or at least review - what the panel decided almost four years ago. The situation is complicated by fact that the panel members' terms of office were allowed to expire and no action was taken to replace them. It is now over to the Assembly Commission - made up of the Speaker and five members from the main parties - to respond. West Belfast MLA Gerry Carroll has criticised the pay increase All 12 SDLP MLAs said they would be donating their pay rises to charity. People Before Profit MLA Gerry Carroll said it was ""a slap in the face to nurses who stood on freezing pickets for months for pay parity, and the civil service staff who are still taking industrial action to get what they deserve"". Mr Butler, the UUP's Chief Whip, said in a Facebook post he would be donating the salary increase to a number of charities. ""Just for clarity, there is no way to refuse this pay increase. It is automatic. It was not voted on by MLAs,"" he added. The Alliance Party said it was ""working with other party leaders to find a means to defer this"". The former chair of the IFRP, Pat McCartan, said the determination in the 2016 report still applies. ""It did provide for a basic salary of an MLA of Â£49,000 with a less than 1% increase per annum of Â£500 provided inflation was running at more than 1%,"" he said. ""Now, when you roll that up, that is why you get the current level of salaries and it is entirely justified through the whole method that we use with job evaluation, pay comparison, and looking at all other legislatures in these islands.

Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe to retire,"Sainsbury's has announced its chief executive Mike Coupe will retire from the supermarket group. Mr Coupe has led Sainsbury's for almost six years, during which time he oversaw afailed attempt to mergewith rival supermarket Asda. The head of Sainsbury's retail and operations, Simon Roberts, will take over from Mr Coupe. ""This has been a very difficult decision for me personally,"" Mr Coupe said. ""There is never a good time to move on, but as we and the industry continue to evolve, I believe now is the right time for me to hand over to my successor."" Sainsbury's blames toy sales for quiet Christmas Sainsbury's named cheapest supermarket of 2019 Mr Coupe will step down as chief executive at the end of May and retire from Sainsbury's in July. His exit was announced a day after Sainsbury's said it wascutting ""hundreds"" of management rolesto reduce costs. It said the cuts were largely due to its integration of Argos, the catalogue store that it bought in 2016. Mr Roberts, who is due to take over on 1 June, has been involved in integrating Sainsbury's and Argos. He was also the former president of retailer Boots UK. In a statement, Mr Coupe said he was ""confident"" his chosen successor was ""the right choice for our customers, our colleagues and our investors"". Mr Coupe will continue to collect his Â£962,000 a year salary until he leaves. His successor will begin the role with a smaller Â£875,000 pay cheque. Mr Coupe gained a reputation for being deal-hungry after he successfully led talks to buy Argos and Nectar, the loyalty-card scheme used by Sainsbury's. But other deals were less fruitful - most notably the proposed Â£12bn merger with Asda. News of the deal sent the supermarket's share price up by as much as 20% and Mr Coupe had appeared confident when it was announced in 2018. He was even caught on camera singing ""We're in the money"" ahead of a media interview to discuss the merger. But Mr Coupe's optimism was short-lived. And, in April last year, the UK competition regulator blocked the merger. ""Just when you thought being caught on camera singing 'We're in the money' was a low point, the Asda merger subsequently didn't happen and Coupe was left scrabbling for a plan B,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. He said Mr Coupe ""may unfortunately be remembered for his singing rather than retailing"". ""He did the dance with Argos and Nectar but tripped up with attempts to marry Asda,"" he said. In the past year, the value of Sainsbury's shares has fallen by 22%. On Wednesday, its share price fell by 1.3% to 210p. Mike Coupe took the reins at J Sainsbury at what should have been an auspicious moment. A few months earlier Philip Clarke had been forced out as chief executive of Tesco, and Sainsbury's biggest commercial rival was in upheaval. Not only had Mr Clarke's chaotic reign left internal morale and profits at a low ebb, but there was a looming accounting scandal. All should have been set fair for Mr Coupe, but the reality was much tougher. There was a new competitive threat in the shape of Aldi and Lidl, German-owned discounters that have steadily taken market share in the UK. Morrisons was beginning its revival, and once Dave Lewis was established at Tesco it quickly got back into its stride. Sainsbury's was again in a fiercely competitive battle, squeezed by large mainstream rivals and upstart competitors. Mr Coupe's answer was to try to diversify the company's sources of income, a plan that became real with the successful purchase of Argos. He then thought he could add scale through a merger with Asda. The time was right - Asda's American owner, Walmart, was eager to sell, and the UK competition regulator had approved Tesco's purchase of the wholesaler Booker. A deal would have created a chain big enough to frighten Tesco, but Mr Coupe misjudged the situation. The Competition and Markets Authority rejected the tie-up in brutal fashion, leaving many investors wondering how the board could ever have thought it would go through. From that moment the clock was ticking for Mr Coupe, and his departure is not a surprise. His successor, Simon Roberts, inherits the same basic problem - how to make Sainsbury's stand out in the crowded middle ground of the UK grocery market. Mr Coupe's exit did not come as a shock to Maureen Hinton, a retail analyst at GlobalData. She thought the timing had been planned to allow for a period of stability at the supermarket following the failed Asda deal. ""The fact that they've got a candidate to take over makes it seem much more like it's been planned,"" she told the BBC. She said Sainsbury's had probably timed the announcement to give customers, staff and investors a period of ""stability"" after the failure of the Asda tie-up. She expected Mr Roberts would try to make further cost cuts and attract more shoppers, although she said some believed the grocery market was becoming saturated. ""There's only so much we can eat,"" she said.

Dementia patients 'dumped in hospital',"Dementia patients are being dumped in hospitals in England because of a lack of community care, a charity says. The Alzheimer's Society called for action, highlighting data showing one in 10 dementia patients spends over a month in hospital after being admitted. The figures also suggested the overall number of emergency admissions among people with dementia is rising - with some patients yo-yoing back and forth. Ministers said they were ""determined"" to tackle the problems. Central to this, the government said, would be plans for reforming the social care system, which encompasses care home places and support in people's homes. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said a long-term solution would be found to ensure dementia patients were treated with ""dignity"". ""We know that hospital visits can be distressing for people with dementia which is why there should be high-quality care in the community,"" she added. Dorothy Boschi had to be admitted to hospital three times during her last year of life after having falls and contracting infections. Each time led to lengthy stays - she spent seven months in hospital in total. Her daughter, Daphne, 63, from South Gloucestershire, said this continued even when doctors decided she was ready to be discharged because support could not be found to look after her in the community. She died in January last year, aged 97. Daphne said the situation led to her mother becoming ""angrier, depressed and more frustrated"" in her final months. ""Everything was a battle to get proper care. The whole system has lost sight of the person they are meant to be providing care for."" The Alzheimer's Society analysed hospital records covering emergency admissions in the six years to 2017-18. It found 379,000 cases where dementia had been recorded on admission - a rise of 100,000 since 2012-13. This represents just a small fraction of the six million emergency admissions that year - although that is likely to be an underestimate as the condition is not always recorded on hospital systems. The charity believes around a quarter of patients in hospital at any one point will have dementia. Around 40,000 of the dementia admissions - one in 10 - spent longer than 28 days in hospital. Alzheimer's Society chief executive Jeremy Hughes said people were falling through the ""cracks of our broken social care system"". ""People with dementia are all too often being dumped in hospital and left there. Many are only admitted because there's no social care support to keep them safe at home. ""They are commonly spending more than twice as long in hospital as needed, confused and scared.""

Parking bans and clean air: The cities going greenHow the clampdown on emissions is driving radical change in Scotland's busiest areas.Scotland,"Edinburgh and Glasgow are battling to become the first ""net zero"" cities in the UK Scotland is soon to be the focus of global attention with theUN climate change summit drawing ever closer. The event will be held in Glasgow, which is battling with Edinburgh to become theUK's first ""net zero"" city- placing their greenhouse emissions at a neutral level. But plans to cut traffic are in motion across the country in addition to numerous rejuvenation projects to create greener, more attractive public spaces. Is Scotland leading the way on climate change? The four big ideas in Scotland's new transport law This video can not be played What is climate change? Glasgow faces anumber of challengesbefore meeting its 2030 target, particularly city centre congestion and pollution. However, it was the first Scottish city tointroduce a low-emission zone. More improvements have been made in the past year, such as two new camera-controlled bus gates either side of Central Station. One of the council's latest plans is to limit vehicles around George Square as part of multi-million project that could ultimately ban parking in the area entirely. A public consultation held over October and November last year showed huge public support for less traffic, more pedestrian areas and more green spaces for relaxing. Plans to limit vehicles on George Square will be considered by the council Next week the council will consider a proposal to fully pedestrianise the east and west sides of the square - at the City Chambers and Merchants House, respectively. The north and south sides would allow public transport and cyclists. If approved this phase could be in place before the UEFA European Football Championships in June. Further permanent works could also be carried out after the summer of 2023 to improve connectivity just beyond the square, costing an additional Â£3m. Parking will be completely banned in the area if proposals are green-lit There are also a number of ongoing projects in Aberdeen aimed at both cutting traffic and breathing new life into one of the city's most historic spaces. Like Glasgow, Aberdeen council bosses are considering plans to ban vehicles from certain streets overnight in order to make them safer and ""more welcoming"". Union Terrace Gardens rejuvenation forces one-way traffic move in Aberdeen Transformation of historic gardens begins Improving fortunes for Aberdeen's Union Street Minister insists zero carbon future still needs good roads The ban would apply between 22:00-05:00 on certain areas off Union Street, which runs through the heart of the city. Certain exemptions would include emergency vehicles and cyclists. Meanwhile, Union Terrace Gardens - a historic park and thoroughfare - is in the middle of a refurbishment which took more than 10 years to get moving. The design for Union Terrace Gardens includes new walkways and new disabled parking Since 2007, swaying public opinion and councillor debates have seen several proposals scrapped, plus Â£50m of investment from businessman Sir Ian Wood taken off the table. Finally, aÂ£25.7m facelift was accepted, including new walkways, an amphitheatre, a play area, cafe, and improved toilets. However, project director Kirstin Taylor said the design would allow ""easier and more inviting access"" and include new disabled parking and lifts into the gardens. It is expected to be completed in the summer of next year. The sunken gardens originally opened in 1879. Edinburgh has rolled out a number of green projects in the past year with several more on the horizon. It became the first city in the UK tojoin the Open Streets movementby closing certain areas of the Old Town between midday and 17:00 on the first Sunday of each month. Car ban and tram extension proposed in 10-year vision for Edinburgh By the end of 2020 it is hoped that the capital will introduce Scotland's second low emission zone, which meansolder cars will have to payto enter the city centre. Another broader city-wide zone would apply to buses, coaches and commercial vehicles. And earlier this month the council published plans for radical changes over the next 10 years to make the city carbon neutral. An artist's impression of how a pedestrianised George Street would look If the proposals go ahead, large portions of Edinburgh would become pedestrianised, George Street would be shut to vehicles by 2025 and the tram network extended by the end of the decade. Along with Glasgow, Edinburgh is the only other Scottish city to signal that it would introduce the workplace parking levy. Use the tool below and we could be in touch.

New China virus 'could mutate and spread further',"This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus Chinese authorities have urged people to stop travelling in and out of Wuhan, the city at the centre of a new virus outbreak that has killed 17 people. Those living in the city of 8.9 million people have also been told to avoid crowds and minimise public gatherings. The new virus has spread from Wuhan to several Chinese provinces, as well as the US, Thailand and South Korea. There are 440 confirmed cases, with the origin a seafood market that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"". Late on Wednesday the Chinese authorities confirmed the number of dead had almost doubled - from nine - in the space of a day. All fatalities so far have been in Hubei, the province around Wuhan. Officials inHong Kong also reported the territory's first two cases,external. Meanwhile, in Geneva, the World Health Organization's emergency committee is meeting to assess the global risks posed by the virus and decide if it should be declared an international public health emergency - as happened with swine flu and Ebola. Such a declaration, if made, could see advice issued on travel or trade restrictions. China drug makers soar on virus contagion fears Chinese virus: How worried should we be? Chinese social media users worry over virus Chinese authorities admitted the country was now at the ""most critical stage"" of prevention and control. ""Basically, do not go to Wuhan. And those in Wuhan please do not leave the city,"" said National Health Commission vice-minister Li Bin in one of the first public briefings since the beginning of the outbreak. Earlier this week, China confirmed that human-to-human transmission of the virus had taken place. The virus, known also as 2019-nCoV, is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus that has not previously been identified in humans. The Sars virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus. Signs of infection with the new virus include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. The first US case was confirmed on Tuesday. President Donald Trump said the situation was ""totally under control"" and that he trusted the information being provided by Chinese authorities. This video can not be played China health officials: ""Don't go to Wuhan, don't leave Wuhan"" Mr Li said there was evidence that the disease was ""mainly transmitted through the respiratory tract"". In general, coughs and sneezes are a highly effective way for viruses to spread. But China has still not been able to confirm the exact source of the virus. ""Though the transmission route of the virus is yet to be fully understood, there is a possibility of virus mutation and a risk of further spread of the epidemic,"" said Mr Li. He added that there were 2,197 people who were known to have come into contact with infected patients. No ""super spreader"" - a patient who has transmitted the virus to more than 10 people - has been discovered so far. At least 15 medical workers in Wuhan, who presumably came into contact with patients, are known to be infected. It's not a Chinese mega-city as well known as Beijing or Shanghai, but Wuhan has connections with every part of the globe. Only slightly smaller than London, the city is home to an international airport that handles tens of millions of passengers each year. These global links explain why the cases of the virus abroad have all involved people either from Wuhan or who had recently visited it. The city has economic clout too - nearly half of the world's 500 biggest companies have invested there. Read more about Wuhan There's no way to know but it's likely to be exacerbated by the millions of people across China who are travelling within the country for the Lunar New Year week-long holiday. Thousands are also travelling abroad. Authorities confirmed that human-to-human transmission of the virus had taken place Mr Li added that the festival would ""increase the risk of the disease spreading and the difficulty of prevention and control"". He said strict measures to control the disease would be put in place, calling for those in Wuhan to ""avoid crowds and minimise public gatherings"". These measures include temperature screening for all those leaving Wuhan, and improved sterilisation and ventilation at major transport hubs. New China virus: Your questions answered A ban on the trade of live poultry and wild animals has also been implemented in the city. State media reports said police were conducting spot checks to make sure this was enforced. The disease may have originally been passed from an animal to a human, said Gao Fu, director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The outbreak is believed to have come from a market trading illegal wildlife in Wuhan There have been a handful of global cases: three cases in Thailand, one in Korea, one in Japan, one in Taiwan and one in the US. On Wednesday, the city of Macau also reported its first confirmed case of the virus. The patient is said to be a businesswoman who arrived from Wuhan over the weekend. Authorities in many places, including Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the US, Russia and Japan have stepped up screening of air passengers from Wuhan. The UK is expected to begin screening passengersarriving at London's Heathrow airport from Wuhan. Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers In Australia, a man who had travelled to Wuhan has been placed in isolation and is undergoing tests. Experts say there could be many cases going undetected and they expect the official numbers to rapidly increase. Researchers from the MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London now estimate that there have probably been about 4,000 cases in Wuhan. The centre's director, Prof Neil Ferguson, however said that the Chinese authorities had been ""remarkably open"" amid an ""enormously demanding situation"". 31 December:China alerts the WHO about a spate of pneumonia-like cases in Wuhan 1 January:The seafood/animal market believed to be at the centre of the outbreak is closed 9 January: WHO says the infection is caused by a new type of coronavirus 11 January:First death confirmed 13 January:Virus spreads abroad, with a suspected case in Thailand 16 January:A case in Japan is confirmed 17 January:Second death - a 69-year-old in Wuhan 20 January:Number of cases triples to more than 200, and outbreak spreads to Beijing, Shenzhen and Shanghai; third death confirmed; Chinese officials confirm human-to-human transmission 21 January:US authorities announce the first case in North America - a man who had visited Wuhan 22 January:Death toll climbs to 17, with more than 400 cases confirmed What is your question about the coronavirus?

"Super-rich elites making London 'off-limits'Moving to London is unaffordable for those from poorer backgrounds, says social mobility report.Family & Education","London has become the ""epicentre of the elites"" in the UK, making it ""off limits"" for young people from poorer backgrounds, says a social mobility charity. The Sutton Trust says the high cost of housing has become a social barrier. A report, using London School of Economics research, says social mobility is easier outside the capital. Trust founder, Sir Peter Lampl, said the idea of going to London to ""move up in the world"" had become ""a myth"". The report says it is increasingly difficult for young people to move to London to get the high-paying jobs concentrated in the capital. ""Those that benefit most from opportunities in London were either born there or are the economically privileged from other parts of the country,"" said Sir Peter. ""London is essentially off-limits to ambitious people from poorer backgrounds who grow up outside the capital."" Inequality undermining trust in democracy London's population: Why do so many people leave the capital? Middle classes getting squeezed by ultra-rich This is exacerbated by practices such as unpaid internships, which are available only to those who can afford to live and work in London without earning. The report - Elites in the UK: Pulling Away? - highlights the rise of the ultra-rich in London in recent decades, with their wealth often deriving from finance and banking. London-born quantity surveyor Yusuf Vardalia says the city is now ""off limits for normal people"". While he was earning ""decent money"" living in London, buying property there was not an option. ""It was ridiculous. So in 2018 my wife and I decided to move to Leicester where we were able to get onto the property ladder and start building our life, which if we had decided to stick with London would have been an impossible dream,"" he said. Madison Hughes, a teaching assistant, says she can only afford to live in London because her parents pay her rent. ""My rent alone is over half my monthly salary and with bills and the general cost of living in London I would essentially be in debt every month,"" she said. ""I am so lucky to have generous parents who have the money to help me. ""My friends are all exactly the same - all the girls I live with either have parents paying their rent, or all their expenses."" She added that something needs to be done about London rent prices ""ASAP"". But James Marsh, who moved to the capital eight years ago, said ""if you're hard-working enough and have the drive to succeed, you will do well"". He had no financial help from his family and was in debt when he arrived in the city. ""It wasn't that easy at first living off Â£100 a week in London, for food and drinks, but it's not impossible,"" he said. ""It isn't unbalanced to other struggles you'd find in other major cities and quite frankly it's not the poverty line either."" He adds that if he had stayed in his home town ""I would not have got anywhere even close to where I am now, either at career level or financially"". The study suggests a lack of wider awareness among this wealthy elite - reinforced by the small, self-reflecting circles in which they move. These top earners do not see themselves as ""especially fortunate"" because they are ""surrounded by numerous other people like themselves"", says the study. The report warns of a social and geographical separation, with very affluent people in London having infrequent contact with those facing much tougher circumstances. They are likely to espouse values of meritocracy, while being part of a process that has seen social mobility becoming less likely. But if social mobility has become difficult in London, the report says there seems to have been much greater opportunities for progress outside the capital. Two thirds of the most socially mobile - who have come from working class backgrounds and then entered high-status professions - have done so by staying near to where they grew up. This ladder of progress has been more available for people not moving far from their home towns, rising up into jobs such as in medicine or law. ""In spite of the dominance of London, over two thirds of the socially mobile have never made a long-term move,"" says Sir Peter.

Madison Hughes, a teaching assistant, says she can only afford to live in London because her parents pay her rent. ""My rent alone is over half my monthly salary and with bills and the general cost of living in London I would essentially be in debt every month,"" she said. ""I am so lucky to have generous parents who have the money to help me. ""My friends are all exactly the same - all the girls I live with either have parents paying their rent, or all their expenses."" She added that something needs to be done about London rent prices ""ASAP"". But James Marsh, who moved to the capital eight years ago, said ""if you're hard-working enough and have the drive to succeed, you will do well"". He had no financial help from his family and was in debt when he arrived in the city. ""It wasn't that easy at first living off Â£100 a week in London, for food and drinks, but it's not impossible,"" he said. ""It isn't unbalanced to other struggles you'd find in other major cities and quite frankly it's not the poverty line either."" He adds that if he had stayed in his home town ""I would not have got anywhere even close to where I am now, either at career level or financially"". The study suggests a lack of wider awareness among this wealthy elite - reinforced by the small, self-reflecting circles in which they move. These top earners do not see themselves as ""especially fortunate"" because they are ""surrounded by numerous other people like themselves"", says the study. The report warns of a social and geographical separation, with very affluent people in London having infrequent contact with those facing much tougher circumstances. They are likely to espouse values of meritocracy, while being part of a process that has seen social mobility becoming less likely. But if social mobility has become difficult in London, the report says there seems to have been much greater opportunities for progress outside the capital. Two thirds of the most socially mobile - who have come from working class backgrounds and then entered high-status professions - have done so by staying near to where they grew up. This ladder of progress has been more available for people not moving far from their home towns, rising up into jobs such as in medicine or law. ""In spite of the dominance of London, over two thirds of the socially mobile have never made a long-term move,"" says Sir Peter.
