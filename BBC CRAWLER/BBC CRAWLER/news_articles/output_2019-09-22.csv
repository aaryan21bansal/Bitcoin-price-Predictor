Government 'will abide by Supreme Court ruling',"The government will abide by the Supreme Court's ruling on Parliament's suspension when the judgement is given this week, the foreign secretary says. Asked if prorogation would be used again if the PM wins, Dominic Raab said he did not want ""to take levers off the table"" that weakens the UK's position. The ruling on whether the decision to prorogue was unlawful is due this week. Jeremy Corbyn said he will work with other opposition parties to secure Parliament's recall if the PM loses. During a three-day hearing in the Supreme Court last week, the government argued that prorogation was not a matter for the courts. On the other side, lawyers opposing the suspension sought to prove the prime minister was trying to ""silence Parliament"" for five weeks - the longest period for 40 years - at a crucial political moment in the run-up to Brexit. Parliament is due to return for a Queen's Speech on 14 October - two weeks before the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October. What happened in the Supreme Court? Could MPs return to Parliament? Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Raab said: ""Of course we will respect whatever the legal ruling is from the Supreme Court. ""But I think we are getting a little bit ahead of ourselves."" He said the government was ""confident"" in its position. ""There are different permutations as to what the Supreme Court may or may not decide,"" he said. ""Later in the week we'll obviously want to look at that very carefully, but I can reassure you of course we are going to abide by a Supreme Court judgement."" When asked whether Parliament would be prorogued again if the government wins, he said: ""I think, let's wait and see what the first judgement decides and then we'll understand the lie of the land."" When pushed on the matter, he added he was ""keen not to take levers off the table that weaken the position of the UK in Brussels"". The Supreme Court ruling is due early this week But Labour leader Mr Corbyn told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show his party would oppose any attempt to prorogue Parliament again, saying the length of the suspension was ""unprecedented"". ""If they [the Supreme Court] decide that Parliament should be recalled, in other words the advice he [the prime minister] gave was wrong, then we would seek to take immediate action in Parliament to prevent him closing down Parliament all the way to 31 October,"" Mr Corbyn said. Meanwhile, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said there would have to be controls at the Irish border in a no-deal Brexit. He told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""We have to make sure that the interests of the European Union and of the internal market will be preserved. ""An animal entering Northern Ireland without border control can enter without any kind of control the European Union via the southern part of the Irish island. ""This will not happen. We have to preserve the health and the safety of our citizens.""

Housing crisis 'affects 8.4 million' in England,"An estimated 8.4 million people in England are living in an unaffordable, insecure or unsuitable home, according to the National Housing Federation. The federation said analysis suggests the housing crisis was impacting all ages across every part of the country. It includes people facing issues such as overcrowded housing or being unable to afford their rent or mortgage. The government said housing was ""a priority"" and it had delivered 430,000 affordable homes since 2010. The research, carried out by Heriot-Watt University on behalf of the federation, used data from the annualUnderstanding Society survey,externalof 40,000 people by the University of Essex. The figures were scaled up to reflect England's total population of nearly 56 million. Inside the housing crisis: Why I live in a cupboard Where can I afford to live? Where does rent hit young people the hardest? The research estimated: 3.6 million people are living in an overcrowded home 2.5 million are unable to afford their rent or mortgage 2.5 million are in ""hidden households"" they cannot afford to move out of, including house shares, adults living with their parents, or people living with an ex-partner 1.7 million are in unsuitable housing such as older people stuck in homes they cannot get around and families in properties which have no outside space 1.4 million are in poor quality homes 400,000 are homeless or at risk of homelessness - including people sleeping rough, living in homeless shelters, temporary accommodation or sofa-surfing Some people may have more than one of these housing problems, the federation said. People were considered to be living in overcrowded homes if a child had to share their bedroom with two or more children, sleep in the same room as their parents, or share with a teenager who was not the same sex as them. Homes where an adult had to share their bedroom with someone other than a partner were also considered overcrowded. After her relationship with her husband broke down, Anna spent five months trying to find somewhere to live with her four-year-old daughter in south-east London. Although she was working full-time in social care, she was shocked at how difficult it was to find someone who would rent to a single parent. Even when Anna found somewhere she felt she could afford, landlords would not consider her because her income was less than three-and-a-half times the monthly rent, while others refused to let to someone with a child. ""It was virtually impossible,"" the 36-year-old told the BBC. ""I remember seeing one house for Â£1,400 a month which was literally a corridor in a basement - it was so mouldy and humid. ""But they still said I didn't earn enough to be able to afford it."" ""It made me feel really powerless and frustrated,"" she added. Anna said she was ""losing all hope"" when a friend offered to rent a house to her below market rate. ""I don't know what I would have done if a friend hadn't been able to help me out when I needed it,"" she said, adding that she still doesn't feel completely secure. ""I just have no idea what I'll do if my friend needs to rent her house out at full price in the future."" The report also estimated that around 3.6 million people could only afford to live decently if they were in social housing - almost double the number on the government's official social housing waiting list. Social housing rents are on average 50% cheaper than from private landlords, contracts are more secure and many properties are designed specifically for older people with mobility issues, the federation said. It said the country needed 340,000 new homes every year, including 145,000 social homes, to meet the housing demand. This video can not be played What is social housing and why do we have it? Kate Henderson, Chief Executive at the National Housing Federation, called for ""a return to proper funding for social housing"". ""From Cornwall to Cumbria, millions of people are being pushed into debt and poverty because rent is too expensive, children can't study because they have no space in their overcrowded homes, and many older or disabled people are struggling to move around their own home because it's unsuitable,"" she said. A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said in 2018 the government built more homes than in all but one of the last 31 years. It has also cracked down on rogue landlords,banned unfair letting feesand capped deposits - saving renters at least Â£240m a year, he added. Millions of homes 'needed to solve crisis' Where can I afford to live? Where does rent hit young people the hardest?

Thomas Cook customers 'will not be stranded',"This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says that people ""will not be stranded"" if Thomas Cook collapses The government is ready to fly holidaymakers back to the UK if tour operator Thomas Cook collapses, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show contingency planning was in place to make sure no-one would be stranded. But he dampened hopes of a government rescue bid for the firm. Ministers did not ""systematically step in"" when businesses went under unless there was ""a good strategic national interest"", he said. Mr Raab said he did not want to undermine the rescue talks that Thomas Cook is currently conducting with its biggest shareholder and creditors in the City of London. What's gone wrong at Thomas Cook? We were held 'hostage' at hotel, say  customers Thomas Cook clients fear ruined weddings and trips The tour operator's financial difficulties have mounted over the past year, culminating in a refinancing plan in August led by its biggest shareholder, Chinese company Fosun. But banks now want the company to raise extra funds and it could fall into administration within days unless it finds Â£200m. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has aircraft on standby in case Thomas Cook does go into administration over night. The BBC understands that those aircraft are currently being flown to destinations so that British tourists can be flown home on Monday if necessary. A source said the CAA is ""very prepared"". The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) union, which represents Thomas Cook staff, isurging the government to step in with a bail outamid fears the company's collapse could leave about 150,000 British tourists stranded. Thomas Cook customers have been reminded on social media that they have Atol protection - a fund paid for through industry levies - ""in the event that Thomas Cook goes into administration"". The travel firm also reassured customers on Sunday that flights continue to operate as normal. Katie Prescott, business correspondent This meeting is crucial for Thomas Cook's survival. If there is no agreement, then the decision to wind up the company will be taken at a board meeting this evening. It's likely (looking at the precedent of Monarch's collapse) that any announcement about that will be made late at night, once all planes are on the ground. But the company doesn't have to announce anything until the markets open at 07:00 BST on Monday. It's low season at the moment, the time of year when Thomas Cook has to pay its suppliers for the busy summer season just gone. Hoteliers are paid on 60 to 90-day terms, once travellers have already taken their holidays. The nightmare scenario is that hoteliers who don't think they will get paid might turn out the people staying with them. However, it is worth re-stating that the company is still trading. People are still holidaying with Thomas Cook. And while we can assume the company is reining back marketing activity around last-minute deals and offers, until any announcement is made, it is business as usual. The foreign secretary said he did not want talk of contingency planning to become ""a self-fulfilling prophecy"". He told the BBC the government had learned lessons from the collapse of the Monarch airline in 2017. The UK's consular authorities abroad were ready to assist, he said. Thomas Cook has hundreds of High Street stores A government spokesperson described the situation as a ""worrying time for holidaymakers and employees"". They added: ""The financial circumstances of individual businesses are a commercial matter, but the government and the Civil Aviation Authority are monitoring the situation closely."" Why Thomas Cook might struggle to book a bailout Thomas Cook: MP calls for 'leadership' Liz Preston says they cheered when her plane landed in Palma As Thomas Cook customers anxiously wait to see if and how their holidays might be affected, some say they have already found themselves in ""horrible"" situations abroad. Customers at a hotel in Tunisia say they were prevented from leaving the propertyon Saturday unless they paid extra fees  - thousands of pounds in some cases - to cover what the resort says it is owed by the tour operator. In Majorca, it's a different story. Liz Preston said there were cheers when her plane took off from Gatwick. ""It was a moment that captured the sheer relief really, that we could still have a holiday, as well as the fact that it might be one of the last ever flights,"" she said. The Thomas Cook staff were in reassurance mode, urging customers to enjoy their holiday, but advising them to keep an eye on the news if the situation changes and their return flight becomes difficult. Richard Stevens regularly travels with Thomas Cook Richard Stevens from Faversham in Kent said he's ""gutted"" Thomas Cook is in such trouble, because he's been coming on Thomas Cook package holidays with his wife and two sons for ""donkey's years"". The domino effect of Thomas Cook's collapse on this holiday island would be significant. Hundreds of smaller industries rely on the through-flow of Thomas Cook travellers for excursion tours, water sports, as well as cafes and bars. Caledonia Tours is a company that offers sightseeing trips. Tour operator Lucas Pantone says 80% of his business is from Thomas Cook. ""If it goes under"" he says, ""we'll be having a crisis meeting within hours, over whether we can survive"". We were held 'hostage', say Thomas Cook customers There are currently 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British. One of the world's largest travel companies, Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and now has annual sales of Â£9bn. It employs 22,000 staff, 9,000 of whom are in the UK, and serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries. In July,Thomas Cook produced a business plansaying that it needed Â£900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of Â£150m. The Â£900m would come from China's Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors. The group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional Â£200m on top of the Â£900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to Â£1.1bn. Thomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional Â£200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out. The firm has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit. Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association, said: ""Ministers need to step forward and take responsibility for the sake of passengers and staff. ""There is a real risk that if the worst comes to the worst proper arrangements may not be in place for the repatriation programme and staff are still working while not knowing if they have a job or will even get paid for this month."" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said ""the government must consider stepping in and taking an equity stake to avoid this crisis"". If you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment. Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating. If you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme. If you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund. When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.

Johnson 'must address conflict of interest claims',"Labour has urged Boris Johnson to address claims he failed to declare a potential conflict of interest in how money was given to a US businesswoman while he was London mayor. The Sunday Times said,externalJennifer Arcuri, an entrepreneur associated with Mr Johnson, joined trade missions he led and was given Â£126,000 in public money. She told the paper this was part of her role as a legitimate businesswoman. No 10 declined to comment. A government department says it is investigating. Ms Arcuri was quoted by the Sunday Times as saying: ""Any grants received by my companies and any trade mission I joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman."" The BBC has contacted her for comment. Labour's London mayor Sadiq Khan has told the BBC that he has ordered City Hall officials to look into the allegations. Mr Khan said: ""All I know is what I have seen in the press. These are very serious allegations. At the moment they are just allegations. ""I have asked my chief of staff to ask City Hall officials to look into what process there was during this time, were those processes followed, but also whether there are also any lessons that need to be learned."" The newspaper says she moved back to the US in June 2018, but her latest company won a Â£100,000 grant intended for ""English-based"" businesses earlier this year. The Sunday Times said it had found the registered address on the grant application form is a rented house in the UK and no longer connected to her. The paper said the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport was investigating the award of the grant after the newspaper's inquiries. The government has now confirmed to the BBC it is investigating. But it highlighted the funds were awarded to a UK-registered company. A statement from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""Funding for this scheme was awarded through open and fair competition. ""We regularly monitor grant initiatives and treat any allegations of impropriety with the utmost seriousness."" The Sunday Times claims one of Ms Arcuri's businesses also received Â£10,000 in sponsorship money from a mayoral organisation when Mr Johnson was in office, and she received a Â£15,000 government grant for foreign entrepreneurs to build businesses in Britain. Jon Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said Mr Johnson should provide full disclosure on the allegations. ""Boris Johnson must now give a full account of his actions in response to these grave and most serious allegations of the misuse use of public money in his former role as mayor of London,"" Mr Trickett said in a statement. ""The public has a right to know how and why these funds were used for the benefit of a close personal friend without on the face of it legitimate reason. ""This cannot be swept under the carpet. It is a matter of the integrity of the man now leading our country, who appears to believe he can get away with anything."" Mr Johnson was London mayor between 2008 and 2016.

Ruthless Ireland dismiss meek Scotland,"Rory Best's try helped Ireland to a 12-0 lead inside 15 minutes 2019 Rugby World Cup: Ireland v Scotland Ireland:(19) 27 Tries:Ryan, Best, Furlong, ConwayPens:CartyCons:Sexton, Murray Scotland:(3) 3 Pen:Laidlaw Ruthless Ireland franked their status as the world's top-ranked side with a clinical Rugby World Cup victory against a meek Scotland in Yokohama. The Irish went over in their first two incursions into the Scottish 22, James Ryan and Rory Best ploughing over to put them 12-0 ahead after 15 minutes. Greig Laidlaw got the Scots on the board, but a wretched bounce led to Tadhg Furlong adding a third try before the half was out. Andrew Conway then crossed after the break to secure Ireland's bonus point. Ireland play hosts Japan on Saturday next, with Scotland facing Samoa two days later. Hosts Japan won the first match in Pool A on Friday,defeating Russia 30-10, with the Samoans yet to play. 'Ireland captain Best silenced critics' 'Scotland lacked energy & aggression' Reaction & as it happened Fixtures, results & pools Ireland have won many games against Scotland - five out of six in the Joe Schmidt era - but none bigger than this and not many as thoroughly emphatic either. Schmidt's team turned up in a major way, driving into the guts of their opponents pretty much from the get-go. It would be an exaggeration to say the Irish are a contender at the World Cup on the back of this, but they've certainly accelerated away from the dog days of the Six Nations and the pitiful shellacking at England's hands at Twickenham in the warm-up campaign. Scotland, though, delivered the square root of not a lot. No belligerence, no anger at getting bullied. They were routed pure and simple. This video can not be played Rugby World Cup: Watch the best moments as England, Ireland and Italy win on day three The Scots have a desperate propensity for conceding tries early in games. That failing didn't start when Gregor Townsend took over as coach but it's intensified - and here that weakness struck again inside just six minutes. What Townsend would have been looking for would have been a first quarter of control. What he got was a first quarter from his nightmares and Schmidt's dreams. It was humid but Ireland's beginning was white hot. The first score had its origins in Iain Henderson bullocking his way into Scotland's 22, evading the tackles of Stuart McInally and Grant Gilchrist. Getting in behind the underdogs was half the job done. A few recycles later, the thing was completed when the towering Ryan stuck his nose to the floor and drove over. Johnny Sexton converted. Ireland were on their way. Ireland were winning every physical battle and practically every breakdown. There was a huge illustration of their confidence after quarter of an hour when Sexton said 'no, thanks' to a kickable penalty and bashed his kick into touch instead. In going for the Scottish jugular, they didn't miss. Henderson, bruising and quite brilliant, soared to catch and when the rumble went over the line it was Best who got the touch down. There was a question as to whether he had full control of the ball, but the try stood and it was almost poetic that it was the captain who got it. Best has had a miserable 2019, a year when his 37 years seem to be catching up without him. He appeared to be panting and wheezing his way towards retirement. This, though, was a big day for the captain. And a big day for his team. Though Laidlaw made it 12-3 just after the first quarter, it was a mere crumb in comparison to Ireland's feast, a third try coming soon after. The kick to Scotland's solar plexus was that it came off one of their own attacks, when the ball came bouncing off Tommy Seymour's body only to be hacked downfield. Hogg got back to rescue it under his sticks but was driven back over his own line. Scrum Ireland. Off went CJ Stander from the base and, in quick order, over went Furlong amid a ruck of bodies. All the boys in green must have been scratching their heads at how easy it all was out there. Conor Murray missed the conversion, the scrum-half filling in on the goal-kicking front for Sexton, who was moving gingerly after coming in for a bit of treatment from the Scottish forwards. Briefly discomforting the fly-half was about their only achievement all evening. Ireland found space with ease against a team with a shocking lack of bite. Stander made a gallop up the middle and made 30 metres in one moment. Jacob Stockdale chipped and gathered and made even more ground shortly after. Ireland were 16 points clear and it told a false picture of how dominant they really were. Before the break there was more calamity for the Scots when their best forward, Hamish Watson, was taken off on a stretcher in clear distress. Another grim moment on a grim day for Townsend's weirdly passive side. Andrew Conway crosses in the second half to clinch a bonus point for Ireland As the rain started to fall more steadily, Ireland took an even firmer grip on things. Just before the hour-mark they struck for their bonus point try to all but guarantee top spot in their pool and a probable quarter-final with the Springboks, a game that can't look as daunting to them now as it might have done a while back. Conway, filling in for the absent Keith Earls, got it. Murray's precise box kick was not dealt with by Ryan Wilson in his own 22. Jordan Larmour, filling in excellently for the injured Rob Kearney, picked it up and shipped it back to Murray, who put Conway away. The wing stepped around the last defender to finish with aplomb. The scrum-half missed the conversion, not that it mattered. The next time an Irishman had a pot at goal, Jack Carty was on the field and he made no mistake. A 24-point game now. No contest. Scotland finally managed to get some possession late on long after the fight was over. Tadhg Beirne came on to the field as a replacement and then went off again for killing ball under his own posts. The Scots put a line-out to touch and tried to work a fancy one at the front, which was defended well. They then tried to move it out the line but Ireland weren't having any of that either. Josh van der Flier ended the attack quite ruthlessly. That single moment could serve as a microcosm of the day. Ireland were too physical, too canny, too good. Far, far too good.

Johnson 'must address conflict of interest claims'The government says it is investigating after claims against the PM are made by a newspaper.UK Politics,"Labour has urged Boris Johnson to address claims he failed to declare a potential conflict of interest in how money was given to a US businesswoman while he was London mayor. The Sunday Times said,externalJennifer Arcuri, an entrepreneur associated with Mr Johnson, joined trade missions he led and was given Â£126,000 in public money. She told the paper this was part of her role as a legitimate businesswoman. No 10 declined to comment. A government department says it is investigating. Ms Arcuri was quoted by the Sunday Times as saying: ""Any grants received by my companies and any trade mission I joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman."" The BBC has contacted her for comment. Labour's London mayor Sadiq Khan has told the BBC that he has ordered City Hall officials to look into the allegations. Mr Khan said: ""All I know is what I have seen in the press. These are very serious allegations. At the moment they are just allegations. ""I have asked my chief of staff to ask City Hall officials to look into what process there was during this time, were those processes followed, but also whether there are also any lessons that need to be learned."" The newspaper says she moved back to the US in June 2018, but her latest company won a Â£100,000 grant intended for ""English-based"" businesses earlier this year. The Sunday Times said it had found the registered address on the grant application form is a rented house in the UK and no longer connected to her. The paper said the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport was investigating the award of the grant after the newspaper's inquiries. The government has now confirmed to the BBC it is investigating. But it highlighted the funds were awarded to a UK-registered company. A statement from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""Funding for this scheme was awarded through open and fair competition. ""We regularly monitor grant initiatives and treat any allegations of impropriety with the utmost seriousness."" The Sunday Times claims one of Ms Arcuri's businesses also received Â£10,000 in sponsorship money from a mayoral organisation when Mr Johnson was in office, and she received a Â£15,000 government grant for foreign entrepreneurs to build businesses in Britain. Jon Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said Mr Johnson should provide full disclosure on the allegations. ""Boris Johnson must now give a full account of his actions in response to these grave and most serious allegations of the misuse use of public money in his former role as mayor of London,"" Mr Trickett said in a statement. ""The public has a right to know how and why these funds were used for the benefit of a close personal friend without on the face of it legitimate reason. ""This cannot be swept under the carpet. It is a matter of the integrity of the man now leading our country, who appears to believe he can get away with anything."" Mr Johnson was London mayor between 2008 and 2016.

Scottish Labour leader calls for clarity on BrexitRichard Leonard tells the BBC his party needs a clearer position to put to voters.Scotland politics,"Richard Leonard was speaking to the Sunday Politics Scotland programme Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has said his party should have a clear policy to remain in the EU. Speaking on theSunday Politics Scotlandprogramme, he said ""clarity"" was need before Labour put its case to voters. The Scottish government has, meanwhile, asked for further funding to cope with a possible no-deal Brexit. The UK government said money would be available where Scotland faces disproportionate costs. In his television interview, Mr Leonard called for Labour to say its preference was to remain in the European Union. ""We recognise there are parts of the UK - and the overall result was to leave,"" he said. ""But I do think that we need clarity in our position. ""So you would expect me to be arguing, as I am, that means we need to be clearer in our position going into any public vote."" Mr Leonard added: ""The Scottish Labour party took a decision frankly in the wake of the European party election results that we needed to be much clearer, that we needed much greater clarity about the position that we were taking. ""For that reason the Scottish executive of the Labour party backed my proposal that we call for an affirmative vote that any deal should go back to the public; secondly, that on that vote there should be a remain option; and thirdly, that we would campaign unambiguously for remain."" His comments came as the Scottish government said more money would be needed if the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal. It has requested Â£52m from a contingency fund to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Money from the EU Exit Operational Contingency Fund has been made available ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union on 31 October. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay reiterated the Scottish government's opposition to any form of Brexit. He also asked that additional costs associated with it are met including those beyond the end of next month. Mr Mackay said: ""The UK government now seems to be actively pursuing a 'no-deal' outcome which is utterly unacceptable and must be avoided at all costs. ""We have requested Â£52m from the UK government's fund to help us prepare for a 'no-deal' outcome. ""This is the minimum requirement for operational activity but the real costs of a 'no-deal' Brexit will massively outweigh these and further funding will be required."" He also said leaving the EU was not Scotland's choice and called for any related costs to be covered by the UK government. Mr Mackay added: ""The Scottish government should not have to cut spending on public services to fund Brexit preparations. ""As a responsible government, we are already taking steps to protect jobs and our economy from a 'no-deal' Brexit and we will set out those plans to parliament shortly but we are facing additional and disproportionate costs to mitigate the impact of such an outcome. ""We will continue make the case for staying in the EU and will stand firm against efforts to take us out against our will."" The request includes funding to support the effect of no-deal on rural communities, increased demand on Marine Scotland and Police Scotland activities, additional communication to EU citizens in the country, and poverty mitigation measures. A Scottish Conservatives spokesman said: ""In 2016, the UK electorate voted to leave the EU. ""Only the Scottish Conservatives have worked to prevent no-deal by supporting a deal. ""The SNP were given Â£92m for our councils to prepare for Brexit. ""Yet there is no evidence Scottish local authorities have received anything at all."" It comes after Scotland's chief economist on Friday predicted a potential Â£2bn loss of investment because of Brexit. Forecasts up to April 2020 in the Scottish government's quarterly State of the Economy Report show Â£500m of investment could be wiped out if uncertainty continues with the figure rising by the end of the year. A spokeswoman for the UK government said: ""We have allocated the Scottish government nearly Â£140m in funding for EU exit preparation. ""We will consider the Scottish government's further bid under the Â£1bn Operational Contingency Fund in the usual way.""

Football manager for past 66 years wins SFA award,"This video can not be played Earlier this year, BBC Scotland News made a film about Larry and his love of football. One of the longest-serving managers in British football history has said he is ""chuffed"" after being awarded by the Scottish Football Association. Larry Barilli, 84, has been in charge of amateur teams in Greenock for 66 years. He was named this year's Best Volunteer in Adult Football in the SFA's Grassroots Awards at a ceremony in Hampden Park. In his career, he has managed seven teams in the Greenock area since 1953. Larry Barilli, pictured with his award along with former Scotland Womenâs international Suzanne Winters and Scotland manager Steve Clarke. The great-grandfather told the BBC: ""I was quite chuffed to be recognised. I got a right good cheer. ""I spoke about the old Bill Shankly saying - 'football is not a matter of life and death, it is much more important than that'. ""When I was 38 years old, my late wife said to me 'Larry, you will need to choose between me and football. I said 'that's a pity, because I liked you'."" Larry estimates to have only missed seven games through illness over the years. He started as a player-manager when he 18 after setting up a team and naming it after the street he grew up in. It is thought Forfar club secretary and manager James Black is the only man to have managed in Scotland for a longer time, and Larry will match his record this season when he leads his team Chaplins in the Greenock and District Welfare League. Scotland's longest-serving football managers: James Black (Forfar manager/club secretary for 66 years) Larry Barilli (Manager in Greenock amateur leagues for 66 years) Bob McGlashan (Arbroath manager/club secretary for 43 years) Willie Maley (Celtic's manager for 43 years) Jock Finlayson (40 years with Hill Of Beath Hawthorn) John Hunter (35 years at Motherwell) Bill Struth (34 years as Rangers boss) Source - Scottish Football Museum Notable others: Ivor Powell, who is in the Guinness Book of World Records as the oldest working football coach, aged 93. He worked as a coach for 58 years. Fred Everiss (manager and club Secretary at West Brom for 46 years) Guy Roux (44 years at Auxerre) Roly Howard (35 years at non-league Merseyside club Marine) Everyone who attended the awards ceremonywatched a BBC film about Larry that was broadcast earlier this year. After some mild abuse of the referee and colourful language that one may expect at a Sunday league game, Larry celebrated after his team Chaplins defeated Belleaire 8-2 in a league match. Larry is believed to have managed about 2,000 games, and the Scottish Amateur Football Association is not aware of a football manager in Scotland who is older than him. As well as managing the side, Larry is Chaplins' kit man and works as a taxi driver two days a week. Larry Barilli was highlighted as ""a shining example"" of the impact volunteers have on Scottish football. Larry Barilli started managing football teams in the year Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay reached the summit of Mount Everest. For the past few years, some of his senior players at Chaplins have taken training while he concentrates on leading the team on match days. After many of his players left this summer, Larry is looking forward to managing a new-look Chaplins side when they kick off their season next week. Andy Gilchrist, West Regional Manager at the SFA, said: ""Larry is a shining example of the impact that volunteers have on the grassroots game in Scotland. His dedication to the game is unrivalled and his enthusiasm has clearly not waned over the years, which is remarkable to see. ""For Larry to have been volunteering in grassroots football for more than 60 years is a truly remarkable achievement. It is quite humbling to hear how he has benefitted the lives of others and it is no surprise that he received several nominations for this award."" William Collins, the Chairman of the Greenock and District Welfare League, added: ""Larry is a great example of someone who loves football at any level. He shares his enthusiasm with the local players and encourages them to play for as long as they can due to his love for the game. ""He is still pretty sharp on a Sunday. I'm sure his players will testify to that.""

Vettel beats Leclerc to Singapore win,"Sebastian Vettel ended his 13-month win drought with a controversial victory in the Singapore Grand Prix. The German benefited from unusual Ferrari strategy to leapfrog team-mate Charles Leclerc into the lead. Leclerc told the team over the radio that it was ""unfair"" and it will do little to reduce tension within the team. But it was a much-needed victory for the four-time world champion who has had a difficult, error-strewn season and faced questions about his status and future. How close is Vettel to joining F1's hall of shame? Singapore GP full race results Listen: 'I don't totally understand the undercut' - Leclerc The German has continued a run of one major driving error every three races since June last year, and seen Leclerc, already a two-time winner in his first season at Ferrari, emerge as a serious threat to his position as number one in the team. But Leclerc was very unhappy and made his feelings clear. Ferrari's strategy, however, did secure them their first one-two since the 2017 Hungarian Grand Prix and Vettel's first win since the Belgian Grand Prix at the end of August 2018. And it pushed Lewis Hamilton, who started second in the Mercedes, down to fourth, behind Red Bull's Max Verstappen. Singapore was the first time since 2008 Ferrari had won three consecutive races Vettel started third and his victory depended on a decision by Ferrari to stop him early, made to ensure he did not pit and come out behind Nico Hulkenberg's Renault, which had stopped for fresh tyres after a first-lap incident and was charging through the field. It arose because the leaders were managing their pace to ensure they could make their one pit stop at the optimum time. Seeing the risk from Hulkenberg to Vettel, the team pitted him on lap 19 and he rejoined in front of the Renault. Ferrari pitted Leclerc, who had led the race from the start from pole position, next time around but Vettel's pace advantage on his first lap out of the pits on fresh tyres ensured he was ahead of Leclerc when the 21-year-old emerged from the pits. ""What the hell?"" Leclerc said over the radio, almost certainly wondering why he was not pitted first. The Singapore night race is always spectacular to watch His engineer told him: ""It was the best we could do."" Leclerc said: ""I just wanted to let you know my feelings. To be completely honest, I don't understand the undercut at all. But we discuss it later."" The double early stop for the Ferraris meant both drivers had to work their way past slower cars that had not yet made a pit stop, and Vettel did this to better effect than Leclerc, building a six-second lead by the time they were running one-two on lap 33, just after half distance. The risk for Ferrari now was the threat from Hamilton, who had delayed his pit stop by six laps in an attempt to benefit from fresher tyres at the end of the race. But three safety-car periods for a series of incidents between back markers gave Ferrari the slow laps they needed to be sure their tyres would make it. At the final one, Leclerc asked for ""everything"" from the car to attack Vettel, but he was told he needed to manage the engine and bring the car home - code for him to hold position behind his team-mate. The safety car maintained its 100% record at the 12th Singapore Grand Prix - required three times Hamilton was running a close second behind Leclerc in the early laps, as the leaders lapped 13 seconds off their qualifying times to ensure their tyres went as long as necessary. But he was undone by Ferrari's strategy gamble. When Vettel pitted, Hamilton said to his team they should try to ""undercut"" Leclerc in the same fashion but that opportunity was removed when Leclerc stopped on the very next lap. That gave Mercedes no option but to run Hamilton long and attempt to attack on fresh tyres later in the race. But the strategy also dropped him behind Verstappen's Red Bull, and his tyre advantage - only a handful of laps - was not enough to enable him to try to pass cars on a track where a car is said to need a 2.4-second pace advantage to overtake. Hamilton even needed help from team-mate Valtteri Bottas, who pitted earlier and was told to back off to slow Red Bull's Alexander Albon, whom Hamilton would otherwise have come out behind. Russell collided with Grosjean at Turn 8, prompting the Williams driver to say it was ""hardly surprising"" But his championship lead over Bottas, who finished behind him in fifth, was extended to 65 points, and it remains only a matter of time before he wins a sixth world title. Behind Bottas, Albon drove a strong race in the Red Bull, albeit his real pace was not that clear because of the tyre-management aspect of the race. And Lando Norris drove well to take seventh and best of the rest for McLaren, ahead of Toro Rosso's Pierre Gasly, Hulkenberg and the Alfa Romeo of Antonio Giovinazzi at the end of a race that was soporific at the front but contained some harum-scarum racing in the midfield from time to time. The incidents that brought out the safety car were a crash between Haas' Romain Grosjean and Williams' George Russell on the exit of Turn Eight on lap 35; a retirement that stranded Sergio Perez's Racing Point on track on lap 39; and a collision between Daniil Kvyat's Toro Rosso and Kimi Raikkonen's Alfa Romeo when the Russian dived for a pass at Turn One on lap 50. Hard to give it to anyone after a race dominated by driving seconds off the pace to protect tyres and decided on a controversial strategy outcome, but Vettel managed his race well once in the lead and was under a lot of pressure, so let's give it to him Russia in a week's time. Three wins in a row; can Ferrari make it four? Mercedes will be determined to bounce back after the self-confessed errors of Singapore. Vettel, Leclerc and Verstappen share a podium together for the first time this season Vettel:""First of all, big congratulations to the team - the start of the season has been difficult for us then we started to come alive and I'm really proud of everyone's work back home. I really want to thank the fans over the last couple of weeks. We haven't been the best and it's happy to get so many letters and nice messages, and it gives me lots of strength and belief and I put it all into the car today."" Leclerc:""Obviously it is always difficult to lose a win like that but at the end it's a one-two for the team so I'm happy for that, our first of the season. I'm disappointed for me but I will come back stronger. It looks a lot more positive than expected, they've [the mechanics] done an amazing job."" Verstappen:""The whole race went well. At the beginning it was really slow and everyone was close together then I started to struggle with the tyres and we boxed and it was a good call. We undercut Lewis and from there it was about managing the tyres.""

Scottish Labour leader calls for clarity on Brexit,"Richard Leonard was speaking to the Sunday Politics Scotland programme Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has said his party should have a clear policy to remain in the EU. Speaking on theSunday Politics Scotlandprogramme, he said ""clarity"" was need before Labour put its case to voters. The Scottish government has, meanwhile, asked for further funding to cope with a possible no-deal Brexit. The UK government said money would be available where Scotland faces disproportionate costs. In his television interview, Mr Leonard called for Labour to say its preference was to remain in the European Union. ""We recognise there are parts of the UK - and the overall result was to leave,"" he said. ""But I do think that we need clarity in our position. ""So you would expect me to be arguing, as I am, that means we need to be clearer in our position going into any public vote."" Mr Leonard added: ""The Scottish Labour party took a decision frankly in the wake of the European party election results that we needed to be much clearer, that we needed much greater clarity about the position that we were taking. ""For that reason the Scottish executive of the Labour party backed my proposal that we call for an affirmative vote that any deal should go back to the public; secondly, that on that vote there should be a remain option; and thirdly, that we would campaign unambiguously for remain."" His comments came as the Scottish government said more money would be needed if the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal. It has requested Â£52m from a contingency fund to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Money from the EU Exit Operational Contingency Fund has been made available ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union on 31 October. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay reiterated the Scottish government's opposition to any form of Brexit. He also asked that additional costs associated with it are met including those beyond the end of next month. Mr Mackay said: ""The UK government now seems to be actively pursuing a 'no-deal' outcome which is utterly unacceptable and must be avoided at all costs. ""We have requested Â£52m from the UK government's fund to help us prepare for a 'no-deal' outcome. ""This is the minimum requirement for operational activity but the real costs of a 'no-deal' Brexit will massively outweigh these and further funding will be required."" He also said leaving the EU was not Scotland's choice and called for any related costs to be covered by the UK government. Mr Mackay added: ""The Scottish government should not have to cut spending on public services to fund Brexit preparations. ""As a responsible government, we are already taking steps to protect jobs and our economy from a 'no-deal' Brexit and we will set out those plans to parliament shortly but we are facing additional and disproportionate costs to mitigate the impact of such an outcome. ""We will continue make the case for staying in the EU and will stand firm against efforts to take us out against our will."" The request includes funding to support the effect of no-deal on rural communities, increased demand on Marine Scotland and Police Scotland activities, additional communication to EU citizens in the country, and poverty mitigation measures. A Scottish Conservatives spokesman said: ""In 2016, the UK electorate voted to leave the EU. ""Only the Scottish Conservatives have worked to prevent no-deal by supporting a deal. ""The SNP were given Â£92m for our councils to prepare for Brexit. ""Yet there is no evidence Scottish local authorities have received anything at all."" It comes after Scotland's chief economist on Friday predicted a potential Â£2bn loss of investment because of Brexit. Forecasts up to April 2020 in the Scottish government's quarterly State of the Economy Report show Â£500m of investment could be wiped out if uncertainty continues with the figure rising by the end of the year. A spokeswoman for the UK government said: ""We have allocated the Scottish government nearly Â£140m in funding for EU exit preparation. ""We will consider the Scottish government's further bid under the Â£1bn Operational Contingency Fund in the usual way.""

"UK must be reformed to survive, says Drakeford","Mark Drakeford has been Welsh first minister since the end of last year The UK must be reformed to survive, the Welsh first minister has told the Labour party conference. Mark Drakeford described how the bonds keeping the four nations together were ""being torn apart by Brexit"" and ""couldn't-care-less Tory governments"". In Brighton, he also repeated a commitment to campaign to remain in the EU in an election or fresh referendum. Mr Drakeford previously said Welsh independence was""rising up the political agenda"". ""Our task under a new UK Labour government must be to build a new United Kingdom,"" he said. ""One that genuinely works for its four constituent parts."" Labour Brexit splits: Welsh Labour leader confirms he will back remain November 'could be' right time for election - Mark Drakeford It is the first UK Labour conference since Mr Drakeford took over as Welsh Labour leader and first minister from Carwyn Jones last December. In his speech on Sunday, he set out a plan to reform the union, saying it ""can only be Labour that articulates a different vision for those repelled by the poisonous politics of division and despair"". Mr Drakeford's views are different to Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's on the Brexit process Mr Drakeford added that through reforming the UK and remaining as part of the EU, the Labour party could offer an alternative to ""narrow nationalism and worn-out imperialism"". His stance on campaigning to remain in the EU has put him at odds with the UK Labour stance on Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said if the party wins power it will offer a referendum choice between Remain and a ""credible"" Brexit option. Earlier, Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplementhe hoped the conference would focus on wider issues on Sunday rather than internal politics, following amove to oust deputy leader Tom Watson. ""There is to be a review of the deputy leader's position. I think that's right and proper,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""You wouldn't in Wales have a position as they have at UK level where two men hold both the leadership and deputy leadership so we've reviewed it already in Wales - time to review it at a UK level."" Mr Drakeford also wants the Welsh party to be in charge of reselecting Welsh MPs When Mark Drakeford told the conference hall that Welsh Labour would campaign ""unapologetically"" for remain in another referendum he got the biggest cheer of his speech. It highlights the big division facing Labour over Jeremy Corbyn's Brexit position - he's promising a referendum but he is refusing to say he'll support remain despite coming under intense pressure from many party members. As for the relationship between the Welsh party and the UK leadership - Mr Drakeford says he is not intending to put pressure on Mr Corbyn, but he insists that all Welsh Labour candidates will go into any general election on a remain platform. How that works in the context of the wider UK party is a bit confusing, given that it is Mr Corbyn who is in charge of Labour MPs once they are elected. But Mr Drakeford is not backing down on his Brexit position and neither is he retreating on another important issue. He wants Welsh Labour to be in charge of the reselection process for Welsh MPs. This may seem like a geeky, internal party matter (and I confess, it is!) but it is also about a struggle for control and a genuine disagreement between the Welsh and UK leaderships. And Mr Drakeford says he will not give up, despite having been knocked back once already. Don't get me wrong, they haven't fallen out. Mr Corbyn told me they get on ""just fine"", but""clear red water"",externalis flowing once again.

Corbyn faces calls to resolve Brexit divisions,"Jeremy Corbyn is coming under pressure amid divisions over Labour's Brexit strategy as leading figures call for the party to back staying in the EU. Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry said Labour must ""say no"" to leaving the EU at its party conference. And deputy leader Tom Watson said it must settle its position as ""a Remain party"" once and for all this week. But Unite leader Len McCluskey said anyone who could not support Jeremy Corbyn's position should stand aside. He said talk of divisions were ""fake news"" given that Labour had a policy of giving the public the final say in another referendum which the shadow cabinet could unite around. Corbyn plays down Labour splits amid aide's exit Where do the parties stand on Brexit? The party's NEC, or governing body, has agreed a motion which calls for the party to renegotiate the current terms of exit and then give voters the choice to back the new Brexit deal or to remain in the EU. Mr Corbyn has persistently refused to be drawn on which way he would campaign in another vote, saying it would depend on the kind of agreement he struck. Labour will also decide the terms of further motions on Brexit, which could call for the party to endorse a remain stance outright. The exact wording of the motion to be debated will be decided later on Sunday and voted on Monday. Mr Corbyn is under growing pressure to declare his hand from pro-EU figures in the party. Addressing a rally organised by the Progress group in Brighton, Mr Watson - who saw off an attempt to oust him on Saturday - said the ""simple truth is whatever anyone says - Labour is a remain party"". Calling on the leadership to ""to settle once and for all our position"", he said by backing remain ""I'm sure we can deliver a Labour government"". And Ms Thornberry questioned ""why on earth"" Labour would be complicit in allowing the UK to leave the EU. This video can not be played Labour ""will have a special conference"" to decide its stance on Brexit, Jeremy Corbyn says. ""Are we going to celebrate a Labour version of Brexit? No. We must have the Labour Party this week saying no to Brexit and we must lead the campaign to remain."" You might think policy is made on the conference floor but what goes behind closed doors - in smoke free rooms these days - is often more important. Representatives from constituencies and from trade unions try to distil disparate motions on the same topic down in to just one, on which they can all agree - and this is then put to the conference for approval the following day in the full knowledge that it will pass. But on Brexit, this usual template isn't working. The gap between the leadership and many in the grassroots has proved difficult to bridge. Labour's ruling national executive - which includes representatives of the big unions - has agreed a statement which would not commit the party to backing leave or remain until after any snap election. On Sunday night, though, grassroots delegates are expected to agree a motion, which would commit the party to campaigning to remain in the EU during the election. The pro-remain Mayor of London Sadiq Khan told me he would be urging delegates to stand firm on this and not to accept a fudge. And I understand it, the call from Len McCluskey of Unite - for remainers to back down in the interests of party unity - is likely to go unheeded. So as things stand, the differences between the leadership and much of the rank and file will be displayed in the full glare of publicity. However, the unions account for 50% of the votes at Labour conference - and if they continue to stand firmly behind Jeremy Corbyn then the overtly pro-remain position will be defeated. The political price could be high, though, and there will undoubtedly be further appeals for the remain motion to be withdrawn. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr show, Mr Corbyn acknowledged that most Labour supporters backed staying in the EU. But he said the party needed to show more understanding of why the country voted leave and even if the UK were to remain in the EU, there needed to be serious reform. Mr McCluskey, a key ally of Mr Corbyn, appealed for loyalty on the issue, saying the party must go into the looming general election ""united"". ""When we have a policy on Brexit and Jeremy Corbyn makes it clear that that is the policy, then that's what leading members of the shadow cabinet should argue for,"" he told Sky News. ""If they find they can't argue for it because they feel strongly, well, of course they have that right but they should step aside from the shadow cabinetâ¦and they can argue whatever they want.""

Ruthless Ireland dismiss meek ScotlandRuthless Ireland frank their status as the world's top-ranked side with a clinical Rugby World Cup victory against a meek Scotland in Yokohama.BBC SportComments,"Rory Best's try helped Ireland to a 12-0 lead inside 15 minutes 2019 Rugby World Cup: Ireland v Scotland Ireland:(19) 27 Tries:Ryan, Best, Furlong, ConwayPens:CartyCons:Sexton, Murray Scotland:(3) 3 Pen:Laidlaw Ruthless Ireland franked their status as the world's top-ranked side with a clinical Rugby World Cup victory against a meek Scotland in Yokohama. The Irish went over in their first two incursions into the Scottish 22, James Ryan and Rory Best ploughing over to put them 12-0 ahead after 15 minutes. Greig Laidlaw got the Scots on the board, but a wretched bounce led to Tadhg Furlong adding a third try before the half was out. Andrew Conway then crossed after the break to secure Ireland's bonus point. Ireland play hosts Japan on Saturday next, with Scotland facing Samoa two days later. Hosts Japan won the first match in Pool A on Friday,defeating Russia 30-10, with the Samoans yet to play. 'Ireland captain Best silenced critics' 'Scotland lacked energy & aggression' Reaction & as it happened Fixtures, results & pools Ireland have won many games against Scotland - five out of six in the Joe Schmidt era - but none bigger than this and not many as thoroughly emphatic either. Schmidt's team turned up in a major way, driving into the guts of their opponents pretty much from the get-go. It would be an exaggeration to say the Irish are a contender at the World Cup on the back of this, but they've certainly accelerated away from the dog days of the Six Nations and the pitiful shellacking at England's hands at Twickenham in the warm-up campaign. Scotland, though, delivered the square root of not a lot. No belligerence, no anger at getting bullied. They were routed pure and simple. This video can not be played Rugby World Cup: Watch the best moments as England, Ireland and Italy win on day three The Scots have a desperate propensity for conceding tries early in games. That failing didn't start when Gregor Townsend took over as coach but it's intensified - and here that weakness struck again inside just six minutes. What Townsend would have been looking for would have been a first quarter of control. What he got was a first quarter from his nightmares and Schmidt's dreams. It was humid but Ireland's beginning was white hot. The first score had its origins in Iain Henderson bullocking his way into Scotland's 22, evading the tackles of Stuart McInally and Grant Gilchrist. Getting in behind the underdogs was half the job done. A few recycles later, the thing was completed when the towering Ryan stuck his nose to the floor and drove over. Johnny Sexton converted. Ireland were on their way. Ireland were winning every physical battle and practically every breakdown. There was a huge illustration of their confidence after quarter of an hour when Sexton said 'no, thanks' to a kickable penalty and bashed his kick into touch instead. In going for the Scottish jugular, they didn't miss. Henderson, bruising and quite brilliant, soared to catch and when the rumble went over the line it was Best who got the touch down. There was a question as to whether he had full control of the ball, but the try stood and it was almost poetic that it was the captain who got it. Best has had a miserable 2019, a year when his 37 years seem to be catching up without him. He appeared to be panting and wheezing his way towards retirement. This, though, was a big day for the captain. And a big day for his team. Though Laidlaw made it 12-3 just after the first quarter, it was a mere crumb in comparison to Ireland's feast, a third try coming soon after. The kick to Scotland's solar plexus was that it came off one of their own attacks, when the ball came bouncing off Tommy Seymour's body only to be hacked downfield. Hogg got back to rescue it under his sticks but was driven back over his own line. Scrum Ireland. Off went CJ Stander from the base and, in quick order, over went Furlong amid a ruck of bodies. All the boys in green must have been scratching their heads at how easy it all was out there. Conor Murray missed the conversion, the scrum-half filling in on the goal-kicking front for Sexton, who was moving gingerly after coming in for a bit of treatment from the Scottish forwards. Briefly discomforting the fly-half was about their only achievement all evening. Ireland found space with ease against a team with a shocking lack of bite. Stander made a gallop up the middle and made 30 metres in one moment. Jacob Stockdale chipped and gathered and made even more ground shortly after. Ireland were 16 points clear and it told a false picture of how dominant they really were. Before the break there was more calamity for the Scots when their best forward, Hamish Watson, was taken off on a stretcher in clear distress. Another grim moment on a grim day for Townsend's weirdly passive side. Andrew Conway crosses in the second half to clinch a bonus point for Ireland As the rain started to fall more steadily, Ireland took an even firmer grip on things. Just before the hour-mark they struck for their bonus point try to all but guarantee top spot in their pool and a probable quarter-final with the Springboks, a game that can't look as daunting to them now as it might have done a while back. Conway, filling in for the absent Keith Earls, got it. Murray's precise box kick was not dealt with by Ryan Wilson in his own 22. Jordan Larmour, filling in excellently for the injured Rob Kearney, picked it up and shipped it back to Murray, who put Conway away. The wing stepped around the last defender to finish with aplomb. The scrum-half missed the conversion, not that it mattered. The next time an Irishman had a pot at goal, Jack Carty was on the field and he made no mistake. A 24-point game now. No contest. Scotland finally managed to get some possession late on long after the fight was over. Tadhg Beirne came on to the field as a replacement and then went off again for killing ball under his own posts. The Scots put a line-out to touch and tried to work a fancy one at the front, which was defended well. They then tried to move it out the line but Ireland weren't having any of that either. Josh van der Flier ended the attack quite ruthlessly. That single moment could serve as a microcosm of the day. Ireland were too physical, too canny, too good. Far, far too good.

The ceremony, which recognises excellence in television, took place in Los Angeles on Sunday. Comer won best leading drama actress for playing Villanelle inKilling Eve. Fleabagstar and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge took home the prize for best leading comedy actress, best comedy series and best comedy writing.

The show's director, Harry Bradbeer, won best director for a comedy series. ""For a director, something like Fleabag only comes along once in your life,"" he said. ""Thank you Phoebe for coming into my life like some kind of glorious grenade. Scientists are still trying to work out how someone so incredibly talented can be so utterly lovely.""

"Government 'will abide by Supreme Court ruling'But the foreign secretary says he will not ""take levers off the table"" for future action.UK Politics","The government will abide by the Supreme Court's ruling on Parliament's suspension when the judgement is given this week, the foreign secretary says. Asked if prorogation would be used again if the PM wins, Dominic Raab said he did not want ""to take levers off the table"" that weakens the UK's position. The ruling on whether the decision to prorogue was unlawful is due this week. Jeremy Corbyn said he will work with other opposition parties to secure Parliament's recall if the PM loses. During a three-day hearing in the Supreme Court last week, the government argued that prorogation was not a matter for the courts. On the other side, lawyers opposing the suspension sought to prove the prime minister was trying to ""silence Parliament"" for five weeks - the longest period for 40 years - at a crucial political moment in the run-up to Brexit. Parliament is due to return for a Queen's Speech on 14 October - two weeks before the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October. What happened in the Supreme Court? Could MPs return to Parliament? Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Raab said: ""Of course we will respect whatever the legal ruling is from the Supreme Court. ""But I think we are getting a little bit ahead of ourselves."" He said the government was ""confident"" in its position. ""There are different permutations as to what the Supreme Court may or may not decide,"" he said. ""Later in the week we'll obviously want to look at that very carefully, but I can reassure you of course we are going to abide by a Supreme Court judgement."" When asked whether Parliament would be prorogued again if the government wins, he said: ""I think, let's wait and see what the first judgement decides and then we'll understand the lie of the land."" When pushed on the matter, he added he was ""keen not to take levers off the table that weaken the position of the UK in Brussels"". The Supreme Court ruling is due early this week But Labour leader Mr Corbyn told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show his party would oppose any attempt to prorogue Parliament again, saying the length of the suspension was ""unprecedented"". ""If they [the Supreme Court] decide that Parliament should be recalled, in other words the advice he [the prime minister] gave was wrong, then we would seek to take immediate action in Parliament to prevent him closing down Parliament all the way to 31 October,"" Mr Corbyn said. Meanwhile, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said there would have to be controls at the Irish border in a no-deal Brexit. He told Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""We have to make sure that the interests of the European Union and of the internal market will be preserved. ""An animal entering Northern Ireland without border control can enter without any kind of control the European Union via the southern part of the Irish island. ""This will not happen. We have to preserve the health and the safety of our citizens.""

Throwing items into prison 'deeply disturbing',"This video can not be played Secret filming of prison throwovers is captured Footage of people throwing items into a prison where a fifth of inmates have a drugs habit have been described by a minister as ""deeply disturbing"". BBC Inside Out West set up cameras in the garden of a house neighbouring Bristol Prison and twice caught a man throwing in packages. A former inmate said drugs and phones were often thrown over the prison wall. Justice secretary Robert Buckland said Bristol Prison would see a staffing increase of a third. A report from the chief inspector of prisons, released last week, said many inmates developed a drug habit while in the prison. It said half the inmates said it was ""very easy"" (36%) or ""quite easy"" (14%) to get hold of illicit drugs in the jail. Mr Buckland said: ""It is always deeply disturbing to see people resort to that sort of criminality. ""The good news is that in one of those incidents the item was found and seized. ""The fact that you are focusing on it, the fact that we are talking openly about it, I think is good. I think the public needs to know this. ""We are now increasing staffing levels. For example, in Bristol, staffing levels have gone up by a third in the past two years."" Over half of prisoners said drugs were easy to get inside HMP Bristol Inside Out West found some of the prison's own CCTV cameras on the walls outside the facility were broken. Mr Buckland said they would be repaired. ""That's one of the items on our list to fix, to get the CCTV sorted,"" he said. ""I think this has really focused minds and attention. We need to make progress as quickly as possible in Bristol."" Inspectors warn over 'shocking' prison Prison violence shared on smuggled phones Prisons 'awash' with smuggled phones Eleanor Ager, the chair of the prison's independent monitoring board, said the video of the package being thrown into the prison ""shows how easy it is"". She said the incidents created an ""unhealthy... black market"" inside the prison. ""You're going to create an unhealthy environment for rehabilitation,"" she said. You can see more on this story on Inside Out on BBC One West at 7.30pm on Monday.

Scottish government wants Â£52m for no-deal BrexitMoney from the EU Exit Operational Contingency Fund has been made available ahead of Britain's departure from the EU.Scotland politics,"Richard Leonard was speaking to the Sunday Politics Scotland programme Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has said his party should have a clear policy to remain in the EU. Speaking on theSunday Politics Scotlandprogramme, he said ""clarity"" was need before Labour put its case to voters. The Scottish government has, meanwhile, asked for further funding to cope with a possible no-deal Brexit. The UK government said money would be available where Scotland faces disproportionate costs. In his television interview, Mr Leonard called for Labour to say its preference was to remain in the European Union. ""We recognise there are parts of the UK - and the overall result was to leave,"" he said. ""But I do think that we need clarity in our position. ""So you would expect me to be arguing, as I am, that means we need to be clearer in our position going into any public vote."" Mr Leonard added: ""The Scottish Labour party took a decision frankly in the wake of the European party election results that we needed to be much clearer, that we needed much greater clarity about the position that we were taking. ""For that reason the Scottish executive of the Labour party backed my proposal that we call for an affirmative vote that any deal should go back to the public; secondly, that on that vote there should be a remain option; and thirdly, that we would campaign unambiguously for remain."" His comments came as the Scottish government said more money would be needed if the UK crashed out of the EU without a deal. It has requested Â£52m from a contingency fund to prepare for a no-deal Brexit. Money from the EU Exit Operational Contingency Fund has been made available ahead of Britain's departure from the European Union on 31 October. Finance Secretary Derek Mackay reiterated the Scottish government's opposition to any form of Brexit. He also asked that additional costs associated with it are met including those beyond the end of next month. Mr Mackay said: ""The UK government now seems to be actively pursuing a 'no-deal' outcome which is utterly unacceptable and must be avoided at all costs. ""We have requested Â£52m from the UK government's fund to help us prepare for a 'no-deal' outcome. ""This is the minimum requirement for operational activity but the real costs of a 'no-deal' Brexit will massively outweigh these and further funding will be required."" He also said leaving the EU was not Scotland's choice and called for any related costs to be covered by the UK government. Mr Mackay added: ""The Scottish government should not have to cut spending on public services to fund Brexit preparations. ""As a responsible government, we are already taking steps to protect jobs and our economy from a 'no-deal' Brexit and we will set out those plans to parliament shortly but we are facing additional and disproportionate costs to mitigate the impact of such an outcome. ""We will continue make the case for staying in the EU and will stand firm against efforts to take us out against our will."" The request includes funding to support the effect of no-deal on rural communities, increased demand on Marine Scotland and Police Scotland activities, additional communication to EU citizens in the country, and poverty mitigation measures. A Scottish Conservatives spokesman said: ""In 2016, the UK electorate voted to leave the EU. ""Only the Scottish Conservatives have worked to prevent no-deal by supporting a deal. ""The SNP were given Â£92m for our councils to prepare for Brexit. ""Yet there is no evidence Scottish local authorities have received anything at all."" It comes after Scotland's chief economist on Friday predicted a potential Â£2bn loss of investment because of Brexit. Forecasts up to April 2020 in the Scottish government's quarterly State of the Economy Report show Â£500m of investment could be wiped out if uncertainty continues with the figure rising by the end of the year. A spokeswoman for the UK government said: ""We have allocated the Scottish government nearly Â£140m in funding for EU exit preparation. ""We will consider the Scottish government's further bid under the Â£1bn Operational Contingency Fund in the usual way.""

"Scotland and Ireland open Rugby World Cup campaignTeam news, stats and what they said as Ireland and Scotland open their Rugby World Cup campaign in Yokohama on Sunday (08:45 BST).BBC Sport","Rory Best's try helped Ireland to a 12-0 lead inside 15 minutes 2019 Rugby World Cup: Ireland v Scotland Ireland:(19) 27 Tries:Ryan, Best, Furlong, ConwayPens:CartyCons:Sexton, Murray Scotland:(3) 3 Pen:Laidlaw Ruthless Ireland franked their status as the world's top-ranked side with a clinical Rugby World Cup victory against a meek Scotland in Yokohama. The Irish went over in their first two incursions into the Scottish 22, James Ryan and Rory Best ploughing over to put them 12-0 ahead after 15 minutes. Greig Laidlaw got the Scots on the board, but a wretched bounce led to Tadhg Furlong adding a third try before the half was out. Andrew Conway then crossed after the break to secure Ireland's bonus point. Ireland play hosts Japan on Saturday next, with Scotland facing Samoa two days later. Hosts Japan won the first match in Pool A on Friday,defeating Russia 30-10, with the Samoans yet to play. 'Ireland captain Best silenced critics' 'Scotland lacked energy & aggression' Reaction & as it happened Fixtures, results & pools Ireland have won many games against Scotland - five out of six in the Joe Schmidt era - but none bigger than this and not many as thoroughly emphatic either. Schmidt's team turned up in a major way, driving into the guts of their opponents pretty much from the get-go. It would be an exaggeration to say the Irish are a contender at the World Cup on the back of this, but they've certainly accelerated away from the dog days of the Six Nations and the pitiful shellacking at England's hands at Twickenham in the warm-up campaign. Scotland, though, delivered the square root of not a lot. No belligerence, no anger at getting bullied. They were routed pure and simple. This video can not be played Rugby World Cup: Watch the best moments as England, Ireland and Italy win on day three The Scots have a desperate propensity for conceding tries early in games. That failing didn't start when Gregor Townsend took over as coach but it's intensified - and here that weakness struck again inside just six minutes. What Townsend would have been looking for would have been a first quarter of control. What he got was a first quarter from his nightmares and Schmidt's dreams. It was humid but Ireland's beginning was white hot. The first score had its origins in Iain Henderson bullocking his way into Scotland's 22, evading the tackles of Stuart McInally and Grant Gilchrist. Getting in behind the underdogs was half the job done. A few recycles later, the thing was completed when the towering Ryan stuck his nose to the floor and drove over. Johnny Sexton converted. Ireland were on their way. Ireland were winning every physical battle and practically every breakdown. There was a huge illustration of their confidence after quarter of an hour when Sexton said 'no, thanks' to a kickable penalty and bashed his kick into touch instead. In going for the Scottish jugular, they didn't miss. Henderson, bruising and quite brilliant, soared to catch and when the rumble went over the line it was Best who got the touch down. There was a question as to whether he had full control of the ball, but the try stood and it was almost poetic that it was the captain who got it. Best has had a miserable 2019, a year when his 37 years seem to be catching up without him. He appeared to be panting and wheezing his way towards retirement. This, though, was a big day for the captain. And a big day for his team. Though Laidlaw made it 12-3 just after the first quarter, it was a mere crumb in comparison to Ireland's feast, a third try coming soon after. The kick to Scotland's solar plexus was that it came off one of their own attacks, when the ball came bouncing off Tommy Seymour's body only to be hacked downfield. Hogg got back to rescue it under his sticks but was driven back over his own line. Scrum Ireland. Off went CJ Stander from the base and, in quick order, over went Furlong amid a ruck of bodies. All the boys in green must have been scratching their heads at how easy it all was out there. Conor Murray missed the conversion, the scrum-half filling in on the goal-kicking front for Sexton, who was moving gingerly after coming in for a bit of treatment from the Scottish forwards. Briefly discomforting the fly-half was about their only achievement all evening. Ireland found space with ease against a team with a shocking lack of bite. Stander made a gallop up the middle and made 30 metres in one moment. Jacob Stockdale chipped and gathered and made even more ground shortly after. Ireland were 16 points clear and it told a false picture of how dominant they really were. Before the break there was more calamity for the Scots when their best forward, Hamish Watson, was taken off on a stretcher in clear distress. Another grim moment on a grim day for Townsend's weirdly passive side. Andrew Conway crosses in the second half to clinch a bonus point for Ireland As the rain started to fall more steadily, Ireland took an even firmer grip on things. Just before the hour-mark they struck for their bonus point try to all but guarantee top spot in their pool and a probable quarter-final with the Springboks, a game that can't look as daunting to them now as it might have done a while back. Conway, filling in for the absent Keith Earls, got it. Murray's precise box kick was not dealt with by Ryan Wilson in his own 22. Jordan Larmour, filling in excellently for the injured Rob Kearney, picked it up and shipped it back to Murray, who put Conway away. The wing stepped around the last defender to finish with aplomb. The scrum-half missed the conversion, not that it mattered. The next time an Irishman had a pot at goal, Jack Carty was on the field and he made no mistake. A 24-point game now. No contest. Scotland finally managed to get some possession late on long after the fight was over. Tadhg Beirne came on to the field as a replacement and then went off again for killing ball under his own posts. The Scots put a line-out to touch and tried to work a fancy one at the front, which was defended well. They then tried to move it out the line but Ireland weren't having any of that either. Josh van der Flier ended the attack quite ruthlessly. That single moment could serve as a microcosm of the day. Ireland were too physical, too canny, too good. Far, far too good.

Thomas Cook set for last-ditch rescue talks,"This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says that people ""will not be stranded"" if Thomas Cook collapses The government is ready to fly holidaymakers back to the UK if tour operator Thomas Cook collapses, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show contingency planning was in place to make sure no-one would be stranded. But he dampened hopes of a government rescue bid for the firm. Ministers did not ""systematically step in"" when businesses went under unless there was ""a good strategic national interest"", he said. Mr Raab said he did not want to undermine the rescue talks that Thomas Cook is currently conducting with its biggest shareholder and creditors in the City of London. What's gone wrong at Thomas Cook? We were held 'hostage' at hotel, say  customers Thomas Cook clients fear ruined weddings and trips The tour operator's financial difficulties have mounted over the past year, culminating in a refinancing plan in August led by its biggest shareholder, Chinese company Fosun. But banks now want the company to raise extra funds and it could fall into administration within days unless it finds Â£200m. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has aircraft on standby in case Thomas Cook does go into administration over night. The BBC understands that those aircraft are currently being flown to destinations so that British tourists can be flown home on Monday if necessary. A source said the CAA is ""very prepared"". The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) union, which represents Thomas Cook staff, isurging the government to step in with a bail outamid fears the company's collapse could leave about 150,000 British tourists stranded. Thomas Cook customers have been reminded on social media that they have Atol protection - a fund paid for through industry levies - ""in the event that Thomas Cook goes into administration"". The travel firm also reassured customers on Sunday that flights continue to operate as normal. Katie Prescott, business correspondent This meeting is crucial for Thomas Cook's survival. If there is no agreement, then the decision to wind up the company will be taken at a board meeting this evening. It's likely (looking at the precedent of Monarch's collapse) that any announcement about that will be made late at night, once all planes are on the ground. But the company doesn't have to announce anything until the markets open at 07:00 BST on Monday. It's low season at the moment, the time of year when Thomas Cook has to pay its suppliers for the busy summer season just gone. Hoteliers are paid on 60 to 90-day terms, once travellers have already taken their holidays. The nightmare scenario is that hoteliers who don't think they will get paid might turn out the people staying with them. However, it is worth re-stating that the company is still trading. People are still holidaying with Thomas Cook. And while we can assume the company is reining back marketing activity around last-minute deals and offers, until any announcement is made, it is business as usual. The foreign secretary said he did not want talk of contingency planning to become ""a self-fulfilling prophecy"". He told the BBC the government had learned lessons from the collapse of the Monarch airline in 2017. The UK's consular authorities abroad were ready to assist, he said. Thomas Cook has hundreds of High Street stores A government spokesperson described the situation as a ""worrying time for holidaymakers and employees"". They added: ""The financial circumstances of individual businesses are a commercial matter, but the government and the Civil Aviation Authority are monitoring the situation closely."" Why Thomas Cook might struggle to book a bailout Thomas Cook: MP calls for 'leadership' Liz Preston says they cheered when her plane landed in Palma As Thomas Cook customers anxiously wait to see if and how their holidays might be affected, some say they have already found themselves in ""horrible"" situations abroad. Customers at a hotel in Tunisia say they were prevented from leaving the propertyon Saturday unless they paid extra fees  - thousands of pounds in some cases - to cover what the resort says it is owed by the tour operator. In Majorca, it's a different story. Liz Preston said there were cheers when her plane took off from Gatwick. ""It was a moment that captured the sheer relief really, that we could still have a holiday, as well as the fact that it might be one of the last ever flights,"" she said. The Thomas Cook staff were in reassurance mode, urging customers to enjoy their holiday, but advising them to keep an eye on the news if the situation changes and their return flight becomes difficult. Richard Stevens regularly travels with Thomas Cook Richard Stevens from Faversham in Kent said he's ""gutted"" Thomas Cook is in such trouble, because he's been coming on Thomas Cook package holidays with his wife and two sons for ""donkey's years"". The domino effect of Thomas Cook's collapse on this holiday island would be significant. Hundreds of smaller industries rely on the through-flow of Thomas Cook travellers for excursion tours, water sports, as well as cafes and bars. Caledonia Tours is a company that offers sightseeing trips. Tour operator Lucas Pantone says 80% of his business is from Thomas Cook. ""If it goes under"" he says, ""we'll be having a crisis meeting within hours, over whether we can survive"". We were held 'hostage', say Thomas Cook customers There are currently 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British. One of the world's largest travel companies, Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and now has annual sales of Â£9bn. It employs 22,000 staff, 9,000 of whom are in the UK, and serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries. In July,Thomas Cook produced a business plansaying that it needed Â£900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of Â£150m. The Â£900m would come from China's Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors. The group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional Â£200m on top of the Â£900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to Â£1.1bn. Thomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional Â£200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out. The firm has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit. Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association, said: ""Ministers need to step forward and take responsibility for the sake of passengers and staff. ""There is a real risk that if the worst comes to the worst proper arrangements may not be in place for the repatriation programme and staff are still working while not knowing if they have a job or will even get paid for this month."" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said ""the government must consider stepping in and taking an equity stake to avoid this crisis"". If you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment. Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating. If you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme. If you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund. When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.
