The inquiry into child abuse,"Inquiry chairwoman, Prof Alexis Jay, led the probe into child abuse in Rotherham The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) in England and Wales is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. But it was dogged with controversy after being announced in July 2014, with chairwomen coming and going and lawyers quitting their posts. Following the death of BBC presenter Jimmy Savile in 2011, hundreds of people came forward to say he had abused them as children. The spotlight has also fallen on sexual assaults carried out in schools, children's homes and at NHS sites. Jimmy Savile died in 2011 At the same time, there have been claims of past failures by police and prosecutors to properly investigate allegations. The inquiry was announced by the then Home Secretary Theresa May to ""expose those failures and learn the lessons"" from the past. When it was announced, the inquiry was expected to take about five years to complete. When finished, it will publish a final report of recommendations. It has already published aninterim report,externalwith 18 recommendations - some of which have been acted upon - plus other investigation reports. The inquiry is divided into public hearings into specific areas of concern, with witnesses giving evidence under oath; research into institutional failures in child protection, and theTruth Project,,externalin which victims share their experiences with the inquiry either in private interviews or written form. The inquiry will not seek to determine civil or criminal liability of individuals or organisations but may reach ""findings of fact"" in relation to this. Allegations of child abuse received by the inquiry will be referred to police and material related to Scotland, Northern Ireland or British Overseas Territories will be passed on to the authorities there. A separateinquiry looking at the abuse of children in care in Scotland,externalhas been set up by the Scottish Government. The inquiry is being led byProf Alexis Jay,external, a former director of social services who headed theinquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. She is being assisted by apanel of advisers,external: law professor and human rights expert Malcolm Evans; child protection barrister Ivor Frank; and lawyer Drusilla Sharpling, a former Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, who has worked as an inspector of constabulary since 2009. A separate panel, made up of eight members,represents victims and survivors,externaland advises the inquiry on all aspects of its work. There is also a Victims and Survivors' Forum. Brian Altman QC is lead counsel,externalto the inquiry. The inquiry's public hearings consisted of15 separate investigations,external. The inquiry is investigating: the institutional responses to the sexual exploitation of children by organised abuse networks alleged failings at Lambeth Council; the Roman Catholic Church; residential schools, and the support services and legal remedies available to victims and survivors current child protection policies and practices in religious institutions in England and Wales - including non-conformist Christian denominations, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism and Buddhism, as well as tuition classes, groups and camps linked to religious beliefs the effective leadership of child protection institutions tasked with safeguarding them against sexual abuse the institutional responses to child sexual abuse allegations against the late Lord Janner, the former Labour peer who in 2015 was ruled unfit to stand trial on child sex abuse charges As of October 2020,eight of its investigations are complete,external. Their conclusions included: the Church of England failed to protect children from sexual abuse, andcreated a culture where abusers ""could hide"", with more support given to alleged perpetrators than to survivors authorities in the UK are failing to use the powers they haveto stop British sex offenders travelling abroadto abuse children. As of 31 March 2018,only about 0.2 per cent,externalof the 58,637 registered sex offenders in England and Wales had their foreign travel restricted internet companies must do more to tackle""an explosion"" in images of child sex abuseon their platforms, including more stringent age checks and screening images before publication hundreds of children were sexually abused bypredatory foster carers and residential home staff who were allowed to thrive, with Nottingham City and Nottinghamshire County councils accused of exposing vulnerable children to repeated rapes and physical abuse political institutionsfailed to respond to historical claims of child sexual abusebut there was no evidence of an organised paedophile network at Westminster thousands of people forcibly sent abroad as children, many of whom were abused in institutions,should receive compensation. The government has subsequently opened a compensation scheme to pay Â£20,000 each to about 2,000 eligible survivors the former council leader in Rochdale, Richard Farnell, ""lied"" in evidenceto the inquiry and his claim that he was unaware of abuse in a hostel, school and other places in the town over 20 years ""defies belief"". He rejected those conclusions children in custody in England and Wales are still at risk of physical and sexual abuse, withmore than 1,000 reported incidents between 2009 and 2017 the Catholic schools system ""prioritised monks and their own reputationsover the protection of children"", meaning pupils suffered ""appalling"" abuse over a 40-year period An interim reportconcluded that common responses to child abuse ""deflected responsibility away from perpetrators and institutions"". John Glynn is among the victims of the UK's child migrant policy The main bone of contention in the inquiry's early years was who is in charge. The first chairwoman, appointed in July 2014, was Baroness Butler-Sloss. However, sheresigned just one week laterafter concerns arose around her links to the establishment - namely her late brother, Sir Michael Havers, who was attorney general in the 1980s. In September 2014, Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf was named the new head, but after disclosing she had been to five dinners with the late Lord Brittan - one of the people facing accusations at the time, which have since been dropped - shequit by the end of October. In February 2015, Justice Lowell Goddard, a serving judge of the High Court of New Zealand, took over the reins and was in charge as the inquiry began hearing directly from victims and survivors. But by August 2016, she hadresigned from her postas well due to ""compounding difficulties"" and her family life. A number of lawyers have also resigned or been removed from the process. In November 2016, the largest of the victims' groups involved in the inquiry, the Shirley Oaks Survivors Association, said it hadlost confidence in the inquiry's leadership. But despite threatening to pull out of the inquiry, they remain core participants. A legal case relating to allegations of abuse relating to Lord Janner has been dropped. The case had previously caused hearings to be delayed because of an ""overlap"" with the criminal investigation. It wasconfirmed in March that the hearings would go aheadin October, with some proceedings taking place in private. Lord Janner's family have always maintained his innocence. IICSA is funded by the Home Office and spent Â£35.3m in the 2019/20 financial year. According to the financial report,about Â£12.3m was on staffing with nearly Â£12m on legal costs,external. Previous total annual costs were Â£36.6m in2018/19,external; Â£28.5m in2017/18,external; Â£20.8m in2016/17,external; and Â£14.7m in2015/16.,external Prof Jay was paid Â£190,522 in the past financial year, plus Â£35,536 accommodation allowance.

"Cover-up culture saw hundreds abused in care homesMore than 700 children suffered cruelty and sexual abuse at care homes in south London, an inquiry finds.","This video can not be played Elizabeth McCourt: 'I can't forgive Lambeth for what they've done to me or my family' Staff and councillors presided over a ""culture of cover-up"" that led to more than 700 children in south London care homes suffering cruelty and sexual abuse, an inquiry has found. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse strongly criticised Lambeth Council for allowing abuse in five homes from the 1960s to the 1990s. It said abusers were able to to infiltrate homes and the foster system. Lambeth Council has made an unreserved apology to the victims. And a former council leader said the authority had ""clearly failed"" and she should have known about the abuse. The Metropolitan Police also apologised ""for when we let children in the care of Lambeth down"". The inquiry into the council, held in the summer of 2020, examined five homes - Angell Road, South Vale Assessment Centre, the Shirley Oaks complex, Ivy House and Monkton Street. The Independent Inquiry Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) report,externalsaid: ""With some exceptions, they [Lambeth Council staff] treated children in care as if they were worthless. ""As a consequence, individuals who posed a risk to children were able to infiltrate children's homes and foster care, with devastating, life-long consequences for their victims."" Of the 705 complaints made by former residents across three such facilities, only one senior member of staff was ever disciplined by the council, the report said. At Shirley Oaks, which closed in 1983, the council received allegations of abuse against 177 members of staff, involving at least 529 former residents. Children's home girl raped '500 times' 'Systematic abuse where I grew up' How the child sexual abuse inquiry works The council was mired in corruption and financial mismanagement during the decades of abuse, with ""politicised behaviour and turmoil"" dominating its culture, according to the report. The report partly blames the Labour council's battle against the Conservative government in the 1980s, saying it sought to ""take on the government"" to the detriment of local services. ""During that time, children in care became pawns in a toxic power game within Lambeth Council and between the council and central government,"" the report added. The IICSA is calling on the Met Police to consider a criminal investigation into why allegations of sexual abuse made by a boy, later found dead at the Shirley Oaks care home, were not passed on to the coroner by Lambeth Council in 1977. The force said it would assess this recommendation. Shirley Oaks and South Vale were found to have been ""brutal places where violence and sexual assault were allowed to flourish"". Another care home, Angell Road, ""systematically exposed children (including those under the age of five years) to sexual abuse,"" the report said. Elizabeth McCourt, who was sexually abused at Angell Road care home, said she could not forgive Lambeth Council. The 56-year-old told the BBC she was forced into prostitution because of the council's ""negligence"". ""I felt dirty, I felt ashamed and I felt like I had nobody to listen to me,"" she said. ""Because of what happened to me in care, and then coming out of care, I can't hold a job down... I've got a criminal record so it's very difficult for me to work."" An archive picture of Shirley Oaks children's home - located in Croydon but run by Lambeth Council Sandra Fearon, who was at Shirley Oaks between 1964 and 1969 with her siblings, said she was violently sexually abused by a doctor from the age of 12. She told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme the abuse continued every week for two years until her school intervened, after she was able to tell a school nurse what had happened to her. ""I got to the point where I was probably seconds away from suicide. That's how bad my health was and the state I was in,"" she said, adding that the abuse ""absolutely destroyed me"". Children spent time with ""social aunts"" or ""social uncles"", volunteers who worked with children without proper vetting. One such volunteer, Geoffrey Clarke, stayed at Shirley Oaks with regular and unimpeded access to children there from the early 1970s. He was convicted of sexually assaulting three children in 1998, but Lambeth Council is now aware of at least 40 people who have made allegations against him. Clarke was charged with numerous abuse offences as part of Operation Middleton, one of five police investigations into child sexual abuse linked to Lambeth Council from 1992 to the present date. Clarke took his own life before his trial. The inquiry criticises the Metropolitan Police for its failures to follow up evidence that may have led to the identification of further offending. Six men have been convicted since the 1990s in connection with abuse in Lambeth. They include: William Hook, jailed for 10 years; Philip Temple, jailed for 18 years; and Leslie Paul, sent to prison for 13 years. Michael Carroll was appointed to work in a Lambeth care home in 1978 despite abusing children previously in Liverpool and failing twice to declare his offences, including when he applied to be a foster carer. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to 10 years in 1999. The former Shirley Oaks site The report made a number of recommendations, including that the council publishes an action plan to deal with the issues raised, as well as improving staff training, recruitment and vetting. Lambeth Council has accepted the recommendations and apologised to the inquiry for creating and overseeing conditions ""where appalling and absolutely shocking and horrendous abuse was perpetrated"". It has also paid Â£71.5 million in compensation to former children's home residents, with individual payments of up to Â£125,000. Linda Bellos, who led Lambeth Council between 1986-88, said she was ""shocked"" and ""disgusted"" by the abuse revealed in the report. Ms Bellos, who was not called to give evidence by the inquiry, told the BBC: ""I should have known, there should have been transparency for the services that we were supposed to be giving to vulnerable children."" ""We clearly failed. I hold myself responsible for that failure,"" she added. Commander Alex Murray, from the Met Police, said: ""It is clear that at different times we missed opportunities to identify offenders and investigate further. Some of the treatment of children was also unacceptable."" He said the force had changed the way it investigated allegations of child sexual abuse, with better training for officers, greater collaboration between social care partners and ""putting the victim at the heart of the investigation"". The long-running IICSA is investigating claims against organisations including the church, local authorities and the armed forces. Its final report of overarching findings will be laid before Parliament next summer.

IMF upgrades UK economic forecast,"The UK economy will grow faster than expected this year as it recovers from the Covid pandemic, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said. Economic prospects for rich and poor nations have diverged more due to differing access to Covid vaccines, it said. In a new assessment,external, the IMF said the world is increasingly split into two blocs. It has upgraded growth forecasts for developed economies. But the outlook for many developing countries has weakened. Among the forecast revisions for this year, the largest upgrade is for the UK to 7%. Britain is also now predicted to have the joint fastest growth of the G7 leading rich countries, together with the US, although that follows a contraction last year that was the deepest in that group. The UK's Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, welcomed what he called ""the positive signs that the economy is rebounding faster than previously expected"". However, he acknowledged that there were still challenges ahead and said the government would remain focused on protecting and creating as many jobs as possible. The IMF - an international organisation that seeks to promote economic growth, trade and financial stability - says there is a division between those countries ""that can look forward to further normalisation of activity later this year - almost all advanced economies - and those that will still face resurgent infections and rising Covid death tolls"". Its report says that in the rich countries almost 40% of the population is fully vaccinated. In emerging market economies - the more advanced developing nations - it's less than half that, and just a ""tiny fraction"" in low income countries. For the rich countries together, growth is now predicted to be stronger this year by half a percentage point. But there is an offsetting downgrade for the rest of the world which leaves the global 2021 forecast unchanged at 6%. There is an upgrade next year to 4.9%. However, the IMF warns that even in countries with very low infection levels, the economic recovery is not assured as long as the virus circulates elsewhere. Fed warns the path of the economy depends on Covid Biden calls for nations to boost their economies Another factor fuelling the divergence is the steps taken by governments to support economic recovery. The report calls the effect in the US ""sizable"". The report says that international action is needed to diminish divergences and strengthen global prospects. It says the immediate priority is to deploy vaccines equitably worldwide. ""Concerted, well-directed policies can make the difference between a future of durable recoveries for all economies or one with widening fault lines - as many struggle with the health crisis while a handful see conditions normalise, albeit with the constant threat of renewed flare-ups."" The report suggests that inflation - which has surged in some countries - is in most cases likely to subside to pre-pandemic ranges next year. It could, however, be more persistent if people and businesses come to expect higher inflation and seek to raise prices and wages in anticipation.

About 70 of Dean's friends and family gathered in his mum's garden in Maidenhead to watch the race in the early hours,with a video of their celebrations going viral. His mum Jacquie Hughes told BBC One: ""We decided, because we couldn't be there, how nice would it be for Tom to know his family and friends were together watching him. ""We invited some members of the swimming club, some neighbours, and before we knew it there were 70 people in the garden watching on a big screen. ""It was so joyous and full of passion.

EU pauses legal action against UK over NI Protocol,"The EU has paused its legal action against the UK for alleged breaches of the Northern Ireland Protocol. It said it was doing so to create the ""necessary space"" to consider UK proposals for reforming the deal. The legal action was started in March after the UK took unilateral action to change the implementation of the protocol. At that time the UK delayed new checks on food, parcels and pets entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed by the UK and EU to avoid a hard border in Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. That has created a new trade border in the Irish Sea, causing some difficulties in moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Why does the UK want to change the NI Protocol? EU publishes proposals to simplify NI Protocol Last week, the UK published proposals for the protocol, which amounted to a request for a major renegotiation. It also asked for a standstill period, which would involve pausing the legal action and extending so-called grace periods. The EU has already said it will not renegotiate the protocol but will ""consider any proposals that respect the principles"" of the deal. However, it has not ruled out the standstill period. A European Commission spokesperson said: ""With regards to the request for a standstill, the commission will carefully assess the new proposals made by the UK, in accordance with the necessary consultation procedures, both internally and with the European Parliament. ""In order to provide the necessary space to reflect on these issues and find durable solutions to the implementation of the protocol, we have decided at this stage not to move to the next stage of the infringement procedure, started in March."" A government spokesperson said they had received a ""constructive reply from the Commission"". ""We look forward to engaging in talks with the EU in the weeks ahead to progress the proposals in our command paper,"" they added. ""As we set out in the Command Paper last week, significant changes are needed to ensure the Protocol is sustainable for future."" Earlier, the EU published its proposals for simplifying some aspects of the protocol, includinga plan for ensuring the continued supply of medicines,externalfrom Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The proposals were previously announced in broad terms at the end of June, but the UK government said they do not go far enough.

EU pauses legal action against UK over NI ProtocolThe action began in March after the UK made a move to change the implementation of the protocol.Northern Ireland,"The EU has paused its legal action against the UK for alleged breaches of the Northern Ireland Protocol. It said it was doing so to create the ""necessary space"" to consider UK proposals for reforming the deal. The legal action was started in March after the UK took unilateral action to change the implementation of the protocol. At that time the UK delayed new checks on food, parcels and pets entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed by the UK and EU to avoid a hard border in Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. That has created a new trade border in the Irish Sea, causing some difficulties in moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Why does the UK want to change the NI Protocol? EU publishes proposals to simplify NI Protocol Last week, the UK published proposals for the protocol, which amounted to a request for a major renegotiation. It also asked for a standstill period, which would involve pausing the legal action and extending so-called grace periods. The EU has already said it will not renegotiate the protocol but will ""consider any proposals that respect the principles"" of the deal. However, it has not ruled out the standstill period. A European Commission spokesperson said: ""With regards to the request for a standstill, the commission will carefully assess the new proposals made by the UK, in accordance with the necessary consultation procedures, both internally and with the European Parliament. ""In order to provide the necessary space to reflect on these issues and find durable solutions to the implementation of the protocol, we have decided at this stage not to move to the next stage of the infringement procedure, started in March."" A government spokesperson said they had received a ""constructive reply from the Commission"". ""We look forward to engaging in talks with the EU in the weeks ahead to progress the proposals in our command paper,"" they added. ""As we set out in the Command Paper last week, significant changes are needed to ensure the Protocol is sustainable for future."" Earlier, the EU published its proposals for simplifying some aspects of the protocol, includinga plan for ensuring the continued supply of medicines,externalfrom Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The proposals were previously announced in broad terms at the end of June, but the UK government said they do not go far enough.

"IMF upgrades UK economic forecastWealth gap between countries could widen due to differing access to Covid vaccines, the IMF says.Business","The UK economy will grow faster than expected this year as it recovers from the Covid pandemic, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has said. Economic prospects for rich and poor nations have diverged more due to differing access to Covid vaccines, it said. In a new assessment,external, the IMF said the world is increasingly split into two blocs. It has upgraded growth forecasts for developed economies. But the outlook for many developing countries has weakened. Among the forecast revisions for this year, the largest upgrade is for the UK to 7%. Britain is also now predicted to have the joint fastest growth of the G7 leading rich countries, together with the US, although that follows a contraction last year that was the deepest in that group. The UK's Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, welcomed what he called ""the positive signs that the economy is rebounding faster than previously expected"". However, he acknowledged that there were still challenges ahead and said the government would remain focused on protecting and creating as many jobs as possible. The IMF - an international organisation that seeks to promote economic growth, trade and financial stability - says there is a division between those countries ""that can look forward to further normalisation of activity later this year - almost all advanced economies - and those that will still face resurgent infections and rising Covid death tolls"". Its report says that in the rich countries almost 40% of the population is fully vaccinated. In emerging market economies - the more advanced developing nations - it's less than half that, and just a ""tiny fraction"" in low income countries. For the rich countries together, growth is now predicted to be stronger this year by half a percentage point. But there is an offsetting downgrade for the rest of the world which leaves the global 2021 forecast unchanged at 6%. There is an upgrade next year to 4.9%. However, the IMF warns that even in countries with very low infection levels, the economic recovery is not assured as long as the virus circulates elsewhere. Fed warns the path of the economy depends on Covid Biden calls for nations to boost their economies Another factor fuelling the divergence is the steps taken by governments to support economic recovery. The report calls the effect in the US ""sizable"". The report says that international action is needed to diminish divergences and strengthen global prospects. It says the immediate priority is to deploy vaccines equitably worldwide. ""Concerted, well-directed policies can make the difference between a future of durable recoveries for all economies or one with widening fault lines - as many struggle with the health crisis while a handful see conditions normalise, albeit with the constant threat of renewed flare-ups."" The report suggests that inflation - which has surged in some countries - is in most cases likely to subside to pre-pandemic ranges next year. It could, however, be more persistent if people and businesses come to expect higher inflation and seek to raise prices and wages in anticipation.

Clarke denies responsibility for contaminated blood,"This video can not be played Lord Clarke: ""I wasn't the blood products minister"" Lord Clarke has told an inquiry he was ""not responsible"" for blood products during his time as health minister. About 3,000 people died after being given blood products containing HIV and hepatitis C in the 1970s and 1980s. And Lord Clarke - Conservative Health Minister 1982-85 and Health Secretary 1988-90 - is the first senior health minister from the time to testify during the inquiry into the scandal. But he said the emerging controversy ""hardly ever came across my desk"". Questions have been asked about what the government knew about the risks of the blood treatments and whether patients were given sufficient warning. Why the NHS gave thousands HIV-contaminated blood Hancock in blood inquiry compensation pledge Parents and pupils kept in dark at infected blood school Victims of what has been called the biggest treatment disaster in NHS history were given a clotting agent called Factor VIII which had been imported from the US, where it was made from plasma donated by prisoners and other groups at risk from blood-borne viruses. By the mid-1980s, once HIV was better understood, the blood products were heat-treated to kill the viruses - but not before thousands of people were infected. Among them weredozens of young haemophiliacs at a boarding school in Hampshire who died after contracting HIV. Haemophilia impairs the body's ability to clot blood and has no cure. Lord Clarke told the inquiry: ""As the tragedy with the haemophiliacs developed, I was aware it was there. ""From time to time, usually on my own instigation, I got on the edge of it. ""I did not call meetings on it. ""I was never the minister directly responsible for blood products. ""I was never asked to take a decision on blood products. ""I never intervened to take a decision on blood products. ""I did intervene or get involved in discussions a bit when I wanted to be reassured. ""When I arrived [as health minister], the idea that blood products was a very big part of the department's activity is simply not true."" And it was not the job of ministers to intervene or impose a personal decision on what treatments patients were given, Lord Clarke said. As late as November 1983, the government said it was not conclusively proven that HIV could be transmitted through blood products. By then, officials were already aware of deaths linked to the treatment. Lord Clarke said he accepted a share of personal responsibility for delays to the production of a public information leaflet about who should and should not donate blood. Those at high risk of contracting Aids, including homosexual men, were to be discouraged from donating. ""It's a pity it look so long,"" he told the inquiry. But he said no-one predicted the scale of the problem and although no-one was ignoring the risk at the time, he said he also didn't want to ""cause public panic over blood transfusions"". Lord Clarke was also shown evidence of minutes from a sub-committee of the Committee on the Safety of Medicines in July 1983. Despite warnings from a leading disease expert over the risks of importing infected blood plasma from the US, the committee concluded there wasn't enough alternative supply from elsewhere to recommend stopping the imports. ""It's a pity they reached that conclusion"", he said, adding that he was ""surprised"" the decision was not run past government ministers. Lord Clarke's evidence marks a significant moment for survivors and their relatives, who campaigned for years to bring about the inquiry, saying the risks of the blood products were never explained and the scandal was covered up. Earlier this year, then Health Secretary Matt Hancock became the first serving cabinet minister to give evidence, telling victims he wanted ""to make sure their voices are heard"" and promising the government would pay compensation if the inquiry recommended it. Led by former High Court judge Sir Brian Langstaff, the public inquiry has been examining the circumstances of the contaminated-blood scandal since 2018. Hundreds of people infected with HIV or hepatitis C and their family members have given evidence at sites across the UK. Evidence hearings are due to continue next year with the final report expected to be published in 2022 or 2023. What is the infected blood scandal?

Roads and property flooded in NI thunderstorms,"A car was stuck in flood water off Lisburn Road in south Belfast Heavy rainfall has caused flooding in some parts of Northern Ireland this afternoon. The Met Office issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across eastern counties which ended at 17:00 BST. This alert warned of the potential for damage to buildings and difficult driving conditions, although rain is expected to continue into the evening. Police have warned motorists in Belfast to be cautious on the roads due to the weather. Officers said Milltown Road and Hospital Road were ""impassable city bound due to flooding in the area"".

All I could do was grab cushions and throws and threw them against the door to try and stop the water."" Mr Neilly estimated that about upwards of Â£6,000 worth of stock may have been damaged. He said the store would be closed on Wednesday for a ""major clean-up"". Fig Design Company shared an image on Facebook showing the flooding damage on Main Street in Ballyclare Steve Aiken, an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) MLA for South Antrim, said emergency services were dealing with floods in Ballyclare and additional support was ""on its way"".

The second time I wasn't able to train and it was a slow build back into training."" About 70 of Dean's friends and family gathered in his mum's garden in Maidenhead to watch the race in the early hours,with a video of their celebrations going viral. His mum Jacquie Hughes told BBC One: ""We decided, because we couldn't be there, how nice would it be for Tom to know his family and friends were together watching him. ""We invited some members of the swimming club, some neighbours, and before we knew it there were 70 people in the garden watching on a big screen. ""It was so joyous and full of passion. It was lovely. I spoke to Tom this morning and he said he watched the video over and over again.""

Sex abuse review says children 'still unprotected',"Fiona Goddard's abuse started while living in a care home in Bradford from the age of 13 Some children in Bradford ""remain unprotected"" from sex exploitation, a new report looking into abuse over two decades has said. The independent review of five cases in the Bradford district since 2001 has found that ""children suffered abuse no child should have to experience"". Victim Fiona Goddard said the council and police had chances to ""nip it in the bud"" but ""never did"". The Bradford Partnership said it ""fully accepts more needs to be done"". More stories from around Yorkshire The review was commissioned afternine men were jailed over the sexual exploitation of girlswho had been in council care. Author Clare Hyde said it ""makes difficult and, at times, distressing reading. ""The children suffered abuse no child should have to experience, and in most cases had suffered other traumas and abuse long before they were sexually exploited."" (From top left, clockwise) Basharat Khaliq, Saeed Akhtar, Naveed Akhtar, Parvaze Ahmed, Zeeshan Ali, Fahim Iqbal, Izar Hussain, Mohammed Usman and Kieran Harris were all jailed at Bradford Crown Court in 2019 The report noted that while there had been ""considerable work"" done in relation to child sexual exploitation (CSE), there were still ""lessons that need to be learned"" and the response to some victims was ""not yet good enough"". It added that despite ""significant improvements"" in understanding and responding to more recent cases of CSE, some children ""remain unprotected while some perpetrators remain unknown and unchallenged"". Fiona Goddard, who was groomed and sexually abused by gangs of men from 2008, said she was failed ""multiple times"" by social services and police. ""I reported it multiple times - physical abuse, sexual abuse or rapes - and they were never followed up on."" The 27-year-old, who has waived her legal right to life-long anonymity, said most of the girls in the care home where she lived were victims of child sexual exploitation. ""They had the opportunity to nip it in the bud and save me from years of abuse but they never did."" The Bradford Partnership said ""more needs to be done"" to help victims of abuse The report also detailed abuse set out by another victim, known as Anna, whose social worker recommended she be placed in the foster care of the parents of the man who was abusing her. While living there, she became pregnant at the age of 15 and went on to marry him in an Islamic wedding, which she says was allowed by the authorities. The report stated: ""While in the 'care' of these adults, she was subjected to further sexual abuse and exploitation, domestic abuse, including assaults and coercion and what we would now recognise as domestic slavery."" Anna said agencies had ""just ignored the abuse"" and it had ""destroyed her childhood"". Both victims said the latest review did not go far enough and called for an independent inquiry, like the onecarried out by Professor Alexis Jay into abuse in Rotherham. Ms Goddard said: ""This review talks about five people, but what about the hundreds of others who deserve the same apology and to see the failings written down in black and white?"" Daniel Greenwood, Ch Supt Bradford District, said police had invested heavily to try and better understand the problem In a joint statement responding to the review, the Bradford Partnership, made up of Bradford Council, West Yorkshire Police's Bradford district commander and Bradford District and Craven Clinical Commissioning Group, said: ""We want to apologise to the young people identified in this report and any others where the actions of agencies in Bradford has failed to protect them from child sexual exploitation."" It added: ""This crime must not be tolerated. All the partners in our district are committed to protecting our children and to working with the police to bring perpetrators of this crime to justice."" Mark Douglas, strategic director of children's services at Bradford Council, said the authority had learned ""an awful lot about about child sexual exploitation"". He added: ""I think we have learned as a system and we are much better placed and much more robust in our response to these circumstances."" The Bradford review was carried out to assess whether there were themes and patterns organisations could learn from Daniel Greenwood, Ch Supt Bradford District, said the report acknowledged there had been a ""vast improvement"" in the way police had responded to CSE and to those at risk. ""Where we have the opportunity to identify perpetrators, we will take all reasonable steps that we can to identify them, arrest them, and to work towards a successful prosecution through the courts,"" he said. Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor in theRochdale grooming gang cases, said the new report's findings were ""deeply depressing but unsurprising"". He said while a full inquiry would reveal the true scale of the problem in Bradford he would rather ""we get on with fixing the problem"". ""That means dealing with the professionals' inability to recognise and respond to abuse...It means putting the children at the centre of our response and that means believing them and acting upon what they're told. ""Whatever inquiry we have, it will tell us the same thing: information was held by one agency, one person, and wasn't shared with another person - and that means those people were let down."" In 2019, nine men were found guilty of offences including rape and inciting child prostitution after a trial lasting more than six weeks. During the trial, the court heard the grooming and abuse began in 2008 when the girls were aged 14, living in a children's home in Bradford. The jury heard staff could not physically prevent the girls leaving the home but they were aware one of the girls was ""being picked up by multiple Asian males in smart cars"".

EU halts legal action against UK over NI Protocol,"The EU has paused its legal action against the UK for alleged breaches of the Northern Ireland Protocol. It said it was doing so to create the ""necessary space"" to consider UK proposals for reforming the deal. The legal action was started in March after the UK took unilateral action to change the implementation of the protocol. At that time the UK delayed new checks on food, parcels and pets entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. The Northern Ireland Protocol was agreed by the UK and EU to avoid a hard border in Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. That has created a new trade border in the Irish Sea, causing some difficulties in moving goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Why does the UK want to change the NI Protocol? EU publishes proposals to simplify NI Protocol Last week, the UK published proposals for the protocol, which amounted to a request for a major renegotiation. It also asked for a standstill period, which would involve pausing the legal action and extending so-called grace periods. The EU has already said it will not renegotiate the protocol but will ""consider any proposals that respect the principles"" of the deal. However, it has not ruled out the standstill period. A European Commission spokesperson said: ""With regards to the request for a standstill, the commission will carefully assess the new proposals made by the UK, in accordance with the necessary consultation procedures, both internally and with the European Parliament. ""In order to provide the necessary space to reflect on these issues and find durable solutions to the implementation of the protocol, we have decided at this stage not to move to the next stage of the infringement procedure, started in March."" A government spokesperson said they had received a ""constructive reply from the Commission"". ""We look forward to engaging in talks with the EU in the weeks ahead to progress the proposals in our command paper,"" they added. ""As we set out in the Command Paper last week, significant changes are needed to ensure the Protocol is sustainable for future."" Earlier, the EU published its proposals for simplifying some aspects of the protocol, includinga plan for ensuring the continued supply of medicines,externalfrom Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The proposals were previously announced in broad terms at the end of June, but the UK government said they do not go far enough.

PM pledges to target crime and anti-social behaviour,"This video can not be played The PM defends the wider use of stop and search powers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested electronic tagging on more burglars after release, and wider use of public ""chain gangs"", as measures to combat crime and anti-social behaviour. The government is also proposing that every neighbourhood in England and Wales should have a named police officer for residents to contact. The PM said it meant victims could speak to someone who knew the area. The Police Federation said fighting crime needed greater investment. And Labour accused the government of being ""all talk and no action"" on law and order. Boris Johnson also said he wanted to see hi-vis ""chain gangs"" as punishment for anti-social behaviour. ""If you are guilty of anti-social behaviour and you are sentenced to unpaid work, as many people are, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be out there in one of those fluorescent-jacketed chain gangs visibly paying your debt to society,"" he said. We have no confidence in Patel, says police body Boris Johnson's claims about crime checked What is a Section 60 stop and search? Under the Beating Crime Plan, more burglars, robbers and thieves would have their location monitored with electronic tags 24 hours a day after leaving prison. The document also says Project Adder - whichtargets drugs gangs, offers help to addicts and increases the use of drugs testing when arrests are made- will be expanded from five areas of England to 13. The new areas covered will be Newcastle, Bristol, London's Hackney and Tower Hamlets, Wakefield, Liverpool, Knowsley and Wirral. Ministers are also removing rules introduced by former Prime Minister Theresa May which made it harder for officers to usetheir section 60 stop and search powers. The powers allow officers to search people without reasonable suspicion in places where serious violence may occur. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford says the change could prove controversial but the government believes limits on stop and search have held back efforts to tackle knife crime. Also as part of a trial, probation services in Wales will be able to require prisoners released on licence to wear ankle tags for up to a year to monitor the amount of alcohol in their sweat. Probation officers will be able to impose the tags where drinking alcohol is believed to increase their likelihood of committing another crime. Currently, courts can only require offenders serving community sentences to wear the tags for up to four months for crimes explicitly linked to alcohol. Like the court-ordered tags, prisoners on release will not be required to wear them if they are dependent on alcohol because those offenders are often required to undergo treatment. The government's plan also includes: A pilot scheme to test the benefit of sending an officer to every reported burglary, to be trialled in Greater Manchester Proposals for league tables ranking how quickly police forces answer 101 and 999 calls More officers to deal with children truanting from school A Â£17m programme to persuade young people who attend hospital with a stab wound or come into contact with police to stay away from violence Â£45m for specialist teams in schools in places with high levels of violence Speaking to reporters in Surrey, Mr Johnson said the government was ""putting Â£15.8bn into supporting our police"" - and he defended stop and search plans arguing that relieving someone of a dangerous weapon was ""a kind and a loving thing to do"" rather than a ""strong-arm tactic"". He said plans for a named police officer for every neighbourhood would ensure that victims of crime could speak to someone who understood the local area. ""What you need is somebody who understands what's going on in your neighbourhood, who understands who the likely miscreants are, who understands whether the thing you are reporting - the crime that you are experiencing - is a one-off or part of a trend,"" he said. By BBC Reality Check Figures shows black people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched in a car than white people It is far from clear that stop and search reduces violent crime. While it's often framed as acting as a deterrent, the figures don't bear this out. A surge of section 60 searches in parts of London was brought in under a knife crime initiative called Operation Blunt 2. However, it had no effect on police recorded crime compared with boroughs where the searches were not brought in. As the number of stops fell after the policy was reviewed in 2010, the proportion of stops resulting in an arrest rose. In other words, when the police could search more people indiscriminately they stopped many more people who weren't committing a crime. If you stop and search a lot more people you do get an increase in the absolute number of arrests - but many argue the methods are disproportionate. Last year, black people were nine times more likely to be stopped and searched as white people. Part of this is due to geography (more searches take place in big cities where there are also larger black communities) but even in London black people are still four times more likely to be searched. By BBC political correspondent Pete Saull On the prime minister's first day out of self-isolation, this is a clear attempt to seize the political initiative on an issue that's moving up the list of voters' priorities. We've all spent more time than usual in our local communities over the past year and we're perhaps more aware than ever of crime and anti-social behaviour. Indeed, surveys for the Office for National Statistics suggest a growing number of people believe crime levels are rising. It's an issue that has been considered safe territory for the Conservative party in the past, but Labour, too, are trying to capitalise on voters' unease. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, has accused the Tories of being ""soft on crime""; an accusation that's traditionally gone in the opposite direction. The debate is also a sign that the parties want to move the conversation on from the pandemic. With the worst of the coronavirus crisis seemingly behind us, you can expect discussions about other subjects to rise up the agenda over the summer. The announcement comes four days after the Police Federation declared it had no confidence in Home Secretary Priti Patel. It described the planned pay freeze for all officers in England and Wales earning more than Â£24,000 a year as an insult. And it delivered a letter to Downing Street on Tuesday objecting to the pay freeze and criticising the crime-fighting proposals. ""We don't need old ideas presented as new, we need genuine investment for the whole of the criminal justice system and genuine consultation over new ideas. Without that, this is just another ill-thought out initiative,"" the letter says. Labour said community policing had been ""decimated"" under the Conservatives. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""Coupled with an insulting pay freeze, it is no wonder frontline police have declared no confidence in the home secretary."" He said the prime minister was offering ""more gimmicks and more slogans"", and suggested that key proposals such as a named police officer for every victim of crime were already recommended by the College of Policing guidelines. The government says its crime plan builds on progress already made, with 9,000 new officers hired of the promised 20,000 additional officers by 2023. This follows a reduction in officer numbers since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Between March 2010 and September 2017 there was a fall in officer numbers in England and Wales of 21,805. Police numbers have risen since then, butin the most recent set of figures,externalfor September 2020 they were still 11,267 below the level in 2010. Former Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent John Sutherland told BBC Newsnight: ""During the decade of austerity, it wasn't just the numbers that we lost, it was the experience that went with it, it was the relationships with local communities that are the bedrock of local policing."" Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said the cuts had to be made in 2010 due to ""the worst economic crash since the Second World War"". He denied suggestions that a reduction in police numbers had led to a rise in crime. Have you been a victim of crime? You can share your experience by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Tesco offers Â£1,000 joining bonus for lorry drivers","Tesco is offering lorry drivers a Â£1,000 joining bonus amid a chronic shortage of drivers in the industry. The supermarket giant has deployed the recruitment incentive for candidates who join before 30 September. Other companies are also understood to be offering similar incentives for HGV drivers after disruption to supply chains led to product shortages. Morrisons said it was working on schemes to train staff to become lorry drivers. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) has estimated there is a 100,000 shortage of HGV drivers across the UK. The industry body has said some 30,000 HGV driving tests did not take place last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, and added a ""historic"" shortage in drivers had been exacerbated by changes to rules following Brexit. More recently, drivers being told to self-isolate after being notified by the NHS Covid app is also adding to the problem. A lack of drivers has led to supermarkets suffering shortages of particular brands, while oil firm BP was forced to temporarily close a ""handful"" of its UK sitesdue to shortages in unleaded petrol and diesel being delivered. There have also been problems with the delivery of some council services. James Jamieson, chair of the Local Government Association (LGA), said several councils had been forced to suspend garden waste collections because of the lack of drivers. Darren Rodwell, environment spokesperson for the Local Government Association, said: ""While most councils have been able to keep services running, some are having to reduce services such as green waste collection. ""These issues are partly due to the increase in 'pinged' staff but also a larger problem with a shortage of HGV drivers. ""The announcement that waste collection staff can apply for exemption is pleasing, but we are awaiting details on how quick the application process will be and whether it includes all waste collection staff."" In Sutton and Croydon delays to bin collections could last until the autumn, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Rod McKenzie, managing director of the RHA, said it was becoming ""increasingly competitive"" to recruit a ""a diminishing number of HGV drivers"", which he added had also driven up wages. Mr McKenzie said he appreciated the ""difficulties"" caused by the pandemic but urged the government to ""speed up"" driving tests. He said it currently takes about six months to fully train a HGV driver. ""We are not seeing any sign of it getting better in the short term,"" he added. Mr McKenzie said a ""package of measures"" was required to tackle driver shortages, which included conducting more tests and creating short-term visas for drivers from overseas to work in the UK. Alex Veitch, general manager of public policy at Logistics UK, said incentives being offered by Tesco and other businesses were ""obviously the law of supply and demand at work, given the current shortage of HGV drivers"". To address driver shortages, wholesale food and catering supplier JJ Foodservice is aiming to fill the gap by broadening its talent pool. The company has launched a recruitment campaign to encourage more women to become HGV drivers. ""Only 1% of HGV drivers in the UK are women - we want to help change that,"" said JJ's HR manager, Joanna Florczak. The wholesaler said it was offering ""permanent contracts with no evenings or weekends, salaries of up to Â£35K in London, and no gender pay gap"". Kaan Hendekli, head of operations at JJ Foodservice, said the company was also using women in recruitment adverts and highlighting ""support with wellbeing, which you might  not associate with traditional HGV driver ads"". ""The UK driver shortage is not going to go away overnight, so we're doing our part to make HGV driver roles more appealing to a wider diversity of people,"" he added. To reduce demand on the company's existing drivers, the wholesaler if offering savings for customers who collect their orders instead of having them delivered. The RHA has called on ministers to put HGV drivers on theHome Office Shortage Occupation List.,external In response to HGV driver shortages, the government recently granted a temporary extension of lorry drivers' working hours. In a letter to the logistics sector,external, government ministers said they would consult about ""the delegation of off-road manoeuvres"" as part of the HGV test, which they said would boost testing capacity. It added the Department for Transport would also look to into issuing provisional licences to drive rigid and articulated lorries.

Roads and property flooded in NI thunderstormsPolice warn motorists to be cautious as the Met Office issued a yellow weather warning.Northern Ireland,"A car was stuck in flood water off Lisburn Road in south Belfast Heavy rainfall has caused flooding in some parts of Northern Ireland this afternoon. The Met Office issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across eastern counties which ended at 17:00 BST. This alert warned of the potential for damage to buildings and difficult driving conditions, although rain is expected to continue into the evening. Police have warned motorists in Belfast to be cautious on the roads due to the weather. Officers said Milltown Road and Hospital Road were ""impassable city bound due to flooding in the area"". Man-hole covers also lifted on Belvoir Road and Upper Knockbreda Road due to the rainfall. A car was stuck in floodwater on the Lisburn Road, causing the route to be blocked. Myrtlefield Park, off the Lisburn Road in Belfast, experienced flooding Police also advised motorists to avoid Stockman's Lane and to seek an alternative route. Along with the thunderstorms, lightning was also spotted in some locations. Lightning was spotted across Belfast on Tuesday afternoon In Ballymena, police said the Lisnevenagh Road was impassable for traffic travelling into the town. Matthew Neilly, owner of Fig Design Company, a florist and interior design store in Ballyclare, County Antrim, reported his shop had flooded for ""the third time"". ""It literally became a river today,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra. ""My heart broke. All I could do was grab cushions and throws and threw them against the door to try and stop the water."" Mr Neilly estimated that about upwards of Â£6,000 worth of stock may have been damaged. He said the store would be closed on Wednesday for a ""major clean-up"". Fig Design Company shared an image on Facebook showing the flooding damage on Main Street in Ballyclare Steve Aiken, an Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) MLA for South Antrim, said emergency services were dealing with floods in Ballyclare and additional support was ""on its way"". The former UUP leader added that sand bags were being made available for the public beside the town hall.

"DUP MP 'appalled' at Edwin Poots over protocolIn a letter, Sammy Wilson questions why the agriculture minister had not ""resisted"" officials' views.Northern Ireland","DUP MP Sammy Wilson clashed with Edwin Poots in a private letter over his approach to the NI Protocol Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson has clashed with colleague Edwin Poots in a private letter over his approach earlier this year to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Mr Wilson said he was ""astounded and appalled"" by a response from the agriculture minister, Mr Poots. It was regarding Brexit checks on pets travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that creates an Irish Sea border. Mr Wilson questioned why as a ""unionist minister"" Mr Poots had not ""resisted the views of his officials"". He went on to say the officials were ""more intent on implementing the protocol"" than recognising the ""grave harm"" it caused. Parties divided on UK call to amend NI Protocol Why does the UK want to change the NI Protocol? Checks on pets travelling from GB to NI delayed Mr Wilson also challenged Mr Poots for ""permitting discussions"" within his department, which were at odds with the DUP position. The letter, which was released through a Freedom of Information request, was sent in May - three days before Mr Poots was elected DUP leader. It was in response to earlier correspondence from the minister in which he set out the new restrictions around the movement of pets between Great Britain to Northern Ireland. In his opening line, Mr Wilson wrote: ""At the outset, can I say I am astounded and appalled at the response I received from you."" Within weeks of the letter, Mr Poots did act to delay the restrictions until October He then set out why he believed the checks on dogs moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland were unnecessary and added: ""I am astounded that the remedies which are open to you are not being pursued."" He asked why the checks could not be delayed for another year and questioned why the minister did not seek executive approval. He wrote that he was surprised that Mr Poots had ""accepted the erroneous advice from your officials"", that it was a departmental matter and did not need executive approval. At the time, Mr Wilson argued the restrictions on pet movements, which were due to come into force on 1 July, should be delayed for at least a year. Within weeks of the letter, Mr Poots did act to delay the restrictions until October. Mr Wilson wrote: ""I am surprised that you are permitting discussions to go on within your department to look at how this part of the protocol could be implemented when your party's position is that there should be no implementation of the protocol and indeed it should be replaced. ""I trust that you will reconsider the answer which you have given to me and give some hope to those who are looking for political leadership to destroy this protocol rather than meekly bow to the unreasonable demands which it makes.""

Insurance threat for pinged holidaymakers,"Covid has created hurdles for people wanting to travel overseas this summer A host of travel insurance policies will not cover cancellation costs if holidaymakers are told to self-isolate owing to a close Covid contact. Hundreds of thousands of people have been pinged recently by the NHS app or contacted by the tracing service. Analysts Defaqto said nine in 10 travel insurance policies cover the cost of cancelled holidays if the policyholder tests positive for Covid. But for cases of self-isolation, cover falls to fewer than six in 10 policies. More than 600,000 people told to isolate by app I want to book a foreign holiday, what are my rights? The practical effects of self-isolation requests - dubbed the pingdemic - have crossed work and home lives, and led to considerable political debate. Much of that has concentrated on people's ability to work safely,particularly in critical roles. There has also been concern among holidaymakers, desperate for a summer getaway, that their plans may be scuppered by contracting Covid or coming into close contact with someone who has the virus. The latest information from data specialists Defaqto, which analyses the insurance sector, found that 88% of single trip travel insurance policies on the market in the UK would pay out if a holiday was cancelled owing to a positive test. However, this drops to 56% if cancellation is owing to a self-isolation request. The figures are almost identical for annual policies. People who test positive for Covid are more likely to have insurance cover Anyone who receives notification from NHS Test and Trace is legally required to self-isolate, whereas a ping from the NHS app is advisory, but strongly recommends isolation. Anna-Marie Duthie, from Defaqto, said some insurers would be sympathetic to those required to self-isolate, so people in that situation should talk to their insurer about a claim.

"PM pledges to target crime and anti-social behaviourMore local officers and wider use of public 'chain gangs' are promised, but police demand extra funding.UK Politics","This video can not be played The PM defends the wider use of stop and search powers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested electronic tagging on more burglars after release, and wider use of public ""chain gangs"", as measures to combat crime and anti-social behaviour. The government is also proposing that every neighbourhood in England and Wales should have a named police officer for residents to contact. The PM said it meant victims could speak to someone who knew the area. The Police Federation said fighting crime needed greater investment. And Labour accused the government of being ""all talk and no action"" on law and order. Boris Johnson also said he wanted to see hi-vis ""chain gangs"" as punishment for anti-social behaviour. ""If you are guilty of anti-social behaviour and you are sentenced to unpaid work, as many people are, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be out there in one of those fluorescent-jacketed chain gangs visibly paying your debt to society,"" he said. We have no confidence in Patel, says police body Boris Johnson's claims about crime checked What is a Section 60 stop and search? Under the Beating Crime Plan, more burglars, robbers and thieves would have their location monitored with electronic tags 24 hours a day after leaving prison. The document also says Project Adder - whichtargets drugs gangs, offers help to addicts and increases the use of drugs testing when arrests are made- will be expanded from five areas of England to 13. The new areas covered will be Newcastle, Bristol, London's Hackney and Tower Hamlets, Wakefield, Liverpool, Knowsley and Wirral. Ministers are also removing rules introduced by former Prime Minister Theresa May which made it harder for officers to usetheir section 60 stop and search powers. The powers allow officers to search people without reasonable suspicion in places where serious violence may occur. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford says the change could prove controversial but the government believes limits on stop and search have held back efforts to tackle knife crime. Also as part of a trial, probation services in Wales will be able to require prisoners released on licence to wear ankle tags for up to a year to monitor the amount of alcohol in their sweat. Probation officers will be able to impose the tags where drinking alcohol is believed to increase their likelihood of committing another crime. Currently, courts can only require offenders serving community sentences to wear the tags for up to four months for crimes explicitly linked to alcohol. Like the court-ordered tags, prisoners on release will not be required to wear them if they are dependent on alcohol because those offenders are often required to undergo treatment. The government's plan also includes: A pilot scheme to test the benefit of sending an officer to every reported burglary, to be trialled in Greater Manchester Proposals for league tables ranking how quickly police forces answer 101 and 999 calls More officers to deal with children truanting from school A Â£17m programme to persuade young people who attend hospital with a stab wound or come into contact with police to stay away from violence Â£45m for specialist teams in schools in places with high levels of violence Speaking to reporters in Surrey, Mr Johnson said the government was ""putting Â£15.8bn into supporting our police"" - and he defended stop and search plans arguing that relieving someone of a dangerous weapon was ""a kind and a loving thing to do"" rather than a ""strong-arm tactic"". He said plans for a named police officer for every neighbourhood would ensure that victims of crime could speak to someone who understood the local area. ""What you need is somebody who understands what's going on in your neighbourhood, who understands who the likely miscreants are, who understands whether the thing you are reporting - the crime that you are experiencing - is a one-off or part of a trend,"" he said. By BBC Reality Check Figures shows black people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched in a car than white people It is far from clear that stop and search reduces violent crime. While it's often framed as acting as a deterrent, the figures don't bear this out. A surge of section 60 searches in parts of London was brought in under a knife crime initiative called Operation Blunt 2. However, it had no effect on police recorded crime compared with boroughs where the searches were not brought in. As the number of stops fell after the policy was reviewed in 2010, the proportion of stops resulting in an arrest rose. In other words, when the police could search more people indiscriminately they stopped many more people who weren't committing a crime. If you stop and search a lot more people you do get an increase in the absolute number of arrests - but many argue the methods are disproportionate. Last year, black people were nine times more likely to be stopped and searched as white people. Part of this is due to geography (more searches take place in big cities where there are also larger black communities) but even in London black people are still four times more likely to be searched. By BBC political correspondent Pete Saull On the prime minister's first day out of self-isolation, this is a clear attempt to seize the political initiative on an issue that's moving up the list of voters' priorities. We've all spent more time than usual in our local communities over the past year and we're perhaps more aware than ever of crime and anti-social behaviour. Indeed, surveys for the Office for National Statistics suggest a growing number of people believe crime levels are rising. It's an issue that has been considered safe territory for the Conservative party in the past, but Labour, too, are trying to capitalise on voters' unease. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, has accused the Tories of being ""soft on crime""; an accusation that's traditionally gone in the opposite direction. The debate is also a sign that the parties want to move the conversation on from the pandemic. With the worst of the coronavirus crisis seemingly behind us, you can expect discussions about other subjects to rise up the agenda over the summer. The announcement comes four days after the Police Federation declared it had no confidence in Home Secretary Priti Patel. It described the planned pay freeze for all officers in England and Wales earning more than Â£24,000 a year as an insult. And it delivered a letter to Downing Street on Tuesday objecting to the pay freeze and criticising the crime-fighting proposals. ""We don't need old ideas presented as new, we need genuine investment for the whole of the criminal justice system and genuine consultation over new ideas. Without that, this is just another ill-thought out initiative,"" the letter says. Labour said community policing had been ""decimated"" under the Conservatives. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""Coupled with an insulting pay freeze, it is no wonder frontline police have declared no confidence in the home secretary."" He said the prime minister was offering ""more gimmicks and more slogans"", and suggested that key proposals such as a named police officer for every victim of crime were already recommended by the College of Policing guidelines. The government says its crime plan builds on progress already made, with 9,000 new officers hired of the promised 20,000 additional officers by 2023. This follows a reduction in officer numbers since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Between March 2010 and September 2017 there was a fall in officer numbers in England and Wales of 21,805. Police numbers have risen since then, butin the most recent set of figures,externalfor September 2020 they were still 11,267 below the level in 2010. Former Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent John Sutherland told BBC Newsnight: ""During the decade of austerity, it wasn't just the numbers that we lost, it was the experience that went with it, it was the relationships with local communities that are the bedrock of local policing."" Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said the cuts had to be made in 2010 due to ""the worst economic crash since the Second World War"". He denied suggestions that a reduction in police numbers had led to a rise in crime. Have you been a victim of crime? You can share your experience by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Gold for GB swimmer who overcame Covid twice,"This video can not be played Tom Dean wins gold for Team GB with Duncan Scott clinching silver Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Tom Dean claimed a stunning gold and Duncan Scott silver to ensure a British one-two in a fast, closely-fought 200m freestyle at the Tokyo Olympics. Dean touched home in one minute 44.22 seconds, securing a British record in his debut Games. Scott finished just 0.04secs behind his team-mate, with Fernando Scheffer of Brazil taking bronze. It is the first time since 1908 that two male British swimmers have finished on the Olympic podium together. The 21-year-old Dean had a difficult build-up to Tokyo after twice contracting coronavirus in 2020, which at one stage left him unable to ""walk up the stairs without coughing and wheezing"". Unable to train for three weeks on each occasion, he told BBC Sport it had been a real setback ""physically and mentally"" prior to the Games. ""The three week build-up back to training had to be structured to prevent any long-term damage to my heart and lungs, so it was scary,"" he explained. ""It was upsetting because no-one takes six weeks off in the build-up to an Olympics. It was a real shock to the system."" Despite the disruption, he arrived at the Games as the second-fastest man in the year, behind Scott. ""When I was sitting in my flat in isolation, an Olympic gold seemed a million miles off,"" he said. ""It is a real honour. I watched the flag go up and the anthems be played, it is the stuff of dreams."" Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table Men's 200m freestyle - full results The two Britons high-fived before sharing a hug as their remarkable podium finishes were confirmed. Both swimmers looked shocked as they spoke to BBC Sport afterwards, with Scott describing it as an ""unbelievable moment"". The Scot was the favourite going into the race but Dean was able to back up his rapid start with a strong finish. Scott, who won European silver in May, said he was ""just buzzing for Deano"" as the two good friends allowed their victory to sink in. About 70 of Dean's family, former coaches and friends gathered in his mum's garden in Maidenhead to watch the race in the early hours, with a video of their celebrations going viral. ""I'm delighted. It feels surreal at the moment, it feels like it's a bit of a dream,"" Dean's mum Jacquie Hughes told BBC One. ""We decided, because we couldn't be there, how nice would it be for Tom to know his family and friends were together watching him.""We invited some members of the [swimming] club, some neighbours and before we knew it there were 70 people in the garden watching on a big screen. ""It was so joyous and full of passion. It was lovely. I spoke to Tom this morning and he said he watched the video over and over again."" This video can not be played Tom Dean: Swimmer's family and friends celebrate his 200m freestyle gold The British team - including Adam Peaty, who won ahistoric 100m breaststroke goldon Monday - cheered the two on from the stands, with several reduced to tears by the emotion of the moment. ""You can't describe that. When you have worked so hard, to share this medal moment with one of your best friends is an unbelievable feeling,"" two-time Olympic gold medallist Rebecca Adlington told BBC TV. ""Duncan will be slightly disappointed because he was the fastest and the favourite but, at the end of the day, you can tell that if anyone were to beat him, he would want it to be his team-mate."" It is the first time since 1908 that two British male swimmers have shared an Olympic podium Scott was quick to praise Dean, with the pair celebrating together on the podium as they received their Olympic medals. ""He has come on so far in the last 18 months and it is a pleasure to watch,"" Scott added. ""He is a good mate out of the pool and it is great to be able to compete against him."" Dean's triumph ensured Britain won their fourth gold medal of the games after Peaty, Tim Pidcock, and Tom Daly and Matty Lee's successes on 'Magic Monday'. He returned to the pool on Tuesday to anchor home the British Men's 4 x 200m freestyle team to a spot in Wednesday's final. Alongside Matthew Richards, James Guy and Calum Jarvis, the quartet finished ahead of Australia and the United States - and faster than Italy, who won the other heat. Elsewhere, Britain'sKathleen Dawsonfinished sixth in the 100m backstroke, while Freya Anderson missed out on qualifying for the 200m freestyle. BritonsAbbie WoodandAlicia Wilsonqualified for the 200m individual medley in second and eighth position respectively. And AmericanLydia Jacobywas the shock winner in the 100m breaststroke, forcing her team-mate and Rio 2016 champion Lilly King to settle for bronze. The 17-year-old had to move from Alaska - where there is no Olympic-length pool - to train and benefited from the Games being delayed by a year to allow her to develop.

"Sex abuse review says children 'still unprotected'The report says some children in Bradford have ""suffered abuse no child should have to experience"".Leeds & West Yorkshire","Fiona Goddard's abuse started while living in a care home in Bradford from the age of 13 Some children in Bradford ""remain unprotected"" from sex exploitation, a new report looking into abuse over two decades has said. The independent review of five cases in the Bradford district since 2001 has found that ""children suffered abuse no child should have to experience"". Victim Fiona Goddard said the council and police had chances to ""nip it in the bud"" but ""never did"". The Bradford Partnership said it ""fully accepts more needs to be done"". More stories from around Yorkshire The review was commissioned afternine men were jailed over the sexual exploitation of girlswho had been in council care. Author Clare Hyde said it ""makes difficult and, at times, distressing reading. ""The children suffered abuse no child should have to experience, and in most cases had suffered other traumas and abuse long before they were sexually exploited."" (From top left, clockwise) Basharat Khaliq, Saeed Akhtar, Naveed Akhtar, Parvaze Ahmed, Zeeshan Ali, Fahim Iqbal, Izar Hussain, Mohammed Usman and Kieran Harris were all jailed at Bradford Crown Court in 2019 The report noted that while there had been ""considerable work"" done in relation to child sexual exploitation (CSE), there were still ""lessons that need to be learned"" and the response to some victims was ""not yet good enough"". It added that despite ""significant improvements"" in understanding and responding to more recent cases of CSE, some children ""remain unprotected while some perpetrators remain unknown and unchallenged"". Fiona Goddard, who was groomed and sexually abused by gangs of men from 2008, said she was failed ""multiple times"" by social services and police. ""I reported it multiple times - physical abuse, sexual abuse or rapes - and they were never followed up on."" The 27-year-old, who has waived her legal right to life-long anonymity, said most of the girls in the care home where she lived were victims of child sexual exploitation. ""They had the opportunity to nip it in the bud and save me from years of abuse but they never did."" The Bradford Partnership said ""more needs to be done"" to help victims of abuse The report also detailed abuse set out by another victim, known as Anna, whose social worker recommended she be placed in the foster care of the parents of the man who was abusing her. While living there, she became pregnant at the age of 15 and went on to marry him in an Islamic wedding, which she says was allowed by the authorities. The report stated: ""While in the 'care' of these adults, she was subjected to further sexual abuse and exploitation, domestic abuse, including assaults and coercion and what we would now recognise as domestic slavery."" Anna said agencies had ""just ignored the abuse"" and it had ""destroyed her childhood"". Both victims said the latest review did not go far enough and called for an independent inquiry, like the onecarried out by Professor Alexis Jay into abuse in Rotherham. Ms Goddard said: ""This review talks about five people, but what about the hundreds of others who deserve the same apology and to see the failings written down in black and white?"" Daniel Greenwood, Ch Supt Bradford District, said police had invested heavily to try and better understand the problem In a joint statement responding to the review, the Bradford Partnership, made up of Bradford Council, West Yorkshire Police's Bradford district commander and Bradford District and Craven Clinical Commissioning Group, said: ""We want to apologise to the young people identified in this report and any others where the actions of agencies in Bradford has failed to protect them from child sexual exploitation."" It added: ""This crime must not be tolerated. All the partners in our district are committed to protecting our children and to working with the police to bring perpetrators of this crime to justice."" Mark Douglas, strategic director of children's services at Bradford Council, said the authority had learned ""an awful lot about about child sexual exploitation"". He added: ""I think we have learned as a system and we are much better placed and much more robust in our response to these circumstances."" The Bradford review was carried out to assess whether there were themes and patterns organisations could learn from Daniel Greenwood, Ch Supt Bradford District, said the report acknowledged there had been a ""vast improvement"" in the way police had responded to CSE and to those at risk. ""Where we have the opportunity to identify perpetrators, we will take all reasonable steps that we can to identify them, arrest them, and to work towards a successful prosecution through the courts,"" he said. Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor in theRochdale grooming gang cases, said the new report's findings were ""deeply depressing but unsurprising"". He said while a full inquiry would reveal the true scale of the problem in Bradford he would rather ""we get on with fixing the problem"". ""That means dealing with the professionals' inability to recognise and respond to abuse...It means putting the children at the centre of our response and that means believing them and acting upon what they're told. ""Whatever inquiry we have, it will tell us the same thing: information was held by one agency, one person, and wasn't shared with another person - and that means those people were let down."" In 2019, nine men were found guilty of offences including rape and inciting child prostitution after a trial lasting more than six weeks. During the trial, the court heard the grooming and abuse began in 2008 when the girls were aged 14, living in a children's home in Bradford. The jury heard staff could not physically prevent the girls leaving the home but they were aware one of the girls was ""being picked up by multiple Asian males in smart cars"".

DUP MP 'appalled' at Edwin Poots over protocol,"DUP MP Sammy Wilson clashed with Edwin Poots in a private letter over his approach to the NI Protocol Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP Sammy Wilson has clashed with colleague Edwin Poots in a private letter over his approach earlier this year to the Northern Ireland Protocol. Mr Wilson said he was ""astounded and appalled"" by a response from the agriculture minister, Mr Poots. It was regarding Brexit checks on pets travelling from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that creates an Irish Sea border. Mr Wilson questioned why as a ""unionist minister"" Mr Poots had not ""resisted the views of his officials"". He went on to say the officials were ""more intent on implementing the protocol"" than recognising the ""grave harm"" it caused. Parties divided on UK call to amend NI Protocol Why does the UK want to change the NI Protocol? Checks on pets travelling from GB to NI delayed Mr Wilson also challenged Mr Poots for ""permitting discussions"" within his department, which were at odds with the DUP position. The letter, which was released through a Freedom of Information request, was sent in May - three days before Mr Poots was elected DUP leader. It was in response to earlier correspondence from the minister in which he set out the new restrictions around the movement of pets between Great Britain to Northern Ireland. In his opening line, Mr Wilson wrote: ""At the outset, can I say I am astounded and appalled at the response I received from you."" Within weeks of the letter, Mr Poots did act to delay the restrictions until October He then set out why he believed the checks on dogs moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland were unnecessary and added: ""I am astounded that the remedies which are open to you are not being pursued."" He asked why the checks could not be delayed for another year and questioned why the minister did not seek executive approval. He wrote that he was surprised that Mr Poots had ""accepted the erroneous advice from your officials"", that it was a departmental matter and did not need executive approval. At the time, Mr Wilson argued the restrictions on pet movements, which were due to come into force on 1 July, should be delayed for at least a year. Within weeks of the letter, Mr Poots did act to delay the restrictions until October. Mr Wilson wrote: ""I am surprised that you are permitting discussions to go on within your department to look at how this part of the protocol could be implemented when your party's position is that there should be no implementation of the protocol and indeed it should be replaced. ""I trust that you will reconsider the answer which you have given to me and give some hope to those who are looking for political leadership to destroy this protocol rather than meekly bow to the unreasonable demands which it makes.""

Japan's Osaka in shock Olympics exit,"This video can not be played Osaka crashes out as Vondrousova progresses from third round Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Japanese superstar Naomi Osaka suffered a surprise exit in her home Olympics as Czech Marketa Vondrousova earned a straight-set win in Tokyo. Osaka, 23, has been one of the faces of the Games in the Japanese capital and had the honour of lighting the Olympic cauldron in last week's opening ceremony. But the four-time Grand Slam champion could not back that up by winning a medal, losing 6-1 6-4 to the world number 42 in the third round. ""I definitely feel like there was a lot of pressure for this,"" said the world number two. ""I think it's maybe because I haven't played in the Olympics before and for the first year it was a bit much."" Follow all the live action on day four of Tokyo 2020 Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Osaka, who is the reigning US Open and Australian Open champion, had won 25 of her previous 26 matches on a hard court. It was Osaka's first tournament after withdrawing from the French Open in June, when she revealed she had ""suffered long bouts of depression"" since winning her first Grand Slam title in 2018. ""I think I'm glad with how I played, with taking that break that I had,"" she said. ""I've taken long breaks before and I've managed to do well. ""I'm not saying that I did bad right now, but I do know that my expectations were a lot higher. ""I feel like my attitude wasn't that great because I don't really know how to cope with that pressure so that's the best that I could have done in this situation."" Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table Following impressive wins in the first two rounds, Osaka looked to be shaping up nicely for a gold-medal bid but produced 32 unforced errors in a rusty performance against former French Open finalist Vondrousova. The 22-year-old Czech hit 18 winners against 10 unforced errors as she converted five of her 11 break points in the match. Osaka's exit follows that of Australian top seed Ashleigh Barty in the first round, leaving the women's singles draw wide open. Vondrousova will play Spain'sPaula Badosain the last eight.

GB's Dean takes gold & Scott silver in Tokyo,"This video can not be played Tom Dean wins gold for Team GB with Duncan Scott clinching silver Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Tom Dean claimed a stunning gold and Duncan Scott silver to ensure a British one-two in a fast, closely-fought 200m freestyle at the Tokyo Olympics. Dean touched home in one minute 44.22 seconds, securing a British record in his debut Games. Scott finished just 0.04secs behind his team-mate, with Fernando Scheffer of Brazil taking bronze. It is the first time since 1908 that two male British swimmers have finished on the Olympic podium together. The 21-year-old Dean had a difficult build-up to Tokyo after twice contracting coronavirus in 2020, which at one stage left him unable to ""walk up the stairs without coughing and wheezing"". Unable to train for three weeks on each occasion, he told BBC Sport it had been a real setback ""physically and mentally"" prior to the Games. ""The three week build-up back to training had to be structured to prevent any long-term damage to my heart and lungs, so it was scary,"" he explained. ""It was upsetting because no-one takes six weeks off in the build-up to an Olympics. It was a real shock to the system."" Despite the disruption, he arrived at the Games as the second-fastest man in the year, behind Scott. ""When I was sitting in my flat in isolation, an Olympic gold seemed a million miles off,"" he said. ""It is a real honour. I watched the flag go up and the anthems be played, it is the stuff of dreams."" Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table Men's 200m freestyle - full results The two Britons high-fived before sharing a hug as their remarkable podium finishes were confirmed. Both swimmers looked shocked as they spoke to BBC Sport afterwards, with Scott describing it as an ""unbelievable moment"". The Scot was the favourite going into the race but Dean was able to back up his rapid start with a strong finish. Scott, who won European silver in May, said he was ""just buzzing for Deano"" as the two good friends allowed their victory to sink in. About 70 of Dean's family, former coaches and friends gathered in his mum's garden in Maidenhead to watch the race in the early hours, with a video of their celebrations going viral. ""I'm delighted. It feels surreal at the moment, it feels like it's a bit of a dream,"" Dean's mum Jacquie Hughes told BBC One. ""We decided, because we couldn't be there, how nice would it be for Tom to know his family and friends were together watching him.""We invited some members of the [swimming] club, some neighbours and before we knew it there were 70 people in the garden watching on a big screen. ""It was so joyous and full of passion. It was lovely. I spoke to Tom this morning and he said he watched the video over and over again."" This video can not be played Tom Dean: Swimmer's family and friends celebrate his 200m freestyle gold The British team - including Adam Peaty, who won ahistoric 100m breaststroke goldon Monday - cheered the two on from the stands, with several reduced to tears by the emotion of the moment. ""You can't describe that. When you have worked so hard, to share this medal moment with one of your best friends is an unbelievable feeling,"" two-time Olympic gold medallist Rebecca Adlington told BBC TV. ""Duncan will be slightly disappointed because he was the fastest and the favourite but, at the end of the day, you can tell that if anyone were to beat him, he would want it to be his team-mate."" It is the first time since 1908 that two British male swimmers have shared an Olympic podium Scott was quick to praise Dean, with the pair celebrating together on the podium as they received their Olympic medals. ""He has come on so far in the last 18 months and it is a pleasure to watch,"" Scott added. ""He is a good mate out of the pool and it is great to be able to compete against him."" Dean's triumph ensured Britain won their fourth gold medal of the games after Peaty, Tim Pidcock, and Tom Daly and Matty Lee's successes on 'Magic Monday'. He returned to the pool on Tuesday to anchor home the British Men's 4 x 200m freestyle team to a spot in Wednesday's final. Alongside Matthew Richards, James Guy and Calum Jarvis, the quartet finished ahead of Australia and the United States - and faster than Italy, who won the other heat. Elsewhere, Britain'sKathleen Dawsonfinished sixth in the 100m backstroke, while Freya Anderson missed out on qualifying for the 200m freestyle. BritonsAbbie WoodandAlicia Wilsonqualified for the 200m individual medley in second and eighth position respectively. And AmericanLydia Jacobywas the shock winner in the 100m breaststroke, forcing her team-mate and Rio 2016 champion Lilly King to settle for bronze. The 17-year-old had to move from Alaska - where there is no Olympic-length pool - to train and benefited from the Games being delayed by a year to allow her to develop.

Emotional scenes & family reaction to GB swimming one-two Swimmer Tom Dean sensationally clinched Team GB's fourth gold of the Tokyo Olympics on day four of the Games as Great Britain secured its best ever start to a Games. GB claimed six medals on Tuesday, including two silvers and three bronzes, to take their tally to 13 overall and put them fifth in the medal table. It more than doubles Britain's previous best medal haul of six after the first four days, achieved at the 2000, 2008 and 2016 Games.

The American left the arena after the vault, but later returned to support her team-mates as they claimed silver behind the Russian Olympic Committee. Simon Gleave, head of sports analysis at Nielsen Gracenote, said: ""After four days, the expectation was that Great Britain would have 10 medals - three gold, five silver and two bronze medals. ""The forecast for Great Britain has therefore improved to 55 medals including 15 golds. This is likely to be enough for fifth place on the medal table on both total medals and gold medals."" UK Sport seta medal target of between 45 and 70. Team GB won 65 medals at London 2012, followed by 67 medals in Rio in 2016 - finishing second in the medal table.

The 27-year-oldrevealed after the finishshe had overcome a stress fracture to her leg to make the start line, passing a late fitness test a week before departing for Tokyo. ""My training had gone so well before then though, so that was a bit of a shock, but I knew I had all of that training in the bag,"" she said. ""I wanted to keep it private.

Afterwards, she said she ""panicked"" when the incident happened. ""I didn't know what to do, so I just rode out on the flat. It was panic mode but it paid off,"" she told BBC Sport.

"Tesco offers Â£1,000 joining bonus for HGV drivers","Tesco is offering lorry drivers a Â£1,000 joining bonus amid a chronic shortage of drivers in the industry. The supermarket giant has deployed the recruitment incentive for candidates who join before 30 September. Other companies are also understood to be offering similar incentives for HGV drivers after disruption to supply chains led to product shortages. Morrisons said it was working on schemes to train staff to become lorry drivers. The Road Haulage Association (RHA) has estimated there is a 100,000 shortage of HGV drivers across the UK. The industry body has said some 30,000 HGV driving tests did not take place last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, and added a ""historic"" shortage in drivers had been exacerbated by changes to rules following Brexit. More recently, drivers being told to self-isolate after being notified by the NHS Covid app is also adding to the problem. A lack of drivers has led to supermarkets suffering shortages of particular brands, while oil firm BP was forced to temporarily close a ""handful"" of its UK sitesdue to shortages in unleaded petrol and diesel being delivered. There have also been problems with the delivery of some council services. James Jamieson, chair of the Local Government Association (LGA), said several councils had been forced to suspend garden waste collections because of the lack of drivers. Darren Rodwell, environment spokesperson for the Local Government Association, said: ""While most councils have been able to keep services running, some are having to reduce services such as green waste collection. ""These issues are partly due to the increase in 'pinged' staff but also a larger problem with a shortage of HGV drivers. ""The announcement that waste collection staff can apply for exemption is pleasing, but we are awaiting details on how quick the application process will be and whether it includes all waste collection staff."" In Sutton and Croydon delays to bin collections could last until the autumn, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said. Rod McKenzie, managing director of the RHA, said it was becoming ""increasingly competitive"" to recruit a ""a diminishing number of HGV drivers"", which he added had also driven up wages. Mr McKenzie said he appreciated the ""difficulties"" caused by the pandemic but urged the government to ""speed up"" driving tests. He said it currently takes about six months to fully train a HGV driver. ""We are not seeing any sign of it getting better in the short term,"" he added. Mr McKenzie said a ""package of measures"" was required to tackle driver shortages, which included conducting more tests and creating short-term visas for drivers from overseas to work in the UK. Alex Veitch, general manager of public policy at Logistics UK, said incentives being offered by Tesco and other businesses were ""obviously the law of supply and demand at work, given the current shortage of HGV drivers"". To address driver shortages, wholesale food and catering supplier JJ Foodservice is aiming to fill the gap by broadening its talent pool. The company has launched a recruitment campaign to encourage more women to become HGV drivers. ""Only 1% of HGV drivers in the UK are women - we want to help change that,"" said JJ's HR manager, Joanna Florczak. The wholesaler said it was offering ""permanent contracts with no evenings or weekends, salaries of up to Â£35K in London, and no gender pay gap"". Kaan Hendekli, head of operations at JJ Foodservice, said the company was also using women in recruitment adverts and highlighting ""support with wellbeing, which you might  not associate with traditional HGV driver ads"". ""The UK driver shortage is not going to go away overnight, so we're doing our part to make HGV driver roles more appealing to a wider diversity of people,"" he added. To reduce demand on the company's existing drivers, the wholesaler if offering savings for customers who collect their orders instead of having them delivered. The RHA has called on ministers to put HGV drivers on theHome Office Shortage Occupation List.,external In response to HGV driver shortages, the government recently granted a temporary extension of lorry drivers' working hours. In a letter to the logistics sector,external, government ministers said they would consult about ""the delegation of off-road manoeuvres"" as part of the HGV test, which they said would boost testing capacity. It added the Department for Transport would also look to into issuing provisional licences to drive rigid and articulated lorries.

Bradford authorities apologise to child sex victims,"Fiona Goddard's abuse started while living in a care home in Bradford from the age of 13 Some children in Bradford ""remain unprotected"" from sex exploitation, a new report looking into abuse over two decades has said. The independent review of five cases in the Bradford district since 2001 has found that ""children suffered abuse no child should have to experience"". Victim Fiona Goddard said the council and police had chances to ""nip it in the bud"" but ""never did"". The Bradford Partnership said it ""fully accepts more needs to be done"". More stories from around Yorkshire The review was commissioned afternine men were jailed over the sexual exploitation of girlswho had been in council care. Author Clare Hyde said it ""makes difficult and, at times, distressing reading. ""The children suffered abuse no child should have to experience, and in most cases had suffered other traumas and abuse long before they were sexually exploited."" (From top left, clockwise) Basharat Khaliq, Saeed Akhtar, Naveed Akhtar, Parvaze Ahmed, Zeeshan Ali, Fahim Iqbal, Izar Hussain, Mohammed Usman and Kieran Harris were all jailed at Bradford Crown Court in 2019 The report noted that while there had been ""considerable work"" done in relation to child sexual exploitation (CSE), there were still ""lessons that need to be learned"" and the response to some victims was ""not yet good enough"". It added that despite ""significant improvements"" in understanding and responding to more recent cases of CSE, some children ""remain unprotected while some perpetrators remain unknown and unchallenged"". Fiona Goddard, who was groomed and sexually abused by gangs of men from 2008, said she was failed ""multiple times"" by social services and police. ""I reported it multiple times - physical abuse, sexual abuse or rapes - and they were never followed up on."" The 27-year-old, who has waived her legal right to life-long anonymity, said most of the girls in the care home where she lived were victims of child sexual exploitation. ""They had the opportunity to nip it in the bud and save me from years of abuse but they never did."" The Bradford Partnership said ""more needs to be done"" to help victims of abuse The report also detailed abuse set out by another victim, known as Anna, whose social worker recommended she be placed in the foster care of the parents of the man who was abusing her. While living there, she became pregnant at the age of 15 and went on to marry him in an Islamic wedding, which she says was allowed by the authorities. The report stated: ""While in the 'care' of these adults, she was subjected to further sexual abuse and exploitation, domestic abuse, including assaults and coercion and what we would now recognise as domestic slavery."" Anna said agencies had ""just ignored the abuse"" and it had ""destroyed her childhood"". Both victims said the latest review did not go far enough and called for an independent inquiry, like the onecarried out by Professor Alexis Jay into abuse in Rotherham. Ms Goddard said: ""This review talks about five people, but what about the hundreds of others who deserve the same apology and to see the failings written down in black and white?"" Daniel Greenwood, Ch Supt Bradford District, said police had invested heavily to try and better understand the problem In a joint statement responding to the review, the Bradford Partnership, made up of Bradford Council, West Yorkshire Police's Bradford district commander and Bradford District and Craven Clinical Commissioning Group, said: ""We want to apologise to the young people identified in this report and any others where the actions of agencies in Bradford has failed to protect them from child sexual exploitation."" It added: ""This crime must not be tolerated. All the partners in our district are committed to protecting our children and to working with the police to bring perpetrators of this crime to justice."" Mark Douglas, strategic director of children's services at Bradford Council, said the authority had learned ""an awful lot about about child sexual exploitation"". He added: ""I think we have learned as a system and we are much better placed and much more robust in our response to these circumstances."" The Bradford review was carried out to assess whether there were themes and patterns organisations could learn from Daniel Greenwood, Ch Supt Bradford District, said the report acknowledged there had been a ""vast improvement"" in the way police had responded to CSE and to those at risk. ""Where we have the opportunity to identify perpetrators, we will take all reasonable steps that we can to identify them, arrest them, and to work towards a successful prosecution through the courts,"" he said. Nazir Afzal, the former chief crown prosecutor in theRochdale grooming gang cases, said the new report's findings were ""deeply depressing but unsurprising"". He said while a full inquiry would reveal the true scale of the problem in Bradford he would rather ""we get on with fixing the problem"". ""That means dealing with the professionals' inability to recognise and respond to abuse...It means putting the children at the centre of our response and that means believing them and acting upon what they're told. ""Whatever inquiry we have, it will tell us the same thing: information was held by one agency, one person, and wasn't shared with another person - and that means those people were let down."" In 2019, nine men were found guilty of offences including rape and inciting child prostitution after a trial lasting more than six weeks. During the trial, the court heard the grooming and abuse began in 2008 when the girls were aged 14, living in a children's home in Bradford. The jury heard staff could not physically prevent the girls leaving the home but they were aware one of the girls was ""being picked up by multiple Asian males in smart cars"".

What is the child sexual abuse inquiry?,"Inquiry chairwoman, Prof Alexis Jay, led the probe into child abuse in Rotherham The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) in England and Wales is investigating claims against local authorities, religious organisations, the armed forces and public and private institutions - as well as people in the public eye. But it was dogged with controversy after being announced in July 2014, with chairwomen coming and going and lawyers quitting their posts. Following the death of BBC presenter Jimmy Savile in 2011, hundreds of people came forward to say he had abused them as children. The spotlight has also fallen on sexual assaults carried out in schools, children's homes and at NHS sites. Jimmy Savile died in 2011 At the same time, there have been claims of past failures by police and prosecutors to properly investigate allegations. The inquiry was announced by the then Home Secretary Theresa May to ""expose those failures and learn the lessons"" from the past. When it was announced, the inquiry was expected to take about five years to complete. When finished, it will publish a final report of recommendations. It has already published aninterim report,externalwith 18 recommendations - some of which have been acted upon - plus other investigation reports. The inquiry is divided into public hearings into specific areas of concern, with witnesses giving evidence under oath; research into institutional failures in child protection, and theTruth Project,,externalin which victims share their experiences with the inquiry either in private interviews or written form. The inquiry will not seek to determine civil or criminal liability of individuals or organisations but may reach ""findings of fact"" in relation to this. Allegations of child abuse received by the inquiry will be referred to police and material related to Scotland, Northern Ireland or British Overseas Territories will be passed on to the authorities there. A separateinquiry looking at the abuse of children in care in Scotland,externalhas been set up by the Scottish Government. The inquiry is being led byProf Alexis Jay,external, a former director of social services who headed theinquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham. She is being assisted by apanel of advisers,external: law professor and human rights expert Malcolm Evans; child protection barrister Ivor Frank; and lawyer Drusilla Sharpling, a former Chief Crown Prosecutor for London, who has worked as an inspector of constabulary since 2009. A separate panel, made up of eight members,represents victims and survivors,externaland advises the inquiry on all aspects of its work. There is also a Victims and Survivors' Forum. Brian Altman QC is lead counsel,externalto the inquiry. The inquiry's public hearings consisted of15 separate investigations,external. The inquiry is investigating: the institutional responses to the sexual exploitation of children by organised abuse networks alleged failings at Lambeth Council; the Roman Catholic Church; residential schools, and the support services and legal remedies available to victims and survivors current child protection policies and practices in religious institutions in England and Wales - including non-conformist Christian denominations, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism and Buddhism, as well as tuition classes, groups and camps linked to religious beliefs the effective leadership of child protection institutions tasked with safeguarding them against sexual abuse the institutional responses to child sexual abuse allegations against the late Lord Janner, the former Labour peer who in 2015 was ruled unfit to stand trial on child sex abuse charges As of October 2020,eight of its investigations are complete,external. Their conclusions included: the Church of England failed to protect children from sexual abuse, andcreated a culture where abusers ""could hide"", with more support given to alleged perpetrators than to survivors authorities in the UK are failing to use the powers they haveto stop British sex offenders travelling abroadto abuse children. As of 31 March 2018,only about 0.2 per cent,externalof the 58,637 registered sex offenders in England and Wales had their foreign travel restricted internet companies must do more to tackle""an explosion"" in images of child sex abuseon their platforms, including more stringent age checks and screening images before publication hundreds of children were sexually abused bypredatory foster carers and residential home staff who were allowed to thrive, with Nottingham City and Nottinghamshire County councils accused of exposing vulnerable children to repeated rapes and physical abuse political institutionsfailed to respond to historical claims of child sexual abusebut there was no evidence of an organised paedophile network at Westminster thousands of people forcibly sent abroad as children, many of whom were abused in institutions,should receive compensation. The government has subsequently opened a compensation scheme to pay Â£20,000 each to about 2,000 eligible survivors the former council leader in Rochdale, Richard Farnell, ""lied"" in evidenceto the inquiry and his claim that he was unaware of abuse in a hostel, school and other places in the town over 20 years ""defies belief"". He rejected those conclusions children in custody in England and Wales are still at risk of physical and sexual abuse, withmore than 1,000 reported incidents between 2009 and 2017 the Catholic schools system ""prioritised monks and their own reputationsover the protection of children"", meaning pupils suffered ""appalling"" abuse over a 40-year period An interim reportconcluded that common responses to child abuse ""deflected responsibility away from perpetrators and institutions"". John Glynn is among the victims of the UK's child migrant policy The main bone of contention in the inquiry's early years was who is in charge. The first chairwoman, appointed in July 2014, was Baroness Butler-Sloss. However, sheresigned just one week laterafter concerns arose around her links to the establishment - namely her late brother, Sir Michael Havers, who was attorney general in the 1980s. In September 2014, Lord Mayor of London Fiona Woolf was named the new head, but after disclosing she had been to five dinners with the late Lord Brittan - one of the people facing accusations at the time, which have since been dropped - shequit by the end of October. In February 2015, Justice Lowell Goddard, a serving judge of the High Court of New Zealand, took over the reins and was in charge as the inquiry began hearing directly from victims and survivors. But by August 2016, she hadresigned from her postas well due to ""compounding difficulties"" and her family life. A number of lawyers have also resigned or been removed from the process. In November 2016, the largest of the victims' groups involved in the inquiry, the Shirley Oaks Survivors Association, said it hadlost confidence in the inquiry's leadership. But despite threatening to pull out of the inquiry, they remain core participants. A legal case relating to allegations of abuse relating to Lord Janner has been dropped. The case had previously caused hearings to be delayed because of an ""overlap"" with the criminal investigation. It wasconfirmed in March that the hearings would go aheadin October, with some proceedings taking place in private. Lord Janner's family have always maintained his innocence. IICSA is funded by the Home Office and spent Â£35.3m in the 2019/20 financial year. According to the financial report,about Â£12.3m was on staffing with nearly Â£12m on legal costs,external. Previous total annual costs were Â£36.6m in2018/19,external; Â£28.5m in2017/18,external; Â£20.8m in2016/17,external; and Â£14.7m in2015/16.,external Prof Jay was paid Â£190,522 in the past financial year, plus Â£35,536 accommodation allowance.

"More pinged workers to get daily Covid testsWaste workers, prison staff and defence workers will be able to avoid isolation, the government says.UK PoliticsComments","More critical workers will be able to take daily tests rather than isolate when they are identified as a close contact of someone who has Covid. The government said 1,200 extra sites would be established, with prisons, waste management and the armed forces among the sectors prioritised. Some 800 sites are already being set up for police, firefighters, supermarket depot staff and some other industries. Several sectors have warned of staffing shortages caused by 10-day isolations. Covid cases fall below 25,000, latest data shows UK pingdemic response chaotic, say food firms Which workers don't have to self-isolate? A total of 618,903 contact tracing alerts- popularly known as pings - advising people to self-isolate for up to 10 days were sent from the NHS Covid-19 app in England and Wales in the week to 15 July. Daily testing for certain critical sectors in England was launched on Monday as an alternative to self-isolation for some workers. The government has not said how many sites are currently up-and-running but that it expected 500 would be set up this week. Tesco is understood to be working through the details of the new scheme, while Morrisons said it was contacting staff who had been pinged to sign up for testing on a voluntary basis, but did say that it was ready to start. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said daily contact testing would play a ""vital role"" in helping to ""minimise the potential for disruption caused by rising cases, while keeping staff protected"". When all 2,000 testing sites are open, 800 will deal with food industry, transport and Border Force workers, as well as police and fire services. The other 1,200 will be for people employed in prisons, waste, defence and veterinary medicine, plus the energy, pharmaceutical, telecoms, chemical, communications, water, space and fish industries. Workers will be allowed to take the tests, rather than isolate, whether or not they are fully vaccinated. The announcement of the scheme's extension came after the number of Covid cases reported in the UKfell to below 25,000on Monday. Frontline health and care staff who are fully vaccinated and identified as a close contact of someone with Covidhave a separate system,,externalallowing some to go to work, subject to strict testing rules. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Chancellor Rishi Sunak are among workers self-isolating after the health secretary tested positive last week. From 16 August, anyone in England who is fully vaccinated - and unvaccinated under-18s - will be able to takePCR tests,external- which are sent to a laboratory to be checked - instead of self-isolating, if pinged. Similar rules come into force in Scotland from 9 August - and in Wales from 7 August.

PM pledges to target drug abuse in anti-crime push,"This video can not be played The PM defends the wider use of stop and search powers. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has suggested electronic tagging on more burglars after release, and wider use of public ""chain gangs"", as measures to combat crime and anti-social behaviour. The government is also proposing that every neighbourhood in England and Wales should have a named police officer for residents to contact. The PM said it meant victims could speak to someone who knew the area. The Police Federation said fighting crime needed greater investment. And Labour accused the government of being ""all talk and no action"" on law and order. Boris Johnson also said he wanted to see hi-vis ""chain gangs"" as punishment for anti-social behaviour. ""If you are guilty of anti-social behaviour and you are sentenced to unpaid work, as many people are, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be out there in one of those fluorescent-jacketed chain gangs visibly paying your debt to society,"" he said. We have no confidence in Patel, says police body Boris Johnson's claims about crime checked What is a Section 60 stop and search? Under the Beating Crime Plan, more burglars, robbers and thieves would have their location monitored with electronic tags 24 hours a day after leaving prison. The document also says Project Adder - whichtargets drugs gangs, offers help to addicts and increases the use of drugs testing when arrests are made- will be expanded from five areas of England to 13. The new areas covered will be Newcastle, Bristol, London's Hackney and Tower Hamlets, Wakefield, Liverpool, Knowsley and Wirral. Ministers are also removing rules introduced by former Prime Minister Theresa May which made it harder for officers to usetheir section 60 stop and search powers. The powers allow officers to search people without reasonable suspicion in places where serious violence may occur. BBC home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford says the change could prove controversial but the government believes limits on stop and search have held back efforts to tackle knife crime. Also as part of a trial, probation services in Wales will be able to require prisoners released on licence to wear ankle tags for up to a year to monitor the amount of alcohol in their sweat. Probation officers will be able to impose the tags where drinking alcohol is believed to increase their likelihood of committing another crime. Currently, courts can only require offenders serving community sentences to wear the tags for up to four months for crimes explicitly linked to alcohol. Like the court-ordered tags, prisoners on release will not be required to wear them if they are dependent on alcohol because those offenders are often required to undergo treatment. The government's plan also includes: A pilot scheme to test the benefit of sending an officer to every reported burglary, to be trialled in Greater Manchester Proposals for league tables ranking how quickly police forces answer 101 and 999 calls More officers to deal with children truanting from school A Â£17m programme to persuade young people who attend hospital with a stab wound or come into contact with police to stay away from violence Â£45m for specialist teams in schools in places with high levels of violence Speaking to reporters in Surrey, Mr Johnson said the government was ""putting Â£15.8bn into supporting our police"" - and he defended stop and search plans arguing that relieving someone of a dangerous weapon was ""a kind and a loving thing to do"" rather than a ""strong-arm tactic"". He said plans for a named police officer for every neighbourhood would ensure that victims of crime could speak to someone who understood the local area. ""What you need is somebody who understands what's going on in your neighbourhood, who understands who the likely miscreants are, who understands whether the thing you are reporting - the crime that you are experiencing - is a one-off or part of a trend,"" he said. By BBC Reality Check Figures shows black people are six times more likely to be stopped and searched in a car than white people It is far from clear that stop and search reduces violent crime. While it's often framed as acting as a deterrent, the figures don't bear this out. A surge of section 60 searches in parts of London was brought in under a knife crime initiative called Operation Blunt 2. However, it had no effect on police recorded crime compared with boroughs where the searches were not brought in. As the number of stops fell after the policy was reviewed in 2010, the proportion of stops resulting in an arrest rose. In other words, when the police could search more people indiscriminately they stopped many more people who weren't committing a crime. If you stop and search a lot more people you do get an increase in the absolute number of arrests - but many argue the methods are disproportionate. Last year, black people were nine times more likely to be stopped and searched as white people. Part of this is due to geography (more searches take place in big cities where there are also larger black communities) but even in London black people are still four times more likely to be searched. By BBC political correspondent Pete Saull On the prime minister's first day out of self-isolation, this is a clear attempt to seize the political initiative on an issue that's moving up the list of voters' priorities. We've all spent more time than usual in our local communities over the past year and we're perhaps more aware than ever of crime and anti-social behaviour. Indeed, surveys for the Office for National Statistics suggest a growing number of people believe crime levels are rising. It's an issue that has been considered safe territory for the Conservative party in the past, but Labour, too, are trying to capitalise on voters' unease. The shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, has accused the Tories of being ""soft on crime""; an accusation that's traditionally gone in the opposite direction. The debate is also a sign that the parties want to move the conversation on from the pandemic. With the worst of the coronavirus crisis seemingly behind us, you can expect discussions about other subjects to rise up the agenda over the summer. The announcement comes four days after the Police Federation declared it had no confidence in Home Secretary Priti Patel. It described the planned pay freeze for all officers in England and Wales earning more than Â£24,000 a year as an insult. And it delivered a letter to Downing Street on Tuesday objecting to the pay freeze and criticising the crime-fighting proposals. ""We don't need old ideas presented as new, we need genuine investment for the whole of the criminal justice system and genuine consultation over new ideas. Without that, this is just another ill-thought out initiative,"" the letter says. Labour said community policing had been ""decimated"" under the Conservatives. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""Coupled with an insulting pay freeze, it is no wonder frontline police have declared no confidence in the home secretary."" He said the prime minister was offering ""more gimmicks and more slogans"", and suggested that key proposals such as a named police officer for every victim of crime were already recommended by the College of Policing guidelines. The government says its crime plan builds on progress already made, with 9,000 new officers hired of the promised 20,000 additional officers by 2023. This follows a reduction in officer numbers since the Conservatives came to power in 2010. Between March 2010 and September 2017 there was a fall in officer numbers in England and Wales of 21,805. Police numbers have risen since then, butin the most recent set of figures,externalfor September 2020 they were still 11,267 below the level in 2010. Former Metropolitan Police Chief Superintendent John Sutherland told BBC Newsnight: ""During the decade of austerity, it wasn't just the numbers that we lost, it was the experience that went with it, it was the relationships with local communities that are the bedrock of local policing."" Policing Minister Kit Malthouse said the cuts had to be made in 2010 due to ""the worst economic crash since the Second World War"". He denied suggestions that a reduction in police numbers had led to a rise in crime. Have you been a victim of crime? You can share your experience by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

'Culture of cover-up' saw care home children abused,"This video can not be played Elizabeth McCourt: 'I can't forgive Lambeth for what they've done to me or my family' Staff and councillors presided over a ""culture of cover-up"" that led to more than 700 children in south London care homes suffering cruelty and sexual abuse, an inquiry has found. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse strongly criticised Lambeth Council for allowing abuse in five homes from the 1960s to the 1990s. It said abusers were able to to infiltrate homes and the foster system. Lambeth Council has made an unreserved apology to the victims. And a former council leader said the authority had ""clearly failed"" and she should have known about the abuse. The Metropolitan Police also apologised ""for when we let children in the care of Lambeth down"". The inquiry into the council, held in the summer of 2020, examined five homes - Angell Road, South Vale Assessment Centre, the Shirley Oaks complex, Ivy House and Monkton Street. The Independent Inquiry Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) report,externalsaid: ""With some exceptions, they [Lambeth Council staff] treated children in care as if they were worthless. ""As a consequence, individuals who posed a risk to children were able to infiltrate children's homes and foster care, with devastating, life-long consequences for their victims."" Of the 705 complaints made by former residents across three such facilities, only one senior member of staff was ever disciplined by the council, the report said. At Shirley Oaks, which closed in 1983, the council received allegations of abuse against 177 members of staff, involving at least 529 former residents. Children's home girl raped '500 times' 'Systematic abuse where I grew up' How the child sexual abuse inquiry works The council was mired in corruption and financial mismanagement during the decades of abuse, with ""politicised behaviour and turmoil"" dominating its culture, according to the report. The report partly blames the Labour council's battle against the Conservative government in the 1980s, saying it sought to ""take on the government"" to the detriment of local services. ""During that time, children in care became pawns in a toxic power game within Lambeth Council and between the council and central government,"" the report added. The IICSA is calling on the Met Police to consider a criminal investigation into why allegations of sexual abuse made by a boy, later found dead at the Shirley Oaks care home, were not passed on to the coroner by Lambeth Council in 1977. The force said it would assess this recommendation. Shirley Oaks and South Vale were found to have been ""brutal places where violence and sexual assault were allowed to flourish"". Another care home, Angell Road, ""systematically exposed children (including those under the age of five years) to sexual abuse,"" the report said. Elizabeth McCourt, who was sexually abused at Angell Road care home, said she could not forgive Lambeth Council. The 56-year-old told the BBC she was forced into prostitution because of the council's ""negligence"". ""I felt dirty, I felt ashamed and I felt like I had nobody to listen to me,"" she said. ""Because of what happened to me in care, and then coming out of care, I can't hold a job down... I've got a criminal record so it's very difficult for me to work."" An archive picture of Shirley Oaks children's home - located in Croydon but run by Lambeth Council Sandra Fearon, who was at Shirley Oaks between 1964 and 1969 with her siblings, said she was violently sexually abused by a doctor from the age of 12. She told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme the abuse continued every week for two years until her school intervened, after she was able to tell a school nurse what had happened to her. ""I got to the point where I was probably seconds away from suicide. That's how bad my health was and the state I was in,"" she said, adding that the abuse ""absolutely destroyed me"". Children spent time with ""social aunts"" or ""social uncles"", volunteers who worked with children without proper vetting. One such volunteer, Geoffrey Clarke, stayed at Shirley Oaks with regular and unimpeded access to children there from the early 1970s. He was convicted of sexually assaulting three children in 1998, but Lambeth Council is now aware of at least 40 people who have made allegations against him. Clarke was charged with numerous abuse offences as part of Operation Middleton, one of five police investigations into child sexual abuse linked to Lambeth Council from 1992 to the present date. Clarke took his own life before his trial. The inquiry criticises the Metropolitan Police for its failures to follow up evidence that may have led to the identification of further offending. Six men have been convicted since the 1990s in connection with abuse in Lambeth. They include: William Hook, jailed for 10 years; Philip Temple, jailed for 18 years; and Leslie Paul, sent to prison for 13 years. Michael Carroll was appointed to work in a Lambeth care home in 1978 despite abusing children previously in Liverpool and failing twice to declare his offences, including when he applied to be a foster carer. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to 10 years in 1999. The former Shirley Oaks site The report made a number of recommendations, including that the council publishes an action plan to deal with the issues raised, as well as improving staff training, recruitment and vetting. Lambeth Council has accepted the recommendations and apologised to the inquiry for creating and overseeing conditions ""where appalling and absolutely shocking and horrendous abuse was perpetrated"". It has also paid Â£71.5 million in compensation to former children's home residents, with individual payments of up to Â£125,000. Linda Bellos, who led Lambeth Council between 1986-88, said she was ""shocked"" and ""disgusted"" by the abuse revealed in the report. Ms Bellos, who was not called to give evidence by the inquiry, told the BBC: ""I should have known, there should have been transparency for the services that we were supposed to be giving to vulnerable children."" ""We clearly failed. I hold myself responsible for that failure,"" she added. Commander Alex Murray, from the Met Police, said: ""It is clear that at different times we missed opportunities to identify offenders and investigate further. Some of the treatment of children was also unacceptable."" He said the force had changed the way it investigated allegations of child sexual abuse, with better training for officers, greater collaboration between social care partners and ""putting the victim at the heart of the investigation"". The long-running IICSA is investigating claims against organisations including the church, local authorities and the armed forces. Its final report of overarching findings will be laid before Parliament next summer.

"'Culture of cover-up' saw care home children abusedMore than 700 children suffered cruelty and sexual abuse at care homes in Lambeth, a report finds.UK","This video can not be played Elizabeth McCourt: 'I can't forgive Lambeth for what they've done to me or my family' Staff and councillors presided over a ""culture of cover-up"" that led to more than 700 children in south London care homes suffering cruelty and sexual abuse, an inquiry has found. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse strongly criticised Lambeth Council for allowing abuse in five homes from the 1960s to the 1990s. It said abusers were able to to infiltrate homes and the foster system. Lambeth Council has made an unreserved apology to the victims. And a former council leader said the authority had ""clearly failed"" and she should have known about the abuse. The Metropolitan Police also apologised ""for when we let children in the care of Lambeth down"". The inquiry into the council, held in the summer of 2020, examined five homes - Angell Road, South Vale Assessment Centre, the Shirley Oaks complex, Ivy House and Monkton Street. The Independent Inquiry Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) report,externalsaid: ""With some exceptions, they [Lambeth Council staff] treated children in care as if they were worthless. ""As a consequence, individuals who posed a risk to children were able to infiltrate children's homes and foster care, with devastating, life-long consequences for their victims."" Of the 705 complaints made by former residents across three such facilities, only one senior member of staff was ever disciplined by the council, the report said. At Shirley Oaks, which closed in 1983, the council received allegations of abuse against 177 members of staff, involving at least 529 former residents. Children's home girl raped '500 times' 'Systematic abuse where I grew up' How the child sexual abuse inquiry works The council was mired in corruption and financial mismanagement during the decades of abuse, with ""politicised behaviour and turmoil"" dominating its culture, according to the report. The report partly blames the Labour council's battle against the Conservative government in the 1980s, saying it sought to ""take on the government"" to the detriment of local services. ""During that time, children in care became pawns in a toxic power game within Lambeth Council and between the council and central government,"" the report added. The IICSA is calling on the Met Police to consider a criminal investigation into why allegations of sexual abuse made by a boy, later found dead at the Shirley Oaks care home, were not passed on to the coroner by Lambeth Council in 1977. The force said it would assess this recommendation. Shirley Oaks and South Vale were found to have been ""brutal places where violence and sexual assault were allowed to flourish"". Another care home, Angell Road, ""systematically exposed children (including those under the age of five years) to sexual abuse,"" the report said. Elizabeth McCourt, who was sexually abused at Angell Road care home, said she could not forgive Lambeth Council. The 56-year-old told the BBC she was forced into prostitution because of the council's ""negligence"". ""I felt dirty, I felt ashamed and I felt like I had nobody to listen to me,"" she said. ""Because of what happened to me in care, and then coming out of care, I can't hold a job down... I've got a criminal record so it's very difficult for me to work."" An archive picture of Shirley Oaks children's home - located in Croydon but run by Lambeth Council Sandra Fearon, who was at Shirley Oaks between 1964 and 1969 with her siblings, said she was violently sexually abused by a doctor from the age of 12. She told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme the abuse continued every week for two years until her school intervened, after she was able to tell a school nurse what had happened to her. ""I got to the point where I was probably seconds away from suicide. That's how bad my health was and the state I was in,"" she said, adding that the abuse ""absolutely destroyed me"". Children spent time with ""social aunts"" or ""social uncles"", volunteers who worked with children without proper vetting. One such volunteer, Geoffrey Clarke, stayed at Shirley Oaks with regular and unimpeded access to children there from the early 1970s. He was convicted of sexually assaulting three children in 1998, but Lambeth Council is now aware of at least 40 people who have made allegations against him. Clarke was charged with numerous abuse offences as part of Operation Middleton, one of five police investigations into child sexual abuse linked to Lambeth Council from 1992 to the present date. Clarke took his own life before his trial. The inquiry criticises the Metropolitan Police for its failures to follow up evidence that may have led to the identification of further offending. Six men have been convicted since the 1990s in connection with abuse in Lambeth. They include: William Hook, jailed for 10 years; Philip Temple, jailed for 18 years; and Leslie Paul, sent to prison for 13 years. Michael Carroll was appointed to work in a Lambeth care home in 1978 despite abusing children previously in Liverpool and failing twice to declare his offences, including when he applied to be a foster carer. He was eventually convicted and sentenced to 10 years in 1999. The former Shirley Oaks site The report made a number of recommendations, including that the council publishes an action plan to deal with the issues raised, as well as improving staff training, recruitment and vetting. Lambeth Council has accepted the recommendations and apologised to the inquiry for creating and overseeing conditions ""where appalling and absolutely shocking and horrendous abuse was perpetrated"". It has also paid Â£71.5 million in compensation to former children's home residents, with individual payments of up to Â£125,000. Linda Bellos, who led Lambeth Council between 1986-88, said she was ""shocked"" and ""disgusted"" by the abuse revealed in the report. Ms Bellos, who was not called to give evidence by the inquiry, told the BBC: ""I should have known, there should have been transparency for the services that we were supposed to be giving to vulnerable children."" ""We clearly failed. I hold myself responsible for that failure,"" she added. Commander Alex Murray, from the Met Police, said: ""It is clear that at different times we missed opportunities to identify offenders and investigate further. Some of the treatment of children was also unacceptable."" He said the force had changed the way it investigated allegations of child sexual abuse, with better training for officers, greater collaboration between social care partners and ""putting the victim at the heart of the investigation"". The long-running IICSA is investigating claims against organisations including the church, local authorities and the armed forces. Its final report of overarching findings will be laid before Parliament next summer.

Nurse says 'red tape' a delay to increasing staff,"A nurse has spoken of her frustration at the ""red tape"" that she has said is preventing more staff from getting on to wards. The nurse, who wished to remain anonymous, has been waiting on the completion of pre-employment checks since being offered bank shifts with the South Eastern Trust in May. It follows a weekend when health trusts madeurgent appeals for off-duty staff. The trust said checks could sometimes be delayed for a number of reasons. The nurse said she just wanted to help out. ""I am at home reading these appeals and I could have been down helping,"" she told BBC News NI. ""It makes my blood boil that 12 weeks after interview I'm still in pre-employment checks when I could have been answering that call."" So-called nursing bank shifts are filled by trained nurses who are available to work flexibly and at short notice to complement the existing workforce. More than 70 nurses have been successfully interviewed for bank nursing shifts but have not been deployed A spokeswoman for the South Eastern Trust said checks were carried out as quickly as possible but could on occasion be delayed due to a variety of reasons. ""These may include candidates failing to return their documents in a timely manner, issues of concern arising from health and disclosure checks that require escalation and, most commonly, difficulty obtaining references for candidates,"" she said. ""Where delays do occur the trust and our colleagues in BSO Recruitment Shared Services Centre endeavour to make sure these are followed up on and actioned as soon as possible to avoid delays in candidates being able to take up posts."" Hospital pressures mount as Covid-19 ICU numbers rise Health trusts in appeal to off-duty staff Nurses 'reconsidering jobs' over physical abuse Figures obtained by BBC News NI show that 72 nurses have been successfully interviewed for bank nursing shifts but have not been deployed because paperwork has to be processed. In Belfast, 37 nurses were interviewed over the last 18 months but are awaiting the completion of checks. In the South Eastern Trust, 18 nurses are in a similar position. The Western Trust has two nurses affected while eight are still going through checks in the Northern Trust area. In the Southern Trust area there are seven nurses going through pre-employment checks. All five health trusts have also used agency nurses to fill thousands of shifts during the past year and a half, including Belfast (91,792) and Northern Trust (73,522). The Health Minister Robin Swann said although he understood the pressing need for more staff, he expected ""due diligence"" to be carried out for anyone going into a professional post. ""It's certainly something I'll be following up on with our service organisations and the trust as well, because we have seen a need for nurses across the system,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. ""I don't want to be doing anything that discourages anyone from coming forward to help us at this moment in time."" The nurse said that at some point ""the red tape has to go and a common sense approach taken"". ""I understand that due process has to be done and that the checks are there for patient and staff safety, but to wait six to 12 weeks to get into a clinical placement, when we constantly hear about staff shortages, does not make sense."" The nurse said there was a potential pool of nurses who are ""just dying to get on to the wards to work"". She added nurses had specifically done return to nursing courses. ""It's very frustrating especially when you hear about short staffing levels and appeals because people are absent, whether that's through retirement, long Covid, general sickness or isolating,"" she said. ""And then there are the waiting lists and you hear that A&Es are struggling to cope."" The Royal College of Nursing said recruitment delays are causing frustration The ""sudden spike in quite sick patients"" had taken trusts by surprise, according to Dr Paul Kerr from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. ""What we are witnessing is dreadful crowding in the emergency departments across Northern Ireland, there is lack of access to emergency beds for patients that need emergency admission,"" he told Good Morning Ulster. ""These are our most vulnerable patients with heart attacks, strokes, infections, traumas and emergency presentations like that. ""This is causing a risk to those patients and indeed a risk to the staff, Covid can indeed spread from patient to patient if these patients are crowded - if 30 or 40 or 50 of them perhaps are crowded in emergency departments, awaiting admission."" Some nurses and doctors were even leaving hospital work as a result of the ""dreadful conditions"", Dr Kerr said. At the weekend, the Belfast and South Eastern Trusts said rising admissions of Covid and non-Covid patients was putting them under significant pressure and issued appeals on social media. The Western Trust also contacted staff via email. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said recruitment delays were causing frustration. Rita Devlin, acting director of the RCN Northern Ireland, said the organisation was aware that members and managers were ""extremely frustrated"" at the length of time it takes to recruit staff into posts. She said the issue had been repeatedly raised with the Department of Health. ""These delays have an impact both on the staff waiting to be appointed and those working in areas within healthcare which are experiencing chronic staff shortages. Ultimately, this impacts upon the patients being cared for,"" Ms Devlin said. ""While we acknowledge the importance of robust checks and procedures, this process must be expedited to prevent further delays to the provision of much needed treatment and care."" Paula Bradshaw, the Alliance Party assembly member who sits on the Stormont health committee, said the situation was ""simply unacceptable"". ""At this stage of the pandemic... we need all the experience and expertise we can get working at the front line in the health service,"" she said. ""We have over the last 18 months recognised the nature of the emergency by implementing exceptional measures across healthcare, public services and in society in general. ""This needs to be recognised also when it comes to the essentials of ensuring our health and social care system has swift access to all the workers it needs, particularly those who are already qualified.""

Insurance threat for pinged holidaymakersSome travel insurance policies will not cover cancellation costs for travellers told to self-isolate.Business,"Covid has created hurdles for people wanting to travel overseas this summer A host of travel insurance policies will not cover cancellation costs if holidaymakers are told to self-isolate owing to a close Covid contact. Hundreds of thousands of people have been pinged recently by the NHS app or contacted by the tracing service. Analysts Defaqto said nine in 10 travel insurance policies cover the cost of cancelled holidays if the policyholder tests positive for Covid. But for cases of self-isolation, cover falls to fewer than six in 10 policies. More than 600,000 people told to isolate by app I want to book a foreign holiday, what are my rights? The practical effects of self-isolation requests - dubbed the pingdemic - have crossed work and home lives, and led to considerable political debate. Much of that has concentrated on people's ability to work safely,particularly in critical roles. There has also been concern among holidaymakers, desperate for a summer getaway, that their plans may be scuppered by contracting Covid or coming into close contact with someone who has the virus. The latest information from data specialists Defaqto, which analyses the insurance sector, found that 88% of single trip travel insurance policies on the market in the UK would pay out if a holiday was cancelled owing to a positive test. However, this drops to 56% if cancellation is owing to a self-isolation request. The figures are almost identical for annual policies. People who test positive for Covid are more likely to have insurance cover Anyone who receives notification from NHS Test and Trace is legally required to self-isolate, whereas a ping from the NHS app is advisory, but strongly recommends isolation. Anna-Marie Duthie, from Defaqto, said some insurers would be sympathetic to those required to self-isolate, so people in that situation should talk to their insurer about a claim. ""Policyholders should read their policies carefully to be sure they fully understand what cover they have, and if in doubt should contact their insurers before changing any travel plans,"" she said. The vast majority of people take out travel insurance policies for overseas trips, although there is also cover available for domestic travel.

The healthcare heroes vaccinating Scotland,"With four million first Covid vaccinations having been given, we speak to some of those who have helped make the programme work. An army of healthcare staff from across the NHS, as well as volunteers and retired professionals, stepped up to facilitate the biggest mass vaccination rollout the country has ever seen - and Sharon Smith is one of them. The 51-year-old is a health visitor who normally takes care of babies and new mums in Busby and Clarkston. When the vaccination programme was announced she signed up immediately to help give the jabs. Her team from East Renfrewshire health and social care partnership started to vaccinate the most vulnerable citizens living in care homes. The first jabs she gave are something she will never forget. ""My first vaccination was a home in Thornliebank. They made us so welcome. They were standing at the door waiting in a guard of honour and they cheered us in,"" she said. ""The ladies had had their hair done and a special chef had been brought in to make everyone's lunch afterwards. The men had put on shirts and ties. I was so emotional - all three nurses were in tears. ""The residents were excited about getting the vaccination so they could see their families again. Some had lost friends and more than one told me it had been worse than the war."" Sharon was a week into giving the vaccines when she realised she would actually be paid for working her days off.

She laughed: ""I genuinely thought I was doing my bit to get us out of this. My nursing instinct made me feel guilty I wasn't on the front line. This was my way to help."" The team made sure not a drop of vaccine was wasted. ""An NHS car would take me to NHS Louisa Jordan where, after strict security, I would pick up the vaccine at the pharmacy. It was in a big insulated box with strict instructions on when it was taken from the freezer. We were only allowed to open the box four times and it had to be used in six hours."" A list of health staff still to be vaccinated was kept at all times and the workers put on standby. ""We would call round and give them designated timeslots to meet us in car parks and care home back gardens. Everyone turned up and we vaccinated in the sun, the rain and the snow,"" Sharon said. ""I remember a poor man taking his shirt off in the snow to get his jab, then stand for 15 minutes in the freezing cold. But we got rid of every single dose."" There were sad moments too with care homes hit particularly hard by Covid. Sharon said: ""We went to one after the visit had been delayed due to an outbreak. When we got there we learned they had lost seven residents in one day. It was so sad but they were so grateful that we were there."" Kenneth MacArthur, 68, retired two years ago after 30 years as a renowned paediatric heart surgeon. He was head of congenital cardiac services at the Royal Hospital for Children in Glasgow. He rejoined the NHS to assist the vaccine rollout in Lanarkshire at the Alistair McCoist Centre in East Kilbride. At its height, he administered a vaccine every five minutes. He enjoyed being part of a team again and has had some nice surprises. ""In the early days of the vaccine I was based in a centre in Rutherglen,"" he said.""One girl who came through because she was in a vulnerable group was a patient I had operated on in the past. ""She recognised me and hailed me across the room, insisting I give her the vaccine. Her father came in another time to get his vaccine so he was telling me about her further operations and chatting away. I've operated on thousands of children and now they are adults."" He did home visits too and found those rewarding. ""When you see people in their own environment it is more emotional and you almost feel you are doing more good in that environment, because these are people who can't get out. ""A lot of people are scared of needles - I just use distraction therapy and get them to laugh. And the vast majority once they get it, say 'Was that it?'"" Rita Ciccu Moore, 61, was assistant director of nursing at NHS Forth Valley and was awarded the MBE in 2019 for services to nursing when she retired. When the pandemic kicked in, she didn't hesitate to go back. First she set up a Covid centre to help manage the response and streamline the vast amounts of information on the new virus coming into the health board every day. In August she got involved in the flu vaccine programme and when the Pfizer vaccine arrived, she set up the programme to vaccinate staff across the health board. Like Ken, her instincts told her to join the ""war effort"". She said: ""I absolutely felt I had to do my bit. We ran seven clinics a day, three days a week, with about 90 people coming to each clinic. ""In the beginning we were giving the Pfizer jab and I felt so responsible, that I couldn't waste a single drop of this precious vaccine."" Rita and a colleague on day one of vaccinating the Forth Valley workforce Rita said: ""I had to make sure we were not throwing any away. We ran around wards, into corridors, asking people if they'd had their vaccine and dragging them in. We focused on places like intensive care and the emergency department."" The highlight of Rita's experience was working with likeminded colleagues. She said: ""We joked saying we were Rita's retirees. A lot of us came back in to help but we were constantly learning - this was all completely new. ""There was an incredible sense of team spirit."" Hilary Warkentin, 29, is a senior staff nurse and immunisation lead in Forth Valley who kept the big vaccination centres running smoothly from the start of the programme until now. ""At the start we didn't know who would be given the vaccine. It turned out to be everyone and the team got bigger and bigger as the rollout progressed. Like all the vaccination staff who spoke to BBC News, Hilary was blown away by the feeling of hope. At one of her sites in Falkirk, a ""rainbow wall"" of Post-it notes was created from messages of gratitude. Hilary met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Hilary was rewarded for her hard work by being chosen to attend a drive-in movie screening by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. ""It was amazing,"" she said. ""Will and Kate came over to the car and spoke to us. The Duchess gave a speech to thank us."" Vince , right, with his friend Colin who both decided to volunteer as the pandemic hit Vince, 51, is an investment fund business analyst by day - by night and on his days off he is a volunteer for NHS Lothian. It was over an after-work pint just days before the first lockdown was called in March 2020 that he and his friend Colin decided to sign up as volunteers. He was an extra pair of hands in St Johns hospital in Livingston before joining the vaccine team. ""I was doing Thursday evenings and Saturday mornings. When the vaccine infrastructure was being put into place, I said I would work another night. ""Before the pandemic I used to travel into Edinburgh for one hour a day there and back - I won 10 hours a week back working from home, so I had more time to volunteer."" Vince has been managing arrivals, queues and check-ins at the vaccine centre at the Gyle in the capital. He said: ""You'd see people waving to their neighbours, they all knew each other and this was their chance to catch up after months inside during lockdown. ""We tot up the numbers at the end of the shift to see if we have set a new record. ""It's nice to feel part of an overall process. Let's hope we never go through this again but looking back we will know we did our bit."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? EASING:What rules are changing, and when?

Rita and a colleague on day one of vaccinating the Forth Valley workforce Rita said: ""I had to make sure we were not throwing any away. We ran around wards, into corridors, asking people if they'd had their vaccine and dragging them in. We focused on places like intensive care and the emergency department."" The highlight of Rita's experience was working with likeminded colleagues. She said: ""We joked saying we were Rita's retirees. A lot of us came back in to help but we were constantly learning - this was all completely new. ""There was an incredible sense of team spirit."" Hilary Warkentin, 29, is a senior staff nurse and immunisation lead in Forth Valley who kept the big vaccination centres running smoothly from the start of the programme until now. ""At the start we didn't know who would be given the vaccine. It turned out to be everyone and the team got bigger and bigger as the rollout progressed. Like all the vaccination staff who spoke to BBC News, Hilary was blown away by the feeling of hope. At one of her sites in Falkirk, a ""rainbow wall"" of Post-it notes was created from messages of gratitude. Hilary met the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Hilary was rewarded for her hard work by being chosen to attend a drive-in movie screening by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh. ""It was amazing,"" she said. ""Will and Kate came over to the car and spoke to us. The Duchess gave a speech to thank us."" Vince , right, with his friend Colin who both decided to volunteer as the pandemic hit Vince, 51, is an investment fund business analyst by day - by night and on his days off he is a volunteer for NHS Lothian. It was over an after-work pint just days before the first lockdown was called in March 2020 that he and his friend Colin decided to sign up as volunteers. He was an extra pair of hands in St Johns hospital in Livingston before joining the vaccine team. ""I was doing Thursday evenings and Saturday mornings. When the vaccine infrastructure was being put into place, I said I would work another night. ""Before the pandemic I used to travel into Edinburgh for one hour a day there and back - I won 10 hours a week back working from home, so I had more time to volunteer."" Vince has been managing arrivals, queues and check-ins at the vaccine centre at the Gyle in the capital. He said: ""You'd see people waving to their neighbours, they all knew each other and this was their chance to catch up after months inside during lockdown. ""We tot up the numbers at the end of the shift to see if we have set a new record. ""It's nice to feel part of an overall process.

Tom Dean claims gold and Duncan Scott silver in a thrilling 200m freestyle at the Tokyo Olympics.,"This video can not be played Tom Dean wins gold for Team GB with Duncan Scott clinching silver Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Tom Dean claimed a stunning gold and Duncan Scott silver to ensure a British one-two in a fast, closely-fought 200m freestyle at the Tokyo Olympics. Dean touched home in one minute 44.22 seconds, securing a British record in his debut Games. Scott finished just 0.04secs behind his team-mate, with Fernando Scheffer of Brazil taking bronze. It is the first time since 1908 that two male British swimmers have finished on the Olympic podium together. The 21-year-old Dean had a difficult build-up to Tokyo after twice contracting coronavirus in 2020, which at one stage left him unable to ""walk up the stairs without coughing and wheezing"". Unable to train for three weeks on each occasion, he told BBC Sport it had been a real setback ""physically and mentally"" prior to the Games. ""The three week build-up back to training had to be structured to prevent any long-term damage to my heart and lungs, so it was scary,"" he explained. ""It was upsetting because no-one takes six weeks off in the build-up to an Olympics. It was a real shock to the system."" Despite the disruption, he arrived at the Games as the second-fastest man in the year, behind Scott. ""When I was sitting in my flat in isolation, an Olympic gold seemed a million miles off,"" he said. ""It is a real honour. I watched the flag go up and the anthems be played, it is the stuff of dreams."" Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table Men's 200m freestyle - full results The two Britons high-fived before sharing a hug as their remarkable podium finishes were confirmed. Both swimmers looked shocked as they spoke to BBC Sport afterwards, with Scott describing it as an ""unbelievable moment"". The Scot was the favourite going into the race but Dean was able to back up his rapid start with a strong finish. Scott, who won European silver in May, said he was ""just buzzing for Deano"" as the two good friends allowed their victory to sink in. About 70 of Dean's family, former coaches and friends gathered in his mum's garden in Maidenhead to watch the race in the early hours, with a video of their celebrations going viral. ""I'm delighted. It feels surreal at the moment, it feels like it's a bit of a dream,"" Dean's mum Jacquie Hughes told BBC One. ""We decided, because we couldn't be there, how nice would it be for Tom to know his family and friends were together watching him.""We invited some members of the [swimming] club, some neighbours and before we knew it there were 70 people in the garden watching on a big screen. ""It was so joyous and full of passion. It was lovely. I spoke to Tom this morning and he said he watched the video over and over again."" This video can not be played Tom Dean: Swimmer's family and friends celebrate his 200m freestyle gold The British team - including Adam Peaty, who won ahistoric 100m breaststroke goldon Monday - cheered the two on from the stands, with several reduced to tears by the emotion of the moment. ""You can't describe that. When you have worked so hard, to share this medal moment with one of your best friends is an unbelievable feeling,"" two-time Olympic gold medallist Rebecca Adlington told BBC TV. ""Duncan will be slightly disappointed because he was the fastest and the favourite but, at the end of the day, you can tell that if anyone were to beat him, he would want it to be his team-mate."" It is the first time since 1908 that two British male swimmers have shared an Olympic podium Scott was quick to praise Dean, with the pair celebrating together on the podium as they received their Olympic medals. ""He has come on so far in the last 18 months and it is a pleasure to watch,"" Scott added. ""He is a good mate out of the pool and it is great to be able to compete against him."" Dean's triumph ensured Britain won their fourth gold medal of the games after Peaty, Tim Pidcock, and Tom Daly and Matty Lee's successes on 'Magic Monday'. He returned to the pool on Tuesday to anchor home the British Men's 4 x 200m freestyle team to a spot in Wednesday's final. Alongside Matthew Richards, James Guy and Calum Jarvis, the quartet finished ahead of Australia and the United States - and faster than Italy, who won the other heat. Elsewhere, Britain'sKathleen Dawsonfinished sixth in the 100m backstroke, while Freya Anderson missed out on qualifying for the 200m freestyle. BritonsAbbie WoodandAlicia Wilsonqualified for the 200m individual medley in second and eighth position respectively. And AmericanLydia Jacobywas the shock winner in the 100m breaststroke, forcing her team-mate and Rio 2016 champion Lilly King to settle for bronze. The 17-year-old had to move from Alaska - where there is no Olympic-length pool - to train and benefited from the Games being delayed by a year to allow her to develop.

Stein Connelly from Transport Scotland told theBBC's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""We are looking at a lot of surface water on the road network just now. The trunk roads are all open happy to say that and we'll do everything we can to maintain that as we get to the peak but we do ask people to be really careful as we're getting into the peak traffic. ""Leave yourself plenty of distance from the car in front and lower your speed, it can take twice as long to stop."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"House prices at new high as buyers seek more spaceStrong demand for houses will last into 2022 as buyers react to the pandemic, says property website Zoopla.","Surging demand for houses will last well into 2022 as buyers continue to look for more room after being cooped up during the pandemic, says property website Zoopla. A search for space has pushed up the average price of a house by 7.3% over the past year, reaching a new high of Â£230,700, it says. While houses are proving popular, flats are less sought after. But properties of all kinds are in short supply, the firm stressed. ""Demand for houses is twice as high as typically seen at this time of year between 2017 and 2019, accelerating away from demand for flats, creating a disparity in average price growth across the two property types,"" Zoopla said. ""House prices are being supported in part by a severe shortage of homes for sale, with stock levels down some 25% in the first half of the year compared to 2020."" The firm said that while house prices were surging, the growth in flat prices was lagging at 1.4% over the past year. House prices rise at fastest pace in 17 years People moving home drive mortgage borrowing surge Why house prices are rising so fast in a pandemic ""The rise in demand for houses is something we saw in the first lockdown,"" Grainne Gilmore, head of research at Zoopla, told the BBC. ""It's a reassessment among many homeowners of where they want to live."" Ms Gilmore said that with the rise of working from home, many people wanted a spare room that could become an office, while others were seeking garden space. ""A cohort of buyers has eroded the supply of family houses and put upward pressure on house prices more than flats over the past 12 months,"" she said. ""That's a situation that we would expect to continue into 2022."" ""We're still seeing very high levels of demand in the market, even now with more modest stamp duty savings,"" Ms Gilmore added. The price of the average UK house has jumped by 30% since 2007, when a typical house cost just Â£177,300, according to Zoopla. In June alone, house prices were up 5.4% year-on-year, although buyer demand dipped 9% in early July because of the stamp duty holiday coming to an end. Sales agreed this year are still 22% ahead of average levels in 2020. As people are taking the opportunity to move out of big cities, house prices have grown the most in Wales at 10.2% and the North East at 8.8%. House price growth is weakest in London at 5.6%. For flats, prices have risen the most in Scotland at 5.2% and the Midlands at 3.7%, but in London, flat prices have fallen by 0.5%. Zoopla said it was also seeing a jump in demand for properties in outer London, up 86% on 2017-19 levels. But the housing website said that it expected sales in London to improve, ""providing there are no further pandemic setbacks"", since the rental market had already bounced back. ""Further relaxation on the restrictions around global travel will result in a firmer pick-up in demand, which will also reverse the downward trend in pricing,"" Zoopla said.

"MPs want national register for the home-educatedThey say the government must ""get a grip"" on the number of children taught at home in England.Family & Education","Home-education groups say there is no basis for a government register A committee of MPs is calling for a national register of home-educated children in England, saying there is an ""unacceptable level of opaqueness"" surrounding the issue. The Commons Education Committee says it is important to ""get a grip"" on the number in home education. It says more data must be collected to ensure all children out of school get a suitable education. Home educators say this will increase families' lack of trust in the system. The MPs' report - Strengthening Home Education - says the government does not collect national figures for how many children are electively home-educated and parents do not have to register the fact with councils. Committee chair, Conservative MP Robert Halfon, said it was ""frankly astonishing"" that the government was only able to make a ""best guess"" over the standard of education children schooled at home were receiving. According toresearch by the BBC,published earlier this month, the number of children registering for home education in the UK rose by 75% in the first eight months of the current school year. It found more than 40,000 pupils were formally taken out of school in the UK between September 2020 and April 2021, compared with an average of 23,000 over the previous two years. The figures are based on Freedom of Information responses from 153 of the 205 county councils and unitary authorities in Great Britain, and all of Northern Ireland. The education select committee's report notes that it is likely the coronavirus pandemic has increased the number of families choosing to pursue home education. The MPs say some families in England face being forced into home schooling - partly due to a lack of support for children with special educational needs and disabilities. They say there must be assessment of progress in numeracy and literacy to ensure that those who are home-schooled are getting the same opportunities as their school-educated peers. The report also says the government should meet entry costs of exams for home-educated children to help them ""gain the qualifications needed for future education, training and employment, that will allow them to play active roles in society"". Committee chair Mr Halfon said: ""It is frankly astonishing that we are only able to make a best guess at the number of children being educated at home, particularly when the Department for Education itself concedes that there is considerable evidence that many young people are missing out on the teaching and support that they are entitled to. ""Some parents are providing their children with a high-quality educational experience, but those against greater oversight must realise that it does not follow that all home-educated children are in the same boat. ""Getting a grip on the number of young people not being taught in school with a national register for children outside of school must just be the first step in shaking up the status quo."" Mr Halfon added that local authorities must ""keep a much closer eye"" on how home-educated children were progressing, and that financial and practical support should be given to ensure home-educated children could take exams. Home-educated child numbers soar by 75% Covid fears prompt rise in home schooling But the group Education Otherwise said the select committee's inquiry into home schooling was prejudiced. Its chair, Wendy Charles-Warner, told the BBC: ""Yet again we have policy recommended on the basis of rhetoric and rumour, rather than evidence. ""Parents are deeply aggrieved that the huge majority of their submissions - which make clear that there is no basis, nor benefit, in registration of home-educated children - have been ignored, in what was manifestly a predetermined outcome of a deeply prejudiced inquiry. ""This report will serve to increase home-educating families' lack of trust in public bodies even further."" She added: ""The only valid and reasonable recommendation in this report is that home-educated children receive fair access to examinations, a point which should not need making."" Jennifer Skillen, who runs HE Special, an online national support group for parents home-educating children with special educational needs and disabilities, welcomed the call for more support and equal access to exams. But she said a lack of clarity about the exact numbers of families home-educating did not mean those children were not receiving an education. ""This negative assumption can influence the relationship between local authorities and families and should be avoided if the government wishes to build positive relationships,"" she said. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders' union NAHT, said the government must ""find out the reasons behind so many more families choosing home-education recently"". He added: ""NAHT has been calling for an official register of home-educated children for some time - the fact that there is no official source of data is a sign of how unsatisfactory the situation is.""

Final victim identified in Miami building collapseThe family of Estelle Hedaya say they have confirmation she is the 98th victim of the Surfside disaster.US & Canada,"Estelle Hedaya, from New York, worked for a jewellery company and lived on the building's sixth floor The family of the final victim unaccounted for in a deadly apartment block collapse in Florida say her remains have been found and identified. The discovery ends a weeks-long wait for the family of 54-year-old Estelle Hedaya, who had been missing since her building collapsed on 24 June. Her brother Ikey Hedaya told US media that local New York police delivered the news to their family on Monday. Her discovery brings the death toll in the collapse disaster to 98. Search teams spent weeks combing the rubble for victims but said on Friday that their search had finally ended. At that time, Estelle Hedaya was still unaccounted for. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said Monday that police volunteers were continuing to ""carefully and meticulously"" sift through millions of pounds of debris at a secondary site looking for remains and personal items. ""We have done everything possible to bring closure to the families and I am especially proud that through these tireless efforts we were able at last to bring closure to all those who reported missing loved ones,"" she told reporters. The number of people missing had initially been put as high as 159, but police brought that figure down after weeks of checking reports. Officials say the site where the 12-floor Champlain Towers South building once stood is being treated as a crime scene. What caused the 40-year-old building to fall to the ground remains unknown, but a2018 report had found structural problemswith the ocean-side block. All but one of those killed were recovered dead in the rubble, with one victim dying in hospital. CONTEXT:What we know about the Miami collapse victims EXPLAINER:A visual guide to Miami collapse A funeral is expected to take place for Estelle Hedaya in New York on Tuesday, the AP news agency reports. Her family and friends described her as outgoing and fun-loving and said she loved to travel and try new things, like salsa dancing. Other victims of the disaster include the seven-year-old daughter of a Miami firefighter, a 92-year-old grandmother and the sister of Paraguay's first lady.

Nurse says 'red tape' a delay to increasing staffIt follows a weekend when health trusts made urgent appeals for off-duty staff to return to work.Northern Ireland,"A nurse has spoken of her frustration at the ""red tape"" that she has said is preventing more staff from getting on to wards. The nurse, who wished to remain anonymous, has been waiting on the completion of pre-employment checks since being offered bank shifts with the South Eastern Trust in May. It follows a weekend when health trusts madeurgent appeals for off-duty staff. The trust said checks could sometimes be delayed for a number of reasons. The nurse said she just wanted to help out. ""I am at home reading these appeals and I could have been down helping,"" she told BBC News NI. ""It makes my blood boil that 12 weeks after interview I'm still in pre-employment checks when I could have been answering that call."" So-called nursing bank shifts are filled by trained nurses who are available to work flexibly and at short notice to complement the existing workforce. More than 70 nurses have been successfully interviewed for bank nursing shifts but have not been deployed A spokeswoman for the South Eastern Trust said checks were carried out as quickly as possible but could on occasion be delayed due to a variety of reasons. ""These may include candidates failing to return their documents in a timely manner, issues of concern arising from health and disclosure checks that require escalation and, most commonly, difficulty obtaining references for candidates,"" she said. ""Where delays do occur the trust and our colleagues in BSO Recruitment Shared Services Centre endeavour to make sure these are followed up on and actioned as soon as possible to avoid delays in candidates being able to take up posts."" Hospital pressures mount as Covid-19 ICU numbers rise Health trusts in appeal to off-duty staff Nurses 'reconsidering jobs' over physical abuse Figures obtained by BBC News NI show that 72 nurses have been successfully interviewed for bank nursing shifts but have not been deployed because paperwork has to be processed. In Belfast, 37 nurses were interviewed over the last 18 months but are awaiting the completion of checks. In the South Eastern Trust, 18 nurses are in a similar position. The Western Trust has two nurses affected while eight are still going through checks in the Northern Trust area. In the Southern Trust area there are seven nurses going through pre-employment checks. All five health trusts have also used agency nurses to fill thousands of shifts during the past year and a half, including Belfast (91,792) and Northern Trust (73,522). The Health Minister Robin Swann said although he understood the pressing need for more staff, he expected ""due diligence"" to be carried out for anyone going into a professional post. ""It's certainly something I'll be following up on with our service organisations and the trust as well, because we have seen a need for nurses across the system,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's The Nolan Show. ""I don't want to be doing anything that discourages anyone from coming forward to help us at this moment in time."" The nurse said that at some point ""the red tape has to go and a common sense approach taken"". ""I understand that due process has to be done and that the checks are there for patient and staff safety, but to wait six to 12 weeks to get into a clinical placement, when we constantly hear about staff shortages, does not make sense."" The nurse said there was a potential pool of nurses who are ""just dying to get on to the wards to work"". She added nurses had specifically done return to nursing courses. ""It's very frustrating especially when you hear about short staffing levels and appeals because people are absent, whether that's through retirement, long Covid, general sickness or isolating,"" she said. ""And then there are the waiting lists and you hear that A&Es are struggling to cope."" The Royal College of Nursing said recruitment delays are causing frustration The ""sudden spike in quite sick patients"" had taken trusts by surprise, according to Dr Paul Kerr from the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. ""What we are witnessing is dreadful crowding in the emergency departments across Northern Ireland, there is lack of access to emergency beds for patients that need emergency admission,"" he told Good Morning Ulster. ""These are our most vulnerable patients with heart attacks, strokes, infections, traumas and emergency presentations like that. ""This is causing a risk to those patients and indeed a risk to the staff, Covid can indeed spread from patient to patient if these patients are crowded - if 30 or 40 or 50 of them perhaps are crowded in emergency departments, awaiting admission."" Some nurses and doctors were even leaving hospital work as a result of the ""dreadful conditions"", Dr Kerr said. At the weekend, the Belfast and South Eastern Trusts said rising admissions of Covid and non-Covid patients was putting them under significant pressure and issued appeals on social media. The Western Trust also contacted staff via email. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said recruitment delays were causing frustration. Rita Devlin, acting director of the RCN Northern Ireland, said the organisation was aware that members and managers were ""extremely frustrated"" at the length of time it takes to recruit staff into posts. She said the issue had been repeatedly raised with the Department of Health. ""These delays have an impact both on the staff waiting to be appointed and those working in areas within healthcare which are experiencing chronic staff shortages. Ultimately, this impacts upon the patients being cared for,"" Ms Devlin said. ""While we acknowledge the importance of robust checks and procedures, this process must be expedited to prevent further delays to the provision of much needed treatment and care."" Paula Bradshaw, the Alliance Party assembly member who sits on the Stormont health committee, said the situation was ""simply unacceptable"". ""At this stage of the pandemic... we need all the experience and expertise we can get working at the front line in the health service,"" she said. ""We have over the last 18 months recognised the nature of the emergency by implementing exceptional measures across healthcare, public services and in society in general. ""This needs to be recognised also when it comes to the essentials of ensuring our health and social care system has swift access to all the workers it needs, particularly those who are already qualified.""

Executive agrees theatre and concert reopening,"The Northern Ireland Executive has agreed that theatres and concert venues can reopen from 18:00 on Tuesday. Ministers met earlier after delaying the decision, saying they wanted more information about risks. There have been other modest changes to Covid-19 restrictions, including an increase in the number of people who can meet indoors. Ten people from three households will also be allowed to meet inside a home. NI theatre and concert hall opening decision delay 'We've lost count of the performances postponed' What can I do as NI's Covid restrictions ease? As part of the move to allow theatres and concert venues to reopen, the executive has agreed live music will be permitted for rehearsals and performances with no restriction to background ambient levels of volume. Audience members must purchase tickets in advance, must have allocated seating and social distancing of 1m (3ft) will be required. Ãine McCarron, marketing officer at the Playhouse in Londonderry, said she was delighted by the news. ""It's music to my ears, I just can't believe it that we have finally been given the go ahead,"" Ms McCarron told BBC News NI. She said it was now important to ""build confidence among audience members who come through our doors"". ""We can very easily sit people 1m apart under our seating place and we can contract trace because we operate through a booking system already,"" she said. The Lyric Theatre will be operating at a third of overall capacity for Tuesday's production of Dracula Julie McKegney, head of customer services at the Lyric Theatre in Belfast, said the industry had ""been waiting for this news since March 2020"". The theatre will be operating at a third of its overall capacity for Tuesday's production of Dracula. Speaking to BBC Evening Extra, Ms McKegney said there would be requirements for guests to follow upon entry. ""They'll come in to the box office here that's behind perspex screens, where they'll be directed over to a sign-in point with their QR code - that's mandatory,"" she said. ""All venues have to take details of a person's first name, surname, a method of contact and a time and date of when they were in attendance for track and trace purposes."" However, Belfast singer-songwriter Sir Van Morrison, who has beenan outspoken critic of the Northern Ireland Executive's coronavirus restrictions,described Monday's announcement as ""shambolic"". Sir Van Morrison had to cancel a series of gigs in Belfast last month due to Covid-19 restrictions ""The announcement has come so late in the day that it's a kick in the teeth,"" Sir Van said. ""Cancelled concerts that were planned for this week could have gone ahead. ""Regrettably like many other sectors, there's been no advance warning, no plan or roadmap for the industry. ""Stormont have lost the confidence in the public and are clearly deaf to our industry when making decisions."" Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey welcomed the return of theatres and concerts. She said: ""I expect all venue promoters to have safety measures in place to ensure that staff and audiences are in a Covid safe environment. ""I believe that equality of access to the arts, be that through participation or as a member of the audience, is crucial and I look forward to attending a performance in the time ahead."" Ms Hargey said she will meet with the chairwoman of the Culture, Arts and Heritage Recovery Taskforce later in the week to discuss financial support for the sector. Ten people from three households will be allowed to meet inside a home, with children aged 12 and under not counting towards that total. Previously the rules permitted six people from two households to meet inside, with up to 10 people allowed if one household was bigger than six people. Ministers also agreed that people attending religious services will not have to wear face coverings during the service The Northern Ireland Executive also agreed that people attending religious services will not have to wear face coverings during the service. It will be guidance only to wear a covering. It will still be a legal requirement to masks when entering and exiting the building. Ministers will also strongly advise their use when singing or when moving around during services. This all amounts to another move towards life after lockdown - changes that will be very welcome in different parts of society. There will be relief in the arts sector - it means indoor plays, concerts and other performances can at last go ahead with restrictions. This is another step towards the life we all used to lead but in the background there is concern about the rising number of Covid cases. It is a day about change but there is still much caution in the air. Earlier on Monday other rules changed, including allowing 15 people from unlimited households to meet outdoors and close-contact services being allowed to operate without the need for pre-booked appointments. The executive will meet again on Thursday to consider other Covid-19 restrictions. It comes asanother 639 positive cases were reported by the Department of Health on Monday.

Shetland fires 'a warning to modular building industry'Two devastating fires involved buildings made from factory-built units brought up to islands by sea.,"This video can not be played The Moorfield Hotel has been extensively damaged by the fire Two devastating fires in Shetland should act as a warning to the modular building industry, it has been claimed. The world-famous Fair Isle Bird Observatory was lost in 2019, followed last year by the Moorfield Hotel. Both buildings were less than 10 years old and made from factory-built units, which had been shipped up to Shetland by sea. One expert has called for a full investigation into why the fires took hold so quickly. Both blazes were particularly severe, and fire crews were unable to stop the spread. No-one was injured in either incident. The observatory had no guests when it was destroyed in March 2019. Susannah and David Parnaby, who were its warden and administrator at the time, had been out when the fire started. Shetland hotel destroyed in overnight blaze Fire destroys Shetland bird observatory The wing of the observatory housing the flat where they lived for a decade was the last section to burn. ""I stayed until it was dark,"" Mrs Parnaby said. ""Where our flat was, that was the last wall to completely burn. I stayed till that point - you know, you've got to see it out, got to witness it, in a weird way."" The couple, who have two children, were made redundant earlier this year but have managed to stay on the island as crofters. The Moorfield Hotel had 70 occupants on the night it caught fire in July 2020. It was due to close a week later having lost its contract to house gas plant workers. Susannah and David Parnaby lost their home in the fire A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) investigation into the Fair Isle blaze was inconclusive, stating that the blaze was likely to have started in the roof space. The SFRS is still investigating the Moorfield Hotel fire, but police said their inquiry was finished, having found no suspicious circumstances. Modular construction is currently enjoying a boom. It is seen as cost-effective, quick and greener; the UK government wants 25% of new affordable homes to be modular. However, some experts are worried that there is also a fire risk and are pointing to the Shetland fires as a warning. Prefab has been around for some time, but stacking modules on top of each other is causing Ian Abley, a technical designer who works for the Fire Protection Association, some concern. Ian Abley said fire getting into the cavities between modules was a problem He writes guidance for insurers about modular buildings and has used one of the Shetland fires as an example in his latest report. ""For the Moorfield Hotel, it's a problem of the fire getting into the cavity between the modules,"" he explained. ""If it can travel from one compartment to another through unseen spaces within the compartment walls and floors, there's very little the fire brigade can do. ""If you're not very careful in the way you put it together there may be combustible materials in those cavities."" Both the hotel and the observatory had passed building standards approval. However, documents obtained via Freedom of Information show a case officer raised concerns about fire safety in the design stage of the Moorfield Hotel. BBC Scotland tracked down the man who made the notes. Stewart Douglas had been concerned at the possibility of fire spreading Stewart Douglas, who is now retired from Shetland Islands Council, identified his handwriting on the plans, and explained he had been concerned at the possibility of fire spreading from a bathroom into a service void. It was not the only issue he had with the design, but these must have been addressed, he said, or the building plans would not have been approved by the council. However, Mr Douglas, who worked in the industry for more than four decades, said sometimes in the construction trade the plans that are signed off do not always match what is built. Asked if the Moorfield Hotel plans matched what was built, he said he could not be 100% sure. ""The only way I could be sure about that is if I'd been on site on a very regular basis, if not daily,"" he said. ""It's not the building standards officer's role or duty to ensure that work's done properly. It's the building owner's responsibility."" Fair Isle Bird Observatory (pictured in the background) was built in 2010 Architect Malcolm Fraser also watched the Shetland fires closely. He works with Construction Scotland Innovation Centre on delivering timber modular buildings, such as the Fair Isle observatory. ""What an extraordinary piece of terrible luck that both the Moorfield and the observatory, as representing the new ways of building on the islands, have both gone on fire"", he said. He believes the investigations should be more wide-ranging, looking at the design of both buildings. ""Were there firebreaks? Did the firebreaks work? Were they installed correctly? And if so, why did the fire seem to have leapt past them? ""These are the obvious questions. ""If this is really the 'construction technology of the future' we need to find out why the fires took hold so quickly. We need the full investigations,"" he said. Fair Isle Bird Observatory was destroyed by fire in 2019 McAleer and Rushe, the contractor which built the Moorfield Hotel, denied any suggestion that there were issues with the construction quality. It said: ""Following the fire at Moorfield Hotel we provided the fire authority with all relevant documentation, including compliance certificates relating to the project, which was completed in 2013. Certificates supplied were compliant with regulations."" BDL Hotels, former owners of the Moorfield Hotel, said they welcomed any review of fire and life safety measures. ""The Moorfield Hotel was designed and built to ensure the safety of guests and staff at all times,"" a statement said. ""The hotel was built by a specialist hotel contractor to all relevant standards, approved by building control and independently inspected by the professional team during construction and at completion. ""The fire started on the top floor, and the fire spread externally along the flat roof behind the false pitched roof. The fire's location made it extremely difficult to reach without the use of aerial firefighting equipment. ""It is sad that despite the heroic efforts of the firefighters the building could not be saved."" Andrew H Wilson Electrical, the builder of the Fair Isle Bird Observatory, went into receivership in 2010. Fair Isle Bird Observatory Trust, the owners of the observatory, declined to comment. Fire safety expert Mr Abley wants assurances in the industry. He said: ""If the construction industry doesn't know how to do cavity construction that prevents fire from spreading from one floor to another, it needs to learn and fast.""

Tears on the podium for a dream come true - the story of Tom Daley,"Tom Daley in tears on top of the Olympic podium after achieving his ultimate goal. The young boy facing the camera spoke with a smile, but everyone could see the steeliness in his eyes. ""I want to get to the Olympics and win a gold medal,"" Tom Daley told the BBC in 2005. He was holding a picture he'd made - a drawing of himself doing a handstand on the 10m diving platform at the London Games, then still seven years away. ""If I wasn't to win, it would drive me on to be at the next Olympics and get that medal then."" Daley was just 11 when he stated that mission. Sixteen years later and his dream was finally achieved. He and Matty Lee secured ahistoric synchronised 10m platform Olympic title at Tokyo 2020. During the medal ceremony tears poured from his eyes at the enormity of it all. And what a journey it has been. This is the story of Tom Daley's path to gold medal glory. This video can not be played Tokyo Olympics: Tom Daley and Matty Lee take diving gold - highlights This achievement in Tokyo and others - including becoming world champion at 15 and twice winning Olympic bronze - owe much to a remarkable resolve that's also helped him overcome struggles away from the pool. Growing up, he was bullied at school. In 2011, his father died at the age of 40. He feared the consequences of revealing his sexuality before coming out in 2013. Daley is Britain's most decorated diver, but he possesses a level of fame that far transcends his discipline. He has become one of sport's highest-profile gay athletes, a role model for others in the LGBTQ+ community. He has suffered several media run-ins during the course of a life lived under the spotlight. Now aged 27 and a father himself, he says he finds it ""crazy"" to see how ""focused and obsessed"" he was as a child. ""If my son was talking like that at the same age, I'd be like 'wow, calm down, take your time, enjoy it,'"" he told BBC Sport. ""But clearly there was just something in me that wanted it so much."" Tokyo - his fourth Olympics - arguably represented his last realistic chance to claim it. While that same dream drove him today, parenthood and his partner helped give him a new perspective, on both triumph and trauma. ""I thought I was going to win an Olympic gold medal in Rio, and that turned out the complete opposite by a long shot,"" recalls the diver. ""It felt like the end of the world. ""Now my world and structure is my family and it was my husband who said to me that my story wasn't finished. ""Although we didn't know it at the time, my son (Robbie) needed to see me win an Olympic gold and the fact that I can say that my son watched me become Olympic champion - albeit on TV as they couldn't be here - is such a great feeling."" This video can not be played The Making of Tom Daley - from childhood star to father & husband Daley has always lived and breathed for the Olympics. He vividly recalls the efforts he went to, as an 11-year-old, to watch the men's synchronised 10m platform final during Athens 2004, when Leon Taylor and Pete Waterfield won silver for Britain. ""We were on holiday in our caravan and everyone was going to the kids' clubs but I was determined to stay in and watch the diving so I was leaning out of the window with the aerial to try to get a better signal,"" he recalls while laughing. Four years later, Daley was already gaining more attention than his ""idols"" ever had. He had qualified for Beijing 2008, aged 13, and cameras were trained on his every move. He didn't challenge for medals in China, but the crowd loved watching the young teenager - cheering on 'baby Daley' throughout the event. A star was born. But back home, it wasn't all easy. ""Some people at my school were so happy for me, but others started being really horrible and I was bullied,"" he says. ""For a long time, I just kept quiet about it, but I bottled up so much that eventually I just couldn't train and it drained me so much mentally until I had nothing left. ""It got to a point where I was always embarrassed to talk about diving and I couldn't take a compliment, because whenever someone said something nice, I had this fear I was going to be mocked."" It left Daley wanting to be home schooled. Instead he was offered the chance to join Plymouth College towards the end of his first year of GCSEs, a month before the 2009 World Championships. In Rome, the revitalised 15-year-old graduated from medal contender to fully grown champion. While his landmark performance in the 10m platform was striking, what happened in the hour after was perhaps even more memorable. Daley rolls his eyes, but also smiles, when recalling the now infamous press conference. Daley's 2009 World championship gold medal-winning post-event press conference was interrupted by his father Rob. ""I remember seeing my dad sneak in with a BBC journalist and he had this beaming smile,"" he recalls. ""He put his hand up and said: 'I'm Rob, Tom's dad, and I want a cuddle.' I remember thinking: 'Oh my god...'"" In the footage, Daley can be heard muttering ""dad, this is so embarrassing"" as he gingerly makes his way around the media scrum to his father - and another hoard of cameras. ""I remember him saying: 'Tom I took you to all of your training sessions, taught you to ride a bike, I changed your nappies when you were a kid.' He said it was the proudest moment of his life to see his son become world champion. ""When I look back, it was a very special moment as we'd achieved it together, and now as a father myself, I completely understand why he was so emotional."" What few knew then was that Rob had been diagnosed with a brain tumour in 2006 and he appreciated not only how special these moments were, but also how precious time with his son was. Months after Daley's success, the family learned that despite having surgery to remove 80% of the tumour three years earlier, Rob was no longer in remission. On Friday 27 May 2011, exactly 14 months before the London 2012 Olympics began, Rob died peacefully with his family by his side. ""In a way, if he hadn't had that brain tumour, we perhaps wouldn't have been as close. We developed this great connection,"" says Daley. ""The heartbreaking thing is that the last few days, all he was asking me about were: 'Have we got tickets for London 2012 yet? Did we win the ballots, are we able to get in?' ""He was so excited about being able to see me compete and it's surreal to think of all the things he's missed."" Grief impacts people in different ways and looking back now, more than a decade on, Daley believes he ""didn't handle it in the healthiest of ways"" at the time. ""My dad died on a Friday and I was at training on the Saturday morning, and then the funeral was on a Wednesday. I left the wake halfway through to travel and go compete at the national championships,"" he says with a shake of the head. ""Now looking back on it as an older athlete, there are more important things to life than diving, but then I knew the London Olympics was this big thing that my dad and I had always dreamed of, and there was all the motivation in the world to go be on the podium in 2012."" After the loss of his father, Daley took on new responsibility as the ""man of the house"" and helped his mum, Debbie, by driving his younger brothers to school and their rugby training. Heading into his home Games, there were constant media questions about his state of mind. Comments made by British Diving's performance director added further pressure. Alexei Evangulov demanded he lose weight and also publicly criticised the diver by suggesting he might become 'Britain's Anna Kournikova' - referencing the Russian former tennis player turned model whose sporting career was said to have been damaged by media distraction. Despite ""so much pressure"", Daley delivered a brilliant bronze, which effectively saved his sport by securing the squad funding for the four years leading into Rio 2016. ""Looking back I sometimes wonder: 'Was that my time? Could it have been gold?' But there are so few people who get to become an Olympian, let alone an Olympic medallist, and to have won a bronze in front of a home crowd, I have to be proud,"" he says. Daley won bronze at 2012 Olympics and celebrated with fans at the Team GB parade in London Daley paid tribute to his father in his post-event interviews, but only finally allowed himself to fully grieve in the months following. ""It all hit me after the Olympics. There was this massive crash,"" he says. ""I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life any more, as London 2012 was all I'd had in my book - and for a few months I actually quit diving."" At this time, Daley was seeing a therapist in an attempt to overcome the ""terror"" he was experiencing when performing his 'twister' dive. A real fear had developed since camera flashes forced him to request a re-dive while performing the routine in the Olympic final. He was also plagued by a persistent triceps injury tear, frustrated by 'fake news' stories in the press about his purchasing habits and was aware that certain people were keen to 'out' him at a time when he was still processing thoughts about his sexuality. Aged 19, Daley returned to compete at the 2013 World Championships in Barcelona, re-tore his triceps, finished sixth and then took a trip to Los Angeles. It changed his life. Daley with his son Robbie and husband Dustin Lance Black - they were married in 2017 ""The difficult thing I found growing up was that there are so many conflicting thoughts and feelings, and I had to live all of that out in the public eye,"" he says. ""Figuring out your sexuality is quite difficult in any way, let alone doing it under constant scrutiny and people asking constant questions and trying to figure out things."" Daley met his now husband, the Oscar-winning screenwriter and producer Dustin Lance Black, while in the United States. A ""huge weight"" was soon lifted off his shoulders. ""Meeting Lance and then coming out in 2013 changed everything,"" he says. ""It allowed me to stop worrying, stop being scared and to just be me."" Following a move to London, and with Jane Figueiredo as his new coach, the medals began to flow once more. A third career Commonwealth gold at Glasgow 2014 was followed by a team title as well as individual bronze at the 2015 Worlds. In 2016, Daley entered what he felt would be his ""peak Olympics"" in Rio as one of the gold medal favourites. He warmed up for his individual event with an impressive bronze alongside new synchronised 10m partner Dan Goodfellow. Before he competed again, team-mates Jack Laugher and Chris Mears made history by becoming Britain's first-ever Olympic diving champions - with Laugher also adding an individual 3m silver. ""When Jack and Chris won Olympic gold medal, I was like 'OMG that is my biggest dream' so I didn't get my escape strategy right and I had no mental break from everything that was going on,"" Daley says. ""After Jack won the silver, I was like, right this is my time now!"" Daley had scored a personal best of 571.85 in the preliminary round of the 10m platform but could only manage a score of 403.25 in the Rio 2016 semi-final Despite setting a new Olympic record total of 571.85 in the preliminaries, later that day the diving world was left stunned as Daley failed to reach a major final for the first time in his career. Five years on, he's still unable to explain exactly what happened. ""My nervous system, erm, my mind and body connect wasn't, erm, there,"" Daley says, uncharacteristically flustered as he watches back footage from the event for the first time. ""I've kind of blanked this out and there's still no sense in it. Sometimes I think maybe I should have stayed in the ice bath longer, or had a recovery drink at a different time, but sometimes you just have to say it was a bad day."" In the post-event interviews, he tearfully vowed to return for the Tokyo Games. But redemption of a sort would come far sooner - 12 months later, he delivered arguably the greatest performance of his career so far to secure a first individual world title since 2009. The following year, at the 2018 Commonwealth Games, he used the platform victory gave him to speak out on issues beyond sport. Inspired by his husband's activism around LGBTQ+ issues and campaigns, he called on Commonwealth countries to decriminalise homosexuality, stating that it was illegal for athletes competing in 37 of the 53 nations at the Games (70%) to be in a relationship with someone of the same sex. ""We have to talk about these things and shine a light on them in order to get change,"" he says now. This video can not be played Homophobia is massive in sport - Daley Daley struggled with pneumonia, concussion and a stress fracture that year. He contemplated his future in diving, but the arrival of son Robbie revitalised him. ""Back in 2016, it felt like the end of the world,"" he says. ""Now I wish I could go back and tell myself: 'You're going to get married, have a beautiful son and things are going to get much better.'"" However, now 27, the daily impact of throwing his body from 10m and hitting the water at 35mph has undeniably taken its toll. Having once been the 'baby' of the team, Daley now describes himself as the ""grandad"". The five-time European champion has taken up mindfulness, yoga and gyrotonics in a bid to prolong his career, which has been extended by at least 12 months by the coronavirus pandemic. ""I knew going into Rio that if I'd won the Olympic gold medal it would have been my last dive,"" states Daley, who will compete individually as well as alongside new synchronised partner Matty Lee in Tokyo. Now though he is ""almost relieved"" to have had five extra ""bonus"" years in the sport and arrived in Japan ""mentally stronger"" than at any point in his life. So, to Tokyo. Daley had long spoken about preferring to face dominant Chinese rivals in outdoor venues where the sun, wind, fluctuating crowd noises add variables to competition. The indoor spectator-less Tokyo Olympic Aquatics Centre was seen as the perfect setting for the East Asian athletes to dominate with their style which he has previously described as ""almost robotic."" As expected, the defending Olympic and current world champions Chen Aisen and Cao Yuan began the synchronised 10m final strongly and looked to be going clear of their rivals at the halfway stage. Daley curled his lip as the scoreboard revealed the situation. They had been good, but not good enough for gold. He and Lee shared a brief look and nodded. They knew they had more to give. A brilliant dive followed in the fourth round and the British pair edged to within a point of their rivals with their penultimate routine. Daley and Lee produced their greatest dive - 101.01 - in the final round. 2004 Olympic silver medallists Leon Taylor, who mentored Daley earlier in his career, erupted with excitement on commentary, calling the gold for Britain - before pausing and realising that while a high three-digit score was improbable, it wasn't impossible from the Chinese. Daley was nervous. The traditionally measured, calm and 'in control' diver had disappeared and, in his place, stood a man with little composure who was fidgeting. He was anxious, jumping like a worried child. He'd been here before, waiting for judges to decide his fate - but this time was different. It was likely to be his last chance for gold. Moments later as the Chinese total was revealed, Daley leapt on to partner Lee and the tears began to flow. Not just from Daley though, but most of his team-mates, coaches and the Team GB support staff were all wiping their eyes. ""I've been diving for 20 years now and I honestly still can't believe what's happened,"" he told me moments after receiving the medal he has craved since childhood. This was a victory for two British divers and a first-ever Olympic title for the nation in the synchronised 10m event. But it was also much more. Matty Lee and Daley handled nerves and pressure in their final two routines at Tokyo 2020 to win gold It was also the completion of a journey he began with his late father over two decades ago. It was also a statement about the importance of inclusion and overcoming adversity. ""When I was a little boy, I felt like an outsider and different,"" began Daley. ""I felt I was never going to be anything because who I was wasn't what society wanted me to be. ""I hope that seeing LGBT people performing at the Olympic Games gives young kids belief and means they won't feel so frightened, scared and alone. ""Whoever you are, no matter where you come from, you can become an Olympic champion - because I did it.""

How the Taliban retook half of Afghanistan,"The Taliban have taken control of Afghanistan, almost 20 years after being ousted by a US-led military coalition. Emboldened by the withdrawal of US troops, they now control all key cities in the country, including Kabul. Who are the Taliban? The Taliban took some areas from government by force. In other areas, the Afghan National Army withdrew without a shot being fired. Although renewed clashes had been going on for several weeks, from 6 August the Taliban made a more rapid advance across the country, as they took control of provincial cities. The maps below start in early July and show the 400 or so government districts as they fell to the Taliban. Source: BBC research. Districts are 2005 government boundaries Ten days that shook Afghanistan US forces based outside Afghanistan had launched air strikes against Taliban positions earlier last week, but they failed to slow the advance of the insurgents. Although most US troops left in July, several thousand returned to Kabul at the weekend to help evacuate American and allied personnel from the capital. The airport in the capital was the only official route out of the country after the Taliban took control of all the major border crossings. Customs duty on goods entering the country via crossings they control is now collected by the Taliban - although exact amounts are unclear as the volume of trade has fallen as a result of the fighting. But, Islam Qala on the border with Iran was, for example, capable of generating more than $20 million per month. Disruption to the flow of imports and exports has affected prices of essential goods in the markets - fuel and foodstuffs in particular. US troops and their Nato and regional allies forced the Taliban from power in November 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US. But despite a continued international presence in the region, billions of dollars of support and training for the Afghan government forces, the Taliban regrouped and gradually regained strength in more remote areas. A  BBC study in 2017 showed the Taliban were in full control of a number of districts. But the research also showed they were active in many other parts of the country, mounting weekly or monthly attacks in some areas, suggesting significantly higher strength than previous estimates. In 2017 about 15 million people - half the population - were reported to be living in areas either controlled by the Taliban or where the Taliban were openly present.

GB's Dean takes gold & Scott silver,"This video can not be played Tom Dean wins gold for Team GB with Duncan Scott clinching silver Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Tom Dean claimed a stunning gold and Duncan Scott silver to ensure a British one-two in a fast, closely-fought 200m freestyle at the Tokyo Olympics. Dean touched home in one minute 44.22 seconds, securing a British record in his debut Games. Scott finished just 0.04secs behind his team-mate, with Fernando Scheffer of Brazil taking bronze. It is the first time since 1908 that two male British swimmers have finished on the Olympic podium together. The 21-year-old Dean had a difficult build-up to Tokyo after twice contracting coronavirus in 2020, which at one stage left him unable to ""walk up the stairs without coughing and wheezing"". Unable to train for three weeks on each occasion, he told BBC Sport it had been a real setback ""physically and mentally"" prior to the Games. ""The three week build-up back to training had to be structured to prevent any long-term damage to my heart and lungs, so it was scary,"" he explained. ""It was upsetting because no-one takes six weeks off in the build-up to an Olympics. It was a real shock to the system."" Despite the disruption, he arrived at the Games as the second-fastest man in the year, behind Scott. ""When I was sitting in my flat in isolation, an Olympic gold seemed a million miles off,"" he said. ""It is a real honour. I watched the flag go up and the anthems be played, it is the stuff of dreams."" Day-by-day guide to the Games Times and channels for BBC's live coverage Listen to the latest Olympics Daily podcast Tokyo 2020 medal table Men's 200m freestyle - full results The two Britons high-fived before sharing a hug as their remarkable podium finishes were confirmed. Both swimmers looked shocked as they spoke to BBC Sport afterwards, with Scott describing it as an ""unbelievable moment"". The Scot was the favourite going into the race but Dean was able to back up his rapid start with a strong finish. Scott, who won European silver in May, said he was ""just buzzing for Deano"" as the two good friends allowed their victory to sink in. About 70 of Dean's family, former coaches and friends gathered in his mum's garden in Maidenhead to watch the race in the early hours, with a video of their celebrations going viral. ""I'm delighted. It feels surreal at the moment, it feels like it's a bit of a dream,"" Dean's mum Jacquie Hughes told BBC One. ""We decided, because we couldn't be there, how nice would it be for Tom to know his family and friends were together watching him.""We invited some members of the [swimming] club, some neighbours and before we knew it there were 70 people in the garden watching on a big screen. ""It was so joyous and full of passion. It was lovely. I spoke to Tom this morning and he said he watched the video over and over again."" This video can not be played Tom Dean: Swimmer's family and friends celebrate his 200m freestyle gold The British team - including Adam Peaty, who won ahistoric 100m breaststroke goldon Monday - cheered the two on from the stands, with several reduced to tears by the emotion of the moment. ""You can't describe that. When you have worked so hard, to share this medal moment with one of your best friends is an unbelievable feeling,"" two-time Olympic gold medallist Rebecca Adlington told BBC TV. ""Duncan will be slightly disappointed because he was the fastest and the favourite but, at the end of the day, you can tell that if anyone were to beat him, he would want it to be his team-mate."" It is the first time since 1908 that two British male swimmers have shared an Olympic podium Scott was quick to praise Dean, with the pair celebrating together on the podium as they received their Olympic medals. ""He has come on so far in the last 18 months and it is a pleasure to watch,"" Scott added. ""He is a good mate out of the pool and it is great to be able to compete against him."" Dean's triumph ensured Britain won their fourth gold medal of the games after Peaty, Tim Pidcock, and Tom Daly and Matty Lee's successes on 'Magic Monday'. He returned to the pool on Tuesday to anchor home the British Men's 4 x 200m freestyle team to a spot in Wednesday's final. Alongside Matthew Richards, James Guy and Calum Jarvis, the quartet finished ahead of Australia and the United States - and faster than Italy, who won the other heat. Elsewhere, Britain'sKathleen Dawsonfinished sixth in the 100m backstroke, while Freya Anderson missed out on qualifying for the 200m freestyle. BritonsAbbie WoodandAlicia Wilsonqualified for the 200m individual medley in second and eighth position respectively. And AmericanLydia Jacobywas the shock winner in the 100m breaststroke, forcing her team-mate and Rio 2016 champion Lilly King to settle for bronze. The 17-year-old had to move from Alaska - where there is no Olympic-length pool - to train and benefited from the Games being delayed by a year to allow her to develop.

The wonder of double Olympic champion Peaty,"This video can not be played Adam Peaty: Team GB star wins 100m breaststroke gold at Tokyo Olympics Tokyo Olympic Games on the BBC Dates:23 July-8 AugustTime in Tokyo:BST +8 Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; Listen on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and Sounds; live text and video clips on BBC Sport website and app. Two Olympic gold medals. Not bad for someone once terrified of water in case a shark came up the plughole. ""Adam Peaty"" and ""makes history"" are four words so often found in the same sentence - and they were written over and over again on Monday as he became thefirst British swimmer to defend an Olympic title. It was inevitable, really. Whispered before 03:13 BST on Monday but shouted thereafter, the 100m breaststroke title was only ever going to be Peaty's. He now owns the 16 quickest times - this race the fifth fastest - over the distance in history, and is the only swimmer ever to dip under 57 seconds with his 2019 world record. Over the two lengths, he is unbeaten since 2014, a astounding run encompassing three world, four European and two Commonwealth titles - and now double Olympic gold. ""It's a big relief, I guess. I put it simply: if you were looking for a promotion and you'd been working your arse off for five years to get that promotion and you've got to prove yourself within 57 seconds, it's almost like that,"" he said. ""Under that pressure, a lot of people could fold. ""I've shown time and time again I can perform when it matters and get faster through the rounds. That's what I do."" It is what he does now - but Peaty hasn't always been such a beast in the water. When he was just 14, his front crawl was so off the mark that his coach, Mel Marshall, sent him to the slow lane. His breaststroke, however, was a different story. ""Like a JCB eating up the water,"" she told theTelegraph.,external That JCB digger was in top gear on Monday. The final's morning berth meant his world record was unlikely to be threatened, his 57.37 time half a second slower than his best. But it was still six tenths ahead of the rest of the field, with Dutch silver medallist Arno Kamminga - the only man other than Peaty ever to go under 58 seconds - still some way off challenging him for gold. ""I have so much respect for him,"" Kamminga said. ""He's been pushing breaststroke for years now and he really set a new standard. ""If you really watch his stroke he's so perfect in the small details, and that's really pushing me in practice as well as competition to strive for perfection."" Double Olympic gold medallist Rebecca Adlington said: ""He is just phenomenal. We aren't going to see many Adam Peatys in my lifetime."" As he climbed on to the lane rope, as he did in Rio five years ago, the weight of expectation visibly lifted off his shoulders. He let out a roar the lion on his arm would be proud of and his post-race interview was expletive-laden, but after placing the medal around his own neck - necessary in these times - he let out the biggest puff of breath. The build-up to these Games had not been the easiest. The year's delay amid the Covid-19 pandemic led to him installing a flume pool in his garden because facilities were shut. But make no mistake, every moment had been worth it. ""These past 18 months, every single day has almost been in the dark. Covid has taken a lot of fun out of things,"" said the 26-year-old. ""If you put it into a percentage, 99.5% or 99.9% you spend in the dark searching for a bit of light. But 0.1% was that performance there. That's why I put that amount of investment into what I do."" This video can not be played Adam Peaty meets BBC Radio 1's Reece Parkinson That investment hasn't been without sacrifice. Peaty became a father in September when his partner, Eiri Munro, gave birth to their son, George. It provided him with a new perspective on life and a focus away from the pool, but even more motivation to achieve. ""Being a father, all that emotional energy - I just can't think straight of how much I've done it for them,"" said Peaty. ""I can look him in the eye and say all that time I had to go training and leave him, and all that time I had to leave her in difficult situations, it's all been worth it."" Back home in the early hours on Monday, his little boy was watching his daddy do what he does best. Any routine his parents had him in was thrown out of the window as George sat with his mum to watch, ""very confused as to what was going on"" but excited all the same. ""It was amazing. It's going to be something we will remember for the rest of our lives,"" Munro told the BBC's Olympic Breakfast. ""It means everything."" Back in Uttoxeter, where Peaty was born and raised, his parents, Mark and Caroline, were also watching (on an alternative channel, but we'll let that slide...). His mum had set her alarm for 02:30, waking ""feeling sick and nervous"". While the Peaty household is usually a noisy one, this time there was silence. ""Both of us knew it was going to be close and both of us were really quiet,"" she said. ""I was pushing myself back into the sofa because I was petrified."" Peaty will come home with one medal - maybe more from the relay events - but his mum is glad one thing won't be returning: the moustache he shaved off after the heats. Munro loved it. But Peaty's mum ""wasn't a fan at all"". Moustache lost, Olympic gold gained, there's no doubt still plenty to come from Peaty. But when the end arrives, whenever that may be, he won't finish his career with a medal collection so bumper as those owned by Michael Phelps, or athletics' Usain Bolt. It doesn't matter, though, because that has never been an aim. What he craves is immortality; to retire with a swim so good it will never be beaten. Bet against him if you dare.
