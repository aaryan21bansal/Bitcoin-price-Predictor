Yemen rebels fire missile at Riyadh,"The Houthi movement unveiled the Burkan 2 missile in February 2017 The Saudi-led coalition battling Yemen's Houthi rebels says it has intercepted a missile over Riyadh. The Houthis' Al Masirah TV reported that a Burkan H2 ballistic missile had targeted a meeting at the al-Yamama Palace in the Saudi capital. Witnesses said they heard an explosion and posted pictures online showing a cloud of smoke in the air. There were no reports of any damage or casualties. The coalition accused Iran of supplying the Houthis with the missile. Iran has denied arming the rebels, who have been fighting a war against Yemen's government and the Saudi-led coalition since March 2015. A report on Al Masirah's website cited the Houthis' Missile Forces as announcing the launch of a Burkan H2 missile on Tuesday ""in response to the heinous crimes committed by the US-Saudi aggression against the people of Yemen"". The missile had targeted a ""meeting of the leadership of the Saudi regime in al-Yamama Palace in Riyadh"", during which Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was expected to discuss the kingdom's annual budget, Al Masirah said. The palace is the main headquarters of the king's office and the royal court. Minutes later, Saudi state-run Al Ikhbariya TV reported that a missile had been intercepted south of the capital. One video posted by a man who said he was in the Olaya district shows a white cloud above the city. The sound of an explosion can then be heard. Coalition spokesman Col Turki al-Maliki said the missile had been ""indiscriminately launched towards Riyadh to target the civilian and populated areas"",external, according to the official Saudi Press Agency. It was intercepted by a Patriot missile south of the city, he added. Col Maliki said the attack proved the ""continued involvement of the Iranian regime in supporting the Houthi armed group with qualitative capabilities in clear and blatant defiance"" of two UN Security Council resolutions with the aim of threatening regional and international security. Firing missiles towards populated areas was against international law, he added. Another Burkan H2 came close to hitting Riyadh's King Khalid International Airport on 4 November. Saudi officials said US-supplied Patriot batteries had also intercepted the missile in flight.But analysts have since cast doubt on that assertion,externaland said the missile's warhead landed close to the domestic terminal. The US put on display remnants of the missile fired towards Riyadh last month The US, which backs the coalition's military campaign in Yemen, on Thursday presented what it said was ""undeniable"" evidence that Iran had made the missile. Standing in front of the remnants of the projectile, permanent representative to the UNNikki Haley said it bore a close resemblance to an Iranian-made Qiam ballistic missile,external. Both lacked large stabiliser fins, included nine valves running along their lengths, and were stamped with the logo of an Iranian manufacturer, she added. Iran 'supplied missile to Yemen rebels' Saudis accuse Iran of 'direct aggression' Saudi Arabia intervened in its neighbour's civil war partly to counter perceived Iranian influence on the Houthis, which champion the Zaidi Shia minority. Iran has denied backing the rebels militarily and insisted that the missile launches are ""independent actions"" in response to Saudi-led coalition aggression. The Houthis are fighting a war against Yemen's government and the Saudi-led coalition A spokesman for Iran's mission to the UN, Alireza Miryousefi, rejected Ms Haley's allegations last week as ""unfounded and, at the same time, irresponsible, provocative and destructive"". Yemen: Finding near-famine - and lots of food Who is fighting whom? The coalition tightened its blockade of Yemen in response to November's missile launch, saying it wanted to halt the smuggling of weapons. But the UN warned that the restrictions could trigger ""the largest famine the world has seen for many decades"". Although the coalition later eased its restrictions, allowing humanitarian aid to be delivered to Houthi-controlled ports and airports, most commercial shipments are still blocked, causing severe shortages of food and fuel. This video can not be played The BBC's Clive Myrie reports from one hospital on the brink of running out of fuel The Saudi-led coalition has also continued to conduct air strikes on rebel-held areas. Such raids have killed at least 136 civilians and non-combatants since 6 December,  a UN human rights official said on Tuesday. More than 8,670 people have been killed and 49,960 injured since the coalition intervened in Yemen's war, according to the UN. The fighting and the coalition blockade have also left 20.7 million people in need of humanitarian aid, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is thought to have killed 2,219 people since April.

Couple forced to separate after 70 years,"Herbert and Audrey Goodine say goodbye for the first time in 73 years An elderly Canadian man and wife are heartbroken after learning that they will be separated for the first time in seven decades a week before Christmas. Herbert Goodine, 91, was told he must leave the long-term care facility where he lives with his wife Audrey Goodine, 89, and move into a nursing home. The facility in Perth-Andover, New Brunswick, told the couple on Friday that he must move that weekend. Their story has sparked outrage across the country. ""When talking to my parents yesterday I listened to my mother weep and I could hear my father in the background,"" their daughter Dianne Phillips wrote on Facebook on Sunday. ""My mother said, 'Christmas is over for us now and this is the worst Christmas that we will ever have. Why could they not have waited till after the holidays?'"" Mrs Phillips' post,externalhas since been shared 15,000 times. Mrs Phillips said she received a call on Friday from the provincial department that oversees long-term care saying that her father, whose health has declined recently, would have to be moved to a home with more advanced care. She says that when she was not immediately able to make a decision, the department ""forced them to make the decision on their own."" Allow Twitter content?

Contaminated blood report 'full of lies',"Carol Grayson's husband, Peter, died after contracting hepatitis C and HIV from infected blood products Government officials have apologised for using a discredited report into the contaminated blood products scandal that left thousands of NHS patients infected with viruses including HIV. Despite assurances that the ""inadequate"" document would be ditched, a health minister has referred to it this year, the BBC can reveal. The government admits that the document was used for too long. This week it will announce who will run its official inquiry into the scandal. Critics say the whole process has taken far too long and have accused the government of a ""whitewash"". Campaigners have always said that the 2006 report - originally billed by the government as an official account of how the scandal unfolded - was misleading and incomplete because original documents had been destroyed. It has been called the worst treatment disaster in the history of the NHS. At least 2,400 people died after they were given blood products that were infected with hepatitis C and HIV during the 70s and 80s. Thousands of NHS patients with an inherited bleeding disorder called haemophilia were given the plasma products, which came from abroad, including the US. Much of the plasma used to make the clotting treatment Factor VIII came from donors like prison inmates in the US, who sold their blood. Carol Grayson's husband, Peter, was one of the victims who died. She says campaigners have challenged the Department of Health over its investigations for more than a decade. She told BBC News: ""I had to give my career up to care for my husband for many years and I didn't have my own children because at the time I wanted to conceive, I was told I might infect the child and the advice at the time was, don't have children. So there are huge implications for families. It doesn't just impact on one person, it impacts on the whole family. ""I go from being absolutely furious and thinking everything I was brought up to believe in, you know about democracy, about justice is a lie."" In July, the prime minister ordered the Cabinet Office to oversee the independent investigation into how the scandal happened, after family members warned that the involvement of the Department of Health would mean it would be, in effect, investigating itself. The BBC has now seen a series of letters from ministers and civil servants, accepting that the 2006 report (Self-Sufficiency in Blood Products in England and Wales) previously seen within Whitehall as a ""definitive account"", was inadequate. Sir Chris Wormald, permanent secretary at the Department of Health, wrote to Liberal Democrat peer Lady Featherstone in August assuring her that the document ""has not been used by officials in recent yearsâ¦ and it will not be used in the future"". But the BBC has also seen a letter written by health minister Lord O'Shaughnessy to another MP in January this year, which referenced the report and its conclusions. When this was brought to Sir Chris's attention, he apologised, and said there were ""some instances in recent years where the department had referred to the document"" and reiterated the assurance that the document would be taken out of use. Lady Featherstone told the BBC that civil servants promised to make clear online that the document had been discredited, but this was not yet apparent. The peer, whose own nephew died from an infection from contaminated blood products, said: ""That document is full of holes, and lies, and mistruths, and lines to take, and I went to the Department of Health to challenge the use of this document. ""I think the permanent secretary was quite genuine in his desire - he saw that the evidence proved that they couldn't use the document - and he wrote to me to assure me that this document was not being used any longer, had not been used in recent years and would never be used again in the future. ""It indicated to me that they knew it was wrong, that they must have acknowledged it was telling untruths."" A Department of Health spokesperson said: ""The 2006 document, Self-Sufficiency in Blood Products in England and Wales: A Chronology from 1973 to 1991, remained in use by the department for too long.  It is no longer used. ""The infected blood scandal of the 1970s and 80s is an appalling tragedy and the government has announced an independent statutory inquiry to ensure that victims and their families finally get the answers they have spent decades waiting for.""

Republican tax bill faces final vote,"This video can not be played US tax bill: the winners and losers The Republican-controlled Congress is expected to confirm the most sweeping overhaul of the US tax system in more than three decades. The House of Representatives approved the legislation comfortably on Tuesday, but the vote is likely to be closer in the Senate. The bill looks set to mark the party's first major legislative triumph under President Donald Trump. Critics say the package is a deficit-bloating giveaway to the super-rich. But Republicans argue the tax cuts for corporations, small businesses and individuals will bolster economic growth. Tuesday saw 12 Republicans and all Democratic members of the House oppose the bill, which passed by 227 votes to 203, to loud cheers and applause from Republicans in the chamber. Speaker Paul Ryan said: ""Today we are giving the people of this country their money back. This is their money after all!"" However, the House will have to vote again on Wednesday morning for procedural reasons, ahead of the planned signing into law of the bill by Mr Trump. The bill - described by the president as a ""Christmas gift"" for the country and by Democratic congresswoman Barbara Lee as ""a slap in the face to low- and middle-income families"" - permanently cuts the tax rate for corporations from 35% to 21%. It reduces the tax share paid by the wealthiest Americans, while awarding more modest reductions for most other income brackets. This video can not be played Paul Ryan's exuberant gavelling reflects how long he's pushed for tax reform Other key elements include: Lower individual tax rates, albeit temporarily Less inheritance tax An expanded child tax credit Lower taxes on overseas profits The legislation would add as much as $1.4tn (Â£1tn) to the $20tn national debt over 10 years, the non-partisan Joint Committee on Taxation says. US tax bill: Winners and losers Senators have now begun voting on the bill, as demonstrators in the gallery attempted to disrupt proceedings, shouting: ""Kill the bill!"" US Vice-President Mike Pence has postponed a Middle East trip in case he is needed to cast a tie-breaking vote to ensure the measure clears the Senate. In the upper chamber, which Republicans control by 52-48, the party can afford to lose support from no more than two votes. Republicans are hoping to pass the bill before going on holiday break On Monday, two of the last Senate Republican holdouts, Susan Collins and Mike Lee, agreed to support the legislation. Senator Jeff Flake remained undecided late on Monday. Senator John McCain, who has brain cancer, is with his family in Arizona. Another Republican senator, Bob Corker, meanwhile, denied his change of heart in favour of the bill had been motivated by a tax deduction that could benefit his real estate investments. The Tennessean had long been opposed to the tax bill because of projections it would add to the federal deficit. But on Friday Mr Corker dropped his objections as a provision was added offering a 20% deduction on certain property income. On Monday, he denied switching sides because he could benefit personally from the legislation. Aside from the tax changes that will affect most Americans, Republicans have been eager to prove they can govern after their attempts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act collapsed during the summer. The tax bill continues the party's attempts to dismantle the 2010 law known as Obamacare by scrapping a fine it imposes on Americans who do not buy health insurance. With an eye on next year's mid-term elections, Democrats argue that the tax package will further expand the US income gap between rich and poor. Will Trump's plans trigger a tax war?

Met review after sex cases collapse,"This video can not be played Rape trial collapse student Liam Allan felt 'pure fear' About 30 rape cases due to go to trial and ""scores"" more investigations are to be reviewed after the collapse of two cases in a week. On Tuesday, prosecutors dropped a case against a man charged with raping a child under 16 due to police providing ""relevant"" evidence in recent days. Last week, student Liam Allan's trial collapsed because of the late disclosure of evidence. The Met said the same officer worked on both cases and remains on full duty. The force has not referred the officer involved to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), a Met spokesman said. The IPCC told the BBC it was ""monitoring the situation"". Collapsed rape trial accused 'betrayed' Why disclosure failings can prove crucial 'It's just sheer incompetence' - says prosecutor In the most recent case of Isaac Itiary, the Crown Prosecution Service said ""new material"" provided by Scotland Yard meant the case could not proceed. Isaac Itiary was charged with raping a child in July but the case collapsed The Met review is aimed at ensuring all digital evidence in other sex crime cases has been disclosed to the CPS. Conservative MP Nigel Evans, who was cleared of rape and sexual assault charges in 2014, said there was a ""systemic"" problem, which could leave innocent people in jail. Prime Minister Theresa May said the attorney general had already started a review into the disclosure of evidence, telling PMQs: ""It is important that we look at this again so we make sure we are truly providing justice."" Liam Allan, 22, was charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault but his trial collapsed after police were ordered to hand over phone records crucial to the case. A computer disk containing 40,000 messages revealed the alleged victim had pestered him for ""casual sex"". Mr Allan, who spent almost two years on bail,has said he intends to sue the Met. This video can not be played Barrister Jerry Hayes tells Today late disclosure of evidence is a worrying 'systemic' problem Jerry Hayes, the barrister prosecuting the case against Mr Allan, agreed with Mr Evans' assertion that the problem was ""systemic"" within the police, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""You speak to any barrister they will tell you stories that this happens every single day and it has got to stop."" He said anyone about to go to trial should seek a letter from the police force to say all evidence has been disclosed, and for those convicted, ""they will have to be looked at again"". By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The cases of Liam Allan and Isaac Itiary are very different. As far as Mr Allan is concerned, the Met has accepted the case ""clearly went wrong"". Crucial information was disclosed to defence barristers so late that the trial was already well under way. In Mr Itiary's case, procedures appear to have been followed, though it's possible police could have acted more quickly. What the cases have done is shine a light on the importance of following disclosure rules. Undoubtedly the squeeze on resources, with cuts in the Crown Prosecution Service and policing and a national shortage of detectives, together with the increased caseload for sexual offences units, have played their part. An inspection report this year also pinpointed inadequacies in training and supervision. Some see the problems as a direct result of a misplaced culture of ""believing"" the victim, where police don't look for or withhold contradictory evidence - but that's an assertion for the attorney general's inquiry to examine. Commander Richard Smith, who oversees the Met's rape investigations, said he understood the failure of the latest case would raise further concerns. He added: ""The Met is completely committed to understanding what went wrong in the case of Mr Allan and is carrying out a joint review with the CPS, the findings of which will be published."" But Nigel Evans said the late disclosure of evidence was ""common"" in investigations. Mr Evans was cleared in 2014 of charges of raping a student Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, he said: ""It seems to be in too many cases that police are cherry-picking the evidence that is there in order to get a prosecution. "" Mr Evans called for a ""proper review"" involving police forces across the country, not just the Met. Dame Elish Angiolini led a review in 2015 into how the Met and the CPS deal with rape cases. She said she was ""concerned about the impact of excessive workloads on the effectiveness of both police and prosecutors"". In response to her review, the Met said it had carried out ""significant work"", with an extra 196 officers allocated to the relevant units and additional lawyers for the CPS. Former Met detective chief inspector Peter Kirkham told the Victoria Derbyshire programme it was a resources issue. ""Since 2010, we have reduced the number of police officers around the country by about 20,000 - that's about 15%,"" he said. He warned that officers were ""stressed"" and ""haven't got time to do their jobs properly"". This video can not be played Former Met detective Hamish Brown: Sex cases review will highlight police cuts The number of adults reporting rape in England and Wales has more than doubled from 10,160 in 2011-12 to 23,851 in 2015-16,according to figures from the HM Inspectorate of Constabulary's rape monitoring group,external. A Home Office study suggests only 4% of cases of sexual violence reported to police are thought to be false.

May and Trump discuss Brexit and Israel,"The two leaders wished each other a happy Christmas and said they would remain in ""close touch"" Theresa May has discussed Brexit and events in the Middle East in a pre-Christmas phone call with Donald Trump. It is the first time they have spoken since last month's diplomatic spat over the US president's re-tweeting of anti-Muslim videos by a UK far-right group. No 10 said the two agreed on the importance of a ""swift"" transatlantic trade deal after the UK leaves the EU. Mrs May also reiterated her opposition to Mr Trump's plan to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Mr Trump said last month that he intended to move the country's embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a shift in longstanding US policy which has been criticised by European allies and much of the Arab world. The two leaders, who last met in September, had earlier clashed over Mr Trump's apparent endorsement of inflammatory tweets posted by a senior member of Britain First. Trump still on May's Christmas card list When Theresa met Donald Donald Trump retweets far-right videos No 10 described his actions as wrong which prompted the US president, in return, to chastise Mrs May on Twitter and urge her to focus her attention on tackling Islamic extremism. In a summary of Tuesday's phone call, Downing Street said the two leaders had covered a range of issues, including the humanitarian situation in Yemen amid the continuing conflict in the country. No 10 said the two leaders agreed ""on the vital importance of reopening humanitarian and commercial access to prevent famine and alleviate the suffering of innocent Yemenis"". On Israel, the leaders discussed their ""different positions"" on the US recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, agreeing ""on the importance of the US bringing forward new proposals for peace and the international community supporting these efforts"". Israel regards Jerusalem as its ""eternal and undivided"" capital, while the Palestinians claim East Jerusalem - occupied by Israel in the 1967 war - as the capital of a future Palestinian state. On the UK's future relations with Europe and the US, Downing Street said the two agreed ""on the importance of a swift post-Brexit bilateral trade deal"". It added: ""The prime minister updated the president on the recent good progress of the Brexit negotiations, and the president set out the progress he had made on his economic agenda."" Mr Trump has repeatedly said he wants to strike a quick trade agreement with the UK after it leaves in March 2019 but experts have said it will take years to negotiate. Soon after he took office in January, Mr Trump was invited on a state visit to the UK but no date has been set for the trip amid criticism from MPs of the president's conduct and stance on key issues. In its summary of the leaders' conversation, the White House made no direct reference to any discussion on Israel, focusing instead on the ""next steps in forging peace"" in the Middle East as well as on Yemen and Brexit.

Germany admits errors after Berlin attack,"This video can not be played Angela Merkel visits the scene soon after the 2016 attack in Berlin Germany has admitted that mistakes were made in the aftermath of last year's attack on a Christmas market in Berlin that left 12 dead. ""Everything humanly possible"" was being done to help those affected and improve security, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on the first anniversary of the attack. Mrs Merkel has come under fire for her government's response. Families have said they were not given timely information and that they were sent bills for the costs of autopsies. After a private ceremony for the bereaved and emergency workers, Mrs Merkel said it was time to work to ""correct the things that went wrong"". ""Not only to guarantee security, but to give those whose lives were destroyed or impacted, the chance to return to their lives as well as possible,"" she added. More about the Berlin attack Witness: It was just horror in front of you The chancellor also attended an event that unveiled a memorial for the victims at Berlin's Breitscheidplatz, the site of the Christmas market. Several family members had accused Mrs Merkel of ""inaction"", saying that she had failed to reach out to them. She met victims' relatives for the first time on Monday, and described the conversation as ""brutally honest"". Last year's attack in Berlin also left dozens injured Earlier,in an article in the Tagesspiegel newspaper (in German),external, Justice Minister Heiko Maas acknowledged the country was not ""sufficiently prepared"" for the consequences of such an attack, saying: ""For this we can only apologise to the victims and surviving relatives"". He proposed the creation of a government co-ordination office to improve communication with victims of future attacks and called for a change in the law so that all victims could be treated and compensated equally, regardless of their nationalities or the circumstances of the attack. Can police protect Christmas crowds? Tributes are paid to the victims of the attack at the market in Berlin A report commissioned by the government and released last week cited a number of failures in the response to the attack, including delays in confirming the identities of the victims to their relatives. A separate report in October revealed ""gross mistakes""by German police and security services. Anis Amri, a Tunisian asylum seeker who drove a lorry into the crowded market, was shot and killed in Italy four days after the attack.

Couple killed in hotel fire named,"Richard Dyson and Simon Midgley were thought to be on a winter break in Scotland Two men who died when a fire tore through a luxury five-star hotel on the shores of Loch Lomond have been named. Simon Midgley and Richard Dyson, believed to be from London, were staying at Cameron House Hotel when the blaze broke out on Monday morning. Police have not confirmed the identity of those who died, but relatives have paid tribute on social media. The hotel's director has praised the actions of the emergency services in preventing further tragedy. Firefighters who brought a couple and their baby to safety from an upper floor have been hailed as ""heroes"". A baby was rescued by firefighters from an upper floor of the hotel Andrew and Louise Logan, and their son Jimmy, from Worcestershire, were taken to hospital after being brought to safety, but were later discharged. More than 200 guests were evacuated from the building when the blaze broke out. A joint investigation into the cause of the fire is under way. Social media posts suggested that Mr Midgley and Mr Dyson were on a winter break in Scotland. A post on Mr Midgley's Instagram account on Saturday showed pictures of Cameron House Hotel and said: ""Home for the weekend."" Relatives have been expressing their shock at news of the couple's deaths. Mr Midgley's sister posted a picture of her brother and his partner on Facebook, while another relative wrote: ""I'm beyond heartbroken."" Kate Baxter wrote on Twitter: ""Such unbearably sad news.. RIP @SimonMidgleyPR, a shining star in our wonderfully close-knit industry."" According to his Facebook page, Mr Midgley was a freelance journalist at the London Evening Standard and ran his own PR company, while Mr Dyson is believed to be a TV producer. Police and firefighters remained at the scene on Tuesday morning, with the scale of the damage becoming more apparent. BBC Scotland's Andrew Black was allowed on site and said: ""The damage to the building is pretty extensive, especially the upper floors. There's a smell of burning wood and we could hear a fire alarm from part of the building still going off."" The BBC understands that a wedding due to take place at Cameron House hotel this weekend has been moved to another luxury hotel. This video can not be played Drone footage from above Loch Lomond shows the extent of the damage at Cameron House In a new statement, Cameron House's director, Andy Roger, praised the ""very swift actions of the emergency services"". He said: ""Everyone associated with Cameron House Hotel is still coming to terms with the events of yesterday and we are all hugely conscious that two people tragically lost their lives in the fire. ""Their families and friends are foremost in our thoughts as we co-operate fully with the investigation teams to try to establish the circumstances surrounding this terrible incident. ""The emergency services were on the scene long into the night and I cannot praise their efforts highly enough. They are true heroes. The firemen bringing out a couple and their young child by ladder from a second-floor room was a heart-stopping moment for all those who witnessed it. ""We're also enormously grateful for the many, many offers of practical support and good wishes from the UK hospitality industry and also from the local community, which has rallied around to help. It's been a humbling experience, but we are a small, tight-knit community on Loch Lomond and a response like that is typical of our many friends and neighbours."" Mr Roger said the hotel had made arrangements for the vast majority of the guests to travel home or continue with their breaks and he thanked them for their patience and ""good spirits"". He also paid tribute to the staff at Cameron House who he said had shown ""an enormous degree of care and teamwork throughout the last two days"". Local people have been speaking of their shock and sadness at what happened at the hotel. One woman told BBC Scotland: ""We are just very sad for all the families involved and so sorry for the people who work there."" Another added: ""It's absolutely horrific. I think the local community really feels it."" Reverend Ian Miller, a retired minister who lives locally and was called in to offer guests support in the aftermath of the fire, said those affected ""fell into two groups"". ""There were those in the side bedrooms which weren't really touched and they just realised they had escaped something terrible,"" he said. ""But for those in the main building then there were degrees of trauma. Some had escaped with virtually nothing. ""One man came out in his underwear. Another woman told me she just grabbed her baby, change bag and moved out."" The Scottish Fire and Rescue service remained at the scene on Tuesday morning Speaking onBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, John Gow, from forensic investigations firm IFIC, said: ""There will be a number of strands to this investigation, running in tandem. ""Obviously, sadly, there is the death investigation due to the fatalities that occurred. ""There is the origin and cause investigation which is establishing how the fire started and spread throughout the property. ""It is also likely there will be an investigation to establish if the fire precaution measures were adequate and operated as they should.""

Crash victim was jailed over 130mph chase,"One of the six victims of a multi-car crash in Birmingham had served a prison sentence over a 130mph police chase, the BBC understands. Kasar Jehangir, 25, was jailed for three years for dangerous driving and possession of drugs with intent to supply in November last year. He wasone of two men who threw heroin from an Audiwhile being chased by police on the M6 in 2015. Lucy Davis and Lee Jenkins have also been named as victims of the crash. Midlands Live: All Birmingham crash victims named; Anguish over dead body photos Mr Jehangir - released earlier in 2017 under probation service supervision - died on Sunday alongside Tauqeer Hussain, 26, and Mohammed Fahsha. Another man, 22, was seriously injured when the Audi the four men were in crashed with a taxi on Lee Bank Middleway, near the city centre. Mr Hussain's mother suffered a heart attack after learning of her son's death, a family member said. ""Beautiful and fun-loving"" Lucy Davis was one of the taxi passengers killed in the crash Taxi driver Imtiaz Mohammed and his passengers, 42-year-old Mr Jenkins, and his partner 43-year-old Ms Davis from Kingstanding in Birmingham, died after the vehicle was smashed on to its side. Ms Davis, who had two children, worked as a sign language interpreter. Her family said: ""Lucy was a beautiful and fun-loving mother, daughter, sister, auntie and friend who brought happiness to the lives of all she met. Rest in Peace our Lady in Red."" Her relatives havetaken to social media to express their ""unbearable"" pain,external. Mr Jenkins' employer, University Hospitals Birmingham, said: ""The trust extends its deepest condolences to the family of Lee Jenkins and also to his friends and colleagues at this very sad time."" Mr Mohammed, 33, has been described by relatives as a ""happy, loving and friendly guy"", was on his last job before heading home to his wife and family, according to his brother. The family of Mr Mohammed, who had five daughters and one son, said his death came the day before his daughter's fourth birthday. Father-of-six Imtiaz Mohammed, described as a hard-working family man, was killed in the crash Three men in the Audi, including Mohammed Fahsha, 30, pictured with his baby nephew, and Tauqeer Hussain, 26, known as Tox to his family, died at the scene. People have been leaving tributes near the scene of the crash, including flowers with a card saying: ""To Mum, I love you loads. ""Life isn't going to be the same without you."" Three vehicles were directly involved in the accident on Belgrave Middleway in the early hours of Sunday The scene of the accident was described as ""harrowing"" Tousif Hussain Kiani, whose younger brother Tauqeer died in the crash, revealed that their mother had a heart attack after hearing about her son's death. Mr Hussain was abroad when his sister contacted him in the middle of the night to tell him his 26-year-old brother was among the men thrown from the Audi. He said he managed to get the next flight back to the UK, only to return to the news that his mother, Jamil Ahktar, had been taken to hospital. The death of Tauqeer is another tragedy for the family as Mr Hussain's older brother, Khrum Munir, was killed in a car accident almost 10 years ago when the 28-year-old was coming home from work. He said his father was ""holding it together because he is a strong man... but emotionally, I'm not sure what he is feeling."" Tousif Hussain Kiani said his brother Tauqeer was 'happy and carefree' Mr Hussain described Tauqeer, known as Tox, as someone who was ""friendly to everybody"" and always outside the house on St Benedicts Road, Small Heath, with his friends ""laughing and joking"". He was due to start a new job in January. He said Mohammed Fahsha lived opposite and was a childhood friend to them both. ""We were always in each other's houses... always together. It doesn't seem real because they're not here,"" he said. The brothers had known Kasar Jehangir for several years and the fourth person in the car who survived, an unnamed 22-year-old man, since he was about 15 years old. He said the group were going to get food when the crash happened. Mr Hussain said he was upset at Mr Jehangir's past drug convictions being referenced following his death. ""It's irrelevant to what has happened now... it's a matter in his own private life and not something his family want to be seeing. ""Everybody does bad and good in their life."" He said he was also angry at graphic images and footage of the aftermath of the crash scene being shared on social media. ""When I checked my social media [after learning of his brother's death] I saw people uploading pictures and videos. ""Fair enough you want to record the cars or whatever, but people were recording the bodies lying on the floor and that's not how I'd like to see any person lying on the floor while they are dead in that state, never mind if they're my brother and my best friends.""

N Korea blamed for global cyber-attack,"Attackers encrypted user's devices, and typically demanded a ransom of $300-600 in Bitcoin The US and UK governments have said North Korea was responsible for the WannaCry malware attack affecting hospitals, businesses and banks across the world earlier this year. The attack is said to have hit more than 300,000 computers in 150 nations, causing billions of dollars of damage. It is the first time the US and UK have officially blamed them for the worm. Thomas Bossert, an aide to US President Donald Trump, first made the accusation in theWall Street Journal,externalnewspaper. Mr Bossert, who advises the president on homeland security, said the allegation was ""based on evidence"". He did not produce any evidence in the article, but said US findings concurred with judgments from other governments and private companies. He added that Australia, Canada, and New Zealand also share the US conclusion that North Korea was behind the attack. Following the interview, the UK Foreign Office also blamed ""North Korean actors using their cyber programme to circumvent sanctions"". The National Cyber Security Centre assessed that is ""highly likely"" that the North Korean Lazarus hacking group had committed the attacks,Minister for Cyber Lord Ahmad said in a statement,external. In May, Windows computers hit by the cyber-attack had their contents locked, with users asked to a pay a ransom to have their data restored. EU police body Europol called the scale of the attack ""unprecedented"". Analysis: Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent Britain's National Cyber Security Centre, part of the GCHQ signals intelligence agency, first attributed the May 2017 Wannacry attack to North Korea within weeks of the ransomware spreading. The speed was because the UK led the international investigation after the National Health Service was hit hard. The US intelligence community may have taken longer to concur with that assessment but there is still the question of why the White House is only going public now. Governments used to be cautious about attribution in cyber attacks but it is becoming increasingly common - beginning with the claim North Korea was behind the attack on Sony in 2014 and more recently involving Russia's alleged hacking in the 2016 US election. This latest claim is almost certainly an attempt to put more pressure on North Korea in the crisis over its nuclear programme with the attempt to rally international support behind the notion that the country is a real danger - whether from cyber weapons or nuclear weapons. And to make the case that further action, of some kind, needs to be contemplated. Mr Bossert warned that ""we will continue to hold accountable those who harm or threaten us"" In the Wall Street Journal piece, Mr Bossert said North Korea must be held ""accountable"" and that the US would continue to use a ""maximum pressure strategy"" to hinder the regime's ability to mount cyber-attacks. He did not specify what action, if any, the US government planned to take in response to the findings. North Korea is already facing major economic sanctions after being redesignated a state-sponsor of terrorism last monthamid tension over its nuclear programme and missile tests. Malware, patches and worms defined UK say cyber-attack was 'launched from North Korea' ""North Korea has acted especially badly, largely unchecked, for more than a decade, and its malicious behaviour is growing more egregious. WannaCry was indiscriminately reckless,"" Mr Bossert wrote. ""As we make the internet safer, we will continue to hold accountable those who harm or threaten us, whether they act alone or on behalf of criminal organisations or hostile nations,"" he went on. ""The tool kits of totalitarian regimes are too threatening to ignore."" He added that Microsoft and Facebook both acted to disable North Korean cyber-attacks ""on their own initiative last week, without any direction or participation by the US"". Microsoft later issued a statement,,externalsaying that last week the company ""working together with Facebook and others in the security community, took strong steps to protect our customers and the internet from ongoing attacks by an advanced persistent threat actor known to us as ZINC, also known as the Lazarus Group"". ""Among other steps, last week we helped disrupt the malware this group relies on, cleaned customers' infected computers, disabled accounts being used to pursue cyber-attacks and strengthened Windows defences to prevent reinfection,"" the statement said.

However, some social media users said that - while crediting Microsoft and Facebook - Mr Bossert did not mentiona UK security researcher who had ""accidentally"" halted the spread of the malicious software. The 22-year-old man, known by the pseudonym MalwareTech, managed to bring the spread to a halt when he found what appeared to be a ""kill switch"" in the rogue software's code. In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) was hit particularly hard by the cyber-attack, with 48 affected health trusts forced to turn many patients away for appointments and even surgeries. It spread across the world, with Russia reportedly being badly hit, causing problems to the country's postal service. North Korea has not yet responded to the US allegation In 2014, the US claimed North Korea were behind cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures, after it released a film featuring the fictional killing of its leader Kim Jong-un. A guide to the cyber-attack on Hollywood The entertainment company had its films leaked and details of corporate finances and private emails released online. The North Koreans hit out at former president Barack Obama over the claim, but has not yet responded to the White House accusations about the WannaCry hack. In October it said rumours from a UK government minister that they were behind the 2017 attack was ""groundless speculation"", and a ""wicked attempt"" to tighten international sanctions on the country.

Streep said Weinstein ""needed me much more than I needed him"" McGowan's tweet in full said: ""Actresses, like Meryl Streep, who happily worked for The Pig Monster, are wearing black @goldenglobes in a silent protest.

""I sat by the phone all day,"" she wrote, adding: ""I hoped that she would give me a hearing. She did not, but I hope she reads this.

Meanwhile, actor Matt Damon has spoken out again about the Hollywood scandal, tellingBusiness Insider,externalhe thinks the men in Hollywood who aren't sexual predators should be talked about more. ""We're in this watershed moment, and it's great, but I think one thing that's not being talked about is there are a whole load of guys - the preponderance of men I've worked with - who don't do this kind of thing,"" he said. His comments follow criticism from actresses including his former girlfriend Minnie Driver ofan interview he gave to ABC,external. Damon said: ""I do believe that there's a spectrum of behaviour and we're going to have to figure, you know, there's a difference between patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation,"" he said.

Facebook 'cautious' on Britain First ban,"Yvette Cooper read out a series of abusive threats made to MPs on Twitter Facebook has said it is reviewing the future of Britain First's profile page, following theremoval of its leaders' pages from Twitter. The social network said it was ""very cautious"" about removing political speech. The details emerged as the Home Affairs Committee grilled Facebook, Google and Twitter on what they were doing to combat hate speech. MPs said the firms had made progress but were still not doing enough. Google promised an annual transparency report on the issue. Facebook and Twitter said they were looking at a similar course of action but did not commit to it. Twitter suspends Britain First leaders Twitter's hate speech rules are expanded Facebook and Twitter could face 'abuse levy' On Britain First, a far-right group, Facebook's director of public policy Simon Milner said it was reviewing its future. ""Clearly there are issues with the pages but we are very cautious about political speech,"" he told MPs. He added that, until recently, it had been registered as a political party. Conservative MP Tim Loughton accused technology giants of inciting violence through inaction. ""This is not about taking away somebody's rights to criticise somebody whose politics they don't agree with,"" he said. ""It's about not providing a platform - whatever the ills of society you want to blame it on - for placing stuff that incites people to kill, harm, maim, incite violence against people because of their political beliefs."" ""You are profiting from the fact that people use your platforms and you are profiting, I'm afraid, from the fact that people are using your platforms to further the ills of society and you're allowing them to do it and doing very little, proactively to prevent them,"" he added. Committee chairwoman Yvette Cooper said that as three of the ""richest companies in the world"", the firms ""needed to do more"" on hate speech. She accused YouTube of failing to remove a racist video repeatedly flagged up to it by her. Ms Cooper described how, over the course of eight months, she repeatedly checked whether a propaganda video from far-right organisation National Action had been taken down, after Google agreed that it violated its policies. She found that it remained on the platform for more than half a year. ""It took eight months of the chair of the select committee raising it with the most senior people in your organisation to get this down,"" Ms Cooper said.  ""Even when we raise it and nothing happens, it is hard to believe that enough is being done."" She said that the video remained on Facebook and Twitter even after it was flagged to Google, saying it was ""incomprehensible"" the information had not been shared. In response, Google's vice-president of public policy Dr Nicklas Lundblad said the firm had seen a ""sea-change"" in the way it was dealing with such content in the last year and was now turning to machine learning - a type of artificial intelligence - which it hoped would become ""five times"" more effective than human moderators and do the work of thousands of them. Ms Cooper also flagged to Google the fact that, as a result of her constant searching for the YouTube video, she was recommended ""vile"" content. ""Is it not simply that you are actively recommending racist material into people's timelines? Your algorithms are doing the job of grooming and radicalising,"" the Labour MP said. In response, Dr Lundblad said Google did not want people to ""end up in a bubble of hate"" and was working on identifying such videos and using machine learning to limit their features, so they would not be recommended to others or have any comments on them. Facebook's Simon Milner said on the matter: ""Our focus has been on global terrorist organisations. One of the issues with this is that content from videos like this can be used by news organisations to highlight their activities. ""With this material, context really matters,"" he said. ""There is a chance that we are taking down important journalism."" He was also asked whether the social media firm would be willing to introduce legislation, being brought in by Germany, that will impose huge fines on social networks if they do not delete illegal content, including hate speech. ""The German legislation is not yet in action,"" he said. ""It is asking us to decide what is illegal, not courts, and we think that is problematic."" Ms Cooper also grilled Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice-president of public policy on a series of abusive tweets  - including racist comments aimed at MP Diane Abbott and death threats aimed at MP Anna Soubry - remained on Twitter. Ms McSweeney said that the firm was increasing the numbers of people moderating its content, but declined to give a figure. She said that Twitter provided dedicated teams who work with parliamentarians. ""Where we see someone getting a lot of abusive content, we are increasingly communicating to them within the platform,"" she said. But she was unable to guarantee that all the tweets referred to by Ms Cooper had been removed. ""Right now, I can't say what you'd see. You can clean a street in the morning and it can still be full of rubbish by 22:00."" None of the three firms was prepared to answer a question about how much moderators were paid, saying it varied from country to country and depended on the skills and specialism of staff. Ms Cooper said there had been a ""shift in attitude"" for the better since the three firms were last questioned. All three admitted they still needed to ""do better"".

Police to get 'extra Â£450m funding',"A potential Â£450m in extra funding for police in England and Wales in the next financial year has been announced by the Home Office. Police and crime commissioners are to be given the power to raise the portion of council tax which goes towards policing by Â£12 per household annually. That would raise Â£270m, while Â£130m for national priorities, such as firearms, would come from central government. An extra Â£50m for counter terrorism has already been pledged. The government also announced the overall grant for the 43 forces in England and Wales would remain the same in cash terms in 2018-19 at Â£12.6bn. However, opposition MPs described the main settlement for next year as a ""real-terms cut"". Although funding for police was protected in the 2015 spending review, police and crime commissioners have been expressing concern about increased demands on officers. In a statement, the Home Office said next year's extra funding came after Policing Minister Nick Hurd spoke to every force about the issues they face. ""It is clear that with more victims of serious, hidden crimes such as domestic abuse, modern slavery and child sexual exploitation coming forward, this has placed greater demand on policing,"" it said. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Hurd said the money amounted to a ""comprehensive settlement that makes sure police have the resources they need"". He said the government had responded positively to requests from the police and crime commissioners for ""more flexibility"" around the level of the police precept included in council tax. Reality Check: Did the government protect police funding? Mr Hurd acknowledged that the Â£270m increase in funding would depend on every commissioner applying to raise their precept. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott questioned whether the settlement would ""really enable police forces to meet the challenge and the reality of modern policing"". She said: ""Since 2010 the Tories have made huge cuts to the police, 20,000 police officers have been lost and an increasing number of overstretched forces say they cannot respond to certain crimes. Further cuts in police officer numbers are now inevitable."" In June, London's police force, the Met, said it needed to secure more funding after being left ""stretched"" by terror attacks and a rise in violent crime. But responding to the new announcement, London's Labour mayor Sadiq Khan, said the government had ""refused to give the Met the resources they need to do their job once again"" and the policing element of council tax was likely to be increased by the maximum allowed. Andy Burnham, Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, said people were noticing the loss of visible policing and accused the government of gambling with public safety amid the terror threat. He said a rise in council tax would mean some of the most deprived communities in the country would bear the ""burden of the government's failure to fairly fund policing"". On Tuesday, the Communities Secretary Sajid Javid announced thatthe largest local authorities in England would be allowed to raise council tax by up to 5.99% next year. David Jamieson, the Labour police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands, said the settlement fell a ""long way short"" of the extra Â£22m his police needed. In its statement, the Home Office said it had identified a further Â£100m of potential savings to be made through ""smarter procurement of everything from cars to uniform"". It also said improving levels of productivity could see officers spend an extra hour a day on the frontline. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""Taxpayers will invest more money in forces because the work our officers do to protect us is absolutely vital and we recognise demand is changing. ""However, my message to police forces is that this increased investment must mean we raise the pace of reform. ""For too long embracing digital and increasing productivity have been tomorrow's policing problems - now they are today's necessities. The government is committed to meeting this challenge and we want policing to do the same.""

Weinstein assistant attacks gagging orders,"This video can not be played Zelda Perkins: ""Everyone sees [Harvey] as this repulsive monster... he was also an extremely exciting person to be around."" A former assistant to Harvey Weinstein, who accused him of attempting to rape a colleague 19 years ago, has called for a change to UK law on gagging orders. Zelda Perkins worked for Weinstein's Miramax Films in the UK in the 1990s. She left after a co-worker said he'd tried to rape her, which he denied. Ms Perkins told BBC Newsnight she tried to expose his behaviour, but was told by lawyers she ""didn't have a chance"". She signed a non-disclosure agreement but said the process was ""immoral"". Ms Perkins was 24 when she signed the confidentiality agreement in 1998, which prevented her from speaking to anyone about the alleged sexual assault. She's now broken her 19 years of silence by speaking publicly about the movie mogul's mistreatment of women. Harvey Weinstein - how the scandal unfolded Harvey Weinstein - the accusers' stories BBC to make Weinstein documentary In her first broadcast interview, she told Newsnight's Emily Maitlis she wanted UK law on non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) reformed to dismantle a legal system which she says enables the rich and powerful to cover up sexual assault and harassment. ""The last 19 years have been distressing, where I've not been allowed to speak, where I've not been allowed to be myself,"" she told the BBC Two programme. ""It's not just distressing for me, but for lots of women who have not been able to own their past, and for many of them, their trauma. Although the process I went through was legal, it was immoral."" She said she was ""emotionally and psychologically"" threatened by Weinstein during her three years working for him, but was never physically threatened. Harvey Weinstein and Zelda Perkins in 1998 When, on a trip abroad, a younger colleague came to her in a distressed state to say that Weinstein had attempted to rape her, Ms Perkins felt it was her duty to act. ""She was shaking, very distressed, and clearly in shock,"" she said. ""She didn't want anybody to know and was absolutely terrified of the consequences. I spoke with her and tried to calm her down before confronting Harvey face to face."" Weinstein denied the attempted rape. The women were advised to take legal advice, but were shocked by what they were told. Salma Hayek: Weinstein threatened to kill me Mira Sorvino: Weinstein 'derailed my career' Meryl Streep defends herself against Rose McGowan criticism ""The lawyers made it very clear that we didn't have very many options,"" she said. ""We had no physical evidence because we hadn't gone to the police when we were abroad, and ultimately, it would be two young women's words against Harvey Weinstein. ""In hindsight, my lawyers were giving me the advice they thought was best. ""However, they were saying, 'You will get dragged backwards, forwards and sideways through the courts. As will your family, as will your friends, as will anybody who knows anything about you. You haven't got a chance. You will be destroyed.'"" They were advised that their best option was to take legal action against Weinstein. What followed eventually led to the signing of an agreement so shrouded in secrecy that Ms Perkins herself is not permitted to own a copy of the document, but can look at it under supervision. She fought to get terms included, including Weinstein's commitment to attend therapy. The document is so closely guarded because it's ""a smoking gun"", she said. ""If you have an agreement that somebody has signed, that says that he will go to therapy, that he will be dismissed from his own company if anybody else makes a claim in the ensuing period, that an HR policy for sexual harassment has to be brought into the company, it's pretty clear that something's wrong."" She received Â£125,000 as part of the settlement - which she now views as a payment for her silence. But she says she regrets that the agreement meant that money changed hands. Harvey Weinstein ran Miramax Films until 2005 She said the experience left her ""pretty broken and exhausted and so disillusioned"" and she doesn't know whether the conditions regarding therapy were carried out. She said: ""I didn't have the energy to go on fighting. It was not my obligation to follow up on his obligation. ""What's extraordinary looking back is you'd imagine that Miramax Films would have been bending over backwards to make sure all of those obligations were fulfilled. But they weren't. I really couldn't stay in the industry at that point."" Now, Ms Perkins says her motives for breaking the terms of her agreement by speaking publicly are as much about shedding light on the gagging orders that can protect the rich and powerful as they are about exposing Harvey Weinstein's alleged abusive behaviour. NDAs are widely used in the business world to share confidential information and keep trade secrets, but their usage in sexual harassment cases is more controversial. The allegations against Harvey Weinstein have caused some law-makers in the US to readdress the use of NDAs in these instances. Senators in New York, New Jersey and California have drafted legislation aimed at banning them in such circumstances. Ms Perkins now wants the UK Parliament to follow suit and debate the issue. Geoffrey Roberston QC said NDAs could be very useful, especially in employment law, and a blanket ban was ""not the way to go"". But he added: ""There is, however, an entirely legitimate case for the UK Parliament to pass an amendment to the Criminal Justice Act, making it a crime to offer money to employees to silence them in relation to criminal offences that they know about. ""This is also a question of legal ethics - the Weinstein story has highlighted an area in the law that can cover up sexual crime."" Ms Perkins said: ""I understand that non-disclosure agreements have a place in society, and for both sides. But it's really important that legislation is changed around how these agreements are regulated."" The BBC asked Mr Weinstein for a response to the allegations. His lawyers said Mr Weinstein categorically denied engaging in any non-consensual conduct or alleged threatening behaviour. Miramax had no comment. The lawyers representing Zelda Perkins at the time that the NDA was signed said it was inappropriate for them to comment, given the terms of the NDA.

Baby likely to die at birth 'to be donor',"The couple will donate their unborn daughter's heart valves A mother who has been told her unborn baby girl will not survive at birth is carrying her to full term so she can donate heart tissue to help others. Hayley Martin was told at her 20-week scan that her child has a rare genetic disorder meaning she will die during labour or within minutes of being born. Speaking on ITV's This Morning show, Mrs Martin, 30, said they would be able to donate her daughter's heart valves. Explaining her decision, she added: ""I wouldn't have it any other way."" More stories from across East Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire Already a mother-of-three, Mrs Martin and her husband Scott, from Hull, discovered their baby had bilateral renal agenesis at the five-month scan. Mrs Martin said she had a feeling early on in the pregnancy and that things were not right The condition is fatal and means the baby has no kidneys and is not surrounded by enough amniotic fluid, causing malformed lungs. After speaking to specialist doctors, the couple were given the weekend to consider terminating the pregnancy but Mrs Martin told This Morning her reaction was ""automatically, I don't want to let her go just yet"". The couple said they had taken the decision to give birth to their daughter, who they have already named Ava-Joy, to help others in need of a transplant. It is likely that their baby's heart valves will be used to help other seriously-ill children. ""With the heart valves they can store them up to ten years,"" Mrs Martin told the show. ""Anything is better than nothing. I know she can't donate proper organs but tissue is just as valuable."" Angie Scales, a NHS organ donation and transplantation nurse, said around 10 to 15 families a year ask about the possibility of donation in relation to their unborn child. She said: ""However, proceeding to actual donation in these cases is extremely rare due to the complexities of the processes that are required."" Three people a day, including children, die waiting for a transplant, she added. The couple said their other children would grow up knowing about their younger sister The couple said the support they had received through a specialist charity in Leeds had helped them bond with their unborn daughter. The charity funded a blood test to enable them to find out the sex of the baby so they were able to give her a name and buy clothes to dress her once she is born. The Martins said they were starting a charity project in Ava-Joy's memory to help other families who decided to carry to term, despite a fatal diagnosis. ""It was not an easy decision but it was the right decision and it has helped me cope with the heartbreak,"" said Mrs Martin. ""A part of her will live on, she won't be completely gone. She will be alive in somebody else.""

Self-parking cars to be legalised,"Jaguar Land Rover is among those developing driverless technology The UK government wants to modify its ban on using mobile phones behind the wheel to allow drivers to use automatic parking devices. Drivers who push a button on their phone or key fob to make their car park itself could be running the risk of a fine under current laws, according toa consultation document,external. Remote-control parking is a feature on many high-end luxury models. But the government claims it could ""revolutionise"" driving for all. Driverless cars on UK roads by 2021 - really? Are we ready for driverless cars? Officials say it can aid those with reduced mobility and help people get into tight parking spaces, as well as making life easier for those with small garages. The Department for Transport cites research which claims the average driver spends 106 days during their lifetime looking for parking spaces. Under the current law, drivers can use a mobile phone only to contact the emergency services and if it is unsafe or impractical to stop the car to make the call. The consultation document says they should also be allowed to look at ""hand-held"" devices, such as a phone, to activate remote-control parking. The devices must be operated within 6m of the vehicle, if the driver has stepped out of it, seen as the safe distance to perform remote manoeuvres. The document also proposes adding a new rule to the Highway Code, which would state: ""You can park your vehicle via remote control, using a legally compliant parking application or device in an appropriate way which does not endanger others."" It also proposes rule changes to allow the use of advanced driver assistance systems on motorways, which take control of the car's speed and position on the road. Drivers will still be advised to keep their hands on the wheel and pay attention to the road, but that may change when systems ""which allow the driver to be out of the loop and divert their attention away from driving and where the vehicle actively monitors the driving for parts of the journey"" become available ""in due course"". Transport Minister Jesse Norman said: ""The government is determined that Britain should lead the way in embracing the safe deployment of new vehicle technology. ""Features such as remote-control parking and motorway assist have the potential to transform car travel, adding greater convenience and accessibility to drivers, so that they can park and drive with more confidence."" Thesix-week consultation,externalwas launched on Tuesday. Driverless cars on UK roads by 2021 - really?

Derailed US train went 80mph into bend,"This video can not be played Footage shows the scale of the derailment A US passenger train that derailed, killing three people, was travelling at 80mph (130km/h) on a curve with a speed limit of 30mph, data from the train's rear engine indicates. It happened in Washington state during rush hour on Monday. Officials say 100 people were taken to hospital. The train crashed shortly after leaving a new station on its inaugural run. Two friends who are railroad enthusiasts were identified as among the fatalities on Tuesday. Rail aficionado Zack Willhoite, 35, was identified by his employer Pierce Transit, who said the IT specialist ""played an important role in our agency"". The National Association of Railroad Passengers identified board member Jim Hamre as another victim. ""He was a dedicated passenger rail advocate doing what he loved to do. Riding trains, promoting travel and making friends"", club president Peter LeCody wrote on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Authorities said all carriages had now been searched, but would not rule out a rise in the number of dead. A spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said investigators had arrived at the scene on Monday night local time and would probably be there for a week or 10 days. Bella Dinh-Zarr said the 12-carriage train had engines at the front and rear. The back engine's data recording had been retrieved, she said, and ""preliminary indications are that the train was travelling at 80mph on a 30mph track"". ""Our hearts go out to everyone who is affected by this very tragic accident,"" she said, adding that the train's engineer had not yet been interviewed but will be in ""within the next day or so"". Passengers say the train rocked and creaked as it took the bend fast before barrelling off a bridge on to a motorway packed with traffic. Seven vehicles, two of them lorries, were hit on the I-5 highway below. Several people were injured in their vehicles but none died. This video can not be played Passenger describes the train crash: ""We could feel cars crumpling"" State transport spokesperson Barbara LaBoe was quoted in the Seattle Times newspaper as sayingthe limit on most of the track was 79mph (128km/h) but drivers were supposed to slow dramatically at the spot where the train derailed,external. She said warning signs were in place two miles before the lowered limit. It was Amtrak's first passenger service to run on a new, shorter route after an investment of $181m (Â£82m). Amtrak is the name of the company that runs most passenger trains in the US, with some government funding. The derailment happened on a section of track previously only used for freight trains. A safety system called Positive Train Control (PTC) was not operational on the train in question, the president of Amtrak told reporters. Using GPS tracking, PTC automatically warns the driver of speed limits and other local conditions and applies the train's brakes if the warnings are not heeded. Congress originally legislated for PTC to be installed by the end of 2015 but it is still not even halfway complete. The cost of implementing the system fully on all tracks and vehicles is reported to be more than $22bn. This video can not be played A 45-second look at how Positive Train Control works Train 501 had left Seattle, heading south for Portland, at 06:00 local time (14:00 GMT). One passenger carriage could be seen dangling from the bridge, while others were strewn across the road and the wooded area next to the track. Authorities are now working through wind and cold rain to clear and re-open the busy motorway, which stretches from Canada to Mexico along the US West Coast. There were 86 people on board, including 77 passengers and seven Amtrak crew members, as well as a train technician. Police say 19 people were taken from the scene uninjured. Of the approximately 100 people transferred to hospital for evaluation, 10 were considered to have serious injuries. A recording of the train's emergency call to railway dispatchers was released to US media. ""Emergency! We are on the ground!"" a man, possibly the conductor, radios in. In a second radio call, another crew member reports that only the rear unit remains on the rails. ""All other cars appear to be on the ground in quite a mess,"" he says. The train's driver has a head injury, he tells dispatchers. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

President Donald Trump tweeted that the derailment underlined the need for his infrastructure plan. However, US media outlets pointed out his submitted federal transportation budget actually proposed cuts to funding to national rail systems. He later added that his thoughts and prayers were with those involved. The section of track where the crash happened has been recently rebuilt and upgraded using federal funds. One carriage was hanging from the tracks, while another was upside down Only the rear locomotive unit stayed on the tracks The train involved was operated by Amtrak and Monday's service was the first 0600 departure under the new timetable and on the new Point Defiance Bypass route The train consisted of 14 cars, two of which were locomotives It was being led by a Siemens Charger locomotive and was trailing a P42 unit which was not under power, Amtrak said There were 12 Talgo carriages, each of which could take up to 36 passengers, but only 77 customers were on board March 2017- Biloxi, Mississippi.

Could drugs delay diseases of ageing?,"Hilda Jaffe is still working at 95 Imagine having to ask a 95-year-old to slow down - well, I did.  Hilda Jaffe was walking so fast there was a risk that the small group following her would be left behind. We had just met in the lobby of the New York Public Library on Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, where Hilda is a volunteer tour guide, and she was escorting us to the vast, elaborately decorated Rose Main Reading Room. Hilda doesn't walk so much as stride.  I know people 60 years her junior who are less nimble on their feet. In common with other super-agers, Hilda has retained her zest for life and knowledge. Hilda completes the New York Times crossword each day, belongs to two book clubs, goes to the opera, classical music concerts and the theatre. She also goes everywhere by foot, describing New York as a ""great city for older people"". Hilda on honeymoon with her late husband Gerry I asked Hilda what was the secret of her long and healthy life? She said: ""Pick your parents; my father died at 88, my mother at 93, so it has to be genetic."" Samples of Hilda's DNA are stored in a freezer at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. She is among more than 600 people aged over 90 who are part of theLongevity Genes Project.,external The Rose Main Reading Room of the New York Public Library, which opened in 1911 and where Hilda Jaffe is a tour guide Dr Nir Barzilai, director of the Institute for Aging, said what was striking about the group was what unhealthy lives many had lived. He told me: ""Almost 50% of them were overweight. Many were heavy smokers, did not exercise and had unhealthy diets - they did not do what their doctors said they should."" His research found several genetic variants among the group that appeared to confer protection against the diseases of ageing. He says only about one in 10,000 people is lucky enough to have these protective super-ager genes, but believes science could help the rest of us. Some pharmaceutical companies are exploring whether these genetic traits could be used to create anti-ageing drugs. For more than 60 years metformin has been used as a very cheap first-line treatment for diabetes. Now, trials in a variety of animals have shown they live healthier, longer lives. Exactly how metformin might delay the diseases of ageing is not well understood, but it appears to reduce oxidative damage and inflammation in cells. In humans, studies have linked metformin to a lower risk of heart disease, diabetes and cognitive decline. Dr Barzilai, who is also deputy scientific director of the American Federation for Aging Research (AFAR), is planning a randomised study of 3,000 adults aged 65-79 - half will take metformin tablets each day and half a placebo or dummy pill. About half the $70m dollars needed has been raised; it is hoped the six-year trial will start in 2018, but this may depend on the support of one or more wealthy philanthropists. At present, the US medicines regulator, the FDA, does not recognise ageing as a medical condition. But Dr Barzilai says if the metformin trial was successful it would provide a proof of principle that ageing can be targeted And he believes better drugs will come in the future. Another promising area of ageing research is cellular senescence - the process by which cells stop dividing. Most human cells can reproduce a limited number of times - this protects against cancer as the more cells divide, the greater the chance they will accumulate errors. Cellular senescence helps keep humans predominantly free of cancer in the first half of life. But as we age, the senescent cells accumulate, secreting inflammatory molecules that can damage neighbouring tissue and help trigger several diseases of ageing. Senescent cells congregate in tissue affected by ageing, such as the joints and eyes - and are implicated in both osteoarthritis and age-related macular degeneration. Unity Biotechnology, in California, is planning to begin human trials next year of a drug to clear senescent cells from the knee. Dr Jamie Dananberg, chief medical officer, told me: ""Osteoarthritis is a key reason why it hurts to get old. Our hope is that a single injection will alleviate pain, halt and perhaps even begin to repair the knee."" Even if the drug, which might need to be injected every few months, was partially successful, it could have huge implications for improving quality of life for those affected. Unity is also targeting eye, lung and kidney disease. These drugs are not designed to make us live longer, but to make old age less painful and more healthy - to put more life in our years. If they work, then more of us could emulate Hilda Jaffe and become super-agers. Follow Fergus onTwitter.,external What are the secrets of the superagers?

Man jailed for nightclub acid attack,"Arthur Collins had denied knowing the substance he threw was acid A man who threw acid across a packed London nightclub injuring 22 people has been jailed for 20 years. Arthur Collins, the ex-boyfriend of reality TV star Ferne McCann, threw the corrosive substance at revellers in Mangle E8 in Dalston on 17 April. The 25-year-old admitted throwing the liquid but had claimed he believed it was a date rape drug. He was sentenced at Wood Green Crown Court to 20 years in prison with an extra five years on licence. Last month he wasfound guilty of five counts of GBH with intent and nine counts of ABH. Sentencing Collins, of Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, Judge Noel Lucas QC described the crime as a ""despicable act"". Judge Lucas said: ""His defence from first to last was carefully researched and choreographed in order to explain away the evidence against him."" This video can not be played CCTV of the acid attack in London club Collins, he added, threw the acid ""irrespective of the persons on whom it landed"" and that ""his motivations for such a vicious course of conduct was nothing more than a perceived personal slight"". Addressing Collins, he said: ""You knew precisely what strong acid would do to human skin. ""Having thrown the acid over the club you slunk away and hid in the rear and pretended to be nothing to do with the mayhem you had caused. ""It was deliberate and calculated and you were intent on causing really serious harm to your victims.""

One man suffered third-degree chemical burns to the left side of the face and required a skin graft. Others had eye injuries. One of his victims Sophie Hall, from Poole, Dorset, said she had hoped for a life sentence, but felt justice had been served. She said after the sentencing: ""Arthur showed no signs of remorse in court. I have to live with my scars for life."" Judge Lucas said that security at Mangle E8 was ""poor"", adding that had it been better, the injuries and offences ""might not have happened"". The BBC has contacted the club for comment.

He was given a six-month sentence suspended for 12 months at Woolwich Crown Court for punching a man in a nightclub on 28 December 2015, and was still subject to the suspended sentence when he carried out the attack at Mangle E8.

The father of Ms McCann's child referred to the attack as a ""stupid little mistake"" during Tuesday's hearing.

Lottery winner to work on Christmas Day,"This video can not be played Lottery millionaire to work at Slough care home on Christmas Day A care home worker who won Â£1 million on the lottery says she will still do her 12-hour Christmas Day shift. Patricia Aldridge, 55, a care assistant from Wexham, near Slough, won the money after the Lotto draw on 9 December. She was announced as a new millionaire on Tuesday, along with her husband Robert, 57, who described the winnings as ""life-changing"". Mrs Aldridge said: ""You hear people say 'if I won a lot of money I'd give up work', but I love what I do."" She discovered her new riches after checking an app on her phone. ""I rang Robert, and I said 'how many zeros are there in a million? I think I've won a million pounds,' said Mrs Aldridge. She will continue to work at the elderly people's care home in Slough despite her millionaire raffle win, where she will do her 08:00 GMT to 20:00 GMT shift on 25 December. Mr Aldridge, a site manager at a school, will also not be giving up work. He said: ""We'll still be the same people.

Toys R Us future in UK plunged into doubt,"Toys R Us's future in the UK has been plunged into doubt after the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) said it would vote against the company's rescue plan. The retailer was told to put Â£9m into its struggling pension fund by the PPF in order for it to support the toy retailer's restructuring plan. Failure to agree a deal could put all its 3,200 staff at risk of redundancy. The PPF's Malcolm Weir said it believed it was ""reasonable"" to seek guarantees on the pension scheme's future. ""Since the company lodged the CVA [company voluntary agreement] proposals we have spent significant time and effort, with the help of PwC, assessing the current and future financial position of the company to ensure the pension scheme would not be weakened by the CVA, leading to an even bigger claim on the PPF and its levy payers further down the line,"" said Mr Weir. ""Given the position of the company, we strongly believe seeking assurances for the pension scheme is reasonable given the deficit in the scheme and questions about the overall position of the company."" Toy sellers bet on Christmas as sales dip Why did Toys R Us fall from grace? Mr Weir did give Toys R Us a glimmer of hope, adding: ""We remain in dialogue with the company and their advisers and we are able to amend our vote if suitable assurances are provided."" Before the PPF announcement, Toys R Us reassured shoppers seeking last-minute presents by saying: ""There will be no disruption for customers shopping through the Christmas and New Year period."" The deadline for the vote on the CVA, which allows the firm to restructure its finances, is on Thursday. If the CVA does not go through, the company could fall into administration. Retail consultant Richard Hymantold the Today programmeit was a ""real Catch 22 situation"", as it left Toys R Us having to choose between the futures of its past or present employees. Meanwhile, Frank Field, chairman of the Work and Pensions select committee, has written to Toys R Us managing director Stephen Knights, querying two consecutive years of big rises in executive pay. Mr Field asked how the pay increase was ""justified at a time of operating losses"" and how the board decided to distribute resources between executive pay and employees' pension benefits. The toy retailer started in the US in the 1950s It reached the UK in 1985, as a subsidiary of the US chain, when it opened five stores It launched its UK website in 1996 The retailer now has 105 stores around the UK Its flagship stores are at London's Brent Cross shopping centre and in Bristol It's workers versus pensioners; a choice between the present and the future. The Pensions Protection Fund has become one of Toys R Us's biggest creditors as it takes over the voting rights of pension trustees in restructuring situations. If the PPF backs the rescue without further financial assurances for the pension fund, pensioners could be affected in future, and its warnings would be seen as meaningless. In many cases, it's a false choice; current employees are paying into the pension fund which they one day hope to live off. The PPF is said to be aware of its responsibility in this case, but its role is to protect members of the pension scheme and the other funds. A ""no"" vote doesn't mean administration is certain for Toys R Us; it could propose a new restructuring plan, one the PPF can back. Talks are taking place so a solution can be found. The PPF is clearly trying to say that companies can't treat pension funds as an inconvenient afterthought. Toy industry expert Peter Jenkinson did offer some hope to the company, if it can resolve its current difficulties. ""The toy industry was in rude health in the UK last year,""he told BBC 5 live Breakfast. ""Toys R Us does suffer because it has some very big stores in prime locations and the rent has gone up. ""Its in-store activity has been found wanting a little bit compared with other toy retailers and it has fallen behind. ""However, if the restructuring goes through then some of its stores could thrive. There are stores I've been into over the last month that have really started to up their game. ""The UK toy industry is behind them and wants to see them survive in some format. ""Buying toys is as much as of an experience as playing with them and taking a trip out to the toy shop is starting to come back into fashion.""

Leak found on new Â£3.1bn aircraft carrier,"HMS Queen Elizabeth sailed into Portsmouth in August following preparations at the naval base The UK's new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, is leaking because of a faulty seal. The Royal Navy's future flagship, which was commissioned by the Queen earlier this month in Portsmouth, has a problem with one of its propeller shafts. The fault on the Â£3.1bn carrier was first identified during sea trials. A Royal Navy spokesman said the ship was scheduled for repair and the fault did not prevent it from sailing again early in the new year. According to the Sun newspaper,HMS Queen Elizabeth has been taking on up to 200 litres of sea water every hour,externalbecause of the fault. BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said the problem was ""highly embarrassing"" for the Royal Navy and just one of a number of snags still to be rectified. A Royal Navy spokesman said ""an issue"" with a shaft seal had been identified during HMS Queen Elizabeth's sea trial and a repair was scheduled for when the carrier was in Portsmouth. He added: ""It does not prevent her from sailing again and her sea trials programme will not be affected."" The commissioning ceremony took place on 7 December By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent The Royal Navy is trying to play down the problem, after first trying to hide it. It is clearly embarrassing. They have known about the problem for some time but they did not want it to get in the way of the commissioning ceremony in front of the Queen. The truth is similar leaks in other warships are not unusual and can be fixed relatively easily. The difference this time though is the scale of HMS Queen Elizabeth and the fact it has just been handed over to the navy. The big question is whether the leak can be fixed while it is still in the water. The navy insists the job can be done without her going back to dry dock, which would be costly and add to delays. Either way, the navy insists the fault will have to be rectified and paid for by the contractors, along with a list of other ""snags"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said the cost of the repair would be funded by the contractors that built it. He added: ""This is the reason why we have the sea trials, to make sure that everything is working absolutely perfectly. This is something that work is currently ongoing to deal with."" HMS Queen Elizabeth was built by the Aircraft Carrier Alliance, a grouping of BAE Systems, Babcock and Thales. Blocks were completed at six yards - Govan and Scotstoun in Glasgow, Appledore, Cammell Laird in Liverpool, A&P in Newcastle and Portsmouth - before being assembled at Rosyth Dockyard in Fife. BAE Systems, which confirmed the affected section was built at its site in Govan, said the repair would be done in the new year and take a few days. The company said: ""It is normal practice for a volume of work and defect resolution to continue following vessel acceptance. This will be completed prior to the nation's flagship recommencing her programme at sea in 2018."" The maximum amount of water the carrier is said to be taking on every hour is 200 litres - the capacity of fish tank measuring 100cm x 50cm x 40cm. Rear Admiral Chris Parry, a former director of operational capability at the Ministry of Defence, said the headlines were ""very embarrassing"" but the leak ""in reality is no big deal"". ""You expect to take some water in when you're operating a warship at sea,"" he told the BBC, adding that was why they are equipped with pumps. He said: ""It's been out for sea trials, it's been under pressure. They've been testing all their systems to the extremes and I'm afraid to say this is what happens at sea."" The 900ft (280m) long HMS Queen Elizabeth entered its home port of Portsmouth for the first time in August after starting two months of sea trials from Rosyth. It is the first of the UK's new generation of aircraft carriers. A second carrier,HMS Prince of Wales, is externally completebut it will take 18 months to fit its internal systems at Rosyth and it will be 2019 before the ship can begin sea trials. News of the leak comes after MPs raised concerns over the costs of the F-35 jet aircraft that will fly off HMS Queen Elizabeth. This video can not be played HMS Queen Elizabeth takes to the sea The UK has begun a Â£9.1bn programme to buy 48 of the F-35s by 2025 from US giant Lockheed Martin. Butthe Commons defence select committee said there had been an ""unacceptable lack of transparency"" over the jets,external, with one estimate suggesting each plane would cost more than Â£150m. UFO spotted by US fighter jet pilots Steepest railway opens in Switzerland HMS Queen Elizabeth cannot currently deploy planes but the Lightning fighter jets are due to make their first trial flights from the carrier's deck next year, with 120 air crew being trained in the US. Anew national shipbuilding strategywas unveiled by then Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon in September. The government has said it plans to buy at least five new Type 31e frigates by 2023, and share the work between shipyards across the country. The first batch of new ships will bolster the Royal Navy fleet, but it is hoped foreign navies will buy ships from the UK in future.

Uber a 'danger to public safety',"Uber drivers work ""excessive hours"", making the taxi app service a danger to public safety, a union has warned. The GMB Union told Westminster Magistrates' Court it had evidence that Uber ""encourages and incentivises"" its drivers to work long hours. The hearing will determine whether the union can take part in the taxi app's battle to renew its London licence. An Uber spokeperson said it would ""shortly be introducing hours limits"" for drivers in its app. It said that on average, drivers spent 30 hours a week logged into its app. ""We take the issue of tired driving seriously, which is why we regularly remind drivers to take rest breaks,"" Uber added. In September, Transport for London deemed Uber unfit to run a taxi service andrefused to renew its licence. Taxi drivers have been campaigning against Uber, such as engaging in this ""go slow"" protest in 2014 GMB representative Gerry Facenna told the court that it wanted Uber to introduce a maximum hours cap for drivers, as well as a limit on how many drivers can operate in one area at the same time. ""From a public safety point of view, being driven around London by a driver who has worked a 15-hour shift is no better than being driven around by a driver who has not had background checks,"" he added. Around 2,000 of GMB Union's members are Uber drivers. In February 2017, the Commons Work and Pensions Select Committee heard evidence from Uber drivers who said they were forced to work long hours to cover their costs, which included the purchase of their cars. In response to the committee's request on driver hours, Uber said last month that over a quarter of its drivers used the app for more than 40 hours a week and more than 2,000 drivers used the app for more than 60 hours. Transport for London cited ""public safety and security"" concerns - including Uber's approach to carrying out background checks on drivers and reporting serious criminal offences - for its decision to remove Uber's operating license. Uber's licence expired in October but its drivers can continue to operate in the capital while it pursues an appeal. The mayor of London Sadiq Khan has warned thatthe appeal process could ""go on for a number of years"".

Diversity targets for judges 'wrong' approach,"The government is committed to exposing injustice, says David Lidington Setting targets to hire judges from ethnic minority backgrounds would be the ""wrong way"" to solve the issue of diversity, says the justice secretary. David Lidington has outlined steps to tackle ""race bias"" in the legal system in England and Wales, followinga damning report from MP David Lammy. But the minister says the government needs to ""look at the critical path"" into the law - rather than targets. Mr Lammy said he was ""disappointed"" with the government's response. Ethnic minority offenders 'face bias' Young offender: 'I'm done with fighting' Justice system near 'breaking point' The Lammy Review,external, published in September, said that people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds make up 25% of the prison population and 41% of the youth justice system - but only 14% of the general population. Ethnic minority groups make up only 11% of magistrates and 7% of judges. As a result, Mr Lammy had called for a national target to achieve representation in the courts by 2025. David Lammy made 35 recommendations to reform the criminal justice system However, Mr Lidington said a target would be ""the wrong way to attack this particular objective"" and he was looking at alternatives. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""When you look at the judges, you have got a group of people who have been practising in law perhaps for 20 years... because we need people who are experienced, who are expert, to sit on the bench. ""In getting a more diverse judiciary... you need to look at the critical path of how do people get into the legal profession in the first place."" Mr Lammy disagreed and instead called for a ""bold approach"". The Tottenham MP told the BBC: ""It is not about the pipeline. BAME (Black, Asian, and minority ethnic) lawyers are applying to join the judiciary. ""If you set a target or a goal, then it concentrates the mind to achieve that. But the government has not affected that. ""The UK is behind the curve on diversity and it needs to catch up."" This video can not be played Watch: Are ethnic minorities treated fairly? Lawyer and diversity campaigner Funke Abimbola was also disappointed with the decision, telling Today: ""It is an important element of [the recommendations] because bias in the judiciary has a direct impact on decision-making. ""This whole report was about there being proven bias against those minority ethnic backgrounds. [Targets are] a key part in driving diversity of thought, which impacts decisions in court."" By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The government's response to David Lammy's proposals suggests it's following them in spirit - but not to the letter. Many of the recommendations relate to changes to data collection, which should be relatively straightforward to implement. The harder task set by Mr Lammy involves increasing diversity, so those who work in the criminal justice system better reflect and understand the people who use it. Although ministers have agreed challenging targets to raise ethnic minority representation among prison officers, they've balked at doing the same for judges and magistrates. The experience of the police service, which failed to meet 10-year BME targets set in 1999 after the Macpherson report, may have influenced their decision. Targets can help focus efforts in achieving a goal - but if they're too stretching, they may prove counter-productive. The Lammy Review concluded that people from minority backgrounds still faced bias, ""including overt discrimination"", in parts of the justice system. Mr Lidington pledged to implement a ""key principle"" of ""change or explain"" when racial discrimination is found in the system. ""Where we cannot explain differences in outcomes for different groups, we will reform,"" he said, pledging to work on each of Mr Lammy's 35 recommendations - even if not following them to the letter. And he added this was the ""very first step"" in a change of attitude towards race disparity ""that will touch on every part of the criminal justice system for years to come"". Withinthe government's response,external, it said it would: Collect wider datasets related to ethnicity for more accurate analysis Publish more datasets so the public can see the reality Review use of ""gang"" prosecutions for those who are victims and exploited by adults Review modern slavery legislation to see how it could help with gang crime Redact, where possible, identifying information to make ""race-blind decisions"" Investigate better ways of explaining legal rights and options to build trust Assess maturity of young offenders over 18 Recruit a more diverse workforce in prisons and help people move to more senior roles Consider sealing criminal records Trial deferred prosecutions - where offenders can avoid trial when admitting the offence - in London Some of the changes would take longer to achieve than others, the Ministry of Justice said. But it had already made progress on several recommendations, including publishing data on race bias in the system. It said a new race and ethnicity board would drive through the reforms - but alternative approaches would be found where proposals could not be implemented in full.

Corbyn: We'll probably gain power in 2018,"Mr Corbyn insisted the adulation of his supporters will 'never' go to his head Jeremy Corbyn believes there is likely to be another election in ""the next 12 months"" and Labour will ""probably"" win it with a majority. ""I'm ready to be prime minister tomorrow,"" the Labour leader told Grazia in what it billed ashis first interview with a women's magazine.,external It comes as Mr Corbyn's ally Diane Abbott predicted that Labour would take a ""decisive"" opinion poll lead in 2018. Mostrecent polls,externalput the party neck-and-neck with the Conservatives. But Ms Abbott told BBC Newsnight she expected Labour to ""move ahead of this government steadily and surely as next year unravels"" and said there was likely to be another election. Mr Corbyn said another election was ""quite possible"" in his Grazia interview. Asked if the public were ready for another election, he said the Conservatives did not have ""much confidence in being able to command a majority in parliament"" so  ""I think the country would want an election in order to bring about some degree of stability"". He added: ""I think we'd probably win it, with a majority... we're working very hard on that."" This video can not be played Labour 'to move decisively ahead' He was also quizzed about Brexit and whether he backed his predecessor as Labour leader - and long time adversary - Tony Blair's call for a second EU referendum because of the way the Leave campaign had been conducted. He said: ""Some were extremely irresponsible in what they did and said, but we have to recognise it was the largest participation of people in an electoral process ever in Britain and they chose to leave."" Asked if he thought people had cast their votes on the basis of false promises, he said: ""People still voted as they did. Yes, I thought there were some ridiculous and exaggerated claims made and I said so at the time."" GQ editor criticises cover star Corbyn But he ruled out campaigning for a second referendum, saying: ""I think we should continue putting pressure on the government to allow a transition period to develop, because at the moment we're in danger of getting into a complete mess in March 2019 (the date Britain leaves the EU)."" Mr Corbyn also said he had not heard many ""whispers"" about sexual harassment at Westminster before the current scandal - and he had been ""horrified and appalled by it all"". He told the magazine he was ""utterly determined all Labour Party events should be a safe place for women to go to"". The Labour leader says Meghan Markle is clearly 'a decent person' On Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, Mr Corbyn - a long-time republican - said ""she's clearly a very decent person"". Asked about the cost of the wedding, he said: ""Weddings come pretty pricey, I understand, but I think the cost should be borne by the family themselves."" He said his own wedding, to third wife Laura Alvarez, which took place in in a country hotel in Mexico in 2013, ""didn't cost very much at all"". The Royal family will pay for Prince Harry's wedding, including the church service, the music, the flowers and the reception but the security costs will be picked up by taxpayers, the Palace has said. Is Mr Corbyn a Steppenwolf fan? The Labour leader was interviewed en route to Geneva, in Switzerland, where he was giving a speech to the United Nations and receiving an award from the International Peace Bureau for ""his political work for disarmament and peace"". He insisted the adulation shown by his supporters at events like Glastonbury would ""never"" go to his head. Asked if he ever sang ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" - the chant that followed him wherever he went over the summer - in the shower, he revealed an apparent fondness for a 50-year-old biker anthem by American rockers Steppenwolf.

Grandparents plea for abducted girl,"Jessica Richards took her daughter after she was placed into care by the local authority The grandparents of a girl abducted by her mother, who has schizophrenia, have pleaded for her return. Elliana Shand, who is four on Tuesday, and her mother, Jessica Richards, 26, disappeared from London in May. Her grandfather told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme Ms Richards was ""a very good mum"" but unwell. The judge overseeing the case said Ms Richards could be in the grip of hallucinations and might pose a ""very real risk"" to Elliana. The child was placed in the care of her paternal grandparents, Sean and Eileen Doyle, in May, after social services staff at Barking and Dagenham Council intervened. Last month, in an unusual move, Mr Justice Hayden released Elliana's name and photograph in the hope that someone could help locate her. The judge, who has been overseeing Elliana's case at the family division of the High Court, said evidence showed Elliana had travelled with her maternal grandmother, Sharon Shand, to Jamaica. It is thought she also went to the USA, Sweden and Spain. Mr Doyle said they had lost track of their granddaughter in Spain but thought she could be in London. ""We've got no idea where she is, which is frustrating in this day and age,"" he said. Mr Justice Hayden said Ms Richards, who has schizophrenia and obsessive compulsive disorder, ""under stress, no longer taking her anti-psychotic mediation, perhaps in the grip of auditory hallucinations... poses a very real risk to her daughter's safety"". He also described the relationship between Ms Richards and her daughter as very warm and affectionate. ""Her mum's a very good mum, she's just not very well. We want to find them both, but we genuinely don't know where they are,"" Mr Doyle said. ""We're grandparents. Our job is to look after our grandkids, it's a good job to have, and we just want to look after her. ""We're not at any stage trying to take her child, our job is to look after her until she's better."" The couple have been distributing leaflets and missing posters in areas where they think she could be, including Godalming in Surrey, north-west London and west London. Mr and Mrs Doyle have urged anyone with information of Elliana's location to call the police Both they and the judge have asked people to contact the police immediately if they know where Elliana is. Appealing directly to Ms Richards, Mrs Doyle said: ""Please give us a ring, let us hear Elliana's voice, let us know you're both OK, let's talk, we're happy to have a meeting."" Mr Doyle added: ""We know them, we know they're not bad people, we're just in a situation that's escalated out of control that has got to the highest court in the land, it's bizarre that we're even there.""

Pigeon spikes on trees 'idiotic',"The spikes were put in place to prevent birds pooing on cars Anti-pigeon spikes placed on tree branches to stop birds pooing on cars have been branded ""idiotic"". The spikes on Pembroke Road, Clifton, Bristol, were erected by the management company of nearby Bartlett Court flats to protect residents' ""expensive cars"". Hillcrest Estate Management said the trees attract roosting pigeons and it needs to protect vehicles at the ""prestigious development"". But wildlife experts have criticised the move. Nature writer Jennifer Garrett said the spikes were a ""war on wildlife"" on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Another Twitter user criticised residents for not using a ""sponge and bucket"" to clean their cars. And Mike Dilger, wildlife reporter for The One Show, said: ""It's another example of a small number of people who live in the city and want the city aseptic and void of wildlife. ""They're anaesthetised to nature."" However, one resident, who did not want to be named, said the spikes ""don't prevent other wildlife"" and the trees are ""full of squirrels"". ""It's quite hard to wash cars out here because there's no washing facilities so it's quite a problem for residents,"" they added. Hillcrest Estate Management said it had tried a number of measures to deter the pigeons, including fake birds and noise deterrents, but had little success and installed the spikes in 2014. The firm added: ""Bird detritus can cause permanent damage to the paintwork on cars if not removed promptly and the worst affected leaseholders wanted action taken to try and improve the situation.""

Corbyn: I'll probably be PM next year,"Mr Corbyn insisted the adulation of his supporters will 'never' go to his head Jeremy Corbyn believes there is likely to be another election in ""the next 12 months"" and Labour will ""probably"" win it with a majority. ""I'm ready to be prime minister tomorrow,"" the Labour leader told Grazia in what it billed ashis first interview with a women's magazine.,external It comes as Mr Corbyn's ally Diane Abbott predicted that Labour would take a ""decisive"" opinion poll lead in 2018. Mostrecent polls,externalput the party neck-and-neck with the Conservatives. But Ms Abbott told BBC Newsnight she expected Labour to ""move ahead of this government steadily and surely as next year unravels"" and said there was likely to be another election. Mr Corbyn said another election was ""quite possible"" in his Grazia interview. Asked if the public were ready for another election, he said the Conservatives did not have ""much confidence in being able to command a majority in parliament"" so  ""I think the country would want an election in order to bring about some degree of stability"". He added: ""I think we'd probably win it, with a majority... we're working very hard on that."" This video can not be played Labour 'to move decisively ahead' He was also quizzed about Brexit and whether he backed his predecessor as Labour leader - and long time adversary - Tony Blair's call for a second EU referendum because of the way the Leave campaign had been conducted. He said: ""Some were extremely irresponsible in what they did and said, but we have to recognise it was the largest participation of people in an electoral process ever in Britain and they chose to leave."" Asked if he thought people had cast their votes on the basis of false promises, he said: ""People still voted as they did. Yes, I thought there were some ridiculous and exaggerated claims made and I said so at the time."" GQ editor criticises cover star Corbyn But he ruled out campaigning for a second referendum, saying: ""I think we should continue putting pressure on the government to allow a transition period to develop, because at the moment we're in danger of getting into a complete mess in March 2019 (the date Britain leaves the EU)."" Mr Corbyn also said he had not heard many ""whispers"" about sexual harassment at Westminster before the current scandal - and he had been ""horrified and appalled by it all"". He told the magazine he was ""utterly determined all Labour Party events should be a safe place for women to go to"". The Labour leader says Meghan Markle is clearly 'a decent person' On Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding, Mr Corbyn - a long-time republican - said ""she's clearly a very decent person"". Asked about the cost of the wedding, he said: ""Weddings come pretty pricey, I understand, but I think the cost should be borne by the family themselves."" He said his own wedding, to third wife Laura Alvarez, which took place in in a country hotel in Mexico in 2013, ""didn't cost very much at all"". The Royal family will pay for Prince Harry's wedding, including the church service, the music, the flowers and the reception but the security costs will be picked up by taxpayers, the Palace has said. Is Mr Corbyn a Steppenwolf fan? The Labour leader was interviewed en route to Geneva, in Switzerland, where he was giving a speech to the United Nations and receiving an award from the International Peace Bureau for ""his political work for disarmament and peace"". He insisted the adulation shown by his supporters at events like Glastonbury would ""never"" go to his head. Asked if he ever sang ""Oh Jeremy Corbyn"" - the chant that followed him wherever he went over the summer - in the shower, he revealed an apparent fondness for a 50-year-old biker anthem by American rockers Steppenwolf. ""I'm more likely to sing Born To Be Wild,"" said the Labour leader.

Bomb squad called to terror raid house,"Police and the bomb disposal unit were seen outside a property in Chesterfield, Derbyshire Action has been taken against an alleged Islamist terror plot in the UK that could have happened at Christmas, counter terrorism sources say. Four men were arrested early on Tuesday in South Yorkshire and Derbyshire. An Army bomb disposal team cordoned off a street in Chesterfield where a 31-year-old man was arrested. Nearby homes were evacuated. Three other men aged 22, 36 and 41 were arrested in the Burngreave and Meersbrook areas of Sheffield. All four suspects were detained on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism under Section 41 ofthe Terrorism Act 2000,external. They have been taken to a police station in West Yorkshire for questioning. The cordon in Chesterfield was later lifted. This video can not be played Elizabeth Fogarty lives on the street where a raid by police took place this morning The cordon around one of the properties - the Fatima community centre on Brunswick Road in Burngreave - was extended on Tuesday afternoon and the bomb disposal unit attended. A large number of police vehicles and officers were outside the two-storey building. The main door appeared to be broken on the ground. Five raids at houses took place on Tuesday at: Shirebrook Road in Meersbrook, Sheffield two addresses in Burngreave, Sheffield - including Fatima Community Centre on Brunswick Road a house on King Street North in Chesterfield an address in Stocksbridge Four men were arrested - all at their home addresses. one in Chesterfield two in Burngreave one in Meersbrook At 21:30 GMT, police said searches had been stood down for the evening but would resume at the scenes in Burngreave and Chesterfield in the morning. A neighbour in Shirebrook Road, Sheffield, reported hearing ""an enormous bang"" as one of the raids took place at 05:30. Carol Perry, who lives two doors from the scene, said: ""I was asleep and then I was woken suddenly... and the house shook. ""My immediate thought was that it was an earthquake."" A large police presence could be seen outside the Fatima community centre in Sheffield A spokeswoman from Counter Terrorism Policing North East said: ""The public may have heard a loud bang at the time as police entered one of the properties, but it was not an explosion. ""[We] would like to reassure them that it was part of the method to gain entry to the property."" Retired Joan Miller, 63, who lives opposite the run-down house, said she looked out of her window to see many plain-clothed armed officers in the street. Ms Miller said: ""[There] was very loud bang. It shook the house. ""I pulled the curtains and saw lots of armed men in the street, so I kept watching because that was quite extraordinary."" Police and Army activity is continuing in Chesterfield She said the officers shouted ""very abruptly"" for people to stay in their homes. Elizabeth Fogarty, who lives across the road from the house in Meersbrook, said: ""I've only recently moved up from London. ""One of the reasons we moved up north to Sheffield is because we felt quite nervous living in London with all the terrorist attacks taking place."" There are two types of terrorism raids in the UK.  Many occur very quietly as detectives knock on the door and take the suspect into custody under normal police powers. Then there are the full-on raids where doors or windows have to be knocked in, cordons set up and the bomb squad called. Such operations are only ever mounted because secret intelligence - perhaps from an intercepted communication and often only fragmentary - suggests there is something at a property they need to get to the bottom of. None of which is proof that any of those who have been arrested have committed an offence - but officers now have up to 14 days, subject to court oversight, to build a case. One of their priorities is likely to be forensically examining phones. All recent major terrorism investigations have turned on not just what officers found during searches, but what they uncovered from online lives. Supt Una Jennings of South Yorkshire Police said: ""I understand our local communities will have concerns about this morning's police activity but I want to offer my reassurance that we will continue to serve and protect the public of South Yorkshire."" Derbyshire's Assistant Chief Constable Bill McWilliam said: ""We of course understand that police activity of this nature can be unsettling.

Queen at aircraft carrier ceremony,"This video can not be played The Queen commissions aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth The Queen has officially welcomed the UK's new aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, at a ceremony to commission it into the Royal Navy fleet. The monarch boarded her namesake ship in Portsmouth to see the Royal Navy White Ensign raised on the vessel for the first time. Princess Anne, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones also attended. The ceremony took place on the giant hangar deck of the Â£3.1bn carrier. HMS Queen Elizabeth and its sister ship HMS Prince of Wales are the most expensive in the Royal Navy's history. HMS Queen Elizabeth sailed into Portsmouth in August following extensive preparations at the naval base. The navy initially estimated both ships would cost Â£3.5bn to build butthe total figure was revised to Â£6.2bn. Latest updates as HMS Queen Elizabeth enters service About 3,700 guests attended the event, which came more than three years after the vessel's official naming ceremony in Rosyth when the Queen broke a bottle of whisky on its hull. During the ceremony, the commissioning warrant was read, and the Blue Ensign, which has been flying from the ship until it is formally handed over to the Royal Navy, was replaced with the White Ensign, raised by 20-year-old Able Seaman Ellie Smith from Hull. Addressing the assembled guests and ship's company, The Queen described the ship as ""the most powerful and capable ship ever to raise the White Ensign"". ""At the forefront of these responsibilities will be the men and women of the Royal Navy, the Royal Marines, supported by the Army, Royal Air Force and by coalition partners. ""As the daughter, wife and mother of naval officers, I recognise the unique demands our nation asks of you and I will always value my special link to HMS Queen Elizabeth, her ship's company and their families,"" she said. The White Ensign was raised to symbolised the ship's commissioning into the fleet Admiral Sir Philip Jones, said: ""We have been on a long, complicated - but committed - journey to get to this point and commissioning the ship is a key milestone. ""The point of the big grey ship is it's enormously big, flexible, capable and adaptable."" As part of the ceremony, a8ft-long (2.44m) cake replica of the shipwas cut. As is traditional, it was carried out by the youngest member of the ship's company - Callum Hui, 17 - and the captain's wife Dr Karen Kyd. Callum Hui and Dr Karen Kyd cut the cake at the commissioning of HMS Queen Elizabeth. By Jonathan Beale, Defence Correspondent This is a big day for the Royal Navy. A chance to look to the future and, at least for a moment, forget about recent defence cuts and fears of even more. After successfully completing her sea trials HMS Queen Elizabeth will be commissioned into service. For the first time she'll raise the White Ensign - officially becoming a Royal Navy Warship.  But, this is still another milestone not the end of her journey. Flight trials will begin next year and her first proper deployment with jets on board isn't planned until 2021. It's also still not clear how many of the new F35 jets she'll carry. Certainly fewer than the 36 she was built for, with each jet costing around Â£100m. The Royal Navy believes the carrier - the first of two - will be a potent symbol of British military power.  But it's already struggling with limited resources. Capt Jerry Kyd called the ceremony the ""culmination of a number of years of real excitement"". He said: ""The first sailing from Rosyth was only nine months ago, we have come a long way. ""The first entry into Portsmouth was in the summer and here we are today accepting the ship into Her Majesty's fleet formally. ""So, it is right at the top, it is the latest milestone, many more to come, but hugely exciting and a very proud day."" This video can not be played The moment HMS Queen Elizabeth entered Portsmouth Harbour The 900ft-long (280m) carrier cannot currently deploy planes but F-35B Lightning fighter jets are due to make their first trial flights from the carrier's deck next year, with 120 air crew currently training in the US. Preparations for the arrival of the flagship of the fleet and its 700-strong company led to more than 20,000 items, ranging froma human skull to sea mines, dredged upfrom Portsmouth Harbour. The Ministry of Defence said specialist dredging vessels had removed 3.2 million cubic metres of sediment -  equivalent to 1,280 Olympic swimming pools - during the dredging operation carried out to deepen the harbour mouth to enable the Queen Elizabeth to reach Portsmouth naval base.

"Toys R Us troubles put 3,200 jobs at risk","Toys R Us's future in the UK has been plunged into doubt after the Pension Protection Fund (PPF) said it would vote against the company's rescue plan. The retailer was told to put Â£9m into its struggling pension fund by the PPF in order for it to support the toy retailer's restructuring plan. Failure to agree a deal could put all its 3,200 staff at risk of redundancy. The PPF's Malcolm Weir said it believed it was ""reasonable"" to seek guarantees on the pension scheme's future. ""Since the company lodged the CVA [company voluntary agreement] proposals we have spent significant time and effort, with the help of PwC, assessing the current and future financial position of the company to ensure the pension scheme would not be weakened by the CVA, leading to an even bigger claim on the PPF and its levy payers further down the line,"" said Mr Weir. ""Given the position of the company, we strongly believe seeking assurances for the pension scheme is reasonable given the deficit in the scheme and questions about the overall position of the company."" Toy sellers bet on Christmas as sales dip Why did Toys R Us fall from grace? Mr Weir did give Toys R Us a glimmer of hope, adding: ""We remain in dialogue with the company and their advisers and we are able to amend our vote if suitable assurances are provided."" Before the PPF announcement, Toys R Us reassured shoppers seeking last-minute presents by saying: ""There will be no disruption for customers shopping through the Christmas and New Year period."" The deadline for the vote on the CVA, which allows the firm to restructure its finances, is on Thursday. If the CVA does not go through, the company could fall into administration. Retail consultant Richard Hymantold the Today programmeit was a ""real Catch 22 situation"", as it left Toys R Us having to choose between the futures of its past or present employees. Meanwhile, Frank Field, chairman of the Work and Pensions select committee, has written to Toys R Us managing director Stephen Knights, querying two consecutive years of big rises in executive pay. Mr Field asked how the pay increase was ""justified at a time of operating losses"" and how the board decided to distribute resources between executive pay and employees' pension benefits. The toy retailer started in the US in the 1950s It reached the UK in 1985, as a subsidiary of the US chain, when it opened five stores It launched its UK website in 1996 The retailer now has 105 stores around the UK Its flagship stores are at London's Brent Cross shopping centre and in Bristol It's workers versus pensioners; a choice between the present and the future. The Pensions Protection Fund has become one of Toys R Us's biggest creditors as it takes over the voting rights of pension trustees in restructuring situations. If the PPF backs the rescue without further financial assurances for the pension fund, pensioners could be affected in future, and its warnings would be seen as meaningless. In many cases, it's a false choice; current employees are paying into the pension fund which they one day hope to live off. The PPF is said to be aware of its responsibility in this case, but its role is to protect members of the pension scheme and the other funds. A ""no"" vote doesn't mean administration is certain for Toys R Us; it could propose a new restructuring plan, one the PPF can back. Talks are taking place so a solution can be found. The PPF is clearly trying to say that companies can't treat pension funds as an inconvenient afterthought. Toy industry expert Peter Jenkinson did offer some hope to the company, if it can resolve its current difficulties. ""The toy industry was in rude health in the UK last year,""he told BBC 5 live Breakfast. ""Toys R Us does suffer because it has some very big stores in prime locations and the rent has gone up. ""Its in-store activity has been found wanting a little bit compared with other toy retailers and it has fallen behind. ""However, if the restructuring goes through then some of its stores could thrive. There are stores I've been into over the last month that have really started to up their game. ""The UK toy industry is behind them and wants to see them survive in some format. ""Buying toys is as much as of an experience as playing with them and taking a trip out to the toy shop is starting to come back into fashion.""

"Lib Dems 'broke referendum finance rules'The Electoral Commission fines the Lib Dems Â£18,000 over the way spending was reported.1han hour agoUK Politics","The Liberal Democrats campaigned for Remain in the EU referendum The Liberal Democrats have been fined Â£18,000 for breaking spending rules in last year's EU referendum.

'Change or explain' vow for race bias,"The government is committed to exposing injustice, says David Lidington Setting targets to hire judges from ethnic minority backgrounds would be the ""wrong way"" to solve the issue of diversity, says the justice secretary. David Lidington has outlined steps to tackle ""race bias"" in the legal system in England and Wales, followinga damning report from MP David Lammy. But the minister says the government needs to ""look at the critical path"" into the law - rather than targets. Mr Lammy said he was ""disappointed"" with the government's response. Ethnic minority offenders 'face bias' Young offender: 'I'm done with fighting' Justice system near 'breaking point' The Lammy Review,external, published in September, said that people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds make up 25% of the prison population and 41% of the youth justice system - but only 14% of the general population. Ethnic minority groups make up only 11% of magistrates and 7% of judges. As a result, Mr Lammy had called for a national target to achieve representation in the courts by 2025. David Lammy made 35 recommendations to reform the criminal justice system However, Mr Lidington said a target would be ""the wrong way to attack this particular objective"" and he was looking at alternatives. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""When you look at the judges, you have got a group of people who have been practising in law perhaps for 20 years... because we need people who are experienced, who are expert, to sit on the bench. ""In getting a more diverse judiciary... you need to look at the critical path of how do people get into the legal profession in the first place."" Mr Lammy disagreed and instead called for a ""bold approach"". The Tottenham MP told the BBC: ""It is not about the pipeline. BAME (Black, Asian, and minority ethnic) lawyers are applying to join the judiciary. ""If you set a target or a goal, then it concentrates the mind to achieve that. But the government has not affected that. ""The UK is behind the curve on diversity and it needs to catch up."" This video can not be played Watch: Are ethnic minorities treated fairly? Lawyer and diversity campaigner Funke Abimbola was also disappointed with the decision, telling Today: ""It is an important element of [the recommendations] because bias in the judiciary has a direct impact on decision-making. ""This whole report was about there being proven bias against those minority ethnic backgrounds. [Targets are] a key part in driving diversity of thought, which impacts decisions in court."" By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The government's response to David Lammy's proposals suggests it's following them in spirit - but not to the letter. Many of the recommendations relate to changes to data collection, which should be relatively straightforward to implement. The harder task set by Mr Lammy involves increasing diversity, so those who work in the criminal justice system better reflect and understand the people who use it. Although ministers have agreed challenging targets to raise ethnic minority representation among prison officers, they've balked at doing the same for judges and magistrates. The experience of the police service, which failed to meet 10-year BME targets set in 1999 after the Macpherson report, may have influenced their decision. Targets can help focus efforts in achieving a goal - but if they're too stretching, they may prove counter-productive. The Lammy Review concluded that people from minority backgrounds still faced bias, ""including overt discrimination"", in parts of the justice system. Mr Lidington pledged to implement a ""key principle"" of ""change or explain"" when racial discrimination is found in the system. ""Where we cannot explain differences in outcomes for different groups, we will reform,"" he said, pledging to work on each of Mr Lammy's 35 recommendations - even if not following them to the letter. And he added this was the ""very first step"" in a change of attitude towards race disparity ""that will touch on every part of the criminal justice system for years to come"". Withinthe government's response,external, it said it would: Collect wider datasets related to ethnicity for more accurate analysis Publish more datasets so the public can see the reality Review use of ""gang"" prosecutions for those who are victims and exploited by adults Review modern slavery legislation to see how it could help with gang crime Redact, where possible, identifying information to make ""race-blind decisions"" Investigate better ways of explaining legal rights and options to build trust Assess maturity of young offenders over 18 Recruit a more diverse workforce in prisons and help people move to more senior roles Consider sealing criminal records Trial deferred prosecutions - where offenders can avoid trial when admitting the offence - in London Some of the changes would take longer to achieve than others, the Ministry of Justice said. But it had already made progress on several recommendations, including publishing data on race bias in the system. It said a new race and ethnicity board would drive through the reforms - but alternative approaches would be found where proposals could not be implemented in full.

Dead K-pop star 'consumed by depression',"""The life of fame was never meant for me,"" the note said A note said to have been written by K-pop superstar Jonghyun has been posted on social media by his close friend, revealing a struggle with depression. ""The depression that was slowly devouring me at last consumed me,"" said the note, posted by fellow singer Nine. Jonghyun, 27, was found dead on Monday in a suspected suicide. He was the lead singer of one of South Korea's biggest pop groups SHINee. His death has triggered an outpouring of grief from fans around the world. Groups of distraught and tearful fans gathered at the Seoul hospital On Tuesday, Nine, a member of another pop group Dear Cloud, shared on Instagram the note she said Jonghyun had sent to her, with instructions to make it public if he ""disappeared from the world"". Dear Cloud's management Mymusic Entertainment confirmed to news agency Yonhap the note was posted after consultation with Jonghyun's family. It spoke about his struggle with living in the public eye, saying ""I was broken from the inside"" and ""the life of fame was never meant for me"". ""What else can I say more. Just tell me I've done well. That this is enough. That I've worked hard. Even if you can't smile don't fault me on my way."" The dark side of Asiaâs pop music industry Depression at work: 'At my desk in tears' However, no details were given as to when the note was written or sent to Nine.

Jonghyun, whose full name was Kim Jong-hyun, was found unconscious in a Seoul apartment. He was taken to hospital where he was declared dead. According to news agency AFP, he had sent several text messages to his sister, including one saying ""this is my last farewell"". Police said they would not be conducting a post-mortem examination, following a request from Jonghyun's family. Officers said it ""looks certain"" that he had killed himself, but did not officially confirm his cause of death as they were still conducting investigations. The singer was considered by many of his fans to be a very sensitive young man who did not embrace the hedonism that often comes with stardom. As well as being a singer and dancer, he played a large part in songwriting and production for SHINee. He also launched a parallel successful solo career in 2015. Fan Wang, a BBC Chinese journalist who worked as an interpreter for Jonghyun during a fan meeting in 2014, recalled that: ""Apart from the time he performed, he didn't talk much most of the time... the thing he cared the most about was his singing and performance."" Another interpreter who worked with the band told the BBC that Jonghyun ""didn't attract as much attention as other band members when he was offstage. Quiet and reticent, he was always walking behind the others. ""Yet during rehearsals, he came across as a lead singer. He took his singing and dancing rehearsals really seriously - you could tell he was a serious, grounded person."" ""He was also very polite. Once, he'd just finished brushing his teeth when he saw me standing by the door - he hadn't even dried his mouth yet, but hurried to bow and greet me right away,"" the interpreter, who wanted to be identified only as Ms Shu, added. The management of SHINee, SM Entertainment, released a statement saying he was ""the best artist"" and that they were ""heartbroken"" about his death. The band also posted an emotional tribute to the pop idol on its official Twitter account, saying in Korean: ""Jonghyun, who loved music more than anyone....  Forever, he will be remembered.""

Fans were paying their respects at a funeral hall at the hospital in Seoul throughout Tuesday.

An altar with Jonghyun's portrait was set up at the hospital SHINee were founded in 2008 as a five member group under SM Entertainment, and quickly rose to become of the biggest K-pop boy groups.

K-Pop steps up to win fans Down Under It is at the forefront of the so-called Korean Wave - the spread of Korean music, drama and film across Asia and worldwide.

Earlier this year, they also played their first North American tour. If you are feeling emotionally distressed,here are details of organisations in the UK which offer advice and support. Depression is more than just feeling a bit down for a few days. It is an illness which, at its most severe, can leave people feeling that life is no longer worth living. It can cause physical symptoms such as headaches, sleeplessness and constant tiredness which may last for months and months. People with depression can also feel anxious, irritable and agitated on a daily basis, but it affects everyone differently. If people admit their symptoms and talk to someone about their feelings, depression can usually be treated but the biggest barrier to getting help is often stigma and the fear of disclosing mental health problems.

Grandparent carers 'running up debts',"Maureen Seed's grandson Louis is now 21 and at university Grandparents are running up large debts raising children whose parents cannot look after them, surveys have found. Nearly 200,000 children in the UK are being raised by a family member other than their parents and findings show the burden often falls on grandparents. Maureen Seed, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, looked after two of her grandchildren for 16 years because of her daughter's drug problems. She amassed about Â£20,000 of credit card debt and is facing bankruptcy. This video can not be played Grandparents 'run up debts' to care for grandchildren Two charities carried out surveys of kinship carers - people who look after grandchildren, or the children of other family members or friends. They suggest Ms Seed's case is not unusual. One found more than a third of carers used a credit card to buy food, while a similar number missed paying a bill. There is no statutory entitlement for kinship carers and charity Grandparents Plus wants a national minimum allowance introduced to cover the costs of raising a child. Cheryl Ward, from the charity Family Fund, added: ""There's a long-standing issue with support for grandparent carers - they're not recognised financially, as someone with special guardianship is."" The Department for Education said it recognised ""the crucial role that grandparents play"" but local authorities were responsible for advice and support. Maureen Seed, 74, said she wanted her grandchildren to ""have the things other children have"" Ms Seed, 74, took on caring for her grandson and granddaughter when they were aged five and two. She had given up work to look after her husband, who suffered a heart attack and stroke and eventually went into a care home, and money was scarce. She spent on credit cards so the children could go on school trips and holidays, and is currently going through bankruptcy to clear her Â£20,000 debt. Eventually Ms Seed got family allowance and child tax credits, and fought for residency payment from the council, at Â£40 per child, per week. Her grandson Louis, now 21, is at university and her granddaughter, 18, at college. Louis said: ""I feel like my nan saved my life. My life could have been very, very different. ""I remember some of the houses I was in with my mum - scruffy houses, around strangers all the time. We had to be got out of there really."" Ms Seed said: ""I wanted them out of that, I didn't want them to live that life. I wanted them to have a stable, happy childhood, to have the things other children have."" Jayne Taylor from Leeds is now her granddaughters' legal guardian but is on her own and has struggled to make ends meet. Jayne Taylor, 60, from Leeds, was contacted by social services in May 2014 about looking after her granddaughters, now 14 and 17. Both suffer from epilepsy and other behavioural issues. Ms Taylor has resorted to food banks at least four times because she was desperate for help. ""I didn't have any money,"" she said. ""I had to make sure they had clothes, even uniform is so expensive. Even if you had savings you would go into it and that's hard when you've been working all your life."" Ms Taylor said she went to parenting classes but bringing up children now was ""very different"" compared with when she was a mother. Grandparents Plus surveyed 4,000 kinship carers. Family Fund, which provides grants for families on low incomes raising disabled or seriously ill children, surveyed primary carers it supported financially who described themselves as a grandparent and/or were 60 or over. Grandparents help more UK mums get back to work UK 'behind' on grandparent childcare provision More stories and updates from across Yorkshire The Grandparents Plus survey, based on 671 responses, suggests the most common reason children are in kinship care is due to parental drug or alcohol abuse (55%). The survey suggests: 45% of respondents quit work to become carers 43% say they do not have enough income for their grandchildren's needs The average income for a kinship household is Â£17,316 - well below the national average (Â£27,200) 19% of carers rely on their pension as their main source of income Of Family Fund's 231 responses, 36% of carers said they used credit cards to buy healthy food, and 39% said they missed a bill in order to buy healthy food. There is no statutory entitlement to financial support for kinship carers - local authorities decide what support is available in individual cases. Registered foster carers are entitled to financial support but kinship carers have no equivalent entitlement. Help is difficult to access if the carer is looking after the child as a private arrangement with no legal order. Someone raising a grandchild or the child of another relative or friend may be able to claim benefits available for children, low-income families, older people, or those with a disability or long-term illness.

"Teens arrested over school arsonThree 13-year-olds were questioned after a blaze at a former school in Newhaven, East Sussex.24m25 minutes agoSussex","Two 13-year-old girls have been arrested following a fire Two girls and a boy, all aged 13, have been arrested on suspicion of arson after a blaze at a former school. Forty firefighters were sent to the former Grays School in Western Road, Newhaven, on Monday morning. The fire ripped through the building and caused extensive damage. Thick black smoke was seen along the East Sussex coast. Nobody was injured in the fire. The three teenagers have been released while inquiries continue.

What should sex education lessons cover?,"Sexting, online pornography, staying safe online, transgender issues - should these topics be included in new sex and relationships education (SRE) guidelines for schools in England? The Department for Education is asking parents and young people for their opinions in an eight-week call for views on what should be covered. The current SRE guidelines have not been updated since the year 2000. Ministers say this is ""unacceptable"" and want new guidance for autumn 2019. The drive to improve and update SRE in schools in England comes as figures collected by BBC Panorama show arise in the number of sexual assaultsby children. Girls go along with sex acts, says teacher 'I didn't say no, but I regret that' The number of reported sexual offences by under-18s against other under-18s in England and Wales rose by 71% from 4,603 in 2013-14 to 7,866 in 2016-17. In March the DfE announced that SRE would be compulsory in all England's schools - meaning in academies as well as council-run schools. But Education Secretary Justine Greening said the current content advice for schools was out-of-date. Ms Greening said: ""It is unacceptable that relationships and sex education guidance has not been updated for almost 20 years, especially given the online risks - such as sexting and cyber-bullying - our children and young people face. ""Young people must have an education that teaches them the importance of healthy and stable relationships. ""This call for evidence is about giving teachers, parents and especially young people a chance to help shape that new approach and I'd urge them to take part."" Lisa Hallgarten, policy manager for the sexual health charity Brook, said: ""We have a very clear understanding of the unique challenges that young people face and what they need from their relationships and sex education. ""We thoroughly look forward to seeing a guidance that reflects this."" Rachel Krys, co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ""We know that children and young people experience sexual harassment and violence, and online they are exposed to images and content which can be very disturbing. ""It is vital that schools give children the information they need about sex, consent and healthy relationships."" Ruth Hunt, chief executive of campaign group Stonewall, said: ""The current guidance, published 17 years ago, contains no mention of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. ""Schools that teach LGBT-inclusive RSE are in the minority, leaving many LGBT young people without the information they need to make safe, informed decisions. ""Just 13% of LGBT young people have learnt about healthy same-sex relationships."" Thomas Pascoe, campaign director of the Coalition for Marriage, said: ""Under these proposals, the leading agent in the early sexualisation of children would be the state itself. ""We should be teaching young children broad values of respect and tolerance, not ordering them to accept adult sexual relationships which they are far too young to understand."" The eight-week consultation will be led by Ian Bauckham, who was awarded the CBE in 2017 for services to education. Mr Bauckham is head teacher of a large Church of England comprehensive school in Kent. He is a national leader of education and works with other schools in the region and further afield. ""I hope that the call for evidence being launched now gives us the chance to find out about the best teaching and to improve provision for all our young people in all types of school,"" he said.

US blames N Korea for global cyber-attack,"Attackers encrypted user's devices, and typically demanded a ransom of $300-600 in Bitcoin The US and UK governments have said North Korea was responsible for the WannaCry malware attack affecting hospitals, businesses and banks across the world earlier this year. The attack is said to have hit more than 300,000 computers in 150 nations, causing billions of dollars of damage. It is the first time the US and UK have officially blamed them for the worm. Thomas Bossert, an aide to US President Donald Trump, first made the accusation in theWall Street Journal,externalnewspaper. Mr Bossert, who advises the president on homeland security, said the allegation was ""based on evidence"". He did not produce any evidence in the article, but said US findings concurred with judgments from other governments and private companies. He added that Australia, Canada, and New Zealand also share the US conclusion that North Korea was behind the attack. Following the interview, the UK Foreign Office also blamed ""North Korean actors using their cyber programme to circumvent sanctions"". The National Cyber Security Centre assessed that is ""highly likely"" that the North Korean Lazarus hacking group had committed the attacks,Minister for Cyber Lord Ahmad said in a statement,external. In May, Windows computers hit by the cyber-attack had their contents locked, with users asked to a pay a ransom to have their data restored. EU police body Europol called the scale of the attack ""unprecedented"". Analysis: Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent Britain's National Cyber Security Centre, part of the GCHQ signals intelligence agency, first attributed the May 2017 Wannacry attack to North Korea within weeks of the ransomware spreading. The speed was because the UK led the international investigation after the National Health Service was hit hard. The US intelligence community may have taken longer to concur with that assessment but there is still the question of why the White House is only going public now. Governments used to be cautious about attribution in cyber attacks but it is becoming increasingly common - beginning with the claim North Korea was behind the attack on Sony in 2014 and more recently involving Russia's alleged hacking in the 2016 US election. This latest claim is almost certainly an attempt to put more pressure on North Korea in the crisis over its nuclear programme with the attempt to rally international support behind the notion that the country is a real danger - whether from cyber weapons or nuclear weapons. And to make the case that further action, of some kind, needs to be contemplated. Mr Bossert warned that ""we will continue to hold accountable those who harm or threaten us"" In the Wall Street Journal piece, Mr Bossert said North Korea must be held ""accountable"" and that the US would continue to use a ""maximum pressure strategy"" to hinder the regime's ability to mount cyber-attacks. He did not specify what action, if any, the US government planned to take in response to the findings. North Korea is already facing major economic sanctions after being redesignated a state-sponsor of terrorism last monthamid tension over its nuclear programme and missile tests. Malware, patches and worms defined UK say cyber-attack was 'launched from North Korea' ""North Korea has acted especially badly, largely unchecked, for more than a decade, and its malicious behaviour is growing more egregious. WannaCry was indiscriminately reckless,"" Mr Bossert wrote. ""As we make the internet safer, we will continue to hold accountable those who harm or threaten us, whether they act alone or on behalf of criminal organisations or hostile nations,"" he went on. ""The tool kits of totalitarian regimes are too threatening to ignore."" He added that Microsoft and Facebook both acted to disable North Korean cyber-attacks ""on their own initiative last week, without any direction or participation by the US"". Microsoft later issued a statement,,externalsaying that last week the company ""working together with Facebook and others in the security community, took strong steps to protect our customers and the internet from ongoing attacks by an advanced persistent threat actor known to us as ZINC, also known as the Lazarus Group"". ""Among other steps, last week we helped disrupt the malware this group relies on, cleaned customers' infected computers, disabled accounts being used to pursue cyber-attacks and strengthened Windows defences to prevent reinfection,"" the statement said.

However, some social media users said that - while crediting Microsoft and Facebook - Mr Bossert did not mentiona UK security researcher who had ""accidentally"" halted the spread of the malicious software. The 22-year-old man, known by the pseudonym MalwareTech, managed to bring the spread to a halt when he found what appeared to be a ""kill switch"" in the rogue software's code. In the UK, the National Health Service (NHS) was hit particularly hard by the cyber-attack, with 48 affected health trusts forced to turn many patients away for appointments and even surgeries. It spread across the world, with Russia reportedly being badly hit, causing problems to the country's postal service. North Korea has not yet responded to the US allegation In 2014, the US claimed North Korea were behind cyber-attacks on Sony Pictures, after it released a film featuring the fictional killing of its leader Kim Jong-un. A guide to the cyber-attack on Hollywood The entertainment company had its films leaked and details of corporate finances and private emails released online. The North Koreans hit out at former president Barack Obama over the claim, but has not yet responded to the White House accusations about the WannaCry hack. In October it said rumours from a UK government minister that they were behind the 2017 attack was ""groundless speculation"", and a ""wicked attempt"" to tighten international sanctions on the country.

Another victim of Birmingham crash named,"One of the six victims of a multi-car crash in Birmingham had served a prison sentence over a 130mph police chase, the BBC understands. Kasar Jehangir, 25, was jailed for three years for dangerous driving and possession of drugs with intent to supply in November last year. He wasone of two men who threw heroin from an Audiwhile being chased by police on the M6 in 2015. Lucy Davis and Lee Jenkins have also been named as victims of the crash. Midlands Live: All Birmingham crash victims named; Anguish over dead body photos Mr Jehangir - released earlier in 2017 under probation service supervision - died on Sunday alongside Tauqeer Hussain, 26, and Mohammed Fahsha. Another man, 22, was seriously injured when the Audi the four men were in crashed with a taxi on Lee Bank Middleway, near the city centre. Mr Hussain's mother suffered a heart attack after learning of her son's death, a family member said. ""Beautiful and fun-loving"" Lucy Davis was one of the taxi passengers killed in the crash Taxi driver Imtiaz Mohammed and his passengers, 42-year-old Mr Jenkins, and his partner 43-year-old Ms Davis from Kingstanding in Birmingham, died after the vehicle was smashed on to its side. Ms Davis, who had two children, worked as a sign language interpreter. Her family said: ""Lucy was a beautiful and fun-loving mother, daughter, sister, auntie and friend who brought happiness to the lives of all she met. Rest in Peace our Lady in Red."" Her relatives havetaken to social media to express their ""unbearable"" pain,external. Mr Jenkins' employer, University Hospitals Birmingham, said: ""The trust extends its deepest condolences to the family of Lee Jenkins and also to his friends and colleagues at this very sad time."" Mr Mohammed, 33, has been described by relatives as a ""happy, loving and friendly guy"", was on his last job before heading home to his wife and family, according to his brother. The family of Mr Mohammed, who had five daughters and one son, said his death came the day before his daughter's fourth birthday. Father-of-six Imtiaz Mohammed, described as a hard-working family man, was killed in the crash Three men in the Audi, including Mohammed Fahsha, 30, pictured with his baby nephew, and Tauqeer Hussain, 26, known as Tox to his family, died at the scene. People have been leaving tributes near the scene of the crash, including flowers with a card saying: ""To Mum, I love you loads. ""Life isn't going to be the same without you."" Three vehicles were directly involved in the accident on Belgrave Middleway in the early hours of Sunday The scene of the accident was described as ""harrowing"" Tousif Hussain Kiani, whose younger brother Tauqeer died in the crash, revealed that their mother had a heart attack after hearing about her son's death. Mr Hussain was abroad when his sister contacted him in the middle of the night to tell him his 26-year-old brother was among the men thrown from the Audi. He said he managed to get the next flight back to the UK, only to return to the news that his mother, Jamil Ahktar, had been taken to hospital. The death of Tauqeer is another tragedy for the family as Mr Hussain's older brother, Khrum Munir, was killed in a car accident almost 10 years ago when the 28-year-old was coming home from work. He said his father was ""holding it together because he is a strong man... but emotionally, I'm not sure what he is feeling."" Tousif Hussain Kiani said his brother Tauqeer was 'happy and carefree' Mr Hussain described Tauqeer, known as Tox, as someone who was ""friendly to everybody"" and always outside the house on St Benedicts Road, Small Heath, with his friends ""laughing and joking"". He was due to start a new job in January. He said Mohammed Fahsha lived opposite and was a childhood friend to them both. ""We were always in each other's houses... always together. It doesn't seem real because they're not here,"" he said. The brothers had known Kasar Jehangir for several years and the fourth person in the car who survived, an unnamed 22-year-old man, since he was about 15 years old. He said the group were going to get food when the crash happened. Mr Hussain said he was upset at Mr Jehangir's past drug convictions being referenced following his death. ""It's irrelevant to what has happened now... it's a matter in his own private life and not something his family want to be seeing. ""Everybody does bad and good in their life."" He said he was also angry at graphic images and footage of the aftermath of the crash scene being shared on social media. ""When I checked my social media [after learning of his brother's death] I saw people uploading pictures and videos. ""Fair enough you want to record the cars or whatever, but people were recording the bodies lying on the floor and that's not how I'd like to see any person lying on the floor while they are dead in that state, never mind if they're my brother and my best friends.""

Healthcare failings at 'squalid' prison,"The report says there is ""a lack of support for people with mental health needs, and in-patients have an impoverished regime"" Major failings in the provision of healthcare at Liverpool prison have been uncovered by a BBC investigation. Whistleblowers have told BBC News that prisoners have died and others have been injured due to poor care. Most of the incidents have happened since inspectors said conditions at the jail were the worst they had seen. Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust said it was sorry it had not managed to improve services as much as it had hoped. For the past three months, healthcare staff at HMP Liverpool have been highlighting ongoing concerns about the treatment of some of the approximately 1,100 prisoners at the jail. MP Rosie Cooper said there was a ""systemic failure to provide decent healthcare"" at the prison Their decision to speak out, they say, was borne of a sense that senior management at the trust were not listening to concerns and hiding failings from regulators. In September, HM Inspectorate of Prisons visited Liverpool. A draft copy of its report, obtained by the BBC, says while there have been some improvements, ""there is a lack of support for people with mental health needs, and in-patients have an impoverished regime. There had been failures of leadership and management at all levels."" Just days after the inspectors left, the BBC was informed of the suicide of a patient. The man, who the BBC is not naming, killed himself in the healthcare unit. A fortnight later, staff told of the suicide of a second inmate. ""He did not have his secondary screening at the prison, a national requirement,"" wrote staff in an email to the BBC. ""The prison at the moment is so risky."" A month later, a third death. On the day the man died, the BBC was told he had been waiting ""nearly 17 hours"" to see a prison GP. Another inmate, we were told, was left with life-changing injuries after staff failed to notice for 12 hours that he had broken his neck despite a medic checking on him. Darren Harley said he removed the roots of his tooth himself because he did not receive medication Darren Harley was convicted of drugs offences and spent 27 months in Liverpool prison before being released in the summer. During his time inside, he says, he developed toothache but the healthcare regime failed on four separate occasions to provide him with proper medication, forcing him to take drastic action. ""My tooth actually shattered and because of the agony I was in, I ended up having to remove the roots myself. I don't understand how it is taking so long for people to get important medication,"" he said. Whistleblowers spoke of regular problems with medication. On some occasions, potentially life-saving drugs, such as warfarin and insulin, were not available despite being prescribed to prisoners. At other times, mistakes led to inmates getting double doses of certain drugs. Lancashire Care NHS Foundation Trust, which has provided healthcare services at the prison for two years, said it inherited some very significant challenges from the previous provider. It said improvements had been made but the scale of the changes needed and the challenging environment within prisons has limited its ability to address everything. Rosie Cooper, the Labour MP for West Lancashire, has been campaigning for improvements at the prison for years and is appalled by the continuing failures. ""We expect those prisoners to obey our rules outside of prison, yet inside prison the authorities abandon all rules and regulations and treat prisoners in this way and leave them suffering. I cannot accept that that's right."" As the BBC revealed on Monday,the inspectorate's findings on HMP Liverpool- a local category B/C prison, which also takes people on remand - are damning across the board. Lawyer Leanne Devine said there was ""a culture of denial"" It describes living conditions ""as amongst the worst we have seen"", with many prisoners living in ""squalid"" conditions. ""Many cells have broken windows with dangerous jagged glass, broken observation panels, damp, leaks and broken or blocked toilets,"" says the report. ""There is a significant problem with cockroaches and rats throughout the prison."" The problems are understood to have contributed to the removal of the governor last month and to some urgent repairs being carried out on one wing. ""There is a culture of denial,"" said Leanne Devine, a lawyer with Broudie Jackson Canter who regularly takes action against HMP Liverpool on behalf of inmates and their families. ""We've not seen any evidence of change. ""What is frustrating for the families is when they go away and they hope for change and then they see years later, coming through the press, the same cases, the same failings.""

'Race bias' in justice system to be tackled,"The government is committed to exposing injustice, says David Lidington Setting targets to hire judges from ethnic minority backgrounds would be the ""wrong way"" to solve the issue of diversity, says the justice secretary. David Lidington has outlined steps to tackle ""race bias"" in the legal system in England and Wales, followinga damning report from MP David Lammy. But the minister says the government needs to ""look at the critical path"" into the law - rather than targets. Mr Lammy said he was ""disappointed"" with the government's response. Ethnic minority offenders 'face bias' Young offender: 'I'm done with fighting' Justice system near 'breaking point' The Lammy Review,external, published in September, said that people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds make up 25% of the prison population and 41% of the youth justice system - but only 14% of the general population. Ethnic minority groups make up only 11% of magistrates and 7% of judges. As a result, Mr Lammy had called for a national target to achieve representation in the courts by 2025. David Lammy made 35 recommendations to reform the criminal justice system However, Mr Lidington said a target would be ""the wrong way to attack this particular objective"" and he was looking at alternatives. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""When you look at the judges, you have got a group of people who have been practising in law perhaps for 20 years... because we need people who are experienced, who are expert, to sit on the bench. ""In getting a more diverse judiciary... you need to look at the critical path of how do people get into the legal profession in the first place."" Mr Lammy disagreed and instead called for a ""bold approach"". The Tottenham MP told the BBC: ""It is not about the pipeline. BAME (Black, Asian, and minority ethnic) lawyers are applying to join the judiciary. ""If you set a target or a goal, then it concentrates the mind to achieve that. But the government has not affected that. ""The UK is behind the curve on diversity and it needs to catch up."" This video can not be played Watch: Are ethnic minorities treated fairly? Lawyer and diversity campaigner Funke Abimbola was also disappointed with the decision, telling Today: ""It is an important element of [the recommendations] because bias in the judiciary has a direct impact on decision-making. ""This whole report was about there being proven bias against those minority ethnic backgrounds. [Targets are] a key part in driving diversity of thought, which impacts decisions in court."" By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The government's response to David Lammy's proposals suggests it's following them in spirit - but not to the letter. Many of the recommendations relate to changes to data collection, which should be relatively straightforward to implement. The harder task set by Mr Lammy involves increasing diversity, so those who work in the criminal justice system better reflect and understand the people who use it. Although ministers have agreed challenging targets to raise ethnic minority representation among prison officers, they've balked at doing the same for judges and magistrates. The experience of the police service, which failed to meet 10-year BME targets set in 1999 after the Macpherson report, may have influenced their decision. Targets can help focus efforts in achieving a goal - but if they're too stretching, they may prove counter-productive. The Lammy Review concluded that people from minority backgrounds still faced bias, ""including overt discrimination"", in parts of the justice system. Mr Lidington pledged to implement a ""key principle"" of ""change or explain"" when racial discrimination is found in the system. ""Where we cannot explain differences in outcomes for different groups, we will reform,"" he said, pledging to work on each of Mr Lammy's 35 recommendations - even if not following them to the letter. And he added this was the ""very first step"" in a change of attitude towards race disparity ""that will touch on every part of the criminal justice system for years to come"". Withinthe government's response,external, it said it would: Collect wider datasets related to ethnicity for more accurate analysis Publish more datasets so the public can see the reality Review use of ""gang"" prosecutions for those who are victims and exploited by adults Review modern slavery legislation to see how it could help with gang crime Redact, where possible, identifying information to make ""race-blind decisions"" Investigate better ways of explaining legal rights and options to build trust Assess maturity of young offenders over 18 Recruit a more diverse workforce in prisons and help people move to more senior roles Consider sealing criminal records Trial deferred prosecutions - where offenders can avoid trial when admitting the offence - in London Some of the changes would take longer to achieve than others, the Ministry of Justice said. But it had already made progress on several recommendations, including publishing data on race bias in the system. It said a new race and ethnicity board would drive through the reforms - but alternative approaches would be found where proposals could not be implemented in full.

Deaths confirmed in US train derailment,"This video can not be played Footage shows the scale of the derailment At least three people have been confirmed killed after a US passenger train derailed onto a motorway in Washington state during rush hour on Monday morning. Officials say 72 people were taken to hospitals after most of the Amtrak train's carriages left the track. A number of those injured are reported to be in a critical condition. Authorities said all carriages had now been searched, but would not rule out a rise in the number of dead. Seven vehicles, two of them lorries, were hit on the I-5 highway below. Several people were injured in their vehicles but none died. It was Amtrak's first passenger service to run on a new, shorter route. Train 501 had left Seattle, heading south for Portland, at 06:00 local time (14:00 GMT). The derailment happened on a section of track, south of Tacoma, previously only used for freight trains. Authorities quoted by Associated Press earlier spoke of at least six people killed. This video can not be played Passenger describes the train crash: 'We could feel cars crumpling' One passenger carriage could be seen dangling from the bridge, while others were strewn across the road and the wooded area next to the track. A photograph released by Washington State Patrol showed one carriage upside down on the road, with wreckage all around it. An Amtrak spokeswoman said the train had derailed at 07:33 local time (15:33 GMT). There were 86 people on board, including 77 passengers and seven Amtrak crew members, as well as a train technician. Police say 19 people were taken from the scene uninjured. Of the 72 transferred to hospitals for evaluation, 10 were considered to have serious injuries. A state transport spokesperson was quoted in the Seattle Times newspaper as saying the curve where the train derailed had a 30mph (48km/h) speed limit,external. Barbara LaBoe said the limit on most of the track was 79mph (128km/h) but drivers were supposed to slow dramatically at the spot where the train derailed. She said warning signs were in place two miles before the lowered limit.The Associated Press reported that a website mapping train speeds suggested the train may have been travelling at 81mph,externalbefore the derailment. The cause of Monday's crash has not been confirmed and investigators have not yet commented on whether speed was a factor. A recording of the train's emergency call to railway dispatchers was released to US media. ""Emergency! We are on the ground!"" a man, possibly the conductor, radios in. In a second radio call, another crew member reports that only the rear unit remains on the rails. ""All other cars appear to be on the ground in quite a mess,"" he says. The train's engineer has a head injury, he tells dispatchers. President Donald Trump's first reaction to the derailment was to tweet that it showed the need for his forthcoming infrastructure plan. However US media outlets pointed out his submitted federal transportation budget actually proposed cuts to funding to national rail systems. Allow Twitter content?

A local news reporter who was on the train, but got off at a stop just before the crash, said many of those on board were railway enthusiasts, keen to experience the first high-speed train on the new route. Every passenger was given a commemorative lanyard and badge to mark their journey, he said. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the accident. Allow Twitter content?

Derailed US train 'went 81mph into bend',"This video can not be played Footage shows the scale of the derailment A US passenger train that derailed, killing three people, was travelling at 80mph (130km/h) on a curve with a speed limit of 30mph, data from the train's rear engine indicates. It happened in Washington state during rush hour on Monday. Officials say 100 people were taken to hospital. The train crashed shortly after leaving a new station on its inaugural run. Two friends who are railroad enthusiasts were identified as among the fatalities on Tuesday. Rail aficionado Zack Willhoite, 35, was identified by his employer Pierce Transit, who said the IT specialist ""played an important role in our agency"". The National Association of Railroad Passengers identified board member Jim Hamre as another victim. ""He was a dedicated passenger rail advocate doing what he loved to do. Riding trains, promoting travel and making friends"", club president Peter LeCody wrote on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Authorities said all carriages had now been searched, but would not rule out a rise in the number of dead. A spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said investigators had arrived at the scene on Monday night local time and would probably be there for a week or 10 days. Bella Dinh-Zarr said the 12-carriage train had engines at the front and rear. The back engine's data recording had been retrieved, she said, and ""preliminary indications are that the train was travelling at 80mph on a 30mph track"". ""Our hearts go out to everyone who is affected by this very tragic accident,"" she said, adding that the train's engineer had not yet been interviewed but will be in ""within the next day or so"". Passengers say the train rocked and creaked as it took the bend fast before barrelling off a bridge on to a motorway packed with traffic. Seven vehicles, two of them lorries, were hit on the I-5 highway below. Several people were injured in their vehicles but none died.

She said warning signs were in place two miles before the lowered limit. It was Amtrak's first passenger service to run on a new, shorter route after an investment of $181m (Â£82m). Amtrak is the name of the company that runs most passenger trains in the US, with some government funding. The derailment happened on a section of track previously only used for freight trains. A safety system called Positive Train Control (PTC) was not operational on the train in question, the president of Amtrak told reporters. Using GPS tracking, PTC automatically warns the driver of speed limits and other local conditions and applies the train's brakes if the warnings are not heeded. Congress originally legislated for PTC to be installed by the end of 2015 but it is still not even halfway complete. The cost of implementing the system fully on all tracks and vehicles is reported to be more than $22bn. This video can not be played A 45-second look at how Positive Train Control works Train 501 had left Seattle, heading south for Portland, at 06:00 local time (14:00 GMT). One passenger carriage could be seen dangling from the bridge, while others were strewn across the road and the wooded area next to the track. Authorities are now working through wind and cold rain to clear and re-open the busy motorway, which stretches from Canada to Mexico along the US West Coast. There were 86 people on board, including 77 passengers and seven Amtrak crew members, as well as a train technician. Police say 19 people were taken from the scene uninjured.

Wet summer warning system developed,"Forecasters may soon be able to give a longer term warning of wet UK summers Researchers in the UK have developed a method of improving the long range accuracy of summer weather forecasts in the UK and Europe. The scientists found a connection between sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic in March and April and the subsequent summer's rain or shine. The researchers say the new method may benefit agriculture, tourism and construction. Thestudy has been published,externalin the journal PNAS. Scientific effort to improve longer term forecasts have been focussed on winter weather patterns, which can pose a sizeable threat to humans and the environment. Developing better seasonal forecasts for the summer has lagged significantly behind. Now researchers at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS) at the University of Reading have found that springtime temperature anomalies in the north Atlantic are connected to the circulation of the atmosphere and the position of the jet stream over Europe in the following July and August. US flood risk 'severely underestimated' Builders 'behind UK flooding risk' ""We found a strong link between sea surface temperatures east of Newfoundland during the spring and the position of the jet stream and the weather in the UK,"" said lead author Dr Albert Osso from the University of Reading. ""We found that there is a predictability."" The researchers believe the temperature anomalies in the sea change what is termed the meridional gradient and the position of the jet stream is strongly influenced by this factor. Predicting barbecue weather might still be beyond the scope of this approach ""The jet stream gives the direction of the storms that cross the Atlantic and affect Europe and the UK,"" said Dr Osso. ""What we have seen is that when temperatures are warmer than normal in this area of the ocean, the storms basically move far north and they miss the UK, not all of them, but on average most of the storms are going to miss."" The scientists say that their findings mean that there is considerable potential to improve the seasonal forecast - with important implications for many sectors. ""This is an exciting finding. It shows that some aspects of summer weather in the UK appear to be much more predictable, many months ahead, than was previously thought,"" said Professor Rowan Sutton, from the University of Reading, and a co-author of the research. ""Farmers could potentially make more informed decisions on planting and harvesting. Shops could have more information to plan their stocks of sun cream or wellies. Forecasters still won't be able to tell you in May if an August bank holiday barbecue is a good idea or not, but they may be able to say if the summer is likely to be wetter or drier than average, with much more accuracy."" In the study, the scientists found that the rainfall in Europe can be predicted several months ahead with a correlation skill of 0.56, where 0 would be pure chance and 1 would be perfect prediction every time. The researchers believe that their new process could be a big help to weather forecasters, ""I think it could become a standard procedure and I think it can help to improve the numerical forecast,"" said Dr Osso. ""Knowing that these connections exist in observations, the forecasters can improve their models to reproduce these links and then get a better numerical forecast, not just a statistical one.

More victims of Birmingham crash named,"One of the six victims of a multi-car crash in Birmingham had served a prison sentence over a 130mph police chase, the BBC understands. Kasar Jehangir, 25, was jailed for three years for dangerous driving and possession of drugs with intent to supply in November last year. He wasone of two men who threw heroin from an Audiwhile being chased by police on the M6 in 2015. Lucy Davis and Lee Jenkins have also been named as victims of the crash. Midlands Live: All Birmingham crash victims named; Anguish over dead body photos Mr Jehangir - released earlier in 2017 under probation service supervision - died on Sunday alongside Tauqeer Hussain, 26, and Mohammed Fahsha. Another man, 22, was seriously injured when the Audi the four men were in crashed with a taxi on Lee Bank Middleway, near the city centre. Mr Hussain's mother suffered a heart attack after learning of her son's death, a family member said. ""Beautiful and fun-loving"" Lucy Davis was one of the taxi passengers killed in the crash Taxi driver Imtiaz Mohammed and his passengers, 42-year-old Mr Jenkins, and his partner 43-year-old Ms Davis from Kingstanding in Birmingham, died after the vehicle was smashed on to its side. Ms Davis, who had two children, worked as a sign language interpreter. Her family said: ""Lucy was a beautiful and fun-loving mother, daughter, sister, auntie and friend who brought happiness to the lives of all she met. Rest in Peace our Lady in Red."" Her relatives havetaken to social media to express their ""unbearable"" pain,external. Mr Jenkins' employer, University Hospitals Birmingham, said: ""The trust extends its deepest condolences to the family of Lee Jenkins and also to his friends and colleagues at this very sad time."" Mr Mohammed, 33, has been described by relatives as a ""happy, loving and friendly guy"", was on his last job before heading home to his wife and family, according to his brother. The family of Mr Mohammed, who had five daughters and one son, said his death came the day before his daughter's fourth birthday. Father-of-six Imtiaz Mohammed, described as a hard-working family man, was killed in the crash Three men in the Audi, including Mohammed Fahsha, 30, pictured with his baby nephew, and Tauqeer Hussain, 26, known as Tox to his family, died at the scene. People have been leaving tributes near the scene of the crash, including flowers with a card saying: ""To Mum, I love you loads. ""Life isn't going to be the same without you."" Three vehicles were directly involved in the accident on Belgrave Middleway in the early hours of Sunday The scene of the accident was described as ""harrowing"" Tousif Hussain Kiani, whose younger brother Tauqeer died in the crash, revealed that their mother had a heart attack after hearing about her son's death. Mr Hussain was abroad when his sister contacted him in the middle of the night to tell him his 26-year-old brother was among the men thrown from the Audi. He said he managed to get the next flight back to the UK, only to return to the news that his mother, Jamil Ahktar, had been taken to hospital. The death of Tauqeer is another tragedy for the family as Mr Hussain's older brother, Khrum Munir, was killed in a car accident almost 10 years ago when the 28-year-old was coming home from work. He said his father was ""holding it together because he is a strong man... but emotionally, I'm not sure what he is feeling."" Tousif Hussain Kiani said his brother Tauqeer was 'happy and carefree' Mr Hussain described Tauqeer, known as Tox, as someone who was ""friendly to everybody"" and always outside the house on St Benedicts Road, Small Heath, with his friends ""laughing and joking"". He was due to start a new job in January. He said Mohammed Fahsha lived opposite and was a childhood friend to them both. ""We were always in each other's houses... always together. It doesn't seem real because they're not here,"" he said. The brothers had known Kasar Jehangir for several years and the fourth person in the car who survived, an unnamed 22-year-old man, since he was about 15 years old. He said the group were going to get food when the crash happened. Mr Hussain said he was upset at Mr Jehangir's past drug convictions being referenced following his death. ""It's irrelevant to what has happened now... it's a matter in his own private life and not something his family want to be seeing. ""Everybody does bad and good in their life."" He said he was also angry at graphic images and footage of the aftermath of the crash scene being shared on social media. ""When I checked my social media [after learning of his brother's death] I saw people uploading pictures and videos. ""Fair enough you want to record the cars or whatever, but people were recording the bodies lying on the floor and that's not how I'd like to see any person lying on the floor while they are dead in that state, never mind if they're my brother and my best friends.""

NHS workforce 'at crunch point',"The UK's medical profession is at a ""crunch point"", facing the prospect of too few doctors to treat rising numbers of patients, the regulator says. The General Medical Council says the supply of medics has failed to keep up with demand and warns against the over-reliance on overseas staff post-Brexit. The GMC's Charlie Massey called it a ""crucial moment"" for UK healthcare. It comes despite government promises in England to increase the number of doctors in training. The annual report by the GMC highlights four areas of concern: Supply of new doctors into the UK has not kept up with demand A dependence on non-UK qualified doctors in some specialist areas The risk of some overseas doctors being put off working in the UK after Brexit An ongoing strain on doctors in training  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The report found the number of doctors on the medical register had grown by 2% since 2012, at a time when there has been a 27% increase in A&E attendances in England and a 10% increase in Northern Ireland. Moreover, the growth in the population of those aged 85 and over - often the most needy in medical terms - is projected to double from 1.6 million to 3.2 million by 2041. ""The medical profession will undoubtedly need to grow to meet this extra demand,"" the report found, adding that it must equally consider in which areas, medically and geographically, that growth should be focused - highlighting rural locations where recruitment remains a challenge. Mr Massey called on the UK government to ""think carefully about how many doctors are needed, what expertise we need them to have so they can work as flexibly as possible, and where they should be located given the changes and movement in population expected"". In addition, the number of licensed doctors who are non-UK graduates has reached 43% in areas such as the east of England, 41% in the West Midlands and 38% in the East Midlands. Some specialist areas are particularly reliant on doctors recruited from overseas. For example, more than half the workforce in obstetrics and gynaecology are currently non-UK graduates. While acknowledging the importance of pooling knowledge and experience with other countries, the report questions whether ""our reliance... should be reduced in favour of a more strategic and sustainable approach"". The impact of Brexit too remains a concern. In 2017, there were 6,000 fewer non-UK graduates on the register than in 2011. South Asia accounts for nearly half the fall, but surveys taken earlier this year suggest European doctors currently working in the UK are also considering their position, in the light of the UK's decision to leave the European Union. ""The underlying challenge for all in healthcare is how we retain the good doctors we have right now,"" said the GMC's Mr Massey. ""Everything we hear from the profession tells us that we need to value them more."" He stressed the need to help doctors ""achieve the right balance between their professional and personal lives through more flexible working arrangements"". In the wake of last year's junior doctors' strikes and countless media reports, it is clear doctors are unhappy with their lot. Both those in training and those doing the training complain of their heavy workload, and subsequent lack of sleep. It has become common for more than half of doctors to take a break after completing foundation training - some do not return. The 'completely childish' man hanged for murder Princess Charlotte to start nursery school in January Lord Sugar surprises viewers with final Apprentice result To meet the future needs of patients, the GMC stressed the need to reduce the burden on doctors through better training and more flexible working conditions. ""The pressure on our health services shows no signs of letting up,"" said Mr Massey. ""It's on all of us to understand why doctors are making different choices about their lives and careers."" Labour shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: ""Tory mismanagement of the NHS workforce has been a disaster for staff and patients alike."" But the Department of Health in England said there were record numbers of doctors working in the NHS - up by nearly 15,000 since May 2010. A spokeswoman also pointed out that the number of training places was increasing by 25% in the coming years. ""We are also making sure we retain those already working in the NHS by improving doctors' work-life balance and supporting flexible working,"" she added.

Whitehall gender pay gap narrowing,"Transport has the widest gender pay gap of any government department, with women earning 16.9% on average less than male colleagues, closely followed by the Brexit department. Women are paid less than men across the civil service,new figures show,,externalwith a gap of 10% in seven other departments. The lowest disparity is 3% - in the culture, media and sport department. The UK's top civil servant, Sir Jeremy Heywood, said the data was a ""matter for concern"". But he hailed a fall in the overall pay gap from 13.6% to 12.7%. The pay gap does not necessarily mean women are paid less than men for doing the same job - the transport and Brexit departments suggest the figures are a result of more women in lower-paid roles and more men in the highest paid roles. The figures show the following gender pay gaps between men and women in various departments: Department for Transport: 16.9% Department for Exiting The EU: 15.26% Department of Health: 14.2% Ministry of Defence: 12.5% (for civil servants) Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy: 12% Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs: 11.5% Foreign and Commonwealth Office: 10.6% Home Office: 10.1% Department for Culture, Media, Digital and Sport: 3% The Department of Transportsaid its gender pay gap was mainly due,externalto the ""large numbers of female employees in administrative grades"" among the 5,600 people employed at the DVLA, in Swansea, who do not get their salary topped up by London weighting. But it has also traditionally been a ""very male-dominated environment"", officials said. ""There is a disproportionate representation of men due to the technical, engineering, construction and maritime skills required and lower proportions of female students in STEM (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects leading into those careers,"" said permanent secretary Bernadette Kelly. David Davis's department is dominated by men at the senior levels, figures show The Department for Exiting the EU, which is not far behind the Transport department when it comes to the disparity between male and female wages, has nearly twice as many men in the most senior roles. If senior roles are taken out of the figures, the mean gender pay gap drops to -0.39%, ""a negative percentage means that women are paid more than men,""according to the department,external. But, like the transport department it says it is taking steps to close the gap and believed there was already ""equal treatment for work of equal or similar value"". A DExEU spokesperson said: ""Ninety per cent of our staff are on loan from other government departments and devolved administrations, who operate their own pay scales and grading systems. These people have their base pay set by their home department, which we have no control over. ""As many staff come from departments with higher pay scales, this could have had an impact on skewing our data in terms of the mean being above the median."" The civil service, which employs 419,000 staff, compares favourably with the public sector as a whole, where women are paid on average 19.4% less than men and the private sector where the figure is 23.7%. All government departments are now required to publish an annual gender pay audit under regulations introduced by Theresa May earlier this year applying to all public bodies with 250 or more employees. Sir Jeremy, the cabinet secretary and head of the civil service, said he was committed to improving the gender balance at all grades within the civil service. ""I am pleased to say that the overall civil service gender pay gap is narrowing although it is still a matter of concern,"" he said. But the FDA union, which represents senior civil servants, said that it was wrong that women were still being ""discriminated against and undervalued"". ""While the civil service should be applauded for shining a light on its gender pay gap with this latest data, departments have a long way to go if they are serious about closing it,"" said its equality officer Zohra Francis.

Views sought on sex education content,"Sexting, online pornography, staying safe online, transgender issues - should these topics be included in new sex and relationships education (SRE) guidelines for schools in England? The Department for Education is asking parents and young people for their opinions in an eight-week call for views on what should be covered. The current SRE guidelines have not been updated since the year 2000. Ministers say this is ""unacceptable"" and want new guidance for autumn 2019. The drive to improve and update SRE in schools in England comes as figures collected by BBC Panorama show arise in the number of sexual assaultsby children. Girls go along with sex acts, says teacher 'I didn't say no, but I regret that' The number of reported sexual offences by under-18s against other under-18s in England and Wales rose by 71% from 4,603 in 2013-14 to 7,866 in 2016-17. In March the DfE announced that SRE would be compulsory in all England's schools - meaning in academies as well as council-run schools. But Education Secretary Justine Greening said the current content advice for schools was out-of-date. Ms Greening said: ""It is unacceptable that relationships and sex education guidance has not been updated for almost 20 years, especially given the online risks - such as sexting and cyber-bullying - our children and young people face. ""Young people must have an education that teaches them the importance of healthy and stable relationships. ""This call for evidence is about giving teachers, parents and especially young people a chance to help shape that new approach and I'd urge them to take part."" Lisa Hallgarten, policy manager for the sexual health charity Brook, said: ""We have a very clear understanding of the unique challenges that young people face and what they need from their relationships and sex education. ""We thoroughly look forward to seeing a guidance that reflects this."" Rachel Krys, co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ""We know that children and young people experience sexual harassment and violence, and online they are exposed to images and content which can be very disturbing. ""It is vital that schools give children the information they need about sex, consent and healthy relationships."" Ruth Hunt, chief executive of campaign group Stonewall, said: ""The current guidance, published 17 years ago, contains no mention of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. ""Schools that teach LGBT-inclusive RSE are in the minority, leaving many LGBT young people without the information they need to make safe, informed decisions. ""Just 13% of LGBT young people have learnt about healthy same-sex relationships."" Thomas Pascoe, campaign director of the Coalition for Marriage, said: ""Under these proposals, the leading agent in the early sexualisation of children would be the state itself. ""We should be teaching young children broad values of respect and tolerance, not ordering them to accept adult sexual relationships which they are far too young to understand."" The eight-week consultation will be led by Ian Bauckham, who was awarded the CBE in 2017 for services to education. Mr Bauckham is head teacher of a large Church of England comprehensive school in Kent. He is a national leader of education and works with other schools in the region and further afield. ""I hope that the call for evidence being launched now gives us the chance to find out about the best teaching and to improve provision for all our young people in all types of school,"" he said.

Palin's son charged over attack on father,"Track Palin (left), an Iraq war veteran, appeared regularly with Mrs Palin at campaign events The son of former Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin has been charged with assault and burglary after a confrontation with his father involving a firearm. Police say Track Palin allegedly broke into his parents' Alaska home through a window on Saturday night. Documents obtained by US media say the 28-year-old said he was on pain medication and had been drinking. He was arrested in 2016 for allegedly punching his girlfriend. After he eventually pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm while intoxicated, other charges were dismissed in that case. Police documents, published by the LA Times newspaper, said Mrs Palin called the police at about 20:40 on Saturday night  (06:40 GMT on Sunday),externalto say her son was on ""some type of medication"" and was allegedly ""freaking out"". The affidavit by a responding officer said they found the former Alaskan governor ""visibly upset"" at the property. Mrs Palin has said previously that her son has suffered from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Police say that when they arrived they had a stand-off with Mr Palin in which he moved around the house and at one stage went out onto the garage roof. They say he demanded police put their weapons on the ground and allegedly called them ""peasants"". Police say the struggle between the two men happened after Mr Palin said he was coming to the property to retrieve a vehicle, and threatened to beat his father. Todd Palin, Mrs Palin's husband, told police he armed himself with a pistol when his son arrived, but was disarmed and was left bloodied. Track Palin was charged by police with first-degree burglary, fourth-degree assault and criminal mischief, and remains in police custody. A statement to US media from the family requested privacy, and said the Palins were unable to comment further on the case. Earlier this year his ex-girlfriend Jordan Loewe applied for a protective order against Mr Palin, having previously requested full custody of their one-year-old son.

Man arrested as shots fired at RAF base,"A man has been arrested after driving through a military checkpoint, getting close to an aircraft at a base in Suffolk used by the US Air Force. Shots were fired by US personnel before the 44-year-old British man was overcome by staff at RAF Mildenhall. The base was temporarily put into lockdown as Suffolk police responded to reports of what they called a ""significant incident"". Police said the incident was being treated as trespass, not terrorism. Supt Kim Warner, from Suffolk Police, said the man, who suffered cuts and bruises, was arrested after a ""short pursuit"" and his vehicle was stopped by US security services. This video can not be played The base was temporarily put on lockdown There was ""no obvious motive at this stage"", he said, adding there was no wider threat to the public or the base and police were not looking for anyone else. The vehicle was brought to a halt close to a US plane, an Osprey, and it was not thought there was ""any significant damage"" to the vehicle or the aircraft, Supt Warner said. Suffolk Police was notified about a breach of security at about 13:40 GMT. ""Shots were fired by US security, I don't know how many, but I do know that shots were fired,"" Supt Warner said. ""It would be fair to say some of the minor injuries were probably as a result of him being apprehended,"" he added. The superintendent said there would now be an internal investigation by the US airbase into why guns were discharged. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

RAF Mildenhall is protected by Ministry of Defence police and US armed guards. The US Air Force said in a statement it was continuing to work with local authorities. The base is used as a transport hub by the US and is home to a fleet of refuelling aircraft and special operations forces. It has about 3,200 military personnel, with 400 to 500 UK civilian staff employed there. The base was one of 56 MoD sites earmarked for closure. However, the US Air Force said in September it was delaying plans to relocate its operations to a base in Germany until 2024. RAF Mildenhall has previously been a potential target for a terror attack against US military personnel. In May 2016,Junead Khan was given a life sentencefor preparing terrorist acts after a court heard how he used his job as a delivery driver to gather information about the base. 'Rules of engagement' Alex Dunlop, BBC Look East Defence reporter It's highly unusual for shots to be fired by US personnel. That said, in the past few years security has been stepped up at the US base, which now has a much tighter perimeter. You can't just drive into the base, you have to go through what's called the '""shed"" - your car is checked and you have to go through lots of tight security measures. RAF Mildenhallis essentially a little piece of America, with more than 3,000 US personnel based here, and there's very close co-operation between the American military police and the British civilian police. US bases here are governed by the Status of Forces Act so there are very clear rules of engagement here, with certain protocols in place when it come to the discharge of firearms. US personnel are allowed to fire guns, but these rules of engagement are not made public because of security considerations. There will undoubtedly be a conversation as a result of this incident between the Pentagon and the Ministry of Defence as to exactly what happened here and why guns were fired.

Russia and China are rivals to US - Trump,"This video can not be played Analysis: Trump's plan to confront - and sometimes work with - US rivals US President Donald Trump has outlined his new national security strategy, labelling China and Russia the primary threats to US economic dominance. His speech - which was based on his platform of ""America First"" - attacked the ""failures"" of past foreign policy. He criticised Pakistan and North Korea, and how previous administrations approached other world powers. The US faces a new era of competition, the US president said at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington. Russia and China are ""rival powers"", he said, but the US must attempt to build a ""great partnership with them"". Trumpâs pragmatic view of troubled world As an example of this new spirit of co-operation, Mr Trump referred to a phone call of thanks he received from Russian President Vladimir Putin for intelligence the CIA provided to the Kremlin about an alleged terror plot. Butthere was harsher language for Russia and China in the new National Security Strategy document itself,external, published before the speech, which called them ""revisionist powers"". Mr Trump described ""four pillars"" to his new plan but made no mention of human rights or climate change, his critics noted. The four themes are protecting the homeland, promoting American prosperity, demonstrating peace through strength and advancing American influence. The 68-page document, which White House officials began work on 11 months ago, suggests a return to Mr Trump's campaign promises. It explicitly states that ""the United States will no longer turn a blind eye to violations, cheating or economic aggression"". Mr Trump will renew his call for a wall on the southern border Referring to his election victory during the speech, he said that in 2016 voters chose to ""Make America Great Again"". Previous American leaders had ""drifted"" and ""lost sight of America's destiny"" he said, standing before a backdrop of American flags. ""Now less than one year later I am proud to report that the entire world has heard the news and has seen the signs,"" he said. ""America is coming back and America is coming back strong."" By Barbara Plett, BBC state department correspondent National security strategies are usually released without fanfare, but President Trump wanted to make an event out of this announcement, which builds on his America First campaign priorities. So the document emphasises the economy and fair trade as security issues, as well as tough border controls and immigration policies. Mr Trump's decision to call out Russia and China as global competitors reflected the wariness within his administration about these two ""revisionist powers"". The president himself shifted quickly to talk about his recent phone calls with President Vladimir Putin, with whom he seeks a closer relationship. But the text of the document goes into quite biting detail about Russia's alleged interference in domestic politics, and about Chinese economic practices that anger the Americans. That was part of an overall theme that emphasised competition more than co-operation in international relations. It signalled engagement with the world rather than an isolationist retreat, but on more muscular terms than his predecessors. He named the US withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal among his successes in office. Mr Trump also said that wealthy countries must recognise that they need to ""reimburse"" the US for the costs of defending them. He criticised North Korea for their repeated nuclear missile tests, and Pakistan for not doing enough to tackle Islamic extremism. This video can not be played Donald Trump: 'America first, America first' He also outlined his campaign promise to build a wall on the southern border, as well as reform of the immigration visa system, which he said is necessary to defend the homeland. The new policy stresses economic security but does not recognise climate change as a national security threat. His predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 declared climate change an ""urgent and growing threat to our national security"". Trump's plan to deal with US rivals.

'Race bias' targeted in justice system,"The government is committed to exposing injustice, says David Lidington Setting targets to hire judges from ethnic minority backgrounds would be the ""wrong way"" to solve the issue of diversity, says the justice secretary. David Lidington has outlined steps to tackle ""race bias"" in the legal system in England and Wales, followinga damning report from MP David Lammy. But the minister says the government needs to ""look at the critical path"" into the law - rather than targets. Mr Lammy said he was ""disappointed"" with the government's response. Ethnic minority offenders 'face bias' Young offender: 'I'm done with fighting' Justice system near 'breaking point' The Lammy Review,external, published in September, said that people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds make up 25% of the prison population and 41% of the youth justice system - but only 14% of the general population. Ethnic minority groups make up only 11% of magistrates and 7% of judges. As a result, Mr Lammy had called for a national target to achieve representation in the courts by 2025. David Lammy made 35 recommendations to reform the criminal justice system However, Mr Lidington said a target would be ""the wrong way to attack this particular objective"" and he was looking at alternatives. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""When you look at the judges, you have got a group of people who have been practising in law perhaps for 20 years... because we need people who are experienced, who are expert, to sit on the bench. ""In getting a more diverse judiciary... you need to look at the critical path of how do people get into the legal profession in the first place."" Mr Lammy disagreed and instead called for a ""bold approach"". The Tottenham MP told the BBC: ""It is not about the pipeline. BAME (Black, Asian, and minority ethnic) lawyers are applying to join the judiciary. ""If you set a target or a goal, then it concentrates the mind to achieve that. But the government has not affected that. ""The UK is behind the curve on diversity and it needs to catch up."" This video can not be played Watch: Are ethnic minorities treated fairly? Lawyer and diversity campaigner Funke Abimbola was also disappointed with the decision, telling Today: ""It is an important element of [the recommendations] because bias in the judiciary has a direct impact on decision-making. ""This whole report was about there being proven bias against those minority ethnic backgrounds. [Targets are] a key part in driving diversity of thought, which impacts decisions in court."" By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The government's response to David Lammy's proposals suggests it's following them in spirit - but not to the letter. Many of the recommendations relate to changes to data collection, which should be relatively straightforward to implement. The harder task set by Mr Lammy involves increasing diversity, so those who work in the criminal justice system better reflect and understand the people who use it. Although ministers have agreed challenging targets to raise ethnic minority representation among prison officers, they've balked at doing the same for judges and magistrates. The experience of the police service, which failed to meet 10-year BME targets set in 1999 after the Macpherson report, may have influenced their decision. Targets can help focus efforts in achieving a goal - but if they're too stretching, they may prove counter-productive. The Lammy Review concluded that people from minority backgrounds still faced bias, ""including overt discrimination"", in parts of the justice system. Mr Lidington pledged to implement a ""key principle"" of ""change or explain"" when racial discrimination is found in the system. ""Where we cannot explain differences in outcomes for different groups, we will reform,"" he said, pledging to work on each of Mr Lammy's 35 recommendations - even if not following them to the letter. And he added this was the ""very first step"" in a change of attitude towards race disparity ""that will touch on every part of the criminal justice system for years to come"". Withinthe government's response,external, it said it would: Collect wider datasets related to ethnicity for more accurate analysis Publish more datasets so the public can see the reality Review use of ""gang"" prosecutions for those who are victims and exploited by adults Review modern slavery legislation to see how it could help with gang crime Redact, where possible, identifying information to make ""race-blind decisions"" Investigate better ways of explaining legal rights and options to build trust Assess maturity of young offenders over 18 Recruit a more diverse workforce in prisons and help people move to more senior roles Consider sealing criminal records Trial deferred prosecutions - where offenders can avoid trial when admitting the offence - in London Some of the changes would take longer to achieve than others, the Ministry of Justice said. But it had already made progress on several recommendations, including publishing data on race bias in the system. It said a new race and ethnicity board would drive through the reforms - but alternative approaches would be found where proposals could not be implemented in full.

What should sex education lessons cover?Parents and young people are being asked their views on new sex and relationships education content.,"Sexting, online pornography, staying safe online, transgender issues - should these topics be included in new sex and relationships education (SRE) guidelines for schools in England? The Department for Education is asking parents and young people for their opinions in an eight-week call for views on what should be covered. The current SRE guidelines have not been updated since the year 2000. Ministers say this is ""unacceptable"" and want new guidance for autumn 2019. The drive to improve and update SRE in schools in England comes as figures collected by BBC Panorama show arise in the number of sexual assaultsby children. Girls go along with sex acts, says teacher 'I didn't say no, but I regret that' The number of reported sexual offences by under-18s against other under-18s in England and Wales rose by 71% from 4,603 in 2013-14 to 7,866 in 2016-17. In March the DfE announced that SRE would be compulsory in all England's schools - meaning in academies as well as council-run schools. But Education Secretary Justine Greening said the current content advice for schools was out-of-date. Ms Greening said: ""It is unacceptable that relationships and sex education guidance has not been updated for almost 20 years, especially given the online risks - such as sexting and cyber-bullying - our children and young people face. ""Young people must have an education that teaches them the importance of healthy and stable relationships. ""This call for evidence is about giving teachers, parents and especially young people a chance to help shape that new approach and I'd urge them to take part."" Lisa Hallgarten, policy manager for the sexual health charity Brook, said: ""We have a very clear understanding of the unique challenges that young people face and what they need from their relationships and sex education. ""We thoroughly look forward to seeing a guidance that reflects this."" Rachel Krys, co-director of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: ""We know that children and young people experience sexual harassment and violence, and online they are exposed to images and content which can be very disturbing. ""It is vital that schools give children the information they need about sex, consent and healthy relationships."" Ruth Hunt, chief executive of campaign group Stonewall, said: ""The current guidance, published 17 years ago, contains no mention of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. ""Schools that teach LGBT-inclusive RSE are in the minority, leaving many LGBT young people without the information they need to make safe, informed decisions. ""Just 13% of LGBT young people have learnt about healthy same-sex relationships."" Thomas Pascoe, campaign director of the Coalition for Marriage, said: ""Under these proposals, the leading agent in the early sexualisation of children would be the state itself. ""We should be teaching young children broad values of respect and tolerance, not ordering them to accept adult sexual relationships which they are far too young to understand."" The eight-week consultation will be led by Ian Bauckham, who was awarded the CBE in 2017 for services to education. Mr Bauckham is head teacher of a large Church of England comprehensive school in Kent. He is a national leader of education and works with other schools in the region and further afield. ""I hope that the call for evidence being launched now gives us the chance to find out about the best teaching and to improve provision for all our young people in all types of school,"" he said.

Aircraft giants clash in trade row hearing,"Parts of the C-Series jet are produced by workers at Bombardier's Belfast plant Boeing and Bombardier traded verbal blows on Monday over claims by the US planemaker that the Canadian company receives massive subsidies. The two sides appeared before the US International Trade Commission (ITC) in the latest round of their bitter row. Boeing accused Bombardier of harming sales of its 737 aircraft and urged the ITC to support tariffs on its rival. But Bombardier, which makes wings in Belfast, said Boeing makes ""money hand over fist"" from the 737. Boeing claims Bombardier's new C-Series aircraft is being sold in the US below cost because of Canadian subsidies. The US company won the first round of the fight in October when the US Commerce Department ordered that tariffs of up to 300% should be imposed on the C-Series. The ITC will decide if the tariffs should be made permanent, which could effectively shut off the US market to the C-Series. Boeing acting 'spitefully' in trade row 'Inaction' claim over Bombardier jobs Why is Bombardier important to NI? In opening remarks to the ITC hearing, Bombardier representative Peter Lichtenbaum said: ""Boeing is making money hand over fist. And with a backlog of 737 orders years into the future, there are no signs of difficulty on the horizon."" Boeing countered that it had already been ""established beyond question that Bombardier has taken billions of dollars in illegal government subsidies to prop up its C-Series programme. The C-Series would not even exist at this point but for those subsidies"". Canada's ambassador to the US, David MacNaughton, warned that a ruling in favour of Boeing would not be the end of the dispute. He told the ITC panel that backing Boeing risked a possible violation of World Trade Organization rules. ""Boeing's assertion that future imports from Canada threaten to cause material injury is necessarily based on just the type of speculation and conjecture that is prohibited under both US and international law,"" he said. Canada earlier this month scrapped plans to buy 18 Boeing Super Hornet fighter jets, underlining Ottawa's anger over the trade challenge. The dispute is also being closely watched by the UK government, which fears any impact on C-Series sales will threaten jobs. The dispute stems from a 2016 sale of 75 C-Series jets to Delta Air Lines. Boeing claims Delta paid $20m per plane, well below an estimated cost of $33m and what Bombardier charges in Canada. Earlier this year, European planemaker Airbus took a controlling stake in the C-Series programme, and will begin production in Alabama. This will increase the US content of the aircraft, and generate hundreds of jobs.

Test-flunking Trump judge pick pulls outMatthew Petersen was unable to answer basic legal questions when senators quizzed him.2h2 hours agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played Trump's nominee for judge can't answer basic legal questions US President Donald Trump's latest judiciary nominee has withdrawn his name after failing to answer basic legal questions at his Senate confirmation hearing. Video of Matthew Petersen's embarrassing encounter went viral. ""It has become clear to me over the last few days that my nomination has become a distraction,"" Mr Petersen wrote in a letter. Mr Petersen was nominated as a federal judge in the District of Columbia. Mr Trump had accepted his offer to withdraw, the White House said. Mr Peterson, a Republican member of the Federal Election Commission, is the latest of Mr Trump's conservative judicial nominations to fail. At the hearing, Mr Peterson stumbled over questions asked by Republican Senator John Kennedy. Senator Kennedy starts by asking Mr Petersen and the four other nominees who appeared with him: ""Have any of you not tried a case to verdict in a courtroom?"" Only Mr Petersen raises his hand. Senator Kennedy: Have you tried a jury trial? Matthew Petersen: I have not. Senator Kennedy: Civil? Matthew Petersen: No. Senator Kennedy: Criminal? Matthew Petersen: No. Senator Kennedy: Bench?

Senator Kennedy: Just for the record, do you know what a motion in limine is? Matthew Petersen: I would probably not be able to give you a good definition right here at the table. The Louisiana Senator and former law professor, who still fully supports Mr Trump, openly criticised his nominee in a later TV interview. ""Just because you've seen My Cousin Vinny doesn't qualify you to be a federal judge,"" Mr Kennedy told local station WWL-TV,external, referring to the 1992 comedy film about a novice lawyer. Mr Kennedy told the station that Mr Trump called him after learning of the exchange and agreed that Mr Peterson was too inexperienced. Mr Peterson, who became the third of Mr Trump's judicial picks to flounder in just a week, said: ""I had hoped that my nearly two decades of public service might carry more weight than my two worst minutes on television.""

Woman jailed for people smuggling,"Wendy Thomas hid two women and a man in a car she tried to drive into the UK A woman who hid three people in a car and tried to drive them into the UK has been jailed for people smuggling. The Home Office said officers discovered the stowaways after stopping Wendy Thomas' car at the Eurotunnel terminal in France on 9 October 2016. Two of them were unresponsive and were rushed to hospital. Thomas, 50, of Cardiff, admitted assisting illegal immigration and was sentenced to 33 months at Blackfriars Crown Court. The man was found under a duvet in the car's foot well The two women were taken to hospital after being found unresponsive Two women were found inside a large black holdall in the boot of Thomas' car and had been covered by pillows and a large soft toy. The third passenger, a man who later claimed to be an Iranian national and was handed to the French authorities, was found hiding under cushions and a quilt in the rear foot wells. Thomas' co-conspirators Adriano Bettoja-Allen, 37, and his wife Jeanette, 49, of Newport, were also sentenced for their parts in two separate ""carefully planned"" attempts to smuggle people into the UK. The Home Office said investigations started following the arrest of Dawood Shahbeik at St Pancras International station, after he arrived on the Eurostar from Calais on 2 October 2016. Text messages on his mobile phone referred to a person who had been taken to a house in Newport, while a search of his luggage revealed a damaged Iranian passport and a large amount of cash. The pillows and large toy used to hide the three stowaways Thomas was arrested a week after Shahbeik and text messages on both their phones showed they had been in regular contact with Adriano Bettoja-Allen. Investigators found he and his wife had travelled through Calais on 2 October after meeting Shahbeik in Dunkirk. They also found Thomas and Bettoja-Allen had travelled in separate vehicles from Folkestone, Kent, to Coquelles, France, on the same Eurotunnel train on 8 October. Adriano Bettoja-Allen returned to the UK less than two hours after Thomas had been stopped by Border Force officers and financial checks also uncovered a large deposit into Thomas' bank account in September 2016. Adriano Bettoja-Allen was jailed for five years for his part in the smuggling operation Adriano Bettoja-Allen admitted assisting illegal immigration and was sentenced to five years in prison. Jeanette Bettoja-Allen pleaded guilty to the same charge and was sentenced to 11 months, suspended for two years. Shahbeik, who also admitted the same charge, was sentenced to 18 months in prison at an earlier hearing. Speaking after the case concluded, David Fairclough, assistant director from Immigration Enforcement's Criminal and Financial Investigation team, said: ""Adriano Bettoja-Allen was revealed by our investigations to be the common link between what initially appeared to be unconnected incidents. ""Our investigations showed that far from being opportunistic attempts to undermine the UK's border controls, the offences had been carefully planned. ""The fact that two women ended up in hospital demonstrates the dangerous lengths people smugglers will go to.""
