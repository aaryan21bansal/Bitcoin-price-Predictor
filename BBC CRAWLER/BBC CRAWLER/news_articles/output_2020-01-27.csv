Mr O'Connor spoke of his steadfast opposition to violence, and read an extract from Mr Mallon's memoirs in which he recalled the words of his father when he was a young boy. ""The only weapons that should ever be used again in this country are words,"" he read. ""Guns never solve problems, only make them - always remember that, son."" Mr Mallon's coffin was carried by SDLP leader Colum Eastwood and other party colleagues Mr Mallon was buried in a family plot in the grounds of St James' Seamus Mallon's parish priest, Fr Michael Woods, expressed sympathy for Mr Mallon's family, including his daughter Orla.

Mr Mallon was the first person in Northern Ireland to hold the post of deputy first minister, when the role was created in 1998. At that time, Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble was first minister and although they were dubbed a political ""odd couple"", the pair were united against violence. Seamus Mallon was integral to the signing of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement David Kerr, a former adviser to Mr Trimble, said the two men had done some of the ""heaviest lifting"" of the peace process and had not received enough recognition for that. ""Certainly with the Nobel Peace Prize, [former SDLP leader] John Hume was recognised, but at the end of the day I think Seamus Mallon did the majority of the work,"" he said. ""He was plain speaking, very direct, very honest - he told you what he thought. ""I think when you have people like that in politics it's refreshing and when you are straight and you have integrity in politics, people - whether they agree with you or disagree with you - they respect you.""

Virus death toll up to 82 as China extends holiday,"This video can not be played Road blocks and ghost towns: Inside the province where the virus originated The number of people killed in China by the new coronavirus has risen to 82, with almost 3,000 confirmed ill. The national new year holiday has been extended by three days to Sunday, in an attempt to contain the spread. The number of deaths in Hubei rose from 56 to 76, with six deaths elsewhere. Wuhan is in lockdown and several other cities have imposed travel bans. At least 44 cases have been confirmed abroad, including in Germany, the United States, and Australia. There have been no deaths outside China. How worried should we be? Companies tell workers 'stay at home' A visual guide to the outbreak On Monday, authorities in Beijing confirmed a 50-year-old man had died - the first fatality in the Chinese capital from the virus. In Shanghai, the government has stopped businesses from returning to work until 10 February. The ban applies to all companies apart from utilities, medical firms, medical suppliers, and supermarkets. Meanwhile, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is in Beijing to discuss the outbreak with the Chinese government and health experts.  81Deaths 2,827Confirmed cases 5,794Suspected cases 461In critical condition 51People recovered and discharged from hospital The BBC's Robin Brant in Shanghai says extending the main holiday of the year is a highly unusual move. But after the pre-new year travel surge, the prospect of half a billion people getting back on trains, planes and buses and criss-crossing the country again is the last thing the government wants, he adds. On Monday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and centre of the outbreak. Experts suspect many more people are infected, but actual figures are hard to ascertain due to a number of factors like some people being asymptomatic. Prof Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College, London, told the UK's Guardian newspaperhis ""best guess"" put the number at 100,000 infected,,externalwhile figures put together by the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong suggest the number was closer to 43,000. Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began How do you quarantine a city - and does it work? However, the University of Hong Kong research also suggested that - without public health intervention - tens of thousands more could be infected every day when the outbreak reaches its height. As a result of their projections, Gabriel Leung, the dean of the faculty of Medicine, was advising ""substantial, draconian measures"" to limit population mobility. The coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and there is no specific cure or vaccine. Most of the deaths have been of elderly people or those with pre-existing respiratory problems. Travel from the city, home to 11 million people, has been severely restricted and non-essential vehicles have been banned from the roads. At the Hubei border, workers are checking people's temperatures before allowing them into the province. The local government in Wuhan said no-one from the city had left China in the past four days. Some 4,096 tourists from Wuhan are still out of the country, while five million new year travellers left the city before the lockdown. Li Keqiang - China's second most powerful politician - visited Wuhan on Monday More than half a million medical staff have joined the province's prevention, control and treatment operations, while two makeshift hospitals are being built. New year celebrations were scaled back and four major cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Xian and Tianjin - have banned long-distance buses. Schools and official institutions will remain closed for the rest of this week. Beijing has closed the Forbidden City for tourists, as well as a section of the Great Wall. Both Disney parks in Hong Kong and Shanghai have closed. This video can not be played Ben Kavanagh, a teacher originally from County Kildare, describes the scene in Wuhan In Guangdong province, several cities have made face masks mandatory in public. Hong Kong, which has eight confirmed cases, has declared a city-wide emergency, with schools closed until 17 February. Mongolia - which has yet to record a case of the virus - has closed its border with China. It has also closed schools until 2 March, and banned public events. Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ? Meanwhile, He Qinghua, a top official with China's National Health Commission,told reporters some areas still ""lack determination in controlling the epidemic"", according to the state-run newspaper Global Times,external. He said rural villages, in particular, were failing to deal with the crisis ""in a timely manner"". Over the weekend, Chinese officials warnedthe virus was able to spread during its incubation period, believed to be between one and 14 days, making it harder to contain the illness. According to the World Health Organization and national authorities, there have been at least47 confirmed cases,externaloutside China. The latest case to be confirmed is in the German state of Bavaria, only the fourth so far in Europe. Eight cases:Thailand Five:USA, Australia, Singapore Four:Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea Three:France, Japan Two:Vietnam One:Nepal, Canada, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Germany In the UK, 73 people have been tested - but no-one has resulted to have contracted the virus. Almost all had recently been to Wuhan or had been in close contact with someone who had. The virus is thought to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Authorities have since temporarily banned the sale of all wildlife in China. The virus itself is a new, or ""novel"" coronavirus - a family that normally affects animals. Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Hubei / Henan A worker checking the BBC team's temperature Police and officials in the impact zone in Hubei and Henan provinces are now very keen to move us on wherever we arrive. They don't seem to mind where we go - as long as we leave their towns. We explain that the world wants to see the important, tiring work they're doing to combat the virus. But they're not interested. It could be that they're worried that our presence might imply to some that their patch is not handling this emergency well enough. One police officer at the entrance to a small town in Henan said to me: ""We don't have a problem here any more so there's no need for you to be here."" He said this at a checking station as cars were being pulled up behind him. Medical staff covered head to toe in protective clothing were then screening every passenger. They also checked the inside of all vehicles. I'm not sure what they were looking for - but it certainly didn't look like business as usual. The World Health Organization (WHO) advises its ""standard recommendations"" focusing on ""hand and respiratory hygiene"". That essentially means washing hands or using disinfectants, and covering one's mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. The advice also suggests avoiding contact with live animals in places where there have been coronavirus cases, and not to eat raw or uncooked animal products.

The Rated People advert displayed on the Tube in London prompted jokes the Duke of Sussex had already found a job afterstepping backfrom royal duties. But apparent lookalike Simon Pengelly from Brecon, Powys, said he was usually compared to actor Jason Statham. ""That photo was taken back in 2016... I normally have a shaved head,"" he said.

The self-employed builder and actor, who has made appearances in Being Human and Merlin, said he hoped the attention would provide a boost to his burgeoning acting career.

"UK has 'one shot' to secure global climate dealIf the Glasgow meeting fails, it will raise tough questions about the UN climate talks process, says the woman in charge.Science & Environment","The Scottish Events Campus includes the Armadillo and the SSE Hydro If the Glasgow climate conference fails to deliver, it could mark the end of the global approach to tackling the problem. COP26 in November will see around 200 world leaders meet to agree a new, long term deal on rising temperatures. But according to Claire O'Neill, the president of COP26, the UK has ""one shot"" at making it a success. She told aBBC documentarythat if Glasgow fails, people will question the whole UN approach. BBC World Service Discovery - 2020: A year to save the Planet? Five things we've learned from Madrid climate talks COP26 marks a critical moment for the UN in the long running effort to find a global solution to climate change. As part of the Paris climate deal, agreed in 2015, countries are meant to update their carbon cutting plans by the end of this year. So far, 114 say they have done this, or are in the process of doing so this year. COP26 President Claire O'Neill faces a huge challenge in forging agreement in Glasgow Another 120 countries have now told the UN that they have either agreed on plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 or are working towards that goal. While this represents some progress, a key part of the Glasgow meeting will be trying to push countries to go even further. In December, there was widespread dismay after countries failed to agree on more ambitious steps at theMadrid conference of the parties known as COP25. The messy compromise in the Spanish capital has also left a raft of complex issues unresolved, including the use of carbon markets, plus the question of compensation for loss and damage suffered by poorer nations from storms and rising sea levels. Underpinning the lack of progress in Madrid was the huge gap between big emitters such as Brazil, Australia, India, China and US and an alliance of countries wanting to go much faster including the European Union, small island states and vulnerable nations. Former UK minister Claire O'Neill has been tasked with presiding over COP26 and delivering an agreement acceptable to all. UN talks in Madrid ended in disappointment with many decisions kicked down the road Widely seen as knowledgeable and authoritative, Ms O'Neill says that Glasgow is the best, and perhaps last chance to make progress under the long drawn out UN process. ""I think we have one shot,"" she said, speaking to the BBC at the end of the Madrid conference in December. ""I think if we don't have a successful outcome next year people will legitimately look at us and say 'what are you doing, is there a better way?' ""I think we have this amazing opportunity to get the world together to talk about ambition but crucially to deliver it, and I guess I am really determined to do that."" Scientists say that to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century, a major upgrade is needed on the plans that countries are already applying to the problem. Delivering anything close to that type of deal in Glasgow will depend on a number of key meetings in the run up to COP26. One of the most important is the summit between the President of China, Xi Jinping and EU leaders in Leipzig in September. If the EU can persuade China to put an ambitious new climate plan on the table, it will significantly improve the chances of success in Glasgow. ""For China to enhance it's climate targets or not will be primarily a political and diplomatic decision, and that is precisely why the European engagement at the diplomatic level will be critical for us to unlock further climate ambition from Beijing,"" said Li Shuo from Greenpeace China. ""But the EU will have to have its own climate plan enhanced before the EU-China summit, and I think that's the only way to make that summit meaningful. ""The good news is that the Chinese president is coming and that provides a high level opportunity."" The influence of Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has grown rapidly However, many experts are concerned that China won't show its hand until they know who will be the next president of the United States - that election will take place just six days before the meeting in Glasgow opens. To achieve a deal, the UK will need to persuade some of the more reluctant countries like India, Brazil and Australia that it is in their interest to agree to increase their ambitions. Rachel Kyte is now Dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University, but was previously the World Bank's special envoy on climate change. She believes that agreement in Glasgow will need the UK to help shift the narrative - that a new climate deal offers more opportunities for countries than challenges. ""This is completely within our means. Most of the technology we need, we have. Most of the finance we have, it's just sloshing around in the economy just really inefficiently purposed at the moment,"" she said. ""Governments and leaders need to understand they will be rewarded for being on the right side of history and for taking the risk, and it is one worth taking.

Anger over Presidents Club clothing range,"It's been two years since the Presidents Club charity closed down amid anger over its men-only dinners at which waitresses were allegedly groped. But now a range of branded clothing has revived memories of the scandal - and stockists include Mike Ashley's House of Fraser chain. Among the clothes are figure-hugging black dresses emblazoned with a logo bearing the name The Presidents Club. Female entrepreneurs described the range as ""disgraceful"" and ""insulting"". In January 2018, the Presidents Club hit the headlines after it emerged that waitresses at its annual fund-raising event were told to wear revealing clothing and put up withsexual harassment from guests. Although the charity no longer exists, the brand has been registered as a trademark by Manchester-based businessman Martyn Warden,as first reported by the Mail on Sunday,external. Its website says that the company believes ""fashion is more than a choice, it's an experience"". House of Fraser also offers the range for both men and women from its own website. Women entrepreneurs contacted by the BBC reacted angrily to the range of clothing and to Mr Ashley's involvement. ""As a business owner and mother of two daughters, I am surprised and disappointed that in this day and age, someone like Mike Ashley should seek to exploit misogynistic practices for commercial gain,"" said Sonal Keay, founder of fashion firm This Is Silk. ""In an era where businesses are supposed to contribute positively towards all stakeholders, which includes wider society, it is an insulting move and I hope that his actions are condemned and ignored."" Kathryn Colas, founder and chief executive of women's advice and support service Simply Hormones, said: ""The clothing is disgraceful, insulting the image of professional working women today."" Giovanna Forte, chief executive of medical equipment firm Forte Medical, said: ""The concept is clearly an opportunistic attempt at exploiting a scandal. ""Whilst I cannot see anything too controversial about the designs - I've seen far more revealing in High Street retailers - it's up to women to vote with their wallets as to whether or not they wish to support the brand and its implications. ""The greater fuss that's made, the greater publicity will be generated and the more successful the exploitation. ""Much like the trousers on Presidents Club members, publicity around the clothing range just needs to be zipped up."" By contrast, Lu Li, founder of female entrepreneurs' support service Blooming Founders, objected to both the brand and the clothing. ""You can only wear this type of dress if you go bra-less,"" she told the BBC. ""There are very few people who can wear that type of dress naturally."" She added: ""It's reinforcing the message to young women that you're not pretty enough, you're not thin enough. ""It's taking a brand with a bad reputation and actually doubling down on what made it bad in the first place."" Frasers Group, which owns House of Fraser, and the Presidents Club have both been approached for comment by the BBC.

UK has 'one shot' to secure global climate deal,"The Scottish Events Campus includes the Armadillo and the SSE Hydro If the Glasgow climate conference fails to deliver, it could mark the end of the global approach to tackling the problem. COP26 in November will see around 200 world leaders meet to agree a new, long term deal on rising temperatures. But according to Claire O'Neill, the president of COP26, the UK has ""one shot"" at making it a success. She told aBBC documentarythat if Glasgow fails, people will question the whole UN approach. BBC World Service Discovery - 2020: A year to save the Planet? Five things we've learned from Madrid climate talks COP26 marks a critical moment for the UN in the long running effort to find a global solution to climate change. As part of the Paris climate deal, agreed in 2015, countries are meant to update their carbon cutting plans by the end of this year. So far, 114 say they have done this, or are in the process of doing so this year. COP26 President Claire O'Neill faces a huge challenge in forging agreement in Glasgow Another 120 countries have now told the UN that they have either agreed on plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 or are working towards that goal. While this represents some progress, a key part of the Glasgow meeting will be trying to push countries to go even further. In December, there was widespread dismay after countries failed to agree on more ambitious steps at theMadrid conference of the parties known as COP25. The messy compromise in the Spanish capital has also left a raft of complex issues unresolved, including the use of carbon markets, plus the question of compensation for loss and damage suffered by poorer nations from storms and rising sea levels. Underpinning the lack of progress in Madrid was the huge gap between big emitters such as Brazil, Australia, India, China and US and an alliance of countries wanting to go much faster including the European Union, small island states and vulnerable nations. Former UK minister Claire O'Neill has been tasked with presiding over COP26 and delivering an agreement acceptable to all. UN talks in Madrid ended in disappointment with many decisions kicked down the road Widely seen as knowledgeable and authoritative, Ms O'Neill says that Glasgow is the best, and perhaps last chance to make progress under the long drawn out UN process. ""I think we have one shot,"" she said, speaking to the BBC at the end of the Madrid conference in December. ""I think if we don't have a successful outcome next year people will legitimately look at us and say 'what are you doing, is there a better way?' ""I think we have this amazing opportunity to get the world together to talk about ambition but crucially to deliver it, and I guess I am really determined to do that."" Scientists say that to keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century, a major upgrade is needed on the plans that countries are already applying to the problem. Delivering anything close to that type of deal in Glasgow will depend on a number of key meetings in the run up to COP26. One of the most important is the summit between the President of China, Xi Jinping and EU leaders in Leipzig in September. If the EU can persuade China to put an ambitious new climate plan on the table, it will significantly improve the chances of success in Glasgow. ""For China to enhance it's climate targets or not will be primarily a political and diplomatic decision, and that is precisely why the European engagement at the diplomatic level will be critical for us to unlock further climate ambition from Beijing,"" said Li Shuo from Greenpeace China. ""But the EU will have to have its own climate plan enhanced before the EU-China summit, and I think that's the only way to make that summit meaningful.

Bryant, 41, and his daughter Gianna, 13, were among the nine killed when the aircraft came down in Calabasas. There were no survivors from Sunday's crash which happened in foggy weather. Bryant, a five-time NBA champion, played for the LA Lakers throughout his career and is considered one of the greatest players in the game's history. Tributes from celebrities, politicians and fellow sports stars have been pouring in, many expressing shock at his sudden death. Moments of silence have been observed at basketball games across the US. Giant who had his controversies Gianna Bryant: The basketball talent killed alongside father World sport stars and celebrities pay tribute Fans gathered at a makeshift memorial for Bryant in front of the Staples Center - where the Lakers play - on Sunday, laying flowers and basketballs in memory of the star.  â Mourners left flowers and wrote tributes to Bryant on the wall of the new hall Bryant was also rememberedat the Grammy Awardswhich were held at the same venue on Sunday evening. ""We're all feeling crazy sadness right now,"" said Grammys host Alicia Keys. ""Because earlier today Los Angeles, America and the whole wide world lost a hero. We're literally standing here heartbroken in the house that Kobe Bryant built."" This video can not be played Alicia Keys and Lizzo lead tributes to Kobe Bryant at the Grammys The NBA issued a statement saying it was ""devastated by the tragic passing of Kobe Bryant and his daughter, Gianna"". ""For 20 seasons, Kobe showed us what is possible when remarkable talent blends with an absolute devotion to winning,"" it said. Kobe Bryant's life in pictures There have been tributes from as far away as the Philippines - wherea new basketball centre named after Bryant opened just hours before his death- and Italy, where Bryant spent part of his childhood as his father played in the Italian basketball league. A minute's silence would be observed at all basketball games ""in every category for the entire week"", the Italian basketball federation (Fip) said on Monday. Fip president Giovanni Petrucci said Bryant ""has been and will always be linked to Italy"". Sheriff Alex Villanueva said the helicopter's manifest indicated that nine people were on board when it crashed, raising the number from five in earlier statements by officials. Coroners have not officially named the victims. Family members and colleagues however saidJohn Altobelli, coach of the Orange Coast College baseball team, was among the passengers,external, along with his wife Keri and their 13-year-old daughter Alyssa - who played with Bryant's daughter, Gianna. Christina Mauser, a basketball coach at Gianna's school, was also on board, her husband wrote on Facebook. In a statement on Sunday afternoon, the City of Calabasas said it heard the news ""with great sadness"". ""The aircraft went down in a remote field off Las Virgenes around 10:00 this morning. Nobody on the ground was hurt,"" it added. Investigators are still trying to find out the cause of the crash. But conditions were foggy, and local police had grounded their helicopters due to the poor weather. Kurt Deetz, who has flown helicopters carrying Bryant in the past, told the Los Angeles Times thatweather was a more likely cause of the accident than a mechanical issue,external. ""The likelihood of a catastrophic twin engine failure on that aircraft - it just doesn't happen,"" he said. This video can not be played Site where basketball legend Kobe Bryant was killed in a helicopter crash Gavin Masak, who lives nearby, told CBS News of the moment the helicopter crashed. ""It wasn't exactly like an explosion sound but it was like a loud boom. It sounded like a helicopter, but it sounded like a jet, like it was loud, so I went inside and told my dad what was happening. So when I came out I saw smoke on the hill but it wasn't like a big, black cloud of smoke, it was just grey,"" he said. Other eyewitnesses told celebrity news site TMZ they heard the helicopter's engine sputtering before it went down. Roads in the area have been closed to stop people trying to get to the crash site. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) identified the crashed helicopter as a Sikorsky S-76B. Bryant was known for taking his helicopter to beat traffic,externalin Los Angeles. Bryant played his entire 20-year career with the Los Angeles Lakers. He retired in April 2016. His achievements include being the 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) and two-time NBA Finals MVP. He was also NBA scoring champion twice and a two-time Olympic champion.

He also won an Oscar for best short animated film in 2018 for Dear Basketball, a five-minute film based on a love letter to the sport he had written in 2015. Bryant and his wife, Vanessa, have three other daughters, Natalia, Bianca and Capri.

Varadkar: EU will have stronger team in trade talks,"This video can not be played Varadkar: ""There will be checks required"" between NI and GB Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has suggested the EU will be the ""stronger team"" in post-Brexit trade talks with the UK. Comparing negotiations to a football match, he suggested to the BBC that the EU would be at an advantage due to its larger population and market. The taoiseach said he did not think the UK had ""yet come to terms with the fact it's now a small country"". Boris Johnson said he would be able to ""wrap this all up"" by the end of 2020. Mr Varadkar held talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Barnier told reporters the two sides faced ""the risk of a cliff edge"" if trade terms were not agreed by the end of the post-Brexittransition periodin December. He cautioned that a ""very short time"" remained to ""rebuild"" the UK-EU relationship. A simple guide to Brexit What trade deals has the UK done so far? Analysis: Varadkar's tough talk on EU deal Frictionless GB to NI trade 'impossible' - Barnier In an interview earlier with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Varadkar also said striking a deal in this timeframe was possible but would be ""difficult"". He pledged the EU would not be ""dragging its feet,"" but added: ""My assessment is that it is more likely that we will need an extension in order to finalise a free trade agreement and future economic partnership than not need it."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson says UK can ""wrap up"" Brexit this year Mr Johnson, however, said he had to ""respectfully disagree"" with his Irish counterpart's doubts, insisting a deal can be reached ""in the time we've got"". The UK PM added: ""We've got until the end of the year, but we will be doing things very fast, and in a very friendly, respectful way."" Mr Johnson has insisted he is not open to any extension. Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that from the UK side, trade talks will be led by a 40-person ""task force"" headed by the PM's Europe adviser David Frost. This video can not be played Michel Barnier: Risk of ""cliff edge"" in Brexit trade talks Mr Varadkar, the leader of the Fine Gael party,is fighting his first election campaign as taoiseach.Ireland heads to the polls on 8 February. He told the BBC: ""The European Union is a union of 27 member states. The UK is only one country. And we have a population and a market of 450 million people. ""The UK, it's about 60[m]. So if these were two teams up against each other playing football, who do you think has the stronger team?"" He also cautioned the UK against trying to negotiate individual deals covering different sectors of the economy. ""The final deal, the new relationship will have to be comprehensive,"" he said. ""When I hear people talk about piecemeal, it sounds a bit like cake and eat,"" he said, adding: ""That isn't something that will fly in Europe."" ""You may have to make concessions in areas like fishing in order to get concessions from us in areas like financial services."" Mr Varadkar said there was ""genuine concern"" across Europe that the UK would seek to ""undercut"" EU standards after Brexit. ""When I meet Prime Minister Johnson he says, no, absolutely not - that's not the kind of United Kingdom that I want to lead as prime minister."" But he added: ""We want that written down in law, we want that in a treaty."" What is a ""level playing field""? Mr Varadkar said both sides would have to agree a ""common set of minimum standards"" for an agreement to be possible. But this is likely to be a contentious area of talks, with British ministers having insisted the UK should have the right to move away from EU regulations. Another potential flashpoint is likely to be access to fishing waters, which both sides have pledged to sort out before the end of June. Leaked slides from an EU presentation last Friday said the bloc would be aiming for the same level of access to British fishing stocks it has now, and would not sign a wider trade deal until fishing access has been agreed. But the UK government insists it will ""take back control"" of its waters. A leaked slide presentation from a meeting last Friday has revealed more of the EU's objectives in the upcoming trade talks. Diplomats from national governments agreed that commitments by the UK to maintaining a level playing field - i.e. not undercutting other EU nations for competitive advantage - are a ""precondition"" for a deal. There should also be a role for the European Court of Justice in any deal to protect EU law. The EU will pursue what it calls a ""comprehensive approach"" to the negotiations and there will be ""trade-offs between chapters"" i.e. give-and-take across different areas of the deal. The EU will expect to be treated as a single bloc, so the UK will not, for example, be able to offer something to Germany that it doesn't offer to everyone else.  In case of future disputes with the UK, there would be the possibility for ""cross-retaliation"" where a disagreement in one sector sees the EU retaliating in another. EU sources say they want to build a relationship with the UK that is balanced and sustainable, where neither side ""feels taken for a ride"".

How Auschwitz became centre of Nazi Holocaust,"A group of child survivors behind a barbed wire fence at the Nazi concentration camp at Auschwitz On 27 January 1945, Soviet troops cautiously entered Auschwitz. Primo Levi - one of the most famous survivors - was lying in a camp hospital with scarlet fever when the liberators arrived. The men cast ""strangely embarrassed glances at the sprawling bodies, at the battered huts and at us few still alive"", he would later write. ""They did not greet us, nor did they smile; they seemed oppressed not only by compassion but by... the feeling of guilt that such a crime should exist."" ""We saw emaciated, tortured, impoverished people,""soldier Ivan Martynushkin said of liberating the death camp,external. ""We could tell from their eyes that they were happy to be saved from this hell."" 'I survived two concentration camps' The families who weren't meant to live Holocaust row seethes as leaders gather in Israel In just over four-and-a-half years, Nazi Germany systematically murdered at least 1.1 million people at Auschwitz. Almost one million were Jews. Those deported to the camp complex were gassed, starved, worked to death and even killed in medical experiments. The vast majority were murdered in the complex of gas chambers at Auschwitz II-Birkenau camp. Six million Jewish people died in the Holocaust - the Nazi campaign to eradicate Europe's Jewish population. Auschwitz was at the centre of that genocide. When the Nazis came to power in 1933 they began to strip Jewish people of all property, freedoms and rights under the law. After the German invasion and occupation of Poland in 1939, the Nazis started deporting Jewish people from the Third Reich to parts of Poland, where they created ghettos to separate them from the rest of the population. In 1941, during the German invasion of the USSR, the Nazis began their campaign of extermination in earnest. Nazis spoke about their invasion as a race war between Germany and Jewish people, as well as the Slavic population and the Roma. This video can not be played Explaining the Holocaust to young people Groups of German soldiers called Einsatzgruppen set out across newly conquered lands in Eastern Europe to massacre civilians. By the end of 1941, they had killed 500,000 people, and by 1945 they had murdered about two million - 1.3 million of whom were Jewish. Behind the lines, Nazi commanders were experimenting with ways to kill en masse. They feared that shooting people was too stressful for their soldiers, and so came up with more efficient means of murder. Experimental gas vans had been used to kill mentally disabled people in Poland as early as 1939. Poisonous fumes were pumped into a sealed compartment to suffocate those inside. By the winter of 1941, the Nazis had constructed gas chambers at Auschwitz. Nazi leaders met in January 1942 at the Wannsee Conference to coordinate the industrial slaughter - what they called a ""final solution to the Jewish question"" - killing the entire European Jewish population, 11 million people, by extermination and forced labour. Auschwitz was originally a Polish army barracks in southern Poland. Nazi Germany invaded and occupied Poland in September 1939, and by May 1940 turned the site into a jail for political prisoners. This area - with the infamous lie Arbeit Macht Frei written above the entrance in German - meaning work sets you free - became known as Auschwitz I. This video can not be played Auschwitz: Drone footage from Nazi concentration camp But as the war and the Holocaust progressed, the Nazi regime greatly developed the site. The first people to be gassed were a group of Polish and Soviet prisoners in September 1941. Work began on a new camp, Auschwitz II-Birkenau, the following month. This became the site of the huge gas chambers where hundreds of thousands were murdered prior to November 1944, and the crematoria where their bodies were burned. German chemicals company IG Farben built and operated a synthetic rubber factory at Auschwitz III-Monowitz. Other private companies like Krupp and Siemens-Schuckert also ran factories nearby, to use the prisoners as slave labour. Both Primo Levi and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel survived Monowitz concentration camp. When Auschwitz was eventually liberated, it had more than 40 camps and subcamps. People from all over Europe were crammed into cattle wagons without windows, toilets, seats or food, and transported to Auschwitz. There they were sorted into those who could work and those who were to be immediately killed. The latter group were ordered to strip naked and sent to the showers for ""delousing"" - a euphemism used for the gas chambers. Guards used Zyklon B pellets to murder people in the gas chambers Nazis cremated victims in ovens Guards from the so-called ""Hygienic Institute"" would then drop powerful Zyklon-B gas pellets into the sealed chambers, and wait for people to die. It took about 20 minutes. The thick walls could not hide the screams of those suffocating inside. Then Sonderkommandos - other prisoners, usually Jews forced to work for the guards or be killed - would remove artificial limbs, glasses, hair and teeth before dragging the corpses to the incinerators. Ashes of the bodies were buried or used as fertiliser. Belongings of those gassed and those sent to work were taken for sorting in a part of the camp known as ""Canada"" - so named because the country was seen as a land of plenty. SS guards sought to hide their crimes as Soviet troops closed in, and tried to destroy their extensive prisoner records - making it hard to fully quantify the number of victims. Academic studies since agree that in total close to 1.3 million people arrived at Auschwitz. About 1.1 million of them died there. The Holocaust: Who are the missing million? Jews from all across Nazi-controlled Europe made up the vast majority of the victims. Almost one million Jewish people were murdered at Auschwitz. One specific example was Hungary's Jewish population. In the space of just two months, between May and July 1944, Hungary transported 420,000 of the 437,000 Jewish people it sent to Auschwitz. So many Hungarian Jewish people were killed in such a short time that victims' bodies were dropped in pits near the camp and burned Tens of thousands of Hungarian Jews were sent to Auschwitz every day. Three quarters of them were killed on arrival. Some 75,000 Polish civilians, 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, 25,000 Roma and Sinti, as well as Jehovah's Witnesses, homosexuals and political prisoners were also put to death by the German state at the Auschwitz complex. German authorities ordered a halt to gassing and the destruction of the gas chambers and crematoria in late 1944, as Soviet troops advanced westward. The stockpile of stolen valuables in the Canada sector was shipped to Germany shortly afterwards. Determined to erase the evidence of their crimes, the Nazis ordered 56,000 remaining prisoners to march west to other concentration camps, such as Bergen-Belsen, Dachau and Sachsenhausen. Those too sick to walk were left behind; any who fell behind on the march itself were killed. Soviet forces found only a few thousand survivors when they entered the camp on 27 January 1945, along with hundreds of thousands of clothes and several tonnes of human hair. Soldiers later recalled having to convince some survivors that the Nazis had truly gone. Elie Wiesel later said in a speech to mark the 50th anniversary of the liberation,externalthat the Nazi crimes at Auschwitz ""produced a mutation on a cosmic scale, affecting man's dreams and endeavours"".

Anger over Presidents Club clothing rangeThe charity that closed down after a groping scandal has had its name revived to sell dresses.Business,"It's been two years since the Presidents Club charity closed down amid anger over its men-only dinners at which waitresses were allegedly groped. But now a range of branded clothing has revived memories of the scandal - and stockists include Mike Ashley's House of Fraser chain. Among the clothes are figure-hugging black dresses emblazoned with a logo bearing the name The Presidents Club. Female entrepreneurs described the range as ""disgraceful"" and ""insulting"". In January 2018, the Presidents Club hit the headlines after it emerged that waitresses at its annual fund-raising event were told to wear revealing clothing and put up withsexual harassment from guests. Although the charity no longer exists, the brand has been registered as a trademark by Manchester-based businessman Martyn Warden,as first reported by the Mail on Sunday,external. Its website says that the company believes ""fashion is more than a choice, it's an experience"". House of Fraser also offers the range for both men and women from its own website. Women entrepreneurs contacted by the BBC reacted angrily to the range of clothing and to Mr Ashley's involvement. ""As a business owner and mother of two daughters, I am surprised and disappointed that in this day and age, someone like Mike Ashley should seek to exploit misogynistic practices for commercial gain,"" said Sonal Keay, founder of fashion firm This Is Silk. ""In an era where businesses are supposed to contribute positively towards all stakeholders, which includes wider society, it is an insulting move and I hope that his actions are condemned and ignored."" Kathryn Colas, founder and chief executive of women's advice and support service Simply Hormones, said: ""The clothing is disgraceful, insulting the image of professional working women today."" Giovanna Forte, chief executive of medical equipment firm Forte Medical, said: ""The concept is clearly an opportunistic attempt at exploiting a scandal. ""Whilst I cannot see anything too controversial about the designs - I've seen far more revealing in High Street retailers - it's up to women to vote with their wallets as to whether or not they wish to support the brand and its implications. ""The greater fuss that's made, the greater publicity will be generated and the more successful the exploitation. ""Much like the trousers on Presidents Club members, publicity around the clothing range just needs to be zipped up."" By contrast, Lu Li, founder of female entrepreneurs' support service Blooming Founders, objected to both the brand and the clothing. ""You can only wear this type of dress if you go bra-less,"" she told the BBC. ""There are very few people who can wear that type of dress naturally."" She added: ""It's reinforcing the message to young women that you're not pretty enough, you're not thin enough. ""It's taking a brand with a bad reputation and actually doubling down on what made it bad in the first place.""

Kate's personal portraits of Holocaust survivors,"Steven Frank is seen alongside his granddaughters Maggie and Trixie The Duchess of Cambridge has taken photographs of Holocaust survivors in a contribution to an exhibition marking 75 years since the end of the genocide. The duchess said her subjects were ""two of the most life-affirming people that I have had the privilege to meet"". It comes as the world marks International Holocaust Memorial Day, 75 years after Auschwitz was liberated. Later, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend the UK commemorations in Westminster. In the images taken by Catherine for the exhibition, which opens later this year, two survivors are pictured with their grandchildren. One of her portraits was of 84-year-old Steven Frank, originally from Amsterdam, who survived multiple concentration camps as a child. He is pictured alongside his granddaughters Maggie and Trixie Fleet, aged 15 and 13. Dutch PM sorry for country's role in Holocaust Searching for traces of my grandfather at Auschwitz Three German women who defied the Nazis Netanyahu warns of Iran threat at Holocaust forum 'Finding my family': A Newsround special Her other portrait is of 82-year-old Yvonne Bernstein, originally from Germany, who was a hidden child in France throughout most of the Holocaust. She is pictured with her granddaughter Chloe Wright, aged 11. Yvonne Bernstein is pictured with her granddaughter Chloe Wright Speaking about the project, the duchess, who is the patron of the Royal Photographic Society, said: ""The harrowing atrocities of the Holocaust, which were caused by the most unthinkable evil, will forever lay heavy in our hearts. ""Despite unbelievable trauma at the start of their lives, Yvonne Bernstein and Steven Frank are two of the most life-affirming people that I have had the privilege to meet. ""Their stories will stay with me forever."" The exhibition will bring together 75 images of survivors and their family members; one for every year since the largest Nazi death camp, Auschwitz, was liberated on 27 January 1945. Judith Rosenberg, Scotland's last Holocaust survivor, recalled being separated from her family and transported to the camp, where she came face to face with the murderous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. ""There was no life. We were starving,""the 97-year-old told the BBCin an interview to mark the anniversary of the camp's liberation. Commemorations are being held around the world on Monday to mark the end of the Holocaust, in which six million Jews and millions of others were murdered, and to honour survivors of subsequent genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur. The duchess said her aim was to make the portraits ""deeply personal to Yvonne and Steven - a celebration of family and the life that they have built since they both arrived in Britain in the 1940s"". ""It was a true honour to have been asked to participate in this project and I hope in some way Yvonne and Steven's memories will be kept alive as they pass the baton to the next generation,"" she said. The Duchess of Cambridge was seen with her camera on a visit to Pakistan last year Two more survivors were photographed by other contributors. In a photograph by Frederic Aranda, Joan Salter, 79 - who fled the Nazis as a young child - appears with her husband Martin and her daughter Shelley. John Hajdu, 82, who survived the Budapest Ghetto, is in a portrait with his four-year-old grandson Zac, photographed by Jillian Edelstein. The photographic project aims to inspire people across the UK to consider their own responsibility to remember and share the stories of those who endured persecution at the hands of the Nazis. It is a collaboration between the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, Jewish News and the Royal Photographic Society. Catherine has beenhonoured for her photographyand has previously shared picturesshe has taken of her family.

Billie Eilish is the big winner at the Grammys,"This video can not be played Billie Eilish says ""anything is possible"" after making history at the Grammys Pop star Billie Eilish swept the board at the 2020 Grammys, winning five awards, including best new artist and song of the year. The 18-year-old also won album of the year for her debut, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go, which was recorded in her childhood home in LA. She replaces Taylor Swift as the youngest person ever to win the award. ""I joke around a lot at these things, but I genuinely want to say I'm so grateful,"" said the singer. Eilish triumphed in all of the Grammys ""big four"" marquee categories - song of the year, record of the year, album of the year and best new artist. She is the first person to achieve the feat since Christopher Cross in 1981. Grammys 2020: Big speeches and emotional moments In Pictures: Highlight from the 2020 Grammys Grammy Awards 2020: List of nominees and winners Her elder brother, Finneas O'Connell, also picked up producer of the year for his work on Eilish's album. He said the record had been made at home because ""I'm the most creative where I'm most comfortable,"" adding: ""It's a huge honour to be given a Grammy for making home-made cookies."" Eilish appeared to be overwhelmed by the extent of her domination of the awards. Accepting the album of the year prize, she turned to fellow nominee Ariana Grande and said: ""Can I just say that I think Ariana deserves this?"" (Grande waved off the comments, ceding the prize back to the winner). Billie Eilish was honoured for her album and the hit single Bad Guy Earlier, on the red carpet, the singer said she felt like an impostor. ""I feel like I'm not supposed to be here,"" she joked. ""I feel like they accidentally let in a fan."" But the teenager has re-written the rules of pop over the last 12 months, creating ominous, unsettling songs that disrupt typical song structures and lure listeners down dark sonic avenues. ""We didn't make this album to win a Grammy,"" said Finneas, joining his sister on stage. ""We wrote an album about depression and suicidal thoughts and climate change and being a bad guy, whatever that means. ""And we stand up here confused and grateful."" Other big winners on the night included Lil Nas X, who won video of the year for Old Town Road, and Lizzo, who scooped three prizes including best pop solo performance for her breakout hit, Truth Hurts. The singer also opened the ceremony and, along with host Alicia Keys, paid tribute to basketball star Kobe Bryant, who died earlier in the day. ""Tonight is for Kobe,"" Lizzo announced as the show began, before singing the lines, ""I'm crying 'cos I love you"". Grammys ceremony opens with tribute to Kobe Bryant Grammys 2020: Red carpet in pictures After her performance, Keys, who was hosting the show, walked solemnly to the stage and asked the audience to remember Bryant's family. ""I would like everybody to take a moment and hold them inside of you and share our strength and our support,"" she said. This video can not be played Alicia Keys and Lizzo lead tributes to Kobe Bryant at the Grammys Several other performers, including Lil Nas X, DJ Khaled and Run-DMC, paid tribute to the star during the ceremony by holding his jersey aloft. Stand-out moments came from hip-hop auteur Tyler, The Creator, who performed in the middle of a burning house; and pop singer Demi Lovato, who sang live for the first time since a suspected overdose two years ago. Ariana Grande, who refused to attend last year's Grammys after a public clash with the show's producer, Ken Ehrlich, made amends with a lavish, risquÃ© and heavily bleeped-out medley of her songs Imagine, Seven Rings, and Thank You, Next, backed by an orchestra. British artists were thin on the ground, but the Chemical Brothers won two awards, including best dance album for No Geography. Dua Lipa, who won best new artist last year, was also on hand to pass the baton to Billie Eilish. She used her speech to champion gender diversity in the music industry, which is still overwhelmingly dominated by men. ""There are so many stellar female producers, artists, songwriters [and] engineers,"" she said. ""If you're in the business and you're hiring, raise your sights to the amazing, talented women out there because we deserve a seat at every table.""

Kobe Bryant: Flawed genius?,"This video can not be played Watch: When Bryant scored 60 points in his final LA Lakers game For most sporting superstars, the first act - chewing up opponents, training obsessively, playing harder, winning, always winning - is the easy part. It's instinct and it's obvious. It's the natural part of being a natural. It's the second act that brings the doubts and the breakdowns. The loss of the old physical certainties, the end of the dominance. Someone born with an ability to see patterns and plays before others is suddenly unable to answer the biggest question of all: what happens next? The tragedy ofKobe Bryant's early death,and that of his daughter Gianna, is primarily a family one. Sport's shock and grief is second to that of wife, daughters, parents, friends. Watch: Kobe Bryant's famous poem, 'Dear Basketball' 'One of the most extraordinary players in history' - world pays tribute to Bryant Watch: When Bryant scored 60 points in his final LA Lakers game What links them all is that Bryant, a genius on the basketball court, sometimes a flawed character off it - appeared to be solving his life after sport in a way that many of his contemporaries and antecedents could not. It was always about a lineage with Kobe. Michael Jordan the inspiration before, the overlapping and feuding and sometime chemistry with Shaquille O'Neal, the battles and then abdication to LeBron James. That's not to deny the basketball-playing greatness of Bill Russell or Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Bird and Magic Johnson. The difference with the four that followed them was how they leapt out of the sport as well. Each had their competing brands - Nike for Jordan, Reebok for Shaq, Adidas in the early years for Kobe - but in every one the NBA recognised a talent and narrative that could take its league to places and popularity that the old guard could not. Jordan described Bryant as his little brother and the shared traits were unambiguous. Jordan sometimes seemed to play with a rage, determined to prove himself right and everyone else wrong, not caring who or what got chewed up along the way. His obsession fuelled his greatness but magnified his shortcomings too. So it was with Kobe the player. After watching the film Kill Bill he began calling himself Black Mamba, seeing in himself an assassin's ruthlessness on court, an ability to strike repeatedly when others could not. Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal won many trophies together while playing for the LA Lakers None of that is normal, but neither is much that goes into becoming the best in a world of elites. In creating a sporting machine you can misplace the softer, more human stuff along the way. Just as Jordan lost himself in gambling, in the mess around his father's murder and the short-lived sojourn in baseball that was mixed up in all of that, so Bryant's weaknesses were inescapable too. The 2003 scandal following accusations of rape from a 19-year-old woman may have ended withcriminal charges being dropped,,externalbut the subsequent civil lawsuit and aftermath clouded what had been an unblemished public image. There was thehomophobic abuse of an umpireand a subsequent $100,000 fine, as well as an apology. On court Bryant could be selfish, missing more shots in his career than any other player in NBA history, proudly admitting that he would rather miss 30 shots in a game than nine because it showed that he would never give up. He had serious disputes with O'Neal, with Lakers management, even with Phil Jackson, the Zen-practising coaching virtuoso who also drew the very best from Jordan in their time together at the Chicago Bulls. Kobe Bryant's number 8 and 24 Los Angeles Lakers jerseys were retired on 18 December 18, 2017 He also won two league scoring titles as well as the five championship rings. He missed but he made far more. Reconciliation and a second era of dominance followed the initial estrangement with the Lakers. All of it, good and bad, like Jordan, sprang from the traits that his great friend and on-court rival Vince Carter says defined him: ""His drive. His mentality. His will to win."" Those were the bonds and the ties. It was in navigating the second act that Bryant was starting to cut himself free. Jordan has not yet learned to replace that first infatuation. For him it's more about admitting to himself that he won't, of living with a beautiful past that will probably always overshadow his present and future. ""I would give up everything now to go back and play the game of basketball,"" he admitted, as he turned 50. Jordan is rich beyond the comprehension of the earlier generation of NBA legends but is still struggling to find anything that satisfies him as much as the first act. He will always be the most important person in the room, but he now does so as someone who must deal with failure, and fading eyesight, and a body that no longer allows him the daily miracles it used to. Bryant was moving towards a better place. As his own father Joe had been to his development, instilling the lifelong love of their shared sport, taking him with him to Italy for seven years as a child when his own playing career moved on from the NBA, so Bryant was with his four daughters and the wider generation beyond. His dedication to Gianna was total, coaching her middle-school basketball team, watching Lakers and college games with her courtside. From that came a wider commitment to women's basketball, advising the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, holding coaching camps for younger players. There was generosity at home and a munificence elsewhere. The first time he met a young LeBron, at an All-Star weekend, he gave him his boots. As LeBron overtook his scoring record a few days ago, he wrote ""Mamba for life, 8, 24 KB"" on his current shoes, an inadvertent valediction to his hero's shirt numbers and driving force. Much of what Bryant did in his 41 years seemed preordained, from the moment he jumped straight from Lower Merion High in suburban Philadelphia to the NBA draft and on to Los Angeles via a famous trade with the Charlotte Hornets. He fulfilled all that crazy potential, came past the wild predictions and hopes that made been made when he was still a skinny teenager in Jordan's shoes. He was also starting to do something else entirely. ""Dear Basketball,"" he wrote, in the poem that became an Oscar-winning short film. ""We both know, no matter what I do next/ I'll always be that kid/ With the rolled-up socks/ Garbage can in the corner/ Five seconds on the clock/ Ball in my hands."" He will be. But Kobe Bryant was escaping too, navigating the second act, becoming something that all around hoped would last.

"Gianna Bryant, basketball talent","Gianna Bryant died alongside her father Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California As the daughter of Kobe Bryant - a five-time NBA champion - Gianna Bryant had big shoes to fill. Like her father, the 13-year-old was a prodigiously talented basketball player. With his help as her personal coach, Gianna hoped to become a professional. Bryant was confident Gianna would do so, often speaking of his wish for her to continue his legacy, albeit in the women's game. Tragically, neither would live to see that aspiration come to fruition. Bryant and Gianna were reported to be heading to a basketball game on Sunday when their helicopter crashed in the city of Calabasas, west of Los Angeles. There were no survivors. The pair was expected to take part in a basketball tournament for young players at the Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks, US media report. Gianna was playing, Bryant was coaching. Basketball legend dies in helicopter crash NBA legend's career in numbers Sport stars and celebrities pay tribute Attending basketball games together was typical of their relationship, which was said to be close.

Bryant said that, following his retirement from basketball in 2016, he switched off from the sport. His daughter, however, rekindled his passion for the game. Gianna Bryant, 13, had aspirations to make a mark as a pro, like her father ""It wasn't me sitting there, you know as an athlete or a player or something like that, and you know it's like about me, and I don't like that. It was her - she was having such a good time,"" Bryant told the BET network in a recent interview. In retirement, Bryant spent most of his time with his family - his wife, Vanessa, and four daughters - Gianna, Natalia, Bianka and Capri. But Gianna was said to have shared a particularly special bond with her father. Bryant's affection for his daughter, also known as Gigi, is obvious from his social media profiles.

You gotta have somebody to carry on your tradition, the legacy. ""She's like, 'I got this',"" Bryant said. ""I'm like, 'that's right'. Yes, you do, you got this."" Not only did Bryant support his daughter, he championed the development of women's basketball more broadly. He tried to draw attention to the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) league which, since its founding in 1996, has steadily increased in popularity. ""The WNBA is a beautiful game to watch,"" Bryant told the LA Times last year. Bryant was said to have had a special bond with Gianna At present, 12 teams compete in the league, which runs from May to September. But like in many other professional sports, women are paid significantly less than their male counterparts. The average pay for male NBA players this season is around $7.5m (Â£5.7m),according to data from Basketball Reference,external. In contrast, the average pay for female WNBA players is around $116,000, reports say. The WNBA has attempted to address the pay disparity, recently agreeing major pay rises with the union that represents players.

"Football banter at work 'excludes women'A management body says sports chat in the office can be a ""gateway"" to more laddish behaviour.","Ann Francke said sports chat can leave women feeling left out Chat about football or cricket in the workplace should be curtailed, a management body has warned. Chartered Management Institute head Ann Francke said sports banter can exclude women and lead to laddish behaviour such as chat about sexual conquests. ""A lot of women, in particular, feel left out,"" she told the BBC's Today programme. ""They don't follow those sports and they don't like either being forced to talk about them or not being included."" ""I have nothing against sports enthusiasts or cricket fans - that's great,"" she said. ""But the issue is many people aren't cricket fans,"" she added, arguing bosses should crack down on sports banter. Ms Francke is concerned that discussing football and, for example, the merits of video assistant refereeing (VAR) can disproportionately exclude women and divide offices. ""It's a gateway to more laddish behaviour and - if it just goes unchecked - it's a signal of a more laddish culture,"" she said ""It's very easy for it to escalate from VAR talk and chat to slapping each other on the back and talking about their conquests at the weekend."" Nevertheless, Ms Francke does not think sports chatter should be banned, just moderated. She said that good managers should be inclusive and ensure that everyone in their team feels comfortable. But sports journalist Jacqui Oatley thinks cracking down on sports chatter would be a ""terrible idea"". ""If you ban football chat or banter of any description, then all you're going to do is alienate the people who actually want to communicate with each other,"" she told the Today programme. ""It would be so, so negative to tell people not to talk about sport because girls don't like it or women don't like it, that's far more divisive."" She said the secret was to discuss sport in an inclusive way and to notice if people were blankly ""staring into space"" during the conversation. A majority of people responding to a LinkedIn post from the BBC and on Twitter appear to agree with Ms Oatley. Former sports, gambling, charities and loneliness minister Tracey Crouch called the Chartered Management Institute's advice ""a load of nonsense"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Mallon was the first person in Northern Ireland to hold the post of deputy first minister, when the role was created in 1998.

Seamus Mallon was integral to the signing of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement David Kerr, a former adviser to Mr Trimble, said the two men had done some of the ""heaviest lifting"" of the peace process and had not received enough recognition for that. ""Certainly with the Nobel Peace Prize, [former SDLP leader] John Hume was recognised, but at the end of the day I think Seamus Mallon did the majority of the work,"" he said. ""He was plain speaking, very direct, very honest - he told you what he thought. ""I think when you have people like that in politics it's refreshing and when you are straight and you have integrity in politics, people - whether they agree with you or disagree with you - they respect you.""

"PM unveils fast-track science visas after BrexitBoris Johnson hails the UK as ""open to the most talented minds"" with quicker route in for scientists.Science & EnvironmentComments","The Government has announced that a fast-track visa will open next month to attract the world's leading scientists. The visas will have no cap on the numbers of suitably qualified people able to come to the UK. The announcement follows a pledge last year by the PM to turn the UK into a""supercharged magnet to attract scientists like iron filings"". Researchers remain concerned about the uncertainty of the UK's role in EU research programmes following Brexit. The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said: ""The UK has a proud history of scientific discovery, but to lead the field and face the challenges of the future we need to continue to invest in talent and cutting-edge research. ""That is why as we leave the EU I want to send a message that the UK is open to the most talented minds in the world, and stand ready to support them to turn their ideas into reality."" Johnson's chief advisor: Science is No 10's top priority after Brexit PM orders fast-track visas for UK science Ministers reverse May-era foreign student rules The new visa system will begin on February 20 and managed by the UK Research and Innovation Agency (UKRI), which funds government research, rather than the Home Office. This is to ensure that suitable applicants are quickly assessed and fast-tracked by those qualified to asses their scientific credentials, rather than immigration officials. Tacitly addressing concerns about the impact of Brexit on the UK's participation in international programmes, the government claims the scheme has been introduced in order to enable UK-based research projects to recruit the best scientists and mathematicians. The announcement is a big win for research organisations who had been lobbying the government very hard for a fast-track visa system for leading researchers to mitigate what they feared would be a brain drain after Brexit. They are especially pleased that UKRI, with the support of other so-called endorsed research organisations, can vouch for an applicant - instead of Home Office officials attempting to determine their scientific attainment. Prof Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the UK's Royal Society, was among those lobbying hardest for the system to be run by research organisations. He welcomed the announcement, saying the new visa would be ""attractive"" to talented researchers and specialists from all over the world - and at all stages of their careers. ""It sends out a positive message that the UK is committed to remaining open to overseas science talent who would collaborate with our outstanding home-grown minds,"" he said. ""What is good for science is good for everybody, and can help tackle important challenges such as climate change or disease."" Sir Venki added: ""The government has listened to the research community, and this is an important first step in creating the visa system that we need for attracting global scientific talent - one that is welcoming, faster and more flexible, and takes into account the long-term aspirations of scientists and their families."" But Dr Robert Massey, deputy director of the Royal Astronomical Society tweeted that he was concerned the system would still restrict the entry of young, up-and-coming researchers. He gave it ""a cautious welcome"", adding: ""The issues will still though be about calling for the 'most talented', which isn't a label many early career researchers identify with."" BBC News reported last year that, after Brexit, scienceis one of the top priorities for the PM's chief aide, Dominic Cummings. Senior research leaders have confirmed that they have been in talks with Mr Cummings and the Science Minister Chris Skidmore in Downing Street. The talks focused on how best to spend a possible multi-billion pound increase in research funding. The outcome may be announced in the March budget. Immigration system to 'put people before passports' Five times immigration changed the UK How has immigration changed in your area? EU researchers account for about half of the total UK scientific workforce of 211,000. Currently, they do not need visas to work in British labs. But freedom of movement between the UK and EU is expected to end after the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020. The government says it willintroduce an Australian-style points-based systemby January 2021. Boris Johnson previously said he wants to draw scientists to the supercharged magnet of Britain ""like iron filings"" Sir Jim McDonald, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said he was ""delighted"" to see that the new visa system would be run by researchers rather than civil servants. He commented: ""The new arrangements will allow awardees of a much larger range of UK and international fellowships to receive fast-track visas through the academies, while UKRI will administer a route that awards fast-track visas to principals and named team members of research and innovation grants from a range of endorsed funders."" The head of UKRI, Prof Sir Mark Walport, said: ""Today's announcements further underline the importance of research and innovation to the future success of the UK and the government's continued commitment and investment."" Labour's spokesperson for industrial strategy, Chi Onwurah, said additional support and recognition for science should be welcomed. But she added that the new measures ""suggest a lack of understanding of innovation, which depends on scientists, researchers, engineers and technicians at all levels and not just a few 'top talent'"". Chi Onwurah said the new visa rules ""suggest a lack of understanding"" by solely focusing on ""top talent"" ""Ending the Erasmus scheme, denying visas to scientists from Africa and Asia, imposing a minimum salary of Â£30,000, these all adversely affect the richness and quality of our scientific base,"" she said. Christine Jardine, from the Liberal Democrats, said the announcement suggests Mr Johnson ""doesn't understand"" what makes the UK science sector successful. ""Science relies on thousands of researchers, and this announcement does nothing for the vast majority of them. If the government is serious about championing UK science, it must prioritise continued mobility as part of our future relationship with the EU,"" she said.

Gianna Bryant: Basketball talent killed alongside father,"Gianna Bryant died alongside her father Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California As the daughter of Kobe Bryant - a five-time NBA champion - Gianna Bryant had big shoes to fill. Like her father, the 13-year-old was a prodigiously talented basketball player. With his help as her personal coach, Gianna hoped to become a professional. Bryant was confident Gianna would do so, often speaking of his wish for her to continue his legacy, albeit in the women's game. Tragically, neither would live to see that aspiration come to fruition. Bryant and Gianna were reported to be heading to a basketball game on Sunday when their helicopter crashed in the city of Calabasas, west of Los Angeles. There were no survivors. The pair was expected to take part in a basketball tournament for young players at the Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks, US media report. Gianna was playing, Bryant was coaching.

It was her - she was having such a good time,"" Bryant told the BET network in a recent interview.

You gotta have somebody to carry on your tradition, the legacy. ""She's like, 'I got this',"" Bryant said. ""I'm like, 'that's right'. Yes, you do, you got this."" Not only did Bryant support his daughter, he championed the development of women's basketball more broadly. He tried to draw attention to the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) league which, since its founding in 1996, has steadily increased in popularity. ""The WNBA is a beautiful game to watch,"" Bryant told the LA Times last year. Bryant was said to have had a special bond with Gianna At present, 12 teams compete in the league, which runs from May to September. But like in many other professional sports, women are paid significantly less than their male counterparts. The average pay for male NBA players this season is around $7.5m (Â£5.7m),according to data from Basketball Reference,external. In contrast, the average pay for female WNBA players is around $116,000, reports say. The WNBA has attempted to address the pay disparity, recently agreeing major pay rises with the union that represents players.

Kate's 'personal' portraits of Holocaust survivors,"Steven Frank is seen alongside his granddaughters Maggie and Trixie The Duchess of Cambridge has taken photographs of Holocaust survivors in a contribution to an exhibition marking 75 years since the end of the genocide. The duchess said her subjects were ""two of the most life-affirming people that I have had the privilege to meet"". It comes as the world marks International Holocaust Memorial Day, 75 years after Auschwitz was liberated. Later, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will attend the UK commemorations in Westminster. In the images taken by Catherine for the exhibition, which opens later this year, two survivors are pictured with their grandchildren. One of her portraits was of 84-year-old Steven Frank, originally from Amsterdam, who survived multiple concentration camps as a child. He is pictured alongside his granddaughters Maggie and Trixie Fleet, aged 15 and 13.

She is pictured with her granddaughter Chloe Wright, aged 11. Yvonne Bernstein is pictured with her granddaughter Chloe Wright Speaking about the project, the duchess, who is the patron of the Royal Photographic Society, said: ""The harrowing atrocities of the Holocaust, which were caused by the most unthinkable evil, will forever lay heavy in our hearts. ""Despite unbelievable trauma at the start of their lives, Yvonne Bernstein and Steven Frank are two of the most life-affirming people that I have had the privilege to meet. ""Their stories will stay with me forever."" The exhibition will bring together 75 images of survivors and their family members; one for every year since the largest Nazi death camp, Auschwitz, was liberated on 27 January 1945. Judith Rosenberg, Scotland's last Holocaust survivor, recalled being separated from her family and transported to the camp, where she came face to face with the murderous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. ""There was no life. We were starving,""the 97-year-old told the BBCin an interview to mark the anniversary of the camp's liberation. Commemorations are being held around the world on Monday to mark the end of the Holocaust, in which six million Jews and millions of others were murdered, and to honour survivors of subsequent genocides in Cambodia, Rwanda, Bosnia and Darfur. The duchess said her aim was to make the portraits ""deeply personal to Yvonne and Steven - a celebration of family and the life that they have built since they both arrived in Britain in the 1940s"". ""It was a true honour to have been asked to participate in this project and I hope in some way Yvonne and Steven's memories will be kept alive as they pass the baton to the next generation,"" she said.

PM unveils fast-track science visas after Brexit,"The Government has announced that a fast-track visa will open next month to attract the world's leading scientists. The visas will have no cap on the numbers of suitably qualified people able to come to the UK. The announcement follows a pledge last year by the PM to turn the UK into a""supercharged magnet to attract scientists like iron filings"". Researchers remain concerned about the uncertainty of the UK's role in EU research programmes following Brexit. The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said: ""The UK has a proud history of scientific discovery, but to lead the field and face the challenges of the future we need to continue to invest in talent and cutting-edge research. ""That is why as we leave the EU I want to send a message that the UK is open to the most talented minds in the world, and stand ready to support them to turn their ideas into reality."" Johnson's chief advisor: Science is No 10's top priority after Brexit PM orders fast-track visas for UK science Ministers reverse May-era foreign student rules The new visa system will begin on February 20 and managed by the UK Research and Innovation Agency (UKRI), which funds government research, rather than the Home Office. This is to ensure that suitable applicants are quickly assessed and fast-tracked by those qualified to asses their scientific credentials, rather than immigration officials. Tacitly addressing concerns about the impact of Brexit on the UK's participation in international programmes, the government claims the scheme has been introduced in order to enable UK-based research projects to recruit the best scientists and mathematicians. The announcement is a big win for research organisations who had been lobbying the government very hard for a fast-track visa system for leading researchers to mitigate what they feared would be a brain drain after Brexit. They are especially pleased that UKRI, with the support of other so-called endorsed research organisations, can vouch for an applicant - instead of Home Office officials attempting to determine their scientific attainment. Prof Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the UK's Royal Society, was among those lobbying hardest for the system to be run by research organisations. He welcomed the announcement, saying the new visa would be ""attractive"" to talented researchers and specialists from all over the world - and at all stages of their careers. ""It sends out a positive message that the UK is committed to remaining open to overseas science talent who would collaborate with our outstanding home-grown minds,"" he said. ""What is good for science is good for everybody, and can help tackle important challenges such as climate change or disease."" Sir Venki added: ""The government has listened to the research community, and this is an important first step in creating the visa system that we need for attracting global scientific talent - one that is welcoming, faster and more flexible, and takes into account the long-term aspirations of scientists and their families."" But Dr Robert Massey, deputy director of the Royal Astronomical Society tweeted that he was concerned the system would still restrict the entry of young, up-and-coming researchers. He gave it ""a cautious welcome"", adding: ""The issues will still though be about calling for the 'most talented', which isn't a label many early career researchers identify with."" BBC News reported last year that, after Brexit, scienceis one of the top priorities for the PM's chief aide, Dominic Cummings. Senior research leaders have confirmed that they have been in talks with Mr Cummings and the Science Minister Chris Skidmore in Downing Street. The talks focused on how best to spend a possible multi-billion pound increase in research funding. The outcome may be announced in the March budget. Immigration system to 'put people before passports' Five times immigration changed the UK How has immigration changed in your area? EU researchers account for about half of the total UK scientific workforce of 211,000. Currently, they do not need visas to work in British labs. But freedom of movement between the UK and EU is expected to end after the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020. The government says it willintroduce an Australian-style points-based systemby January 2021. Boris Johnson previously said he wants to draw scientists to the supercharged magnet of Britain ""like iron filings"" Sir Jim McDonald, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said he was ""delighted"" to see that the new visa system would be run by researchers rather than civil servants. He commented: ""The new arrangements will allow awardees of a much larger range of UK and international fellowships to receive fast-track visas through the academies, while UKRI will administer a route that awards fast-track visas to principals and named team members of research and innovation grants from a range of endorsed funders."" The head of UKRI, Prof Sir Mark Walport, said: ""Today's announcements further underline the importance of research and innovation to the future success of the UK and the government's continued commitment and investment."" Labour's spokesperson for industrial strategy, Chi Onwurah, said additional support and recognition for science should be welcomed. But she added that the new measures ""suggest a lack of understanding of innovation, which depends on scientists, researchers, engineers and technicians at all levels and not just a few 'top talent'"". Chi Onwurah said the new visa rules ""suggest a lack of understanding"" by solely focusing on ""top talent"" ""Ending the Erasmus scheme, denying visas to scientists from Africa and Asia, imposing a minimum salary of Â£30,000, these all adversely affect the richness and quality of our scientific base,"" she said. Christine Jardine, from the Liberal Democrats, said the announcement suggests Mr Johnson ""doesn't understand"" what makes the UK science sector successful. ""Science relies on thousands of researchers, and this announcement does nothing for the vast majority of them. If the government is serious about championing UK science, it must prioritise continued mobility as part of our future relationship with the EU,"" she said.

Starmer: We need to end Westminster 'monopoly',"This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""The government hasn't really got a clue"" Britain needs a radical redistribution of wealth and opportunity and an end to the ""monopoly of power"" in Westminster, Sir Keir Starmer has said. Ahead of a speech, the Labour leadership candidate argued that goal could be reached with a system ""built on the principle of federalism"". Returning to campaigning after a week's break, he also promised to address the ""underlying causes"" of Brexit. So far, Sir Keir and Lisa Nandy have places on the final members' ballot. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry are vying to secure enough nominations to reach the last stage of the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Who will be Labour's next leader? Unite union backs Long-Bailey for Labour leader Anti-Semitism claims 'used to undermine Corbyn' Mrs Long-Bailey has also called for parliaments in Scotland and Wales to be as ""autonomous and independent"" as possible, but not going as far as mentioning federalism. Speaking at an earlier hustings, she said: ""When we devolved power to Scotland and Wales they were never meant to be a satellite government with Westminster being the king and them being servile under the bottom. They were meant to be on an equal footing. That's what we need to push forward for."" While the devolved parliaments in the UK are still ultimately controlled by central government in Westminster - meaning the Commons could repeal the law that allows for their existence in the first place - federalism would give the governments equal power with SW1. Sir Keir gained a further nomination on Monday from the union Community, which also announced it was backing Angela Rayner for deputy leader. General secretary Roy Rickhuss said Sir Keir's ""experience and vision are what the Labour Party needs to rebuild, win back the trust of voters, and lead a transformative Labour government"". Profile: Sir Keir Starmer Sir Keir - the shadow Brexit secretary - is setting out his vision for a ""new political consensus"". At a speech in East London later, he will argue for the need to ""empower people to have a real say in their workplace, in the communities they're part of and over the public services they use"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme this would ""address underlying causes and reasons"" behind the Brexit vote, arguing one of the main drivers was people wanting ""power and influence and decision making closer to them"". Sir Keir - who was a prominent advocate for Remain - said he was ""making the case for the future of the United Kingdom with a different political consensus, where we devolve that power and opportunity and wealth away from Whitehall and Westminster"". He also warned not addressing these issues would mean ""we are at risk of watching the break-up of the United Kingdom"" and ""we leave a vacuum"" for nationalism to take hold. But Sir Keir said it was not about whether he supported Brexit or not, adding that when the UK leaves the bloc on Friday, ""that debate is over"". This video can not be played Who decides on the next Labour leader? The Holborn and St Pancras MP suspended his campaign last week after his mother-in-law was involved in a serious accident last week. This week he will travel to constituencies in England, Wales and Scotland to hear people's views. He will also unveil his ideas for how Labour can reflect the experience and skills of all parts of the party. The new Labour leader and deputy leader will be announced on 4 April. On Friday, the Unite trade unionconfirmed it would endorseMrs Long-Bailey for leader. Profile: Rebecca Long-Bailey Unite's general secretary Len McCluskey said the Salford and Eccles MP had ""the brains and the brilliance"" to take on Boris Johnson. Asked on Today whether he thought Sir Keir's proposals would appeal to Brexit-backing Labour supporters, Mr McCluskey said: ""Clearly Leave voters wanted something different from what they have had for the past couple of decades [but] I am not sure constitutional change was upmost in their mind."" He said there will be a need to ensure ""power is rested away from Westminster"", but the answer now was to ""invest in our communities"" to improve wages, job security and public services. Mr McCluskey added: ""They have been starved for a decade now, hurt by austerity."" Profile: Lisa Nandy Profile: Emily Thornberry To make the final ballot, hopefuls need the support of three unions and affiliate groups representing 5% of the membership, or 33 local branches. Having already been nominated by bakers' union BFAWU, Unite's support for Mrs Long-Bailey means she needs just one more union or affiliate by the 14 February deadline. Mr McCluskey said ""all of the candidates are capable of uniting the party"", but Mrs Long-Bailey was ""the best placed"".

Bereaved parents call for police investigationOne baby died shortly after being born prematurely when her mother was sent home with paracetamol.Wales,"This video can not be played Kayden was born with severe brain damage following mistakes in his mother's maternity care A couple whose baby died after errors at a scandal-hit maternity service say they want a police investigation. Cwm Taf Morgannwg Health Board maternity services wereplaced in special measuresin 2019. Mistakes in Sarah Handy's care contributed to her baby's death in 2017, an inquest found. The health board apologised and said it had addressed issues raised by parents after a report by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Mrs Handy's case is one of 140 being reviewed to establish whether mothers and babies were harmed bythe care they receivedat maternity units run by Cwm Taf Morgannwg - in Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil, and the Royal Glamorgan Hospital, Llantrisant. She and her husband Jonathan now want to know if wider, systemic failings may have played a part too. The leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council, Andrew Morgan, has echoed the family's call for a criminal investigation. BBC Wales Investigatesdiscovered mistakes made by maternity services in Cwm Taf Morgannwg have cost tens of millions of pounds in compensation payments in the last 10 years. Mrs Handy, a high-risk patient because of medical issues, ended up giving birth at home because of an error at Prince Charles Hospital. When she went to hospital suffering from what she thought were labour pains, a registrar sent her home with laxatives and paracetamol. But Mrs Handy was in labour, and no longer close to the medical help she needed. Sarah and Jonathan Handy want to know if wider failings played a part in their daughter's death Jennifer was born so premature she needed specialist care - but instead her father, a police officer, had to deliver his daughter. She was breathing but in a serious condition, and Mr Handy performed CPR until the paramedics came. But by the time Mrs Handy and her daughter reached the hospital, Jennifer had died and her mother needed emergency surgery, spending weeks in hospital. ""I have flashbacksâ¦ nightmares because of having to live in the place where such a horrific thing happened to you,"" she said. But because of failings in record keeping at the hospital, what happened was not reported as a ""serious"" incident. Q&A: Cwm Taf maternity problems 'Significant progress' after failings Health board boss resigns after maternity failings ""Our baby daughter died,"" Mr Handy, from Merthyr, said. ""My wife nearly died at home and I can't for the life of me understand how that's not a serious incident. What does qualify as a serious incident? There's a death. What is above that?"" At the inquest into Jennifer's death in April 2019 the coroner concluded that the registrar's mistake in sending Mrs Handy home had contributed to the baby's death. That same month, a report from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) was published. It outlined how despite repeated warnings from staff and regulators, the health board had failed to address issues such as under-staffing and a malfunctioning complaints system. The Handys want to know if the wider failings uncovered by the inspection may have played a part in Jennifer's death too. Mr Handy said: ""Surely somewhere there has to be an investigation into whether there's any criminal element to it. ""I won't be able to rest I don't think, till we know that it has been thoroughly looked at - all angles."" For six years Cwm Taf Morgannwg midwives had been trying to raise the alarm. The head of their Royal College in Wales (RCM), Helen Rogers, saw the problems first hand. She told the BBC: ""We were finding the staff in tears, really distressed they couldn't give the care and they genuinely felt that if they raised concerns, that if they put their head above the parapet, in their words, or if they spoke up they would be punished in some way. And that was the very clear perception."" The RCM's concerns were raised with managers including then chief executive Allison Williams. Paid up to Â£175,000 a year, it was her job to make sure the service was run properly. Former health board chief executive Allison Williams has apologised Ms Rogers says concerns were passed on to Ms Williams. Managers tried to reconfigure the service but problems remained. In 2017 maternity staff were asked to complete an anonymous survey. Of those that did, 91% said there weren't enough staff to complete work properly. They also warned it felt ""unsafe"" and women were receiving an unacceptable standard of care. Mistakes made in Lisa Broom's care at Prince Charles Hospital in 2012 led to her son Kayden being born with severe brain damage which caused physical and learning disabilities. Kayden has undergone more than 50 operations and needs 24-hour care and support at his Merthyr Tydfil home. Ms Broom went into labour three months early and staff at Prince Charles Hospital said she would need to be transferred to a specialist unit. The only bed available was at the John Radcliff Hospital in Oxford - 120 miles away. ""Even in the ambulance I kept saying please don't take me, I'm not going to make it,"" she said. ""But they had no choice, they had to follow whatever somebody above them said."" Kayden Broom's mother was sent to Oxford by ambulance when she went into labour But there were communication errors - the registrar who sent Ms Broom to Oxford wrongly assumed she would be sent by air ambulance. She was not checked by a consultant or given the correct medication before leaving Merthyr. As her ambulance pulled into the hospital car park in Oxford, Kayden was born but not breathing. He was starved of oxygen which caused the brain damage. The health board has apologised and said that lessons would be learned. Kayden's lawyer Stephen Webber has helped a number of families get compensation for mistakes made by Cwm Taf Morgannwg's maternity service. He said the total payments and cost of ongoing care for children could run into ""tens of millions"" and the health board needs to learn from its mistakes. ""It's incredibly frustrating these sorts of errors are made because it is not some great technical piece of medical treatment. It is a breakdown in communication,"" Mr Webber said. ""They [Cwm Taf] make these compensation payments and think it's enough. Well it simply isn't. They need to confront these problems."" Lawyer Stephen Webber has sued Cwm Taf Morgannwg on behalf of several families Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething said he feels he was ""not told the truth"" about the state of staffing before the full picture emerged. He said: ""I don't think the messaging we had was as full and honest as it should have been."" He added: ""It was plain that actually, understaffing wasn't just an issue between recruitment rounds, but there was a real issue for a period of time about the staffing levels, and some staff complained and raised concerns about that and had direct assurances that it would be tackled and it wasn't. "" In 2018 a consultant midwife report said there were ongoing, systematic failures and recommended changes had not been implemented. But the report was not shared by the then chief executive and three senior managers at the health board. Mr Gething said that was something he was ""incredibly unhappy"" about. ""It's exactly what should not happen in the health service, in any part of the health service,"" he said. Problems were still being highlighted at Prince Charles Hospital as recently as two months ago Allison Williams apologised publicly at the Senedd for the maternity failings. She said: ""A community like ours deserves the very best for all the reasons that you say, and we have failed themâ¦.there's no disputing that."" Ms Williams took sick leave beforequitting in the summer of 2019, and declined to comment when approached by BBC Wales Investigates. Despite maternity services being in special measures, a leaked report seen by the BBC from the Health Inspectorate for Wales shows mothers and babies were still being put at risk at Prince Charles Hospital as recently as two months ago, with emergency resuscitation equipment not properly checked and patient records not stored correctly. Similar problems were uncovered at Cwm Taf Morgannwg's other maternity unit at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend. Asked about the current concerns identified by HIW,  Dr Sharon Hopkins, interim chief executive at Cwm Taf Morgannwg, told the programme all the concerns highlighted have now been addressed. ""We're very clear that we're not where we need to be yet. There are still lots of improvements to make,"" she said. ""I think things are safe, things are clinically safe, but are they as good as they could be? Is the quality where we would like it to get to? No it's not."" Andrew Morgan said he felt misled over the maternity failings Rhondda Cynon Taf council leader Andrew Morgan said it was ""an absolute scandal"" nobody on the health board had been held to account for the previous maternity service failings. He echoed the Handys' calls for criminal investigations. ""If it's established that harm did come to individuals through neglect or because people knew of the risks and didn't act,  then potentially they should face further action through the courts,"" he said.

Grammys honour Bryant,"This video can not be played Alicia Keys and Lizzo lead tributes to Kobe Bryant at the Grammys The 2020 Grammys ceremony has opened with a heartfelt tribute to basketball player Kobe Bryant, who died on Sunday. ""Tonight is for you Kobe,"" declared pop star Lizzo, opening the show with her stirring ballad Cuz I Love You. Host Alicia Keys then dedicated the show to Bryant's memory, with an a-capella version of It's So Hard To Say Goodbye, accompanied by Boyz II Men. The show is taking place at the Staples Center, where Bryant played his entire career with the LA Lakers. Basketball great Bryant dies in helicopter crash Early Grammys for Dolly Parton and Lil Nas X Grammy Awards 2020: List of nominees and winners News of the star's death at the age of 41 stunned artists and performers backstage at the arena when it broke earlier in the day. ""I genuinely thought it wasn't real,"" said pop star Billie Eilish. ""I was in the green room... and I was like, 'Oh that has to be fake'"". The star, who grew up in Los Angeles, added: ""Everybody knew Kobe. Everybody. It's genuinely unbelievable. ""I feel like anything I say is not enough for what's going on."" Alicia Keys is hosting the ceremony for the second time The mood was sombre as the ceremony started, and Keys acknowledged the atmosphere in her opening speech.

Varadkar: EU will have upper hand in trade talks,"This video can not be played Varadkar: ""There will be checks required"" between NI and GB Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has suggested the EU will be the ""stronger team"" in post-Brexit trade talks with the UK. Comparing negotiations to a football match, he suggested to the BBC that the EU would be at an advantage due to its larger population and market. The taoiseach said he did not think the UK had ""yet come to terms with the fact it's now a small country"". Boris Johnson said he would be able to ""wrap this all up"" by the end of 2020. Mr Varadkar held talks with EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier on Monday. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Barnier told reporters the two sides faced ""the risk of a cliff edge"" if trade terms were not agreed by the end of the post-Brexittransition periodin December. He cautioned that a ""very short time"" remained to ""rebuild"" the UK-EU relationship. A simple guide to Brexit What trade deals has the UK done so far? Analysis: Varadkar's tough talk on EU deal Frictionless GB to NI trade 'impossible' - Barnier In an interview earlier with BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, Mr Varadkar also said striking a deal in this timeframe was possible but would be ""difficult"". He pledged the EU would not be ""dragging its feet,"" but added: ""My assessment is that it is more likely that we will need an extension in order to finalise a free trade agreement and future economic partnership than not need it."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson says UK can ""wrap up"" Brexit this year Mr Johnson, however, said he had to ""respectfully disagree"" with his Irish counterpart's doubts, insisting a deal can be reached ""in the time we've got"". The UK PM added: ""We've got until the end of the year, but we will be doing things very fast, and in a very friendly, respectful way."" Mr Johnson has insisted he is not open to any extension. Meanwhile, it has been confirmed that from the UK side, trade talks will be led by a 40-person ""task force"" headed by the PM's Europe adviser David Frost. This video can not be played Michel Barnier: Risk of ""cliff edge"" in Brexit trade talks Mr Varadkar, the leader of the Fine Gael party,is fighting his first election campaign as taoiseach.Ireland heads to the polls on 8 February. He told the BBC: ""The European Union is a union of 27 member states. The UK is only one country. And we have a population and a market of 450 million people. ""The UK, it's about 60[m]. So if these were two teams up against each other playing football, who do you think has the stronger team?"" He also cautioned the UK against trying to negotiate individual deals covering different sectors of the economy. ""The final deal, the new relationship will have to be comprehensive,"" he said. ""When I hear people talk about piecemeal, it sounds a bit like cake and eat,"" he said, adding: ""That isn't something that will fly in Europe."" ""You may have to make concessions in areas like fishing in order to get concessions from us in areas like financial services."" Mr Varadkar said there was ""genuine concern"" across Europe that the UK would seek to ""undercut"" EU standards after Brexit. ""When I meet Prime Minister Johnson he says, no, absolutely not - that's not the kind of United Kingdom that I want to lead as prime minister."" But he added: ""We want that written down in law, we want that in a treaty."" What is a ""level playing field""? Mr Varadkar said both sides would have to agree a ""common set of minimum standards"" for an agreement to be possible. But this is likely to be a contentious area of talks, with British ministers having insisted the UK should have the right to move away from EU regulations. Another potential flashpoint is likely to be access to fishing waters, which both sides have pledged to sort out before the end of June. Leaked slides from an EU presentation last Friday said the bloc would be aiming for the same level of access to British fishing stocks it has now, and would not sign a wider trade deal until fishing access has been agreed. But the UK government insists it will ""take back control"" of its waters. A leaked slide presentation from a meeting last Friday has revealed more of the EU's objectives in the upcoming trade talks. Diplomats from national governments agreed that commitments by the UK to maintaining a level playing field - i.e. not undercutting other EU nations for competitive advantage - are a ""precondition"" for a deal. There should also be a role for the European Court of Justice in any deal to protect EU law. The EU will pursue what it calls a ""comprehensive approach"" to the negotiations and there will be ""trade-offs between chapters"" i.e. give-and-take across different areas of the deal. The EU will expect to be treated as a single bloc, so the UK will not, for example, be able to offer something to Germany that it doesn't offer to everyone else.  In case of future disputes with the UK, there would be the possibility for ""cross-retaliation"" where a disagreement in one sector sees the EU retaliating in another. EU sources say they want to build a relationship with the UK that is balanced and sustainable, where neither side ""feels taken for a ride"".

Virus death toll up to 80 as China extends holiday,"This video can not be played Road blocks and ghost towns: Inside the province where the virus originated The number of people killed in China by the new coronavirus has risen to 82, with almost 3,000 confirmed ill. The national new year holiday has been extended by three days to Sunday, in an attempt to contain the spread. The number of deaths in Hubei rose from 56 to 76, with six deaths elsewhere. Wuhan is in lockdown and several other cities have imposed travel bans. At least 44 cases have been confirmed abroad, including in Germany, the United States, and Australia. There have been no deaths outside China. How worried should we be? Companies tell workers 'stay at home' A visual guide to the outbreak On Monday, authorities in Beijing confirmed a 50-year-old man had died - the first fatality in the Chinese capital from the virus. In Shanghai, the government has stopped businesses from returning to work until 10 February. The ban applies to all companies apart from utilities, medical firms, medical suppliers, and supermarkets. Meanwhile, the director-general of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is in Beijing to discuss the outbreak with the Chinese government and health experts.  81Deaths 2,827Confirmed cases 5,794Suspected cases 461In critical condition 51People recovered and discharged from hospital The BBC's Robin Brant in Shanghai says extending the main holiday of the year is a highly unusual move. But after the pre-new year travel surge, the prospect of half a billion people getting back on trains, planes and buses and criss-crossing the country again is the last thing the government wants, he adds. On Monday, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang visited Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province and centre of the outbreak. Experts suspect many more people are infected, but actual figures are hard to ascertain due to a number of factors like some people being asymptomatic. Prof Neil Ferguson, a public health expert at Imperial College, London, told the UK's Guardian newspaperhis ""best guess"" put the number at 100,000 infected,,externalwhile figures put together by the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong suggest the number was closer to 43,000. Wuhan: The London-sized city where the virus began How do you quarantine a city - and does it work? However, the University of Hong Kong research also suggested that - without public health intervention - tens of thousands more could be infected every day when the outbreak reaches its height. As a result of their projections, Gabriel Leung, the dean of the faculty of Medicine, was advising ""substantial, draconian measures"" to limit population mobility. The coronavirus causes severe acute respiratory infection and there is no specific cure or vaccine. Most of the deaths have been of elderly people or those with pre-existing respiratory problems. Travel from the city, home to 11 million people, has been severely restricted and non-essential vehicles have been banned from the roads. At the Hubei border, workers are checking people's temperatures before allowing them into the province. The local government in Wuhan said no-one from the city had left China in the past four days. Some 4,096 tourists from Wuhan are still out of the country, while five million new year travellers left the city before the lockdown. Li Keqiang - China's second most powerful politician - visited Wuhan on Monday More than half a million medical staff have joined the province's prevention, control and treatment operations, while two makeshift hospitals are being built. New year celebrations were scaled back and four major cities - Beijing, Shanghai, Xian and Tianjin - have banned long-distance buses. Schools and official institutions will remain closed for the rest of this week. Beijing has closed the Forbidden City for tourists, as well as a section of the Great Wall. Both Disney parks in Hong Kong and Shanghai have closed. This video can not be played Ben Kavanagh, a teacher originally from County Kildare, describes the scene in Wuhan In Guangdong province, several cities have made face masks mandatory in public. Hong Kong, which has eight confirmed cases, has declared a city-wide emergency, with schools closed until 17 February. Mongolia - which has yet to record a case of the virus - has closed its border with China. It has also closed schools until 2 March, and banned public events. Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ? Meanwhile, He Qinghua, a top official with China's National Health Commission,told reporters some areas still ""lack determination in controlling the epidemic"", according to the state-run newspaper Global Times,external. He said rural villages, in particular, were failing to deal with the crisis ""in a timely manner"". Over the weekend, Chinese officials warnedthe virus was able to spread during its incubation period, believed to be between one and 14 days, making it harder to contain the illness. According to the World Health Organization and national authorities, there have been at least47 confirmed cases,externaloutside China. The latest case to be confirmed is in the German state of Bavaria, only the fourth so far in Europe. Eight cases:Thailand Five:USA, Australia, Singapore Four:Taiwan, Malaysia, South Korea Three:France, Japan Two:Vietnam One:Nepal, Canada, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, Germany In the UK, 73 people have been tested - but no-one has resulted to have contracted the virus. Almost all had recently been to Wuhan or had been in close contact with someone who had. The virus is thought to have emerged from illegally traded wildlife at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan. Authorities have since temporarily banned the sale of all wildlife in China. The virus itself is a new, or ""novel"" coronavirus - a family that normally affects animals. Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Hubei / Henan A worker checking the BBC team's temperature Police and officials in the impact zone in Hubei and Henan provinces are now very keen to move us on wherever we arrive. They don't seem to mind where we go - as long as we leave their towns. We explain that the world wants to see the important, tiring work they're doing to combat the virus. But they're not interested. It could be that they're worried that our presence might imply to some that their patch is not handling this emergency well enough. One police officer at the entrance to a small town in Henan said to me: ""We don't have a problem here any more so there's no need for you to be here."" He said this at a checking station as cars were being pulled up behind him. Medical staff covered head to toe in protective clothing were then screening every passenger. They also checked the inside of all vehicles. I'm not sure what they were looking for - but it certainly didn't look like business as usual. The World Health Organization (WHO) advises its ""standard recommendations"" focusing on ""hand and respiratory hygiene"". That essentially means washing hands or using disinfectants, and covering one's mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. The advice also suggests avoiding contact with live animals in places where there have been coronavirus cases, and not to eat raw or uncooked animal products.

VideoEU has 'stronger team' - Varadkar,"This video can not be played The Irish leader Leo Varadkar compared the UK and the EU to football teams with vastly different populations and said the EU will have the upper hand in upcoming trade negotiations. In an interview with the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, the Taoiseach warned against any UK attempt to get a ""piecemeal"" deal with the EU. Mr Varadkar said he had been genuinely afraid that the UK might have left the EU without a deal, but that a meeting between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Varadkar on the Wirral in the autumn had provided the ""crucial moment"" in securing a deal.

Varadkar: UK won't get 'piecemeal' EU trade deal,"For a long time, Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar has sidestepped talking at length about his role in the fraught political journey of Brexit in the last few years. But with just a few days until the UK's departure, he opened up a little, in an interview with me, about what happened, and what might unfold next. The Taoiseach suggested that the EU will have the upper hand in the upcoming trade negotiations, saying: ""We have a population and a market of 450 million people, the UK it's about 60, so if these were two teams up against each other playing football, who do you think has the stronger team?"" He also warned against any UK attempt to get a ""piecemeal"" deal with the EU, saying: ""When I hear people talk about piecemeal, it sounds a bit like cake and eat it,"" and added ""That isn't something that will fly in Europe."" But when I asked him if Ireland had been too stubborn in the last couple of years, he suggested that it was the UK had misread the first phase of Brexit, suggesting that many people in Westminster and Britain ""don't understand Ireland"". He said there was an imagined scenario that France, Germany and Britain would get together at a big summit and tell the small countries what's what. But he said: ""That's not the way the 21st Century works. That's certainly not the way the EU works"". Echoing other leaders, Mr Varadkar also questioned the the timetable set by Boris Johnson to get a trade deal with the rest of the EU by the end of the year. He disagreed with the Prime Minister's claim that there is ""bags of time"", saying: ""It will be difficult to do this,"" and suggesting that there might have to be an extension to the next part of the Brexit process, beyond the end of this year, to finalise a trade deal. He did however pledge to work ""night and day"" to try and get it done and said: ""We won't be dragging our feet"". The Taoiseach said to get a deal there would have to be legal assurances that the UK would not undercut the EU, agreeing a ""common set of minimum standards"", that would have to be ""high standards"". There is no question it's going to be a key area of contention in the coming months, saying that he did trust Boris Johnson, but that it was in ""black and white"" that were would have to be some checks on goods going from Great Britain into Northern Ireland, despite Boris Johnson's repeated insistence that there will not have to be. Mr Varadkar and Mr Johnson held private talks in a bid to break the Brexit deadlock at Thornton Manor Hotel, on The Wirral, Cheshire. Looking back, Mr Varadkar said he had been genuinely afraid that the UK might have left the EU without a deal, but that a meeting between the two men on the Wirral in the autumn had provided the ""crucial moment"". He said the progress at the summit was the ""simple story"" of ""two guys in a roomâ¦ talking turkey"" without their staff present, where they found a way that they could move forward. ""I knew when I was leaving Liverpool Airport that things were looking promising again,"" he said. Michel Barnier will visit the Irish leader again today, another statement of intent about how Ireland's position will be taken into consideration by the EU at large, a situation that the government here in Dublin has no wish to leave behind.

"PM unveils fast-track science visas after BrexitBoris Johnson hails the UK as ""open to the most talented minds"" with quicker route in for scientists.Science & Environment","The Government has announced that a fast-track visa will open next month to attract the world's leading scientists. The visas will have no cap on the numbers of suitably qualified people able to come to the UK. The announcement follows a pledge last year by the PM to turn the UK into a""supercharged magnet to attract scientists like iron filings"". Researchers remain concerned about the uncertainty of the UK's role in EU research programmes following Brexit. The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, said: ""The UK has a proud history of scientific discovery, but to lead the field and face the challenges of the future we need to continue to invest in talent and cutting-edge research. ""That is why as we leave the EU I want to send a message that the UK is open to the most talented minds in the world, and stand ready to support them to turn their ideas into reality."" Johnson's chief advisor: Science is No 10's top priority after Brexit PM orders fast-track visas for UK science Ministers reverse May-era foreign student rules The new visa system will begin on February 20 and managed by the UK Research and Innovation Agency (UKRI), which funds government research, rather than the Home Office. This is to ensure that suitable applicants are quickly assessed and fast-tracked by those qualified to asses their scientific credentials, rather than immigration officials. Tacitly addressing concerns about the impact of Brexit on the UK's participation in international programmes, the government claims the scheme has been introduced in order to enable UK-based research projects to recruit the best scientists and mathematicians. The announcement is a big win for research organisations who had been lobbying the government very hard for a fast-track visa system for leading researchers to mitigate what they feared would be a brain drain after Brexit. They are especially pleased that UKRI, with the support of other so-called endorsed research organisations, can vouch for an applicant - instead of Home Office officials attempting to determine their scientific attainment. Prof Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the UK's Royal Society, was among those lobbying hardest for the system to be run by research organisations. He welcomed the announcement, saying the new visa would be ""attractive"" to talented researchers and specialists from all over the world - and at all stages of their careers. ""It sends out a positive message that the UK is committed to remaining open to overseas science talent who would collaborate with our outstanding home-grown minds,"" he said. ""What is good for science is good for everybody, and can help tackle important challenges such as climate change or disease."" Sir Venki added: ""The government has listened to the research community, and this is an important first step in creating the visa system that we need for attracting global scientific talent - one that is welcoming, faster and more flexible, and takes into account the long-term aspirations of scientists and their families."" But Dr Robert Massey, deputy director of the Royal Astronomical Society tweeted that he was concerned the system would still restrict the entry of young, up-and-coming researchers. He gave it ""a cautious welcome"", adding: ""The issues will still though be about calling for the 'most talented', which isn't a label many early career researchers identify with."" BBC News reported last year that, after Brexit, scienceis one of the top priorities for the PM's chief aide, Dominic Cummings. Senior research leaders have confirmed that they have been in talks with Mr Cummings and the Science Minister Chris Skidmore in Downing Street. The talks focused on how best to spend a possible multi-billion pound increase in research funding. The outcome may be announced in the March budget. Immigration system to 'put people before passports' Five times immigration changed the UK How has immigration changed in your area? EU researchers account for about half of the total UK scientific workforce of 211,000. Currently, they do not need visas to work in British labs. But freedom of movement between the UK and EU is expected to end after the Brexit transition period on 31 December 2020. The government says it willintroduce an Australian-style points-based systemby January 2021. Boris Johnson previously said he wants to draw scientists to the supercharged magnet of Britain ""like iron filings"" Sir Jim McDonald, president of the Royal Academy of Engineering, said he was ""delighted"" to see that the new visa system would be run by researchers rather than civil servants. He commented: ""The new arrangements will allow awardees of a much larger range of UK and international fellowships to receive fast-track visas through the academies, while UKRI will administer a route that awards fast-track visas to principals and named team members of research and innovation grants from a range of endorsed funders."" The head of UKRI, Prof Sir Mark Walport, said: ""Today's announcements further underline the importance of research and innovation to the future success of the UK and the government's continued commitment and investment."" Labour's spokesperson for industrial strategy, Chi Onwurah, said additional support and recognition for science should be welcomed. But she added that the new measures ""suggest a lack of understanding of innovation, which depends on scientists, researchers, engineers and technicians at all levels and not just a few 'top talent'"". Chi Onwurah said the new visa rules ""suggest a lack of understanding"" by solely focusing on ""top talent"" ""Ending the Erasmus scheme, denying visas to scientists from Africa and Asia, imposing a minimum salary of Â£30,000, these all adversely affect the richness and quality of our scientific base,"" she said. Christine Jardine, from the Liberal Democrats, said the announcement suggests Mr Johnson ""doesn't understand"" what makes the UK science sector successful. ""Science relies on thousands of researchers, and this announcement does nothing for the vast majority of them. If the government is serious about championing UK science, it must prioritise continued mobility as part of our future relationship with the EU,"" she said.

"'Zero tariff, zero quota' aim for Brexit talks","The UK leaves the EU on Friday The government is aiming to secure a ""zero tariff, zero quota"" free trade deal with the EU, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has said. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr the UK would not diverge from current EU trade regulations ""for the sake of it"". Mr Barclay added the government's objectives for the trade talks would be published after Brexit on 31 January. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will make a speech next month setting out more details, he said. Mr Barclay's comments come after theUS treasury secretary said his country wants to agree to a post-Brexit trade dealwith the UK this year. After Brexit happens at 23:00 GMT on Friday, the UK will be free to negotiate and sign new trade deals with countries with no existing EU deals - like the US. The UK then enters into an agreed transition period with the EU, which lasts until 31 December 2020. During this time the UK will aim to negotiate a free trade deal with the EU to ensure that UK goods are not subject to tariffs and other trade barriers. John Pienaar: Brexit sound bites and slogans will run out Commemorative Brexit 50p coin unveiled What trade deals has the UK done so far? Could the UK and EU sort a trade deal in months? Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr, Mr Barclay said: ""We are going to publish our objectives for the negotiation and we will set that out in due course after the 31st. ""The key issue is that we will have control of our rules, we will not be a rule-taker, we will not diverge for the sake of diverging. ""We start from a position of alignment but the key opportunity is that we will be able to set our standards, high standards, on worker's rights, on the environment, on state aid as part of that trade policy."" He said ""both sides are committed"" to securing a trade deal by the end of December, adding: ""It's in both side's interests to keep the flow of goods going."" Irish minister for European affairs, Helen McEntee, told Sophy Ridge on Sky News that ""Brexit is really only at half-time, we have a huge amount of work still to do"". ""However, the idea that we can negotiate a trade deal with one that is comprehensive, one that provides very little change for our citizens, not just in the UK and Ireland, but the EU as well, within about a 12-month space, it's very difficult."" The new European Commission president Ursula von der Leyenhas previously shared concerns about the timeframe, saying it would be ""impossible"" to reach a comprehensive trade deal by the end of 2020. Priti Patel said that the government will be able to control levels of low-skilled migration after Brexit Meanwhile, the home secretary told Sophy Ridge UK businesses have been ""too reliant on low-skilled cheap labour from the EU"". Priti Patel said the government will be able to control levels of low-skilled migration after Brexit. She also confirmed that the Migration Advisory Committee will report this week on the UK's future immigration system. The government was ""absolutely determined to change the immigration system, end the complexity of the immigration system, have simpler rules, have a points-based system where we can absolutely have people that bring the right kind of skills for our labour market"", she said. On the UK's post-Brexit relationship with EU rules, Ms Patel appeared to adopt a harder approach than Mr Barclay, saying: ""In terms of divergence, we are not having alignment. We will be diverging. We want to take control of our laws, money and our borders."" Last week, Chancellor Sajid Javid said the UK would use the power to diverge from EU rules on tradeonly when it was in the interests of business.

Has China learned lessons since deadly Sars epidemicâ?,"China was accused of covering-up the Sars epidemic In March 2003 it became clear a mysterious and previously unknown disease was starting to spread around the world. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) went on to infect more than 8,000 people and kill almost 800. Many of those it infected, including doctors, went from having flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia within days. The virus spread to 26 countries and China was criticised by the UN's global health body for concealing the scale of the outbreak. Now, 17 years later, the spread of a new deadly coronavirus is reviving memories of Sars and putting global scrutiny back on to the Chinese government. China has responded with tough measures, including effectively quarantining millions of residents in cities. But has its response gone far enough? And what lessons did it learn from the deadly Sars outbreak in 2003? Sars posed a huge challenge to China both as a public health crisis and a political one. The World Health Organization (WHO) was first alerted to reports of severe and unusual cases of pneumonia in the country's south in February 2003. Local officials said more than 300 people had become sick. Despite initial openness, other local government officials appeared to play down the risk or suggest the mystery threat was contained. Analysts who studied the Chinese response said the issue soon disappeared from the spotlight. Investigations later showed the first infections appeared in Guangdong Province in November 2002, but it took months for the scale of China's Sars crisis to be exposed. Physician Jiang Yanyong alerted the international media in April that the Chinese government was drastically understating the Sars threat. Dozens died in the Toronto area - with Canada becoming one of the worst- hit nations Advice was circulated to hospitals and the director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) even issued an unprecedented apology over the spread. ""Our medical departments and mass media suffered from poor co-ordination,"" Li Liming told a news conference. Combating Sars was complicated because of uncertainties about how it was spreading. The WHO issued its first global alert on 12 March 2003 after a patient hospitalised in Hanoi, Vietnam led to handfuls of medical staff becoming sick. Hong Kong's Department of Health also confirmed outbreaks of respiratory illness among its hospital workers. ""This was the first time a coronavirus had come to the attention as a pathogen that could spread around the world like this,"" Prof David Heymann, who led the WHO's infectious disease unit at the time of Sars, told the BBC. ""So in the beginning it wasn't known what it was and nobody really looked for coronaviruses such as they are doing now."" Prof Heymann told the BBC that Chinese authorities appeared to have been much more proactive with the new outbreak, including providing the WHO with information on a regular basis. This week, the WHO's director general praised China's response. The lack of transparency over Sars hurt China's standing on the international stage and caused its economic growth to slow. Health experts, including Prof Heymann, stress transparency as a key factor in preventing the spread of viruses, especially unknown ones. Once proper control measures and infection prevention were implemented, Sars was contained within months. This was aided by public health information being shared by the WHO and local governments wherever Sars was a concern. Hong Kong was one of the major hotspots for the virus. People there began to change their routines, with surgical masks becoming the norm in public. Surfaces in public areas with high risks of transmission, like lift buttons, were cleaned hourly and every day the local news carried updated tolls of those infected killed by the virus. Helier Cheung, a BBC journalist who grew up in Hong Kong, remembers she and classmates having their temperatures taken daily. Classes were suspended for several days - right in the run-up to exams - and television adverts reminded the public to wash their hands and bleach surfaces. The spread of Sars was traced to an infected doctor at Hong Kong's Metropole Hotel Her experience contrasts with that of another BBC employee who was working at a university in mainland China at the time of Sars. She remembers relying heavily on rumours and access to foreign news outlets when little official information was available. She also remembers misinformation spreading - with bowls of vinegar set on burners in classrooms in the mistaken belief they could disinfect the air. ""I do remember being worried, but very poorly informed,"" she said. Information and clarity were sparse even when students were quarantined and her campus later locked down. Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens became notorious when hundreds of residents became sick In recent days, Chinese officials have tried to show they are being much more open this time. President Xi Jinping described combating the virus as ""extremely critical"" and there have been public warnings against any attempts at cover-ups. ""Anyone who puts the face of politicians before the interests of the people will be the sinner of a millennium to the party and the people,"" a commentary on a Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission account said on Tuesday. ""Anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of [virus] cases out of his or her own self-interest will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity."" However, the Chinese government has strengthened its control over the flow of information since the time of Sars. Some international scientists have estimated the true number of people impacted by the new coronavirus is far higher than has been publicly confirmed. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute in London, told the BBC he became aware of rumours circulating about a new virus in Wuhan several weeks ago - well before the first cases were confirmed on 31 December. Local officials may have been very nervous to be the ones to raise the alarm, he said. ""President Xi Jinping pays a lot more attention to the international image of China than his predecessors, and he has concentrated much more power than his predecessors,"" Mr Tsang said. ""Therefore anything that could potentially have a negative impact on the international image of China becomes sensitive."" Your questions:You asked, we answered The story explained:How worried should we be? Wuhan profiled:The city now in lockdown In detail:Follow all our coverage here Chinese social media is also highly regulated and the New York Times reported that the hashtag #WuhanSARS was blocked locally. Police even questioned eight people about spreading ""rumours"" of the virus online, according to reports. The Sars outbreak was a catalyst for change in China's medical system, with health spending rising afterwards. Health officials used to report infectious diseases by filling in cards by hand and then posting or faxing them to a central office. After Sars, the government created a centralised online system that links up clinics and hospitals across the country and lets them report cases in real time. The global epidemic was eventually contained within months ""China... has developed excellent disease surveillance systems since Sars, including real-time emergency department surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections, so this will help with rapid identification of new cases,"" Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity research programme at Sydney's Kirby Institute, told Reuters. 'Increased likelihood' of new virus reaching UK ""Spreading at alarming rate"" - one doctor in Wuhan speaks Gabriel Leung, chair of public health at Hong Kong University, said the timescale of ""recognising, characterising, releasing and reporting information"" had been vastly improved from the time of the Sars outbreak. ""What did take months during the time of Sars is now compressed into a matter of weeks or days,"" he told a news conference earlier this week. But not all of the public health reforms suggested after Sars have been implemented. This video can not be played Fears over new coronavirus in China trigger face mask shortgae In 2006, Zhong Nanshan, the doctor who identified Sars and who is leading the Chinese government's efforts in Wuhan, said it was crucial to clean up China's wildlife markets, which were ""poorly managed and insanitary"" and ""a dangerous source of possible new infections"". But reports from Wuhan suggest inter-species transmission is also at the centre of the new outbreak. A market in Wuhan, which was shuttered the day after the first cases were confirmed, is thought to have sold animals including rats, live wolf pups and civets, the last of which have been linked with previous pandemics in the past. Typically, traditional use in local delicacies or medicines has hindered efforts to clean-up the animal trade. But with a market again identified as a source of an outbreak, even official media are mobilising appeals against the wildlife trade in response. Propaganda posts telling people #SupportBanningWildAnimalMarkets have been widely shared on Chinese social media. Whether the radical measures implemented by China, going beyond even WHO recommendations, are enough to avoid a repeat of Sars remains to be seen. Dr W Ian Lipkin, a US-based epidemiologist who worked on Sars, is among the experts who have cast doubt on whether the travel restrictions from cities, including Wuhan, will be enough to stop the global spread.

LA County fire chief Daryl Osby has described the size of the fire from the crash as a quarter of an acre. He added the presence of magnesium in the wreckage made the fire harder to extinguish. LA Sheriff Alex Villanueva says they are awaiting the arrival of a coroner at the scene and confirms there were nine people aboard the aircraft, all of whom have died. He says it would be ""inappropriate to identify anyone until the coroner has made that identification"". Adding it is ""wholly inappropriate"" to learn about a loss of a loved one ""through TMZ"". The LA County Sheriff believe there were nine people on board: the pilot and eight passengers. La County Fire Chief Daryl Osby has confirmed that everyone on board the helicopter has passed away. The LA County Sheriff department are currently doing a news conference. We will bring you the latest when we can.
