Benghazi 'ringleader' cleared of murder,"The man accused of masterminding the 2012 attack on a US consulate in Benghazi, Libya, has been acquitted by a US jury of the most serious charges. Ahmed Abu Khattala was convicted of terror charges but found not guilty of other charges including murder. The attack on the diplomatic compound resulted in the death of US ambassador Chris Stevens and four US guards. Hillary Clinton, who was secretary of state at the time, was accused by Republicans of not doing enough. A jury in Washington acquitted Khattala of 14 of the 18 charges after deliberating for five days following a seven-week trial. He was convicted on four charges including conspiracy to provide material support for terrorism, maliciously destroying and injuring dwellings and property as well as using and carrying a semi-automatic weapon during a crime of violence. Khattala faces up to 60 years in prison. He  was captured by US special forces in Libya in 2014. â¢ Native of Benghazi in eastern Libya â¢ Construction worker by trade â¢ Spent several years in Col Muammar Gaddafi's notorious Abu Salim prison in Tripoli â¢ Formed his own small militia during the anti-Gaddafi uprising â¢ Denies any links to al-Qaeda but has expressed admiration for it â¢ Also denies any role in the attack on the US embassy in 2012, but eyewitnesses report him being there â¢ US state department says he is a senior leader in Islamist group Ansar al-Sharia According to prosecutors, the first wave of attackers assembled outside the gates of the mission about 21:45 local time on 11 September 2012. They were armed with AK-47-type rifles, handguns and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Stevens and diplomat Sean Smith died in the fire, while the remaining state department workers escaped to a separate US facility nearby. That building soon came under attack, and security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty were killed by mortar fire. Prosecutors said Mr Abu Khattala entered the destroyed US mission and ""supervised the exploitation of material from the scene"" by armed men. According to US prosecutors, in the days following the attack, Mr Abu Khattala ""attempted to obtain various types of equipment, including weapons, to defend himself from feared American retaliation for the attack"". The attack ignited a firestorm of accusations from Republicans, mainly directed at Mrs Clinton, over the security of the compound and what was known in the build-up to the tragedy.

Viagra can be sold over the counter,"Men will no longer require a prescription to obtain the impotence drug Viagra and will instead be able to buy it over the counter at pharmacies. The decision by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency follows a public consultation. It will be up to pharmacists to judge whether men over the age of 18 can safely be sold the little blue pills. Manufacturer Pfizer hopes to get stocks of Viagra Connect (sildenafil 50mg) into UK pharmacies by spring 2018. Experts say making the medication more widely available will help men who might not feel able to visit their GP about impotence. The MHRA hopes it will stop some men buying unregulated medicines from websites operating illegally. Mick Foy, MHRA's group manager in vigilance and risk management of medicines, said: ""This decision is good news for men's health. ""Erectile dysfunction can be a debilitating condition, so it's important men feel they have fast access to quality and legitimate care, and do not feel they need to turn to counterfeit online supplies which could have potentially serious side-effects."" Pharmacists will decide whether treatment is appropriate and can offer advice on erectile dysfunction, usage of the medicine, potential side-effects and whether further consultation with a general practitioner is required. Viagra Connect will not be sold to: those with severe heart disease or at high risk of cadiovascular disease those with liver failure those with severe kidney failure men taking certain medicines that could cause a bad reaction when combined with Viagra Men who are sold it will be advised that they can take a 50 mg tablet an hour before having sex, but should not use more than one pill a day. Sildenafil is already available on NHS prescription free of charge. Most men occasionally fail to get or keep an erection. This is usually due to factors such as stress, tiredness, anxiety or drinking too much alcohol, says NHS Choices. Men should see their GP or go to a sexual health clinic if erection problems keep happening because it can be a sign of an underlying health condition, it advises. The MHRA received 47 responses to its consultation, with 33 in support of making viagra available off prescription and one 'unsure'. The 13 that did not support the proposal included eight pharmacists. Some were concerned that customers might withhold medical information from staff in order to get the treatment. Risk of abuse or misuse of the drugs was another worry. In reaching its decision the MHRA judged that the benefits of permitting Viagra to be sold without a prescription would outweigh potential risks. Denise Knowles, psychosexual therapist and counsellor at Relate, warned that taking a pill was not a sticking plaster for relationship problems. ""Many of the people I have spoken with have a misconception that it will give them a stronger erection or add to their desire. But it's not there to enhance prowess. ""It's not a magic pill that will cure problems in a relationship."" Why does the US military buy so much Viagra?

Health check for jailed Briton in Iran,"A British-Iranian woman jailed for five years in Tehran has been given a health assessment to see if she is well enough to stay in prison, her supporters say. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was accused of spying while visiting Iran with her daughter last April, which she denies. A local health official was told she had panic attacks, insomnia, bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts. Iranian media say the symptoms will be considered and ""conditional release"" could be given if she ""qualifies"". The health commissioner is due to present his judgment on whether Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, from London, is fit to remain in jail later this week. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe: Caught in Iran power struggle Johnson 'sorry' over jailed mother remarks Protection considered for jailed Briton But she is due to appear in court on 10 December on a second charge of ""spreading propaganda"". The Free Nazanin Campaign said she is instructing her lawyer to challenge the legality of the ongoing ""campaign"" against her, ""given its impact both on her chances of a fair trial and her health"". The full details of the new allegations have not been made public but they came after UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson wrongly stated earlier this month Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe had been training journalists. Mr Johnson later acknowledged his comments were inaccurate and her husband, Richard, raised the issue of his wife being given diplomatic protection in a subsequent meeting. The protection would signal that the UK is treating the case as a formal, legal dispute between the UK and Iran. The Foreign Office said its lawyers were discussing the issue. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter, Gabriella, had her passport confiscated and is being taken care of by relatives in Tehran.

Bereaved woman wins damages battle,"This video can not be played ""It was never about the money... it was about the principle"" A woman has won her legal battle for better rights for unmarried people who lose their long-term partners. NHS worker Jakki Smith, from Chorley, Lancashire, took the government to court for breaching her human rights in denying her bereavement damages. A fixed sum of Â£12,980 is paid out if a person dies as a result of negligence - but only to spouses or civil partners. Her partner of 16 years, John Bulloch, died aged 66 in 2011 after an infection was missed by medics. Mr Bulloch, a former prison governor, underwent the removal of a benign tumour on his right foot in August 2011 and fell ill while on holiday in Turkey. Jakki Smith and John Bulloch were together for 16 years The Court of Appeal allowed Ms Smith's challenge against a High Court ruling dismissing her claim. In court, her legal team had argued the current legislation was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. They said the award should be available to anyone who had been in a relationship for at least two years. Her lawyer, Zac Golombeck, said the ruling was a ""historic decision"" and ""long overdue"". The Law Commission previously recommended co-habiting couples should be eligible for bereavement damages and the government also produced a draft bill in 2009, although it was never progressed, he added. Ms Smith, 59, who was not in court, said she was ""over the moon"" as she had found it ""hurtful and unfair"" that her relationship could be considered ""less meaningful"". ""It felt unfair to me because I couldn't have the bereavement damages. I felt they were saying: 'You weren't married, you weren't bereaved, it didn't count'. I wanted it to count. ""John and I had planned a life together, we were in it for the long run and the fact that our bond wasn't recognised, simply because we hadn't chosen to marry, was very upsetting."" Ms Smith, pictured outside court at a previous hearing, said her legal fight was ""never about the money"" Ms Smith said she would not get any money from the decision as there is no possibility of a retrospective payment. Ms Smith said: ""Nothing will bring John back, but he was a firm believer in everyone being treated equally and I think he would have agreed with me that this is worth fighting for. ""Just because John and I hadn't said vows to each other and didn't wear wedding rings didn't mean we weren't completely committed to each other.""My fight has never been for the money, it's about having meaningful relationships recognised. ""I just hope what has happened helps other people who may find themselves in this tragic situation."" Ms Smith said she was ""optimistic and hopeful"" the government would now consider changing the legislation.

Suspended officers 'used range illegally',"ACC Higgins would be eligible to retire in March but intends to stay on Two senior Police Scotland officers suspended as part of a criminal inquiry are accused of using the force firing range for unauthorised purposes, BBC Scotland understands. Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins and Supt Kirk Kinnell are among four officers suspended in recent days. The alleged offences took place at the Police Training and Recruitment Centre in Jackton, East Kilbride. No wrongdoing has been admitted by any of the officers under investigation. Police appoint new senior officers Minister urged to 'get a grip' on Police Scotland Senior officer suspended amid criminal probe The firing range should only be used in controlled circumstances by authorised officers. Police Scotland firearms officers must complete an intensive 11-week course during which they are trained to Armed Response Vehicle (ARV) standard. Officers cannot even use a taser stun gun without completing the course at Jackton. Ch Insp Bob Glass and a fourth officer, who has not been named, were also suspended on Friday. Ch Insp Glass is Supt Kinnell's deputy and was head of Strathclyde Police's armed response unit at the time of the 2007 terror attack on Glasgow Airport. Supt Kinnell is due to retire next month while Ch Insp Glass and ACC Higgins are eligible to leave the force after completing 30 years' service in January and March respectively. The BBC understands the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) is examining a number of other allegations as part of the wide-ranging probe. One is believed to concern two separate alleged incidents at a senior officer's house. On both occasions a neighbour raised the alarm but when local officers turned up at the house the senior officer allegedly told them to go away. The BBC understands the matter was only escalated after a second allegation was made. Separately, the purchase of a rucksack and other ""high value items"" for the force, which then went missing, also forms part of the investigation. Two other officers have been placed on restricted duties as a result of the investigation into allegations of criminal conduct and gross misconduct. It is understood Sgt Cat Gibbons, who is based at the Road Policing Unit in Irvine, is one of the officers. Firearms officers must complete an intensive 11 week training course Pirc is also looking into allegations of misconduct against Chief Constable Phil Gormley, who is currently on ""special leave"". That investigation is unrelated to inquiries into allegations that officers in the former counter-corruption unit abused their position when attempting to find the source of a journalist's information. Both Mr Gormley and Mr Higgins have denied wrongdoing. On Friday Deputy Chief Constable Iain Livingstone confirmed the suspension of ACC Higgins, who was responsible for operational support, custody and criminal justice and three other officers, He also confirmed two others were placed on restricted duties by Deputy Chief Constable Rose Fitzpatrick in connection with an investigation by the Pirc. The anonymous allegations were initially brought to the SPA's attention by the Pirc on 18 October. On Friday the SPA board suspended ACC Higgins and referred the misconduct allegations to the Pirc. Separately, Pirc also confirmed it had referred the original allegations to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS). It was to determine whether the criminal allegations should be investigated by the Commissioner. The COPFS decided that an independent investigation should be carried out by the Pirc. A Pirc spokesman said: ""The investigation is ongoing.""

Space junk mission prepares for launch,"This video can not be played A spacecraft will test clean-up technologies after it launches next year A mission that will test different methods to clean up space junk is getting ready for launch. The RemoveDebris spacecraft will attempt to snare a small satellite with a net and test whether a harpoon is an effective garbage grabber. The probe has been assembled in Surrey and will soon be packed up ready for blast off early next year. Scientists warn that the growing problem of space debris is putting spacecraft and astronauts at risk. It is estimated that there are about half a million pieces of man-made rubbish orbiting the Earth, ranging from huge defunct satellites, to spent rocket boosters and nuts and bolts. Any collisions can cause a great deal of damage, and generate even more pieces of debris. The RemoveDebris mission is led by the Surrey Space Centre at the University of Surrey. The assembly of the spacecraft, which is about the size of a washing machine, has taken place at Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) and is almost complete. Dr Jason Forshaw, project manager on the RemoveDebris team, said: ""RemoveDebris will be one of the world's first missions in this area.... We have technologies on here that have never been demonstrated in space before."" The spacecraft has been assembled in the UK and will soon be packed up for launch The spacecraft will first head for the International Space Station on a resupply rocket. It will then be unpacked by astronauts before being launched from the orbiter to begin its experiments. RemoveDebris has its own space junk on board - small satellites.  It will release one of these into space and then will use a net to recapture it. It will also fire a small harpoon at a target plate to see if the technology can accurately work in the weightless environment. It will finally test future de-orbiting technology. As the orbiter descends to Earth it will deploy a 10sq m sail, which will change the spacecraft's speed and ensure it burns up as it enters the atmosphere. ""It will prevent the spacecraft from becoming space junk itself,"" explained Dr Forshaw. The hope is that the technology-testing mission, which has cost Â£15m, will lead to larger clean-up efforts. ""People are starting to realise the significance of space junk and the problem it presents,"" Dr Forshaw said. The spacecraft will establish whether a net could ensnare a small satellite Scientists estimate that there are about 7,500 tonnes of rubbish in space and we are reaching a critical point. . Dr Hugh Lewis, senior lecturer in aerospace engineering at the University of Southampton, said: ""For some people, space debris is one of these things that is out of sight, out of mind. ""But from my perspective it is one of the worst environmental catastrophes that we have encountered."" Even very small pieces of junk can do a great deal of damage. Last year a loose fleck of paint is thought to have caused a crack in a window on the International Space Station. Last year a small piece of debris chipped a window on the International Space Station The largest pieces, though, present a pressing problem. In 2012, a European satellite called Envisat, the size of a double decker bus, suddenly stopped working. Since then it's been circling the Earth, threatening other key satellites in its path. Dr Lewis explained: ""The biggest pieces of space debris have huge amounts of mass in them. If they were to be hit by something, they would release all that mass in the form of thousands and thousands of more fragments."" More debris, could lead to more collisions - a cascade effect known as the Kessler syndrome. The fear is that space could eventually become inoperable. ""The environment provides us with really important services - like navigation, timing, communications, weather forecasting and so on,"" Dr Lewis added. ""The worst case scenario is probably the loss of some vital satellitesâ¦ it would mean stepping back probably decades in terms of our technology we take for granted on Earth."" It is estimated that there are about half a million pieces of space junk the size of a marble or larger The European Space Agency is now looking at how larger satellites like Envisat can be destroyed - but cleaning up space piece by piece will be difficult and extremely expensive. International space guidelines suggest that satellites should de-orbit themselves after 25 years - but it is difficult to ensure everyone plays by the rules. Some experts are also concerned that the new push to launch small satellites (known as cubesats) in increasingly large numbers could add to the problem. Martin Pointer from SSTL said: "" Space junk is definitely a concern for us. As more and more satellites are put up - especially some of the constellations of small satellites  - the likelihood of collisions is much greater. ""I think it's our responsibility to ensure we don't cause more junk in space and find ways of either removing those at the end of life or for mitigating against problems.""

North Korea's missile programme,"With the war of words between the US and North Korea escalating, focus has turned to Pyongyang's missile programme. But just how advanced is it? North Korea's missile arsenal has progressed over the decades from crude artillery rockets derived from World War II designs to testing what it says are long-range missiles that may be able to strike targets in the US. Intercontinental missiles North Korea's latest efforts are focused on building reliable long-range missiles, which would have the potential of reaching the mainland United States. On 4 July 2017, Pyongyang said it had carried out its first successful test of an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM). It said the Hwasong-14 could hit ""any part of the world"", but initial US estimates put the range as shorter than that. The US military described it as an intermediate-range missile, but a number of US experts said they believed the missile could reach the US state of Alaska. On 28 July 2017, North Korea carried out its second and latest ICBM test, with the missile reaching an altitude of about 3,000km and landing in the sea off Japan. Pyongyang has also displayed two types of ICBMs, known as the KN-08 and KN-14, at military parades since 2012. Carried and launched from the back of a modified truck, the three-stage KN-08 is believed to have a range of about 11,500km. The KN-14 appears to be a two-stage missile, with a possible range of around 10,000km. Neither has yet been tested, and the relationship between them and the Hwasong-14 is not yet clear. Media reports in the US have claimed that Pyongyang has now made a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles.  While not confirmed, this has been seen as one of the last obstacles to North Korea being a fully nuclear-armed state. A report in theWashington Post,external, citing US intelligence officials, suggested North Korea was developing nuclear weapons capable of hitting the US at a much faster rate than expected. A Japanese government defence paper also said the weapons programme had ""advanced considerably"" and that North Korea possibly now had nuclear weapons. Inter-continental ballistic missiles are seen as the last word in power projection because they allow a country to wield massive firepower against an opponent on the other side of the planet. The only real reason to spend the money, time and effort building them is to have the capability to fire nuclear weapons. During the Cold War, Russia and the United States sought different ways to protect and deliver their missiles, which were hidden in silos, piggybacked on huge trucks or carried by submarines. All ICBMs are designed along similar lines. They are multi-stage rockets powered by solid or liquid fuel, and carry their weapon payload out of the atmosphere into space. The weapon payload - usually a thermonuclear bomb - then re-enters the atmosphere and detonates either above or directly on top of its target. Some ICBMs have a ""multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle"", or Mirv. The country is highly militarised This has multiple warheads and decoys, allowing it to strike multiple targets and confuse missile defence systems. In the Cold War period, the range and potential threat of ICBMs were seen as key to the concept of ""Mutually Assured Destruction"" or MAD. MAD supposedly helped maintain peace because neither side could ""win"" without suffering incalculable damage. North Korea's own missile programme began with Scuds, with its first batch reportedly coming via Egypt in 1976. By 1984 it was building its own versions called Hwasongs. These missiles have an estimated maximum range of about 1,000km, and carry conventional, chemical and possibly biological warheads. From the Hwasong came the Nodong design - effectively an upscaled Hwasong/Scud with an extended range of 1,300km. In anApril 2016 analysis,,externalthe International Institute for Strategic Studies said the missiles were a ""proven system which can hit all of South Korea and much of Japan"". More capable missiles followed with the development of the Musudan range, which was most recently tested in 2016. Estimates differ dramatically on its how far it can fly, with Israeli intelligence putting it at 2,500km and the US Missile Defense Agency estimating about 3,200km. Other sources suggest a possible 4,000km. Another development came in August 2016 when North Korea announced it had tested a submarine based ""surface-to-surface, medium-to-long-range ballistic missile"", called the Pukguksong.

What are North Korea's other WMDs?,"The warning from the South Korean President Moon Jae-in of the potential threat from North Korean chemical and biological weapons is timely, underscoring that Pyongyang has invested heavily in a variety of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes. Mr Moon also warned of the danger of a North Korean electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) attack that could cripple a country's electrical grid and critical infrastructure. So while attention focuses on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme and the long-range missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, how much do we know about these other secretive WMD programmes? Are Pyongyang's missiles a risk to planes? Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programme Reality Check: Minutes to shelter from a missile Special report: Korea crisis North Korea makes no secret of its nuclear weapons ambitions. In marked contrast, it does not admit to having chemical or biological weapons. It has signed up to a treaty banning biological weapons, but it has not acceded to the equivalent agreement banning chemical weapons. US and South Korean experts believe that, in fact, North Korea does have a significant chemical weapons programme, with stockpiles of munitions containing nerve, choking and blister agents; such substances as phosgene; hydrogen cyanide; mustard; and sarin. North Korea has a huge artillery and rocket force capable of delivering such munitions, though it remains unclear if it is able to produce chemical warheads that would survive the stresses of a flight on a ballistic missile. Much less is known about North Korea's activities in the biological weapons field. South Korean intelligence believes that the North is well-able to produce and weaponise pathogens like anthrax, botulism and typhus, but it is far from clear if these programmes have gone beyond the research stage. The EMP threat is something that is widely written about - it has especially been taken up in US conservative circles - and the debate has gained added currency in the wake of North Korean threats to mount such an attack. In essence, this would involve the detonation of a small nuclear device in the atmosphere - you would not even need a nuclear missile, a balloon could be released from a cargo ship - which results in a massive power-surge that damages and disables electrical circuitry over a huge area. Crippled infrastructure that might not be repairable for months could lead to death, chaos and lawlessness on a vast scale. In 2008, a US commission investigating the threat concluded that ""the electromagnetic pulse generated by a high-altitude nuclear explosion is one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences"". This video can not be played South Korea tested missiles in response to the North's new launch Experts differ on the likelihood of such an attack emanating from North Korea, whatever the threats. Of course, in the Korean context there is already a nuclear threat and, to the extent that an EMP attack involves the detonation of a nuclear device, Pyongyang would be risking catastrophic reprisal and potentially the end of the regime. All these fears underscore the problem of dealing with Pyongyang. There is a tension between keeping the international community united behind UN sanctions resolutions and applying the scale of pressure that the Trump administration wants (and which it believes can only come from China). In the meantime, North Korea's programmes advance. A senior US general now warns that Pyongyang's recent test may well have been a hydrogen bomb, marking a significant advance in the North's capabilities. And all the while, the danger of a test going wrong - of debris landing on Japan or Guam - or of miscalculation grows, and with that the threat of crisis turning into conflict.

Brexit papers given to MPs amid secrecy row,"This video can not be played Keir Starmer asks about the existence of the documents but Robin Walker says they did not ""exist in the form requested"". Parliament is being treated with contempt over the partial release of Brexit documents, Labour has claimed. MPs will see for the first time later studies of how the UK's exit will affect 58 sectors of the economy, but certain sections will not be released. Ministers say they are being as ""open as possible"" but some sensitive details which risk ""undermining the UK's negotiating hand"" will be kept private. Labour said the will of Parliament was being ignored and transparency ditched. The 850-pages of documents - which MPs demanded be published in a vote earlier this month - has been handed to the Commons and Lords Brexit committees, whose members will begin to study it in private later. 'I gave up my job to fight Brexit' Brexit minister Robin Walker said he hoped the ""accessible and informative"" material would be made available to all MPs in due course - in a reading room - but defended the removal of commercially sensitive details which he suggested could damage the UK's negotiating strategy. But Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Brexit committee, said it was ""their job"" to decide what was published and he objected to the suggestion it could not be trusted to respect confidentiality. In other Brexit news, a Downing Street source said there was no settlement on the UK's so-called divorce bill, as newspaper reports - citing a range of figures - claimed it had been agreed. David Davis pictured during his appearance before the Brexit committee There has been huge speculation about what is in the Brexit papers, which reportedly run to 800 pages. Until now only senior ministers and civil servants knew what was in the papers, which were kept in a safe overnight in several lever arch folders. The Commons and Lords Brexit committee will starting reading them in private later, while they have also been shared with the Scottish and Welsh governments and Northern Irish officials. But there are bits which they won't be able to see because they have either been handed over with bits blacked out, or not been handed over by ministers. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's economics editor Kamal Ahmed says he has been told that the reports are not - as has been claimed by some - in-depth ""impact assessments"". He says they will not put a figure on the costs to different industries if there is no comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and EU after the UK leaves in March 2019. The government says the reports will show the size of each of the sectors, their worth to the UK economy and how they are regulated at the moment within the EU single market and customs union. The letter from Davis Davis to the committee was not well received by some In a letter to the Commons committee, Brexit Secretary David Davis said certain details were being kept private because there was no guarantee all of the 21 MPs on the committee would keep them secret. One Conservative member of the committee, Craig McKinlay, has backed this stance, suggesting some of his fellow committee members may ""use this information against the national interest"". The cross-party committee, he told the BBC, was ""deeply divided"" between those ""refighting the referendum"" and those who want to ""move on"" and he trusted the government to decide what information to share. ""If we get this wrong, it could cost the country billions,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says the government could be in contempt of Parliament if it withholds Brexit data from MPs Earlier this month, MPs voted for the documents to be released, although Conservative MPs abstained. Ministers claim the analysis ""does not exist in the form Parliament requested"" and claim they have satisfied the terms of the parliamentary motion, but Labour disagrees and says the MPs' decision was clearly ""binding"".

Many Tory MPs, including prominent Brexiteers, also criticised the government's actions, Philip Hollobone telling MPs it was ""skating on very thin parliamentary ice"". Speaking in Parliament, the SNP's Pete Wishart said the ""government must be held accountable for its failure to comply"" but Commons Speaker John Bercow said any MPs alleging contempt of Parliament must write to him officially, assuring them he would respond promptly.

Read Laura Kuenssberg's take on the row Kamal Ahmed on economic costs The amount of money the UK will pay as part of Brexit has been one of the main sticking points in the first round of negotiations with the EU. Brussels has consistently called for the UK to put more cash on the table and last week Theresa May won ministers' backing to increase the offer. According to theDaily Telegraph,externaland theFinancial Times,external, agreement has been reached between the two sets of negotiators on how the bill could be calculated.

Harry and Meghan to wed in Windsor in May,"This video can not be played Meghan Markle has revealed that Prince Harry proposed on a Sunday night at home Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, in May, Kensington Palace says. The Royal Family will pay for the wedding, including the service, music, flowers and reception - the date will be announced later. Ms Markle, 36, a Protestant, will be baptised into the Church of England and confirmed before the wedding. A spokesman for the prince said the pair would make sure the wedding ""reflects who they are as a couple"". Jason Knauf said Prince Harry, 33, and Ms Markle were ""leading the planning process for all aspects of the wedding"" and were working through ideas on how members of the public could ""feel part of the celebrations"". ""This wedding, like all weddings, will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the characters of the bride and groom,"" he added. Harry: Stars were aligned when I met Meghan Full interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle The prince and the actress Who is Meghan Markle? Profile: Prince Harry Mr Knauf described Windsor as a ""very special place"" for the couple, saying they had spent time there together since meeting in July 2016. He also revealed that the American actress intends to become a British citizen and will work towards it in the coming years. St George's Chapel was the venue for a service of prayer and dedication after Harry's father, the Prince of Wales, married the Duchess of Cornwall at the Windsor Guildhall in 2005. It was also chosen for the wedding of Harry's cousin, Peter Phillips, and Autumn Kelly in 2008, and the Earl and Countess of Wessex in 1999. BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph said St George's Chapel held many happy childhood memories for Prince Harry, and while a more intimate venue than Westminster Abbey or St Paul's Cathedral, was grand enough for royal wedding. This video can not be played Kate on Harry and Meghan: ""William and I are absolutely thrilled"" Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne, and Ms Markle announced their engagement on Monday. Mr Knauf said it was ""an incredibly happy day"" for the couple and they were ""overwhelmed by support from the UK and around the world"". Their 16-month relationship began when they met on a blind date in London arranged by a mutual friend. The couple gave their first joint TV interview to the BBC's Mishal Husain on Monday  - revealing the proposal came as they made roast chicken at home earlier this month. They also discussed Ms Markle's pet dogs and Mr Knauf revealed that while one of them, Guy, was legally allowed to stay with her in the UK, the other, Bogart, would not be joining her. The other American in Prince Harry's life Why she won't be Princess Meghan Can you remarry in church after divorce? The prince and Ms Markle will carry out their first official engagement together in Nottingham on Friday. They will go on a walkabout and visit the Nottingham Contemporary which is hosting a Terrence Higgins Trust World Aids Day charity fair, and Nottingham Academy to meet head teachers. Their spokesman said Ms Markle would not be continuing her work on gender with the United Nations or with other organisations, and instead would start new charity work as a full-time royal. She is to become the fourth patron of the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Speaking during a visit to the Foundling Museum in London on Tuesday, the Duchess of Cambridge said both she and Prince William hoped the couple ""enjoy this happy moment"". By Adam Whitty, BBC News, Windsor St George's Chapel is shrouded in darkness tonight, the 15th Century gothic building shielded by the walls of Windsor Castle. However, on a cold and dark night, there is a real atmosphere of warmth and light in Windsor with the knowledge this town will be the centre of the world in six months' time. A shop worker (whose tills will surely be ringing relentlessly in the build up to the big day) said the day would be like a ""fairytale"" for Windsor and the country as a whole. A woman called Elaine, who used to volunteer in the chapel for a number of years, said St George's offered a much more intimate experience for an occasion like this. ""We just think of ourselves as really lucky,"" she said. ""It's going to be an incredible atmosphere on the day."" The couple announced plans for a spring wedding on Monday, but by choosing May, have avoided a potential clash with the birth of the Duchess of Cambridge's third child and the Queen's appearance at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London and Windsor - both of which are in April. Downing Street has said there are no plans for a bank holidayto mark the wedding, after the possibility was mooted on social media. Ms Markle was previously married, but the Church of England agreed in 2002 that divorced people would be allowed to remarry in church. What?A 15th Century gothic chapel, set in the grounds of Windsor Castle. Size:Holds 800 guests - Westminster Abbey has a capacity of 2,000. Other royal occasions;Prince Harry's christening in 1984, religious blessing for the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall in 2005, and the wedding of the Earl of Wessex in 1999. Historic funerals:The Queen Mother and Princess Margaret in 2002, and King George VI - the Queen's father - in 1952. The chapel contains the tombs of 10 sovereigns.

"Wholesaler fails with 2,500 jobs lostPalmer and Harvey goes into administration, with 2,500 jobs to go immediately, and a further 900 under threat.3m3 minutes agoBusiness","Major UK wholesaler Palmer and Harvey (P&H) has gone into administration following failed rescue talks. Administrators at PwC have said 2,500 jobs will be lost with immediate effect. The firm had been in takeover talks with private equity firm Carlyle, but these fell through.

It is the UK's fifth biggest privately-owned firm, and delivers more than 12,000 products, including food and alcohol. It supplies about 90,000 outlets around the UK including major chains, convenience stores, corner shops and petrol station forecourts.

The remaining employees would ""assist the joint administrators in managing the activities of the business to an orderly closure"". One P&H customer, Costcutter Supermarkets, said it was was searching for other suppliers. ""We have activated our contingency plans to provide alternative sources of supply through appropriate regional and national options,"" a Costcutter spokesman said.

Ireland's deputy PM resigns amid crisis,"Frances Fitzgerald had been at the centre of a controversy which could have resulted in a snap election Ireland's deputy prime minister Frances Fitzgerald has said she is resigning for the sake of the country, averting a snap general election. She had been under pressure over a police whistleblower scandal that could have brought down the government. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he had accepted her resignation with ""deep regret"". She quit hours before a motion of no confidence in her was to be proposed by the main opposition party, Fianna FÃ¡il. Leo Varadkar: Frances Fitzgerald has 'done nothing wrong' Origins of the Garda McCabe whistleblower controversy There were fears that an Irish election could have complicated next month's EU meeting, at which the Republic of Ireland's position will influence the assessment of the UK's progress in Brexit talks. According to Irish broadcaster, RTÃ, Ms Fitzgerald told a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that she was not asked or forced to resign, but took the decision herself. ""I believe it is necessary to take this decision to avoid an unwelcome and potentially destabilising general election at this historically critical time,"" she said. ""Throughout my career I have always sought to act with integrity and responsibility, and that is why I have decided on this occasion to put the national interest ahead of my own personal reputation."" She had been under pressure to resign because of her inaction in supporting a Garda whistleblower, Sgt Maurice McCabe, whom she had publicly defended in her former role as Irish justice minister. Ms Fitzgerald held the dual roles of tÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) and minister for business, enterprise and innovation. Speaking in the DÃ¡il (Irish Parliament) on Tuesday, Mr Varadkar described her as an ""exemplary member of government and a loyal colleague"". This video can not be played ""I don't think there's any long-term damage to the government,"" says Fine Gael MEP Brian Hayes He defended her handling of the McCabe case and added that as minister she had enshrined a code of ethics in An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na to protect officers who reported wrongdoing. Mr Varadkar confirmed that he had accepted her resignation with deep regret and told the DÃ¡il that a good woman was leaving office without getting a fair hearing. ""In the past few days a drip-drip of information may have made certain things seem greater than they are,"" he said. ""There was a feeding frenzy, and it became impossible for her to get a fair hearing based on the full facts."" The taoiseach added that he had advised the president to accept her resignation and he will personally take over her brief as minister for business, for a short time. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin had been in talks over the weekend The taoiseach said he expects Ms Fitzgerald ""to continue to play a full role in political and public life, including at the highest level into the future"". He described her as ""one of the most reforming ministers we have ever had"". The Department of Justice's secretary general Noel Waters, who had been due to retire in February, said he was leaving the role on Tuesday. Last week, it was revealed that Ms Fitzgerald hadbeen told of an attempt to discredit Sgt Maurice McCabe by lawyers for the Garda commissionerat a commission of enquiry a year earlier than she had previously admitted. She said she had forgotten the email and was precluded from acting on legal advice. The publication of further emails on Monday showed she had been aware of the attempt to discredit the whistleblower on one other occasion and was seen by many in her Fine Gael party as undermining her position. Police whistleblower Sgt Maurice McCabe was the subject of false allegations after he spoke out about corruption The Irish government is currently led by Mr Varadkar's Fine Gael party, but his cabinet includes a number of independent ministers and the coalition also depends on the support of the main opposition party, Fianna FÃ¡il. The coalition came to power in 2016, after a bruising general election in which no single party won enough seats to govern alone. Fianna FÃ¡il agreed to support the minority governmentfor three budgets and in confidence motions, but the whistleblower controversy has tested that agreement. If Fianna FÃ¡il's proposed vote of no confidence in Ms Fitzgerald had passed, another election may have been unavoidable.

Ticket websites may be 'breaking law',"Bands like the Arctic Monkeys have called for reform of the industry Secondary ticketing websites may be breaking the law, by failing to tell consumers about restrictions on the tickets they're buying. After a year-long investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found widespread concerns about such websites. It said some of them had taken action to improve, but others had not. The CMA has not named the websites involved, but it is threatening to do so if they don't comply. It may also take action in the courts. Secondary ticketing websites are designed to re-sell tickets to concerts, shows and events where the original buyer can no longer attend. The four largest sites, Get Me In, Viagogo, StubHub and Seatwave were all investigated as part of the enquiry. All four agreed to makesome changesin March 2015, before the CMA investigation began. Get Me In and Seatwave said they had complied with the law since November 2016. StubHub said it was working to ensure that consumers have access to a ""safe, secure and transparent"" ticket resale service. ""Our investigation has identified concerns that the law protecting consumers is being broken,"" said Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA. ""Thousands of people use these sites and they have a right to know if there is a risk that they will be turned away at the door, who they've bought their ticket from or exactly what seat at the venue they're getting for their money."" The CMA says it must be made clear to consumers: whether there are restrictions on using a re-sold ticket which could stop someone getting into an event whom they are buying from. In some cases the seller could be a business, not an individual exactly where in the venue they will be sitting The news was welcomed by the FanFair Alliance, a group that campaigns against online ticket touts. ""It is has taken far too long to get here, but a Sword of Damocles now hangs over the entire secondary market,"" said a FanFair Alliance spokesperson. ""If they fail to deliver root-and-branch reforms, we expect the largest resale platforms to face significant consequences."" The CMA has also found some additional concerns, such as ""pressure selling"". In some cases websites are making false claims about the popularity of tickets, putting pressure on consumers to buy quickly. In other cases consumers can have difficulty getting their money back, despite guarantees on the website. The CMA also highlighted instances of speculative selling - where businesses advertise tickets they do not yet own - and cases where secondary sites are being used as primary sellers. Ticketmaster, which owns Get Me In and Seatwave, said it welcomed the CMA's initiative. ""We have been working closely with the CMA to ensure that we are compliant with consumer law, offering unparalleled transparency to fans when purchasing tickets,"" a spokesperson said. Several high-profile bands, including the Arctic Monkeys and One Direction, have called for tighter enforcement action on such sites. Under the Consumer Rights Act, offending sites face fines of up to Â£5,000.

Ex-Corrie star admits sex assaults,"Bruno Langley was sentenced to a 12-month community order at Manchester Magistrates' Court Former Coronation Street actor Bruno Langley has admitted groping two women in a music venue. The women were assaulted at the Band on the Wall music venue on Swan Street in Manchester on 1 October. Langley, 34, of Altrincham, admitted two sexual assaults and was sentenced to a 12-month community order at Manchester Magistrates' Court. ITV said he had left the soap's cast, but existing storylines meant he would be seen on screen until 24 December. The court heard Langley had grabbed the crotch of one woman and touched the breasts and bottom of the other while drunk. Prosecutor Karen Saffman said the actor had been ""clearly intoxicated"" when he approached the first woman, who was out with her husband. Reading from the woman's victim statement, she said he had ""properly grabbed"" her crotch with a ""rough grab"". Bruno Langley played Todd Grimshaw, Coronation Street's first openly gay character, for 16 years Ms Saffman said the woman ""was thinking about hitting him"" but instead confronted him, asking: ""Did you do that on purpose?"" She said Langley had not replied but a man who was with him apologised for the actor's actions. The court heard the woman had then gone to the toilets where she was approached by his second victim who told her she had also been attacked. Ms Saffman said Langley had also sexually touched two other women, but had not faced charges over those assaults. She added that while he was not charged, those incidents were ""indicative of his behaviour"" on the night. Sentencing, District Judge Mark Hadfield said he had to consider if he would pass a custodial sentence, telling Langley his actions had been ""quite disgraceful and degrading"". He said Langley had shown genuine remorse, though his defence of being drunk was ""not mitigation, [but] a further aggravating feature"" and the ""consequences"" of what happened were ""serious for all concerned, the two victims but also for you"". ""You have lost your good name and I know nothing of showbusiness, but... in the current climate, I suspect it may be very difficult for you to gain employment in that industry in the future,"" he added. Langley was handed a 12-month community order, including 40 days of rehabilitation activity, and was ordered to wear an electronic tag, observe a curfew and pay Â£250 compensation to his victims. He also must sign the sex offenders register for five years. Langley, whose contract was terminated after an internal inquiry in October, had played Coronation Street's first openly gay character Todd Grimshaw since 2001.

Pope avoids Rohingya term in speech,"Before his speech Pope Francis met Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi Pope Francis has delivered a keynote speech in Myanmar, demanding ""respect for each ethnic group"" but without referring specifically to its Muslim Rohingya community. Rights groups had urged the Pope to use the term to back the community. However, the Catholic Church in the country had told him the term could cause difficulties for Catholics. Myanmar has been accused of ethnic cleansing, with 620,000 Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh since August. What you need to know about Rohingya crisis Myanmar's persecuted minority in pictures Myanmar's government rejects the term Rohingya, labelling the community ""Bengalis"". It says they migrated illegally from Bangladesh so should not be listed as one of the country's ethnic groups. Although he made no direct reference to the Rohingya, the Pope's speech was a strong defence of ethnic rights. He said: ""The future of Myanmar must be peace, a peace based on respect for the dignity and rights of each member of society, respect for each ethnic group and its identity, respect for the rule of law, and respect for a democratic order that enables each individual and every group - none excluded - to offer its legitimate contribution to the common good."" This video can not be played Pope Francis is welcomed on his arrival in Myanmar Francis said Myanmar's greatest treasure was its people and that they had ""suffered greatly, and continue to suffer, from civil conflict and hostilities that have lasted all too long and created deep divisions"". ""As the nation now works to restore peace, the healing of those wounds must be a paramount political and spiritual priority."" He added: ""Religious differences need not be a source of division and distrust, but rather a force for unity, forgiveness, tolerance and wise nation-building."" Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act? Myanmar army exonerates self on Rohingya crisis Francis has used the term Rohingya in the past, in support of what he has termed his Rohingya ""brothers and sisters"". Some were upset at his refusal to do so again. ""We are very much disappointed that he did not mention the Rohingya crisis,"" activist Mohammad Zubair told the AFP news agency from Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh. Amnesty International also said it was ""disappointing""- though it did applaud his calls for respect toward all ethnic groups. ""Pope Francis' visit has also helped focus international attention on Myanmar and the horrific crimes being carried out against the Rohingya people on a daily basis by Myanmar authorities,"" its deputy campaign director for the region, Ming Yu Hah, said. The BBC's Jonathan Head, in Yangon, says the Pope has also met a senior ultra-nationalist Buddhist monk and the armed forces commander, and his comments there may have been more forthright. After meeting the pope on Monday, military chief Gen Min Aung Hlaing claimed ""there is no discrimination between ethnic groups in Myanmar"". Amnesty called his comments ""the real scandal of the visit"". Before his speech, Pope Francis held talks with Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi. In her speech, Ms Suu Kyi also made no direct reference to the Rohingya Muslims. However, she accepted the situation in Rakhine state had ""most strongly captured the attention of the world"". This video can not be played Rohingya girls say they were forced into sex work in Bangladesh She said that ""social, economic and political"" issues had ""eroded trust and understanding, harmony and co-operation between different communities in Rakhine"". Ms Suu Kyi has been criticised for her lack of action over the issue. On Monday, the Nobel Peace Prize winner was stripped of the Freedom of the English city of Oxford, with local councillors saying they no longer wished to honour those who turned a blind eye to violence. Myanmar has deniedUN accusations that the treatment of the Muslim community amounts to ethnic cleansing. It says the crackdown in Rakhine state, which beganafter deadly attacks on police posts by Rohingya militants, is to root out violent insurgents. The 80-year-old Pope is on the second day of a four-day visit to the country. In an earlier 40-minute meeting in Yangon with leaders of the Buddhist, Islamic, Hindu, Jewish and Christian faiths, the Pope also made no direct reference to the Rohingya, according to Vatican officials who gave a briefing on the meeting. Evidence of Christianity in Myanmar extends back as far as the 13th Century, but Catholic evangelism began in earnest in the 18th Century, when Myanmar was the kingdoms of Ava and Pegu Catholics make up 1%-1.3% of the 53 million population. Buddhism is the majority religion with about 88%, with Christianity overall accounting for about 6% About 90% of Catholics in the country are from the Karen, Kachin, Chin, Shan and Kaw ethnic minorities Censuses over the past 40 years show Christianity is the fastest growing religious group On Wednesday, the Pope is to celebrate a huge Mass in Yangon, which some 200,000 Myanmar Catholics, almost 40% of the country's Catholic community, are expected to attend. After Myanmar, Francis will move on to Bangladesh to meet a small group of Rohingya refugees in a symbolic gesture. The Pope's trip was planned before the violence erupted in Myanmar in August. Last weekMyanmar and Bangladesh signed a deal to return hundreds of thousands who have fled across the border, but aid agencies have raised concerns about any forcible return. Separately, Bangladesh has approved several hundred million dollars of funding to house tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees in a controversial camp on an isolated and salt-contaminated island, despite concerns the land may not be habitable at high tide.

Ed Sheeran overlooked at Grammys,"Ed Sheeran has been nominated in the pop categories Ed Sheeran's multi-million selling album Ã· has been excluded from the main categories at the 2018 Grammy Awards, surprising many industry observers. The star was edged out of contention by Bruno Mars and Kendrick Lamar, who each received multiple nominations. Jay Z leads with eight nominations, including his first ever appearance in the album of the year list for 4:44, which comes 21 years after his debut. Sheeran did receive several nominations in the pop categories, however. Shape of You is up for best pop solo performance, while Ã· is shortlisted for best pop album. Lady Gaga is also relegated to the pop categories for her recent album, Joanne, while Katy Perry fails to receive any nominations at all. Overall, the shortlist is very male-dominated, with New Zealand's Lorde the only woman cited for album of the year. Lorde's Melodrama is up for album of the year Taylor Swift also missed out on a nomination for her single Look What You Made Me Do, one of the most talked-about records of the year. Her recent album, Reputation, was released too late to be eligible for an award - but the star does receive recognition for writing Little Big Town's single Better Man, which is up for best country song; and for her duet with One Direction's Zayn Malik, I Don't Want To Live Forever, which featured on the Fifty Shades soundtrack. Jay Z's haul comes in recognition of his 13th studio album, which finds the star in a vulnerable, reflective mood. The title track confronts his infidelity, while the self-lacerating Kill Jay Z discusses how fame inflated his ego. However, most critics expect rapper Kendrick Lamar to pick up the coveted album of the year prize. Damn, which highlights his incendiary, virtuoso flow, is his third record to make the shortlist. This video can not be played Luis Fonsi's Despacito has become the most-streamed song of all time. Despacito, the hit from Puerto Rican singer Luis Fonsi featuring Justin Bieber and Daddy Yankee, lands three nominations including record and song of the year. It is the first time a Spanish-language song has been listed in the song of the year category since Los Lobos's cover of La Bamba in 1988. British artists are hard to find amongst the Grammys' 84 categories. The Rolling Stones' collection of covers, Blue & Lonesome, is cited for best traditional blues album; while Laura Marling's Semper Femina is up for best folk album. Coldplay, Calvin Harris, Gorillaz, Bonobo and Guernsey-born producer Mura Masa also receive nods, but there is no prospect of a British artist sweeping the board like Adele in 2017 or Sam Smith in 2015. The next class of Grammy winners will be unveiled on 28 January at Madison Square Garden in New York. Album of the year Childish Gambino - Awaken, My Love!

The worst places to grow up poor,"Rhythmical Mike is a successful performer - but says his schooldays were ""a nightmare"" ""You've got this - the whirlwind that you're in - is the beginning of something wonderfully new - for you."" Rhythmical Mike, a 24-year-old East Midlands poet, performs his work to pupils at Lovers' Lane Primary school in Newark, Nottinghamshire. It's an area where many children face big challenges and, according to a new State of the Nation report from the Social Mobility Commission, their educational and career prospects are too often limited from the outset. It ranks all 324 local authorities in England in terms of the life chances of someone born into a disadvantaged background and it debunks the notion of a simple North-South divide. Instead, it says, there is a ""postcode lottery"" with ""hotspots"" (shown in orange on the map below) and ""cold spots"" (shown in blue) found in all regions. The report highlights a ""self-reinforcing spiral of ever growing division"", with children in some areas getting a poor start in life from which they can never recover. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map created with Carto. If you can't see the map,tap here,external. West Somerset sits at the bottom of the league table, with average wages less than half those in the best performing parts of London. There are some surprises, with wealthy areas such as West Berkshire, Cotswold and Crawley performing badly for their most vulnerable residents. The report explains that wealthy areas can see high levels of low pay, with poorer young people at risk of being ""somewhat neglected"", particularly if they are scattered around isolated rural schools Conversely, some of the most deprived areas are ""hotspots"", providing good education, employment opportunities and housing for their most disadvantaged residents. These include London boroughs with big deprived populations such as Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Newham. In Kensington and Chelsea half of disadvantaged teenagers make it to university, but the figure for the same group in Barnsley, Hastings and Eastbourne is just 10%. ""London and its hinterland are increasingly looking like a different country from the rest of Britain,"" says Alan Milburn, who chairs the Social Mobility Commission. ""It is moving ahead, as are many of our country's great cities. ""But too many rural and coastal areas and towns of Britain's old industrial heartlands are being left behind economically and hollowed out socially."" Large variations were also found within Scotland and Wales, although the data is not directly comparable with that for England, says the report. This video can not be played ""Not many opportunities"": People in the town of Newark share their experiences The East Midlands is the English region with the worst outcomes for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, says the report - and within the East Midlands, Newark and Sherwood is the worst performing local authority. In Newark, only 43% of children are ready for school when they start Reception, compared with 52% nationally, the research finds. And by adulthood only 21% are in professional or managerial roles, compared with 51% in Oxford. Mike, real name Mike Markham, has been a poet for about six years, running his own company and playing at festivals, supporting stars like Rizzle Kicks and Russell Brand. For him, school was a really negative experience. He feels he failed there. ""It was a nightmare,"" he says, but believes overcoming his early difficulties helped him succeed later in life. ""Anybody can achieve anything,"" is his message to the children. He believes that, despite class structures, the world is changing. ""I think you've just got to be driven, you've got to be inspired you've got to be inspiring."" Efforts to improve social mobility need to start early, says the report The children themselves have big ambitions. ""I want to be a boxer. I want to get to the highest level and be a professional,"" says one boy. ""I want to be a heart surgeon and to do that I am going to have to get into the best universities there are and I've just got to try and pass all my exams,"" says a girl. But head teacher Jenny Hodgkinson says too many parents are caught between low pay and rising living costs and are working so hard simply to put food on the table, that they often lack time and energy to focus on their children's schooling. ""There's a lot of challenges facing families at the moment,"" she says. ""In terms of working more than one job, people with low income aren't time rich. ""They want to do the best for their children and they work ever so hard but they don't always have the resources to do what they need to."" ""It can be difficult trying to earn a living in this town,"" says parent Sian Mclachlan. In the town centre, one young woman complained of few opportunities for young people. ""If there's a good job going it will be gone within a week or so,"" she adds. ""I've got job security,"" says one young man. ""But I could be doing a lot more. I took better money where I should have gone to college - but you're not really pushed in this area."" The school is making great efforts to improve children's mental health, resilience and self-esteem, along with extra reading support and individual mentoring. It is working to draw in families, with classes to improve parents' basic skills which can help improve attitudes to education and boost their children's attendance. Ms Mclachlan says workshops on CV writing, job interviews and money management are also on offer. But the report warns of ""mind-blowing inconsistency"" in efforts to improve social mobility. ""Tinkering around the edges will not do the trick,"" says Mr Milburn. ""The analysis in this report substantiates the sense of political alienation and social resentment that so many parts of Britain feel."" He wants ""a new level of effort to tackle the phenomenon of left-behind Britain"" and urges the government to increase spending on regions that most need it. For example, estimates suggest that the North of England is Â£6bn underfunded compared with London. This video can not be played Alan Milburn: ""Your chances of getting on really depend on where you're born and where you live"" His recommendations include: all councils to develop a strategy for boosting disadvantaged children's prospects all councils to pay the living wage greater efforts to attract teachers to poorer regions struggling schools to develop partnerships with successful schools to boost attainment fairer transport funding, including transport subsidies for poor young people in rural areas Education Secretary Justine Greening said the findings underlined ""the importance of focusing our efforts in more disadvantaged areas where we can make the biggest difference"". ""We are making progress. There are now 1.8 million more children in good or outstanding schools than in 2010. Disadvantaged young people are entering universities at record rates and the attainment gap between them and their peers has narrowed. ""We are also boosting salaries through the introduction of the National Living Wage, creating more full-time, permanent jobs and investing Â£9bn in affordable housing. Taken together, this won't just change individual lives, it will help transform our country into a fairer society.""

Suspended officers 'fired guns illegally',"ACC Higgins would be eligible to retire in March but intends to stay on Two senior Police Scotland officers suspended as part of a criminal inquiry are accused of using the force firing range for unauthorised purposes, BBC Scotland understands. Assistant Chief Constable Bernard Higgins and Supt Kirk Kinnell are among four officers suspended in recent days. The alleged offences took place at the Police Training and Recruitment Centre in Jackton, East Kilbride. No wrongdoing has been admitted by any of the officers under investigation. Police appoint new senior officers Minister urged to 'get a grip' on Police Scotland Senior officer suspended amid criminal probe The firing range should only be used in controlled circumstances by authorised officers. Police Scotland firearms officers must complete an intensive 11-week course during which they are trained to Armed Response Vehicle (ARV) standard. Officers cannot even use a taser stun gun without completing the course at Jackton. Ch Insp Bob Glass and a fourth officer, who has not been named, were also suspended on Friday. Ch Insp Glass is Supt Kinnell's deputy and was head of Strathclyde Police's armed response unit at the time of the 2007 terror attack on Glasgow Airport. Supt Kinnell is due to retire next month while Ch Insp Glass and ACC Higgins are eligible to leave the force after completing 30 years' service in January and March respectively. The BBC understands the Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) is examining a number of other allegations as part of the wide-ranging probe. One is believed to concern two separate alleged incidents at a senior officer's house. On both occasions a neighbour raised the alarm but when local officers turned up at the house the senior officer allegedly told them to go away. The BBC understands the matter was only escalated after a second allegation was made. Separately, the purchase of a rucksack and other ""high value items"" for the force, which then went missing, also forms part of the investigation. Two other officers have been placed on restricted duties as a result of the investigation into allegations of criminal conduct and gross misconduct. It is understood Sgt Cat Gibbons, who is based at the Road Policing Unit in Irvine, is one of the officers. Firearms officers must complete an intensive 11 week training course Pirc is also looking into allegations of misconduct against Chief Constable Phil Gormley, who is currently on ""special leave"". That investigation is unrelated to inquiries into allegations that officers in the former counter-corruption unit abused their position when attempting to find the source of a journalist's information. Both Mr Gormley and Mr Higgins have denied wrongdoing. On Friday Deputy Chief Constable Iain Livingstone confirmed the suspension of ACC Higgins, who was responsible for operational support, custody and criminal justice and three other officers, He also confirmed two others were placed on restricted duties by Deputy Chief Constable Rose Fitzpatrick in connection with an investigation by the Pirc. The anonymous allegations were initially brought to the SPA's attention by the Pirc on 18 October. On Friday the SPA board suspended ACC Higgins and referred the misconduct allegations to the Pirc. Separately, Pirc also confirmed it had referred the original allegations to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS). It was to determine whether the criminal allegations should be investigated by the Commissioner. The COPFS decided that an independent investigation should be carried out by the Pirc. A Pirc spokesman said: ""The investigation is ongoing.""

Ireland's deputy PM resigns amid crisisFrances Fitzgerald resigns 'for the sake of the country' averting a snap election before Christmas.,"Frances Fitzgerald had been at the centre of a controversy which could have resulted in a snap election Ireland's deputy prime minister Frances Fitzgerald has said she is resigning for the sake of the country, averting a snap general election. She had been under pressure over a police whistleblower scandal that could have brought down the government. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he had accepted her resignation with ""deep regret"". She quit hours before a motion of no confidence in her was to be proposed by the main opposition party, Fianna FÃ¡il. Leo Varadkar: Frances Fitzgerald has 'done nothing wrong' Origins of the Garda McCabe whistleblower controversy There were fears that an Irish election could have complicated next month's EU meeting, at which the Republic of Ireland's position will influence the assessment of the UK's progress in Brexit talks. According to Irish broadcaster, RTÃ, Ms Fitzgerald told a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that she was not asked or forced to resign, but took the decision herself. ""I believe it is necessary to take this decision to avoid an unwelcome and potentially destabilising general election at this historically critical time,"" she said. ""Throughout my career I have always sought to act with integrity and responsibility, and that is why I have decided on this occasion to put the national interest ahead of my own personal reputation."" She had been under pressure to resign because of her inaction in supporting a Garda whistleblower, Sgt Maurice McCabe, whom she had publicly defended in her former role as Irish justice minister. Ms Fitzgerald held the dual roles of tÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) and minister for business, enterprise and innovation. Speaking in the DÃ¡il (Irish Parliament) on Tuesday, Mr Varadkar described her as an ""exemplary member of government and a loyal colleague"". This video can not be played ""I don't think there's any long-term damage to the government,"" says Fine Gael MEP Brian Hayes He defended her handling of the McCabe case and added that as minister she had enshrined a code of ethics in An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na to protect officers who reported wrongdoing. Mr Varadkar confirmed that he had accepted her resignation with deep regret and told the DÃ¡il that a good woman was leaving office without getting a fair hearing. ""In the past few days a drip-drip of information may have made certain things seem greater than they are,"" he said. ""There was a feeding frenzy, and it became impossible for her to get a fair hearing based on the full facts."" The taoiseach added that he had advised the president to accept her resignation and he will personally take over her brief as minister for business, for a short time. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin had been in talks over the weekend The taoiseach said he expects Ms Fitzgerald ""to continue to play a full role in political and public life, including at the highest level into the future"". He described her as ""one of the most reforming ministers we have ever had"". The Department of Justice's secretary general Noel Waters, who had been due to retire in February, said he was leaving the role on Tuesday. Last week, it was revealed that Ms Fitzgerald hadbeen told of an attempt to discredit Sgt Maurice McCabe by lawyers for the Garda commissionerat a commission of enquiry a year earlier than she had previously admitted. She said she had forgotten the email and was precluded from acting on legal advice. The publication of further emails on Monday showed she had been aware of the attempt to discredit the whistleblower on one other occasion and was seen by many in her Fine Gael party as undermining her position. Police whistleblower Sgt Maurice McCabe was the subject of false allegations after he spoke out about corruption The Irish government is currently led by Mr Varadkar's Fine Gael party, but his cabinet includes a number of independent ministers and the coalition also depends on the support of the main opposition party, Fianna FÃ¡il. The coalition came to power in 2016, after a bruising general election in which no single party won enough seats to govern alone. Fianna FÃ¡il agreed to support the minority governmentfor three budgets and in confidence motions, but the whistleblower controversy has tested that agreement. If Fianna FÃ¡il's proposed vote of no confidence in Ms Fitzgerald had passed, another election may have been unavoidable.

Stella McCartney says fashion 'wasteful'The designer backs a report that claims half of High Street fashion is thrown away within a year.5h5 hours agoBusinessComments,"Stella McCartney is calling for radical changes to the ""incredibly wasteful"" fashion industry. The designer is backing a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation which claims half of High Street fashion is disposed of within a year. It also says the amount of clothing bought has doubled in 15 years,  but the number of times an item is worn has fallen by 20%. The report is backed by industry giants including H&M and Nike. ""Today's textile industry is built on an outdated linear, take-make-dispose model and is hugely wasteful and polluting,"" said Dame Ellen MacArthur, a round-the-world sailor and environmental campaigner. The report by her foundation says that 50% of the clothes sent for landfill in the UK could be recycled. Victoria Beckham fashions Â£30m investment Kendall Jenner named highest paid model Other environmental effects include the depositing in the ocean of half a million tonnes of tiny synthetic fibres, which cannot be cleaned up. As a result, the foundation says that we could end up eating our own clothes as they re-enter the food chain. Stella McCartney said: ""What really excites me about [the report] is that it provides solutions to an industry that is incredibly wasteful and harmful to the environment. "" The report has a list of suggestions as to how to change the way clothing is produced to make it more sustainable: Phase out substances of concern and create safer materials Transform the way clothes are designed, sold and used to break free from their increasingly disposable nature Radically improve recycling by transforming clothing design, collection and reprocessing Make effective use of resources and move to renewable inputs The report taps into a growing move among consumers towards more sustainable living. In a recent survey by consultants Kantar Futures, 80% of respondents said they would pay more for products that lasted longer. ""Consumers are placing greater importance on the long-term benefits of a product, rather than cost-saving options that are seemingly more disposable,"" said J Walker Smith from Kantar Futures. But market research firm Mintel said good intentions did not always result in a change in behaviour. Its research suggests that 80% of women aged 16-24 were mainly looking for low prices.

Harry and Meghan: Can you remarry in church after divorce?,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are to marry at St George's Chapel, Windsor, in May. But what effect does the fact that she is divorced have on the wedding? The first words uttered by a priest after the moment that he or she has legally married a couple in the Church of England are: ""Those whom God has joined together let no-one put asunder."" But42% of marriages in England and Wales end in divorce,external, according to the Office for National Statistics' 2016 figures. This year it was revealed that a quarter of people who marry have done so before. So even allowing for those who choose to remarry in civil ceremonies, the Church must inevitably be asked to marry some people who are divorced. The Church of England did not officially permit remarriage after divorce from the 17th Century until the 21st. The rules were almost certainly breached informally. But it was only in 2002 that the General Synod, the church's legislative body, allowed remarriage in church of divorced people whose former partners were still alive, in ""exceptional circumstances"". Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry in May It revoked resolutions dating back to 1938 stating that ""both divorce itself and remarriage after divorce during the lifetime of a former partner always involve a departure from the true principle of marriage"", and ""the Church should not allow the use of [the Marriage] Service in the case of anyone who has a former partner still living"". The prince and the actress Who is Meghan Markle? Full interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Profile: Prince Harry Advice to clergy published by the church in 2002 states that defining the ""exceptional circumstances"" is the responsibility of the priest conducting what is called the ""further marriage"" - how the church terms the second marriage. Priests who do not object are recommended to make sure that the couple understand that divorce is a breach of God's will for marriage. They should ensure the prospective couple have a ""mature view"" of the breakdown of the previous marriage, and that there has been ""sufficient healing of the personal and social wounds of marriage breakdown"". The breakdown of the previous marriage must not be ""directly caused"" by the new partner, and the new marriage should not ""cause hostile public comment or scandal"". Clergy who object to carrying out the remarriage of divorcees have a get-out. Section 8 (2) of the Matrimonial Causes Act 1965 states that no clergy shall be ""compelled to solemnise the marriage of any person whose former marriage has been dissolved and whose former spouse is still living"", or ""to permit the marriage of such a person to be solemnised in the church or chapel"" of which they are the minister. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall had their wedding blessed at St George's Chapel, Windsor after a civil ceremony in 2005 They might wish instead to conduct a service of prayer and dedication after a civil marriage, as was held for the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall at the Chapel Royal in Windsor in 2005. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, whose parents were divorced when he was young, has conducted the marriage service of at least one divorced person. In the Church of Scotland, divorcees have been permitted to remarry since church law was changed in 1959. The teaching of the church, which is Presbyterian in tradition, does not consider marriage to be a sacrament - the term used to describe a formal rite of the church. Ministers are required to ask divorcees similar questions to those used by Anglican priests south of the border, and no minister has to conduct a marriage ceremony against his or her conscience. Catholic canon law does not permit the marriage of a divorcee whose former spouse is still alive, although annulments can be granted to certify the original marriage as invalid from the start.

Bath university head quits in pay row,"Prof Dame Glynis Breakwell has faced criticism over excessive pay The vice-chancellor of the University of Bath, facing accusations of excessive pay, has stepped down. Dame Prof Glynis Breakwell, the UK's highest paid vice-chancellor with a salary of Â£468,000, had become the focus of criticisms of rising pay among university leaders. Lecturers had complained that her pay had risen much more rapidly than the salaries of university staff. Dame Glynis will step down at the end of the summer term. Dame Glynis said she had ""served the university to the best of my ability"" and would now take a sabbatical before formally retiring in 2019. She will stay on full pay through her sabbatical and a car loan worth about Â£31,000 will be written off - but the university says there will be no financial payment attached to stepping down. Former Education Minister Lord Adonis, who had called her pay ""shameless and outrageous"", criticised the arrangements as allowing a ""lame duck"" to remain on full pay. Bath Students Against Cuts and Fees said the terms of her stepping down were ""unacceptable"" and that she should ""leave now and without further recompense"". And in response to her departure, Sally Hunt, leader of the UCU lecturers' union, said her ""position had become untenable"". The vice-chancellor had faced a wave of challenges over her pay. Last week Dame Glynis had narrowly survived amotion of no confidencein the university's senate, but more than 300 staff had called for her resignation. Four local MPs had resigned from roles at the university. And there were more protests and censures planned for later this week - with criticism from staff and students that her pay was unreasonably high. Dame Glynis's pay had come into sharper focus in the debates over tuition fees and value for money for students. When tuition fees in England were increased to Â£9,250, there were accusations that universities were spending too much on their own senior leaders. The Universities Minister, Jo Johnson, had highlighted concerns about the""upward spiral"" of vice-chancellors' payand had warned them that they needed to show more restraint. But Dame Glynis said she had raised the size and status of the university during her time in charge. ""Since 2001 the university has changed dramatically,"" said Dame Glynis, as she announced stepping down. ""It has almost tripled in size and is now among the top universities in the UK. ""It has had many great achievements in its first 51 years and it will go on to be even greater."" Thomas Sheppard, chair of the university's council, said: ""Dame Glynis Breakwell has given outstanding service to the University of Bath, which has seen the university's national and international profile grow enormously under her leadership.""

Why Meghan won't be called 'princess',"A series of complex and ancient laws will apply to the title that Prince Harry's future wife will receive Why won't Meghan Markle be known as Princess Meghan when she ties the knot with Prince Harry next year? The brutal answer is that, by the standards of British royal protocol, the former Hollywood star lacks ""royal blood"". That means that she cannot call herself Princess Meghan. The arcane rules mean that Meghan will be compelled to follow the example of her future sister-in-law. When Catherine Middleton and Prince William were pronounced ""man and wife"" in 2011, she automatically became Her Royal Highness, Princess William of Wales. The overwhelming likelihood is that the new royal fiancee will in turn officially become HRH Princess Henry of Wales. So we can forget about Princess Kate and we can forget about Princess Meg. The reason for this is simple:  Catherine Middleton was not of royal blood, and what applies to her will also apply in the case of Meghan Markle. The rules which applied to Catherine Middleton (left) at the time of her marriage will also apply to Meghan Markle It is royal blood which is the key determinant when it comes to deciding how a princess is named Royal blood meant that the Queen's late sister Margaret was entitled to call herself Princess Margaret. Likewise the Queen's daughter is Princess Anne and her granddaughters are Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. More royal wedding details expected Harry: Stars were aligned when I met Meghan Full interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Diana Spencer was never officially known as Princess Diana Royal blood made them  princesses in their own right. But Sarah Ferguson was never Princess Sarah and Sophie Rhys-Jones - the wife of Prince Edward - is not Princess Sophie. The rules also meant - to the consternation of many - that Lady Diana Spencer was never officially Princess Diana. She was the Princess of Wales and, after her divorce from Prince Charles, she was Diana, Princess of Wales. As the BBC's Nicholas Witchell explained at the time of William and Kate's engagement in 2011, the Royal Family has not flourished for 1,000 years or so without finding a solution to this somewhat baffling and arguably meaningless issue of what people should be called. From the point of view of Buckingham Palace, handy titles or ""handles"" are required for the members of the family who occupy prestigious but somewhat peripheral roles to the main business of monarchy. The Queen's first cousins are, respectively, the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent, and when her disgraced uncleabandoned the throne to marry an American divorcee in 1936, he became the Duke of Windsor. The prince and the actress Who is Meghan Markle? Profile: Prince Harry Such ducal titles are frequently bestowed upon marriage, our correspondent reported, precisely because they give the new entrant to the family a grand-sounding title without making them princesses or princes in their own right. So when Prince Andrew married Sarah Ferguson in 1986, the Queen made him Duke of York, thus she became the Duchess of York - a title she continues to hold despite her divorce. The Duke of Edinburgh (right in 1950) only became Prince Philip when the Queen accorded him the title Similarly, when Prince Edward married Sophie Rhys-Jones, he became the Earl of Wessex and his new wife the Countess of Wessex. It could be that the Queen makes the same kind of move in the cases of Kate and Meghan, and dusts off a long-defunct royal dukedom - Sussex (the favourite for Harry and Meghan), Albany and Clarence are among the vacant ones. But as with many things connected to British royal protocol, there is always an exception to the rule - the Queen's husband Philip married into the royal family, and yet he is a prince. When he married the then Princess Elizabeth in 1947, the then British King, George VI, created him ""Duke of Edinburgh"". Although he was a prince in some European countries prior to marrying the Queen, in Britain he officially became Prince Philip in February 1957 when the Queen ""accorded him the style and title of a Prince of the United Kingdom"". She could also make both Kate and Meghan princesses in their own right - but such are the rigid traditions surrounding this issue that Britain's first Princess Meghan is likely to be some time away.

Which dress might make Meghan sparkle?,"When Prince Harry and Meghan Markle posed for photos afterannouncing their engagementon Monday, Ms Markle wore a white coat from a brand called Line the Label. The Canadian brand's website then received so many visitors it crashed under the volume of traffic. It proves the world's eyes are now firmly watching the US actress - and what she wears - ahead of the royal wedding. Clarence House announced the couple will marry in spring 2018, which - as any bride-to-be will know - means Ms Markle needs to act quickly to find her perfect wedding dress. So which designer will she choose? Who is Meghan Markle? Meghan's career in pictures Seven things we've learned about the engagement Kate's 'very British' wedding dress Asked what she would wear to walk down the aisle, Ms Markle previously told Hello! magazine her perfect dress would be ""classic and simple"". She made the comments after her character in the US legal drama Suits got married, adding: ""I personally prefer dresses that are whimsical or subtly romantic"". ""She is covering all bases there,"" says Katie Rosseinsky, a fashion writer for Grazia Daily. ""She's been photographed wearing Erdem and Antonio Berardi recently. Erdem has that whimsical element of design which she likes, so that could be an option."" British designer Berardi could design a 'simple and classic' dress for Meghan British designer Berardi on the other hand is famed for the classic and simple look which Ms Markle says she favours. ""I could also see her in something a bit more directional like Emilia Wickstead, who is also one of Kate's favourite designers,"" says Rosseinsky. ""It would be a cool option, not super-embellished, but with interesting shapes that photograph well."" Rosseinsky describes Ms Markle - who appeared at the Invictus Games in Toronto in ripped jeans in September - as ""a relaxed, casual dresser"". ""It's very different to the coat dresses we see Kate [the Duchess of Cambridge] and other royals wearing. Will she be compelled to smarten up?"" asks Rosseinsky. Meghan Markle's ripped jeans sold out after her appearance at the Invictus Games Jodie Davis, co-executive producer of TV show Entertainment Tonight Canada, thinks the wedding will have some Canadian input, as Ms Markle lived there for more than six years while filming Suits. Davis says those ripped jeans at the Invictus Games sold out after the 36-year-old appeared in them. ""It became the 'it' look in the city,"" he says, adding that Ms Markle made the Toronto Life magazine's list of most influential people during her time there. Davis says he thinks there will be ""ethical brands from the US and Canada"" involved in the wedding, reflecting Markle's charity work. ""There are rumours there will be a Canadian influence in the wedding photos or the dress itself,"" he says. ""She definitely brings a very relaxed but stylish and chic look when she's out and about. She's the opposite to the character in Suits, which is well tailored power-dressing."" Markle's character Rachel is known for her power dressing on the show Suits Christine Ross, who is the editorial director of Meghan's Mirror - a fashion blog chronicling Ms Markle's style - agrees. ""Her style hasn't changed since before Harry - it's quite modern and edgy but with a bohemian softness, so it's a relaxed vibe,"" she says. ""I expect her wedding dress will be quite classic but modern and structural. She will pick a diplomatic brand - with a British or American choice.  She will be demure with maybe a crisp satin, but definitely modern."" Ross says while the Duchess of Cambridge has a ""traditional"" look, Ms Markle ""will be a bit more trendy and fearless"". ""It's because she's an American - the culture is a lot different,"" she explains ""Kate is an upper middle class British girl and Meghan grew up in LA, it's a completely different lifestyle."" Mark Niemierko, a celebrity wedding planner, says he's ""excited and intrigued"" by what form the wedding will take. ""She could choose a Vera Wang, or Oscar de la Renta, Monique Lhuillier is also very chic, very classic,"" he says naming three of the most respected American dress design houses. ""If she goes down the British route it could be Christopher Bailey at Burberry. Another really good option would be Stella McCartney, which would play into Meghan's ethical credentials. ""Alice Temperley is also really ethical, but would be a bit slinky, so it would really depend on the location. If you're getting married at Westminster Abbey you need a dress to fill it."" Oscar de la Renta, Erdem and Emilia Wickstead could all be options for Meghan Markle Niemierko, who planned James Corden's wedding to Julia Carey in 2012, adds: ""Meghan is not from British high society and there is a whole new raft of people at British Vogue who are also not from society. ""Alexandra Schulman [the former British Vogue editor] played a big part in advising Kate for her wedding dress. So Edward Enninful might be a great influence. That would be really interesting."" But on the other hand, it may even be US Vogue editor Anna Wintour who advises Ms Markle. ""Wintour is incredibly powerful and takes great personal interest in things like this,"" says Niemerko. ""Harry will play his part. He's the young, cool one. He'll be encouraging her to be herself."" The Duchess of Cambridge's dress was designed by Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen Whatever happens, certain to be a big influence is Jessica Mulroney, a friend and stylist to Ms Markle. Mulroney is also the stylist for Canada's first lady, Sophie Trudeau, and runs a New York wedding boutique. ""They're very close friends,"" says Grazia's Rosseinsky, who thinks Mulroney's influence on Ms Markle is clear. ""If you look at the earlier photos of Meghan, she's definitely become more polished.  I think that's definitely the influence of Jessica Mulroney. ""When you style one of the most powerful and most photographed women in the world like Sophie Trudeau, you will definitely bring some tips across."" The fashion writer thinks Mulroney will not only play a part in the look of Prince Harry's wife-to-be for the pending nuptials, but also in the future. ""I imagine she will definitely be involved in the wedding,"" she says. ""She will also be very good for diplomatic dressing. Kate is good at throwing a nod to labels from the countries she's visiting. Jessica Mulroney will be already used to this from styling Sophie Trudeau."" Wedding planner Niemerko adds that whatever Ms Markle's choice of dress, only one thing is important. ""The most exciting thing about the wedding is being yourselves,"" he says. ""They're marrying for love - which is the best way."" Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Seven things we've learned,"This video can not be played Meghan Markle has revealed that Prince Harry proposed on a Sunday night at home Prince Harry and Meghan Markle havegiven their first interviewsince their engagement was announced. Here are seven things we learned about their relationship. Just weeks after they met, Prince Harry convinced Ms Markle to join him on a trip to Botswana. ""We camped out with each other under the stars,"" the prince said. ""She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic."" He said being away allowed them to get to know each other without the usual pressures of royal life. The prince made sure his fiancee's engagement ring is personal to their relationship. Set in yellow gold - Ms Markle's ""favourite"" - the central diamond is from Botswana, where they first spent significant time together. It is flanked by two stones taken from the collection of Princess Diana, the prince's late mother. The couple spoke of how important it was to include Princess Diana in their engagement. Ms Markle said: ""Not being able to meet his mother, it's so important to me to know that she's a part of this with us."" Prince Harry said his mother would have been ""over the moon, jumping up and down"" at the engagement and ""best friends with Meghan"". ""It's days like this I really miss having her around,"" he added. Ms Markle credited her American background - and lack of exposure to British tabloids - with allowing her to get to know Prince Harry naturally and organically. For his part, the prince had never seen Suits, the American legal drama in which Ms Markle stars, and had never even heard of her before they met. They were both pleasantly surprised by their blind date. ""I was beautifully surprised when I walked into that room and saw her,"" he said. ""I was like, 'I'm really going to have to up my game here'."" What are your experiences of going on a blind date? Tell us your story athaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. The pair also announced that Ms Markle will not continue acting. ""I don't see it as giving anything up. I see it as a change. It's a new chapterâ¦"" she said. ""Now it's time to work as a team with you,"" she said as she turned to Prince Harry. They talked about forging a new role for themselves as a couple, focusing on the humanitarian causes over which they first bonded. The prince said Ms Markle would easily take to the role of being a member of the Royal Family and said they were a ""fantastic team"". The couple are living in Nottingham Cottage - circled above - in the grounds of Kensington Palace The couple described a quiet night at home, cooking a roast chicken together, when the prince surprised Ms Markle by getting down on one knee. Ms Markle described the moment. It was ""just a cosy night... trying to roast a chicken and it just - just an amazing surprise. ""It was so sweet and natural and very romantic,"" she said. And it was an instant ""yes"" from Ms Markle. ""I could barely let you finish proposing, I said - 'can I say yes now'?"" Ms Markle confirmed that one of her two dogs has followed her to London. And Prince Harry revealed the Queen's corgis took to her ""straight away"" when she met the monarch. ""I've spent the last 33 years being barked at,"" he said. ""This one walks in, absolutely nothing...  just wagging tails and I was just like argh."" Ms Markle said the corgis were ""just laying on my feet during tea, it was very sweet"". Prince Harry's brother and sister-in-law, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, are expecting their third child next year. But Ms Markle laughed when Prince Harry's answer to a question about their plans for having children was ""not currently"". The prince added: ""One step at a time and hopefully we'll start a family in the near future.""

New inquests over serial killer deaths,"Port, from London, was given a whole life prison term for the murders of four young men A High Court judge has ordered fresh inquests into the deaths of two men who were murdered by the serial killer Stephen Port. Port was convicted a year agoof murdering Daniel Whitworth, 21, and Gabriel Kovari, 22, in 2014. Their original inquests had recorded open verdicts but the court heard ""new evidence"" had since been uncovered. Quashing the original verdicts, Lord Justice Holroyde said new inquests were ""both necessary and desirable"". The killer the police missed Mr Kovari, originally from Slovakia, was found dead in a churchyard in Barking, east London, on 28 August 2014, three weeks before Mr Whitworth, from Kent, was discovered in the same spot. Daniel Whitworth (left) and Gabriel Kovari were found dead in the same churchyard A fake suicide note found in Mr Whitworth's hand - which had in fact been written by Stephen Port - said he had accidentally killed his lover Mr Kovari and was taking his own life as a result. In fact, the two victims did not know one another. Police accepted the note at face value and treated the deaths as non-suspicious, despite concerns being raised by people close to both men. The court heard that subsequently police had not treated the two deaths as murders, meaning the coroner had lacked key information at the inquests in June 2015. Edward Pleeth, representing the senior coroner for the eastern area of Greater London, said a ""significant amount of new evidence"" had since been uncovered. The graveyard of St Margaret's Church, just yards from Stephen Port's flat in Barking Ruling that new inquests should take place, Lord Justice Holroyde said the coroner had been given ""insufficient"" evidence to give her the ""full picture"" regarding the deaths. He also said it seemed ""surprising"" the original police investigation had ""revealed so little"" about the true circumstances. Port, now 42, also murdered Anthony Walgate, 23, from Hull, and Jack Taylor, 25, from Dagenham. Inquests for those men were suspended pending the criminal trial. The judge said it was ""eminently sensible"" for all four inquests to be held together. Anthony Walgate (left) and Jack Taylor were also murdered by Port Mandy Pearson, step-mother of Daniel Whitworth, said the ruling was ""an important start to getting some of the many wrongs concerning Daniel's death corrected."" Lawyer Andrew Petherbridge, of Hudgell Solicitors and who is representing the four families, said holding the inquests together ""will help identify if institutional failings and discrimination within the Metropolitan Police service played any roles in their deaths"". An investigation by the BBC revealed flaws in the evidence given by police at the original inquests forMr WhitworthandMr Kovari. Seventeen police officers who worked on the original enquiries are under investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission over the murders.

Unmarried woman wins damages battle,"This video can not be played ""It was never about the money... it was about the principle"" A woman has won her legal battle for better rights for unmarried people who lose their long-term partners. NHS worker Jakki Smith, from Chorley, Lancashire, took the government to court for breaching her human rights in denying her bereavement damages. A fixed sum of Â£12,980 is paid out if a person dies as a result of negligence - but only to spouses or civil partners. Her partner of 16 years, John Bulloch, died aged 66 in 2011 after an infection was missed by medics. Mr Bulloch, a former prison governor, underwent the removal of a benign tumour on his right foot in August 2011 and fell ill while on holiday in Turkey. Jakki Smith and John Bulloch were together for 16 years The Court of Appeal allowed Ms Smith's challenge against a High Court ruling dismissing her claim. In court, her legal team had argued the current legislation was in breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. They said the award should be available to anyone who had been in a relationship for at least two years. Her lawyer, Zac Golombeck, said the ruling was a ""historic decision"" and ""long overdue"". The Law Commission previously recommended co-habiting couples should be eligible for bereavement damages and the government also produced a draft bill in 2009, although it was never progressed, he added. Ms Smith, 59, who was not in court, said she was ""over the moon"" as she had found it ""hurtful and unfair"" that her relationship could be considered ""less meaningful"". ""It felt unfair to me because I couldn't have the bereavement damages. I felt they were saying: 'You weren't married, you weren't bereaved, it didn't count'. I wanted it to count. ""John and I had planned a life together, we were in it for the long run and the fact that our bond wasn't recognised, simply because we hadn't chosen to marry, was very upsetting."" Ms Smith, pictured outside court at a previous hearing, said her legal fight was ""never about the money"" Ms Smith said she would not get any money from the decision as there is no possibility of a retrospective payment. Ms Smith said: ""Nothing will bring John back, but he was a firm believer in everyone being treated equally and I think he would have agreed with me that this is worth fighting for. ""Just because John and I hadn't said vows to each other and didn't wear wedding rings didn't mean we weren't completely committed to each other.""My fight has never been for the money, it's about having meaningful relationships recognised. ""I just hope what has happened helps other people who may find themselves in this tragic situation."" Ms Smith said she was ""optimistic and hopeful"" the government would now consider changing the legislation.

UK banks could handle 'disorderly Brexit',"Mark Carney became governor of the Bank of England in 2013 The UK's banks could cope if Britain leaves the European Union in a ""disorderly Brexit"" in 2019, the Bank of England has said. For the first time since the financial crisis, all of the UK's biggest lenders have passed the Bank's stress tests. The tests of adverse economic scenarios discover if the banks could continue to lend money to support the UK economy. Bank governor Mark Carney said they would be able to, even in ""the unlikely event"" of no deal when Brexit happens. Mr Carney said that all parties were working to avoid the situation, but warned that if the UK did leave in a ""sharp, disorderly"" way there would be some economic ""pain"" for households and businesses. The worst case scenario the Bank imagined in the stress tests included a 33% fall in house prices, a rise in interest rates from 0.5% to 4% within two years, and the unemployment rate rising to 9.5% from its current rate of 4.3%. The tests flagged up other Brexit concerns. Six million UK customers buy insurance policies from EU companies and, after Brexit, those firms would not have permission to collect premiums or pay claims. The same is true of the financial insurance that banks buy and sell to each other. Here the numbers are staggering - the notional value of those contracts are Â£26 trillion. Without legislation from both the EU and the UK they may be hard to enforce and that would create financial instability. The Bank of England offered a checklist of items to mitigate the impact of Brexit which included: A clear EU-UK regulatory framework in place Timely agreement on an implementation period Legislation on both sides to preserve continuity of existing cross-border insurance and derivative contracts Michael Snapes, financial services director at PwC, said: ""There is some comfort to be had in the knowledge that the UK banking system is strong enough to withstand a severe economic deterioration. ""The results suggest that the major UK banks may finally be emerging fully from their post-crisis downturn."" The headline of the report sounds comforting - the UK financial system is strong enough to withstand a ""disorderly Brexit"". By that, the Bank means an exit from the EU without a trade deal to replace our current relationship, the introduction of tariff and regulatory barriers and the potential forced relocation of people and businesses from the UK to the EU. So everything is all right then? Er, not quite. What the Bank is actually saying is that the economic shock to the system would be no worse than the economic tests it puts banks through anyway. These economic tests are severe. A 33% fall in house prices, a more than doubling of the unemployment rate, a 25% drop in the pound and a rapid rise in interest rates from 0.5% to 4%. This is a dire economic scenario. All the Bank is saying is that a disorderly Brexit would be no more apocalyptic than that. That is not much comfort. Read more of Simon's blog here. The Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) also said it was increasing the amount that banks had to hold in reserve in case of an economic downturn. Mr Carney said the growth of consumer credit in the UK had created ""pockets of risk"". He said that domestic financial risks and the potential for new global economic issues meant banks should be prepared for further losses. Mr Carney said the FPC was ""taking action to ensure the financial system is resilient to a very broad range of risks"". Both Barclays and RBS, who did not pass the stress tests in a snapshot of their businesses at the end of 2016, had improved their financial positions since then, said the Bank. As a result, both were deemed to have passed the stress tests overall. Lloyds, HSBC, Santander, Nationwide and Standard Chartered were the other lenders who took part. Looking at this year's results, RBS's chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said: ""We continue to make progress towards the stress-resilient bank we aspire to be and 2017 represented another year of material improvement. ""Until we have resolved our remaining major legacy conduct issues and non-core portfolio interests, we will continue to show stress test results weaker than our long term targets."" In a statement, Barclays said: ""Barclays was not asked to submit a revised capital plan by the Bank of England in light of the steps already taken during 2017.""

The graveyard of St Margaret's Church, just yards from Stephen Port's flat in Barking Ruling that new inquests should take place, Lord Justice Holroyde said the coroner had been given ""insufficient"" evidence to give her the ""full picture"" regarding the deaths. He also said it seemed ""surprising"" the original police investigation had ""revealed so little"" about the true circumstances. Port, now 42, also murdered Anthony Walgate, 23, from Hull, and Jack Taylor, 25, from Dagenham. Inquests for those men were suspended pending the criminal trial. The judge said it was ""eminently sensible"" for all four inquests to be held together. Anthony Walgate (left) and Jack Taylor were also murdered by Port Mandy Pearson, step-mother of Daniel Whitworth, said the ruling was ""an important start to getting some of the many wrongs concerning Daniel's death corrected."" Lawyer Andrew Petherbridge, of Hudgell Solicitors and who is representing the four families, said holding the inquests together ""will help identify if institutional failings and discrimination within the Metropolitan Police service played any roles in their deaths"". An investigation by the BBC revealed flaws in the evidence given by police at the original inquests forMr WhitworthandMr Kovari.

Scarlet fever cases hit 50-year highExperts are unable to explain why the contagious disease is on the increase in England.13h13 hours agoHealthComments,"Scarlet fever hit its highest level in England for 50 years, with more than 17,000 cases reported in 2016 - research in the Lancet shows. The disease has been on the rise since 2014, but experts have so far failed to find a reason for the recent increase. Doctors are urging the public to be aware of symptoms, which include a rosy rash, and seek help from their GP. Data for 2017 suggests the rate may be falling, but experts remain cautious, saying it is ""too early to tell"". The bacterial disease, though highly contagious, is not usually serious and can be treated with antibiotics. It is most common among children under 10. A joint investigation by public health authorities from across England and Wales found that the incidence of scarlet fever tripled between 2013 and 2014, rising from 4,700 cases to 15,637 cases. In 2016, there were 19,206 reported cases, the highest level since 1967. The majority of the outbreaks were in England. ""We are concerned - it's quite a dramatic rise,"" said Dr Theresa Lamagni, head of streptococcal surveillance at Public Health England, who led the study. ""We've always seen cases of scarlet fever - it's just the scale in the past has been much lower than the last few years."" Scarlet fever is caused by bacteria known as group A streptococcus, and it is spread through close contact with people carrying the organism - often in the throat - or through contact with objects and surfaces contaminated with the bacterium. Symptoms include a sore throat, headache and fever, accompanied by a red rash that is rough to the touch (sometimes described as 'like sandpaper'). Scarlet fever was a common cause of death in the Victorian era, but had largely been in decline since the introduction of antibiotics. However, prompt treatment remains essential to prevent both the spread of the disease and the risk of further complications such as pneumonia and liver damage. Anyone diagnosed with scarlet fever is advised to stay at home until at least 24 hours after the start of treatment to avoid passing on the infection. There is no vaccine against the disease and all cases must be reported by doctors to the local health authority. Dr Lamagni described the soaring number of cases of scarlet fever as ""baffling"", adding that no underlying causes had been identified. Molecular genetic testing has ruled out a newly emerged strain of the infection, nor was there any suggestion that the disease had become resistant to the penicillin normally used to treat it. She stressed that cases of the disease are ""not any more serious than previously - it's just a question of scale"". Several countries in East Asia have also reported an escalation over the past five years, including Vietnam, China, South Korea, and Hong Kong - but there appears to be ""no clear connection"" between them and England. Typically, natural cyclical patterns of scarlet fever incidence occur every four to six years - the dip in 2017 suggests the cycle may have peaked in 2016. Dr Lamagni said the ""slight decrease"" in the number of cases in England this year might suggest we have ""turned a corner"", but she said the number of cases ""remained high"". A total of 620 outbreaks of the illness were reported in 2016, mostly in schools and nurseries. About one in 40 cases is admitted to hospital, although just over half are discharged the same day. ""We encourage parents to be aware of the symptoms of scarlet fever and to contact their GP if they think their child might have it,"" said Dr Lamagni. In Scotland, scarlet fever is more difficult to track because doctors are no longer obliged to notify their local health authority of any outbreak. ""We use upper respiratory tract group A streptococcal laboratory detections, the bacteria that causes scarlet fever, as an indicator of the level of scarlet fever in the community,"" an NHS Scotland spokesman said. ""These bacteria are currently slightly higher than expected levels for this time of year in Scotland.""

Investigations into stillbirths promisedAll families who suffer stillbirth or life-changing injuries to their babies will be offered investigations.,"The NHS in England must do better at learning from mistakes to cut the number of baby deaths and injuries in childbirth, the health secretary says. There are an estimated 1,000 cases a year where babies unexpectedly die or are left with severe brain injury. That is out of nearly 700,000 births, which, Mr Hunt said, showed the NHS provided safe care for most. But, he added, all unexplained cases of serious harm or death would now be independently investigated. The Healthcare Safety Investigations Branch, set up earlier this year, will be tasked with reviewing cases. The Â£97m bill for 'midwife shortage' Number of UK nurses and midwives falling Unveiling the new plans, Mr Hunt said he hoped this would help the NHS learn from mistakes as part of the drive to halve the overall rate of stillbirths, deaths and brain injuries by 2025 - five years earlier than previously announced. The target was initially set in 2015 amid concern that while there had been progress on reducing cases, the improvement had not been as fast as some western countries. But Mr Hunt conceded staffing numbers would also have to increase. It comes as an NHS-backed review of deaths in cases where the baby was seemingly healthy as labour began found in 80% of cases improvements in care could have prevented the death. Staffing and heavy workload was highlighted as a key issue by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership report. Sarah and Jack Hawkins believe if previous stillborn deaths had been investigated, their baby may have survived Sarah Hawkins' pregnancy had gone well. But during her labour Sarah was told that her baby, Harriet, had died. Nottingham University Hospitals Trust initially said it was because of an infection, but after Sarah and her husband Jack, who both worked at the trust, fought for an external review the full picture came to light. There had been gross errors and mismanagement coupled with intense pressure on services. One of the maternity units run by the trust had had to close its doors to new admissions because of under staffing. When she was admitted, opportunities were missed to identify problems early enough. Staff failed to diagnose she was in active labour, made mistakes monitoring the baby's heartbeat and did not respond quickly enough when the situation became critical. The trust later admitted if it was not for the shortcomings Harriet could have survived and apologised for the ""unimaginable distress and sadness caused"". Sarah said: ""It's taken us 19 months to get an external, independent review. We've been trying to find answers for our daughter and it shouldn't be us trying to fight. ""It has had such a significant mental and physical impact on our mental wellbeing."" The health secretary said there were ""not enough staff across the whole NHS"" and that would be addressed by a major expansion in training places in the coming years. But he also said there were steps that could be taken now to improve the way the health service dealt with mistakes. ""We make it really difficult for the NHS to learn what happened and to spread the message about what needs to be done differently next time. ""People are worried about lawyers, regulation and being fired by their own trust. We have to change a blame culture into a learning culture."" He said key to this would be the move to get the new Healthcare Safety Investigations Branch to automatically look at all cases of potentially avoidable harm. Currently it is up to local hospitals to investigate cases or for parents to bring clinical negligence cases. Mr Hunt said he hoped the move would give parents quick answers and ensure learning was shared across the NHS, which in turn would help curb the growing bill for settling clinical negligence claims relating to babies with brain injuries. An average of two claims a week are being settled at the moment, with each case costing millions of pounds in lifetime care for these babies. Mr Hunt also said the government would look into changing the law to allow coroners to investigate full-term stillbirths - currently they cannot do this, with some parents saying deaths have been classified as stillbirths to avoid the need for an inquest. Royal College of Midwives general secretary Gill Walton welcomed the measures being taken. But she added the findings on staffing levels were ""concerning"" - the union believes the NHS in England is 3,000 midwives short of what it needs. ""The increasing complexity of women being cared for in our maternity services exacerbates this issue,"" she said. ""We must ensure we have enough midwives and obstetricians to provide safe care throughout the maternity pathway and adequate facilities in all birth settings.""

Stella McCartney says fashion 'wasteful'The designer backs a report that claims half of High Street fashion is thrown away within a year.16m17 minutes agoBusiness,"Stella McCartney is calling for radical changes to the ""incredibly wasteful"" fashion industry. The designer is backing a report by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation which claims half of High Street fashion is disposed of within a year. It also says the amount of clothing bought has doubled in 15 years,  but the number of times an item is worn has fallen by 20%. The report is backed by industry giants including H&M and Nike. ""Today's textile industry is built on an outdated linear, take-make-dispose model and is hugely wasteful and polluting,"" said Dame Ellen MacArthur, a round-the-world sailor and environmental campaigner. The report by her foundation says that 50% of the clothes sent for landfill in the UK could be recycled. Victoria Beckham fashions Â£30m investment Kendall Jenner named highest paid model Other environmental effects include the depositing in the ocean of half a million tonnes of tiny synthetic fibres, which cannot be cleaned up. As a result, the foundation says that we could end up eating our own clothes as they re-enter the food chain. Stella McCartney said: ""What really excites me about [the report] is that it provides solutions to an industry that is incredibly wasteful and harmful to the environment. "" The report has a list of suggestions as to how to change the way clothing is produced to make it more sustainable: Phase out substances of concern and create safer materials Transform the way clothes are designed, sold and used to break free from their increasingly disposable nature Radically improve recycling by transforming clothing design, collection and reprocessing Make effective use of resources and move to renewable inputs The report taps into a growing move among consumers towards more sustainable living. In a recent survey by consultants Kantar Futures, 80% of respondents said they would pay more for products that lasted longer. ""Consumers are placing greater importance on the long-term benefits of a product, rather than cost-saving options that are seemingly more disposable,"" said J Walker Smith from Kantar Futures. But market research firm Mintel said good intentions did not always result in a change in behaviour. Its research suggests that 80% of women aged 16-24 were mainly looking for low prices.

Profumo 'had relationship with Nazi spy',"Gisela Winegard and John Profumo met in Oxford in the 1930s, before she started working for German intelligence Tory minister John Profumo - who resigned over a notorious 1960s sex scandal - had a relationship with a Nazi spy, declassified records suggest. MI5 documents suggest he had a relationship with German model Gisela Winegard in Oxford in the early 1930s. Dr Stephen Twigge from the National Archives said this could have exposed him to blackmail. In 1963 Profumo resigned as a minister after it was revealed he lied to MPs about his affair with Christine Keeler. The declassified papers - published on Tuesday - were compiled by MI6, the UK's foreign intelligence service, and then given to MI5, the domestic branch of the secret services, at the height of the so-called Profumo Affair. In the letters, Winegard's American husband Edward - who was her jailer when she was convicted of espionage - claimed that the couple separated in 1950 because of her ""endearing letters from John Denis Profumo... written on House of Commons notepaper"". Secret Service papers state Profumo wrote to Winegard while he was an MP. This video can not be played A brief explanation of the complexities of the Profumo affair In the early 1960s John Profumo, then the Conservative secretary of state for war, had a two-year affair with model Christine Keeler, who was also having a relationship with Russian military attache Yevgeny Ivanov. In March 1963 he told the House of Commons there was no ""impropriety"" in their relationship after being asked about it by opposition MPs who said they were concerned about the national security implications. However, more newspaper stories emerged and Profumo eventually admitted lying to the House, resigning from the cabinet and the Commons, and devoting the rest of his life to charity work. His fall from grace is often considered a contributory factor to the fall of the MacMillan government. Labour would win under Harold Wilson's leadership in 1964. A classic Westminster scandal The documents claim that the fashion model - whose maiden name was Klein - worked for German intelligence during World War Two. Profumo, who was MP for Kettering from 1940 to 1945 and then for Stratford-upon-Avon, told MI5 about the spy in a memo in 1941, where he admitted to meeting her in 1936 ""and got to know her well"". ""Lady Astor is alleged to have expressed the opinion that she was a spy,"" he added. MI5 documents unveil the extent of the Secret Service's probe in to John Profumo's life at the height of the 1963 sex scandal The file adds that Winegard was rejected for a UK visa in 1951 as it was thought she had ""recently engaged in blackmail activities"". ""Jack Profumo, MP for South Cattering [sic]"" was named as a reference on the visa. Dr Stephen Twigge, head of the Modern Collections section at the National Archive said Profumo ""sounded like he was vulnerable to blackmail."" ""He wrote to Gisela Winegard in Tangiers and her husband found letters from Profumo on House of Commons note paper in their apartment."" This video can not be played Dr Steven Twigge of the National Archives discusses Profumo's affairs ""It was enough for the MI6 head of station in Tangiers to be alarmed."" However a historian who has written on the case challenged the idea that Profumo could have been blackmailed. Richard Davenport-Hines, author of ""An English Affair: Sex, Class and Power in the Age of Profumo,external""  said: ""Profumo was a man of the world, rich, handsome and charismatic, who was very open about his sex life. ""As a junior backbencher, he would not have been a security risk in the 1950s. ""He was also a single man when this happened."" Winegard was imprisoned for espionage after the Allies liberated Paris in 1944, marrying Edward on her release in 1950. She had run a secret information service for German intelligence in Paris under the guise of a ""commercial information bureau"". She was also the mistress of a high-ranking German officer, having a child with him. After the war she came to the attention of the US Secret Service and was accused of harbouring the on-the-run chief of a German spy ring while living in the south of France. The records also show she was sacked from the Voice of America radio station in Tangier in 1950 when her ""pro-German sympathies"" were revealed. The Profumo affair.

Chennai Six released from Indian jail,"This video can not be played Cameras were there to film the men's release from prison Six British former soldiers have been released from an Indian prison four years after being arrested and detained on weapons charges. The so-called Chennai Six, who had been guards on a ship to combat piracy in the Indian Ocean,won an appeal against their convictionson Monday. They have now been escorted out of Chennai Central Prison by British consulate officials. They said they were discussing the next step with the Indian authorities. The Chennai Six: What is their story? Lawyers representing the men say they will have to spend some more time in India before they can expect to return home. The first picture of Billy Irving, from Argyll, after his release from an Indian prison The men were working on the anti-piracy ship MV Seaman Guard Ohio, owned by the US-based company AdvanFort, when they were arrested in 2013. They are: Nick Dunn from Ashington, Northumberland Billy Irvingfrom Connel, Argyll Ray Tindall from Chester Paul Towers from Pocklington, East Yorkshire John Armstrong from Wigton, Cumbria Nicholas Simpson from Catterick, North Yorkshire They were held along with three Ukrainians, 14 Estonians and 12 Indians when customs officials and police found weapons and ammunition on board, which Indian authorities said had not been properly declared. (From top left, clockwise) Nick Dunn, Paul Towers, Nick Simpson, Ray Tindall, John Armstrong and Billy Irving Initially the charges were quashed when the men argued the weapons were lawfully held for anti-piracy purposes and the paperwork, issued by the UK government, was in order. But a lower court reinstated the prosecution and in January 2016 they were sentenced to five years in prison. The men's families welcomed the acquittal, and some have already spoken to their relatives. Billy Irving's partner, Yvonne McHugh, said that when his call came through as a private number she assumed it was another press call. ""Then it was his amazing voice at the end of the phone,"" she added. ""He just said hello and I screamed down the phone. Then he just said 'I'm out'. ""He's free. He's actually out of that prison for good. It's just the most phenomenal news I could ever have got.""

""Oh, that was absolutely gorgeous to listen to him, I started crying. It was just so lovely to talk to him because there's no communication at all while they're in jail. It's letters or parcels, you can't do anything else. ""Oh it'll be such a good present to have Christmas. It'll be lovely."" Ray Tindall's mother, Carole Edwards, said: ""It was just so lovely to talk to him because there's no communication at all while they're in jail."" Joanne Thomlinson, the sister of John Armstrong, said: ""As ecstatic as we all are at them being released, there are going to be emotional issues around that and it is going to be difficult for them to adapt. ""And as well it's not a case that they're on a plane straight home... they're yet again going to have to stay in India while the paper work gets sorted and I think that's quite difficult for them, because they've done that before in 2014 they were released from prison and had to stay in India."" A British consulate spokesman said: ""The government shares their happiness. ""We are working with the Indian authorities to discuss the next step and we will continue to offer the men and their families consular assistance for as long as needed.""

"Breaking|Breaking newsIrish deputy PM 'to resign'Irish deputy prime minister Frances Fitzgerald is set to resign, Irish broadcaster RTÃ says.7m7 minutes agoEurope","Frances Fitzgerald had been at the centre of a controversy which could have resulted in a snap election Ireland's deputy prime minister Frances Fitzgerald has said she is resigning for the sake of the country, averting a snap general election. She had been under pressure over a police whistleblower scandal that could have brought down the government. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said he had accepted her resignation with ""deep regret"". She quit hours before a motion of no confidence in her was to be proposed by the main opposition party, Fianna FÃ¡il. Leo Varadkar: Frances Fitzgerald has 'done nothing wrong' Origins of the Garda McCabe whistleblower controversy There were fears that an Irish election could have complicated next month's EU meeting, at which the Republic of Ireland's position will influence the assessment of the UK's progress in Brexit talks. According to Irish broadcaster, RTÃ, Ms Fitzgerald told a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday that she was not asked or forced to resign, but took the decision herself. ""I believe it is necessary to take this decision to avoid an unwelcome and potentially destabilising general election at this historically critical time,"" she said. ""Throughout my career I have always sought to act with integrity and responsibility, and that is why I have decided on this occasion to put the national interest ahead of my own personal reputation."" She had been under pressure to resign because of her inaction in supporting a Garda whistleblower, Sgt Maurice McCabe, whom she had publicly defended in her former role as Irish justice minister. Ms Fitzgerald held the dual roles of tÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) and minister for business, enterprise and innovation. Speaking in the DÃ¡il (Irish Parliament) on Tuesday, Mr Varadkar described her as an ""exemplary member of government and a loyal colleague"". This video can not be played ""I don't think there's any long-term damage to the government,"" says Fine Gael MEP Brian Hayes He defended her handling of the McCabe case and added that as minister she had enshrined a code of ethics in An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na to protect officers who reported wrongdoing. Mr Varadkar confirmed that he had accepted her resignation with deep regret and told the DÃ¡il that a good woman was leaving office without getting a fair hearing. ""In the past few days a drip-drip of information may have made certain things seem greater than they are,"" he said. ""There was a feeding frenzy, and it became impossible for her to get a fair hearing based on the full facts."" The taoiseach added that he had advised the president to accept her resignation and he will personally take over her brief as minister for business, for a short time. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin had been in talks over the weekend The taoiseach said he expects Ms Fitzgerald ""to continue to play a full role in political and public life, including at the highest level into the future"". He described her as ""one of the most reforming ministers we have ever had"". The Department of Justice's secretary general Noel Waters, who had been due to retire in February, said he was leaving the role on Tuesday. Last week, it was revealed that Ms Fitzgerald hadbeen told of an attempt to discredit Sgt Maurice McCabe by lawyers for the Garda commissionerat a commission of enquiry a year earlier than she had previously admitted. She said she had forgotten the email and was precluded from acting on legal advice. The publication of further emails on Monday showed she had been aware of the attempt to discredit the whistleblower on one other occasion and was seen by many in her Fine Gael party as undermining her position. Police whistleblower Sgt Maurice McCabe was the subject of false allegations after he spoke out about corruption The Irish government is currently led by Mr Varadkar's Fine Gael party, but his cabinet includes a number of independent ministers and the coalition also depends on the support of the main opposition party, Fianna FÃ¡il. The coalition came to power in 2016, after a bruising general election in which no single party won enough seats to govern alone. Fianna FÃ¡il agreed to support the minority governmentfor three budgets and in confidence motions, but the whistleblower controversy has tested that agreement. If Fianna FÃ¡il's proposed vote of no confidence in Ms Fitzgerald had passed, another election may have been unavoidable.

Ireland talks aim to avoid snap electionCalls for Ireland's deputy PM to resign could derail the coalition ahead of a key EU summit.9h9 hours agoEurope,"Frances Fitzgerald was Irish minister for justice during a police whistleblower controversy The leaders of Ireland's two main political parties are holding crisis talks on Tuesday in an attempt to avoid a snap general election. Calls for Ireland's deputy prime minister to resign over a controversy involving a police whistleblower could end a deal between the parties. Fianna FÃ¡il abstains in key votes to allow the biggest party, Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael, to lead a ruling coalition. It comes ahead of an EU summit in which Ireland will play a major role. If an election is called, there are fears that it could complicate next month's EU meeting, at which Ireland's position will influence the assessment of the UK's progress in Brexit talks. Revelations about a plan to discredit a police whistleblower during an inquiry have led opposition parties to call for the tanaiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Frances Fitzgerald to resign over her handling of the affair. Irish government 'new politics' era survives first year Fianna FÃ¡il agrees to back minority Fine Gael government On Monday,documents revealed that Ms Fitzgerald had received a letter from an official discussing what was described as an aggressive stance towards the whistleblower,external. At the time she was the Irish minster for justice. She faces a vote of no confidence in the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) on Tuesday. However, a spokesperson for the government said it retained full confidence in Ms Fitzgerald. The dispute has created a political crisis and if the parties fail to reach an agreement then it could force a general election before Christmas. Both parties have said that they want to avoid a poll. Mr Varadkar, Ireland's taoiseach (prime minister), would still travel to the EU summit next month which will decide whether the Brexit talks will move onto the next phase. Audit reveals Garda irregularities Timeline: The Garda McCabe whistleblower controversy In 2015, the O'Higgins Commission was established by the government to examine malpractice allegations in the Garda's (Irish police) Cavan/Monaghan division. On Monday evening, it was revealed that the now tÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) was personally sent a letter from one of her officials in July 2015, which discussed the ""aggressive stance towards Sgt Maurice McCabe at the commission"". The letter is one of a number of documents published by the department of justice from a record trawl requested by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Garda Commissioner Noirin O'Sullivan retired in September In a series of tweets on Monday evening, Ms Fitzgerald wrote: ""As Justice Minister I could not interfere with the O'Higgins Commission. This is confirmed twice in today's docs & has been confirmed by the Attorney General."" A judge-led tribunal is also being held to establish whether senior Garda officers were involved in an alleged smear campaign against whistleblower Sgt Maurice McCabe. Ms Fitzgerald also wrote: ""The Tribunal will objectively judge the appropriateness of my conduct. I look forward to giving my evidence to the Tribunal early in January."" Allow Twitter content?

Skeletons found on Japan 'ghost ship',"Japanese authorities are trying to identify eight people whose badly decomposed remains were found on a wooden boat that washed up on a beach. The discovery took place in the northern Akita prefecture. It comes days aftera group of men claiming to be North Korean fishermen washed onshore in the same area. Crew-less boats or vessels with bodies on board, known as ""ghost ships"" and thought to be North Korean fishing boats, regularly wash up in Japan. They have usually been found on the western coast, which faces North Korea. The 'North Korea ghost boats' washing up on Japan In the latest incident, Japanese broadcaster NHK said the boat, measuring about 7m (23ft) long, was found on a beach near Oga city on Sunday. The vessel was missing a rotor blade and navigational devices. On Monday officials found the remains of eight people, some reduced to bones, while inspecting the boat. Kyodo news agency reported that the coast guard suspected the boat and its occupants had come from North Korea. The discovery is the latest in a string of similar incidents. On Friday, a wooden boat carrying eight men - alive and in reasonably good health - washed up at Yurihonjo city. The boat found last week had bare light bulbs commonly used to attract fish at night The men said they were North Koreans fishing for squid, who had ended up drifting into Japanese waters when their boat experienced difficulties. Reuters news agency reported that two bodies were also found over the weekend at Sado island, with a pack of North Korean cigarettes and other belongings with Korean lettering. Japan regularly sees North Korean fishing boats straying into its territory, and its coastguard has occasionally had to rescue fishermen. The BBC's Celia Hatton says the appearance of ""ghost ships"" is thought to be a consequence of North Korea's attempts to satisfy hunger by demanding huge quotas of seafood. That forces fishermen to board aging ill-equipped vessels and to venture far out to sea, with no equipment to issue a distress call if their boats run into trouble, says our correspondent.

Man arrested over Melbourne 'terror plot',"Ali Khalif Shire Ali allegedly planned to target New Year's Eve celebrations in Melbourne Australian police have arrested a man they allege was planning to carry out a terror attack during New Year's Eve celebrations in Melbourne. Ali Khalif Shire Ali, 20, will be charged with terrorism offences that carry a maximum penalty of life in prison, authorities said. Police allege he had planned to shoot people with an automatic gun at Federation Square in the city's centre. There is no ongoing threat to the public, police said. Last year, about 500,000 people celebrated New Year's Eve in Melbourne's city centre. Authorities said Mr Ali was born in Australia to Somali parents and had been monitored by police as a ""person of interest"" since January. They said he had not obtained an automatic weapon before his arrest in Werribee, a Melbourne suburb, on Monday. ""What we will be alleging is that he was intending to use a firearm to shoot and kill as many people as he could,"" Victoria police deputy commissioner Shane Patton said on Tuesday. ""This is a person who would become particularly energised, for a lack of a better word, when overseas [terrorism] events occurred and would express a great deal of interest in committing an attack himself."" Australia PM seeks 14-day detention law Australia adopts UK-style security model Mr Ali had obtained an al-Qaeda manual online with instructions for staging a terrorist attack, and was a sympathiser of so-called Islamic State, according to police. Mr Patton said he had connections with extremists but was believed to be acting alone. No further arrests were expected. Search warrants were executed at Mr Ali's home, a business where he had worked, and a relative's property. The arrest was not linked to previous operations, police said. Last year,police said they had foiled a major terror attack planned for Christmas Dayin Melbourne, with Federation Square also among its alleged targets. Australian police have charged 74 people in counter-terrorism investigations since 2014, when the nation's terror threat level was raised to ""probable"".

We must do better on baby deaths - Hunt,"The NHS in England must do better at learning from mistakes to cut the number of baby deaths and injuries in childbirth, the health secretary says. There are an estimated 1,000 cases a year where babies unexpectedly die or are left with severe brain injury. That is out of nearly 700,000 births, which, Mr Hunt said, showed the NHS provided safe care for most. But, he added, all unexplained cases of serious harm or death would now be independently investigated. The Healthcare Safety Investigations Branch, set up earlier this year, will be tasked with reviewing cases. The Â£97m bill for 'midwife shortage' Number of UK nurses and midwives falling Unveiling the new plans, Mr Hunt said he hoped this would help the NHS learn from mistakes as part of the drive to halve the overall rate of stillbirths, deaths and brain injuries by 2025 - five years earlier than previously announced. The target was initially set in 2015 amid concern that while there had been progress on reducing cases, the improvement had not been as fast as some western countries. But Mr Hunt conceded staffing numbers would also have to increase. It comes as an NHS-backed review of deaths in cases where the baby was seemingly healthy as labour began found in 80% of cases improvements in care could have prevented the death. Staffing and heavy workload was highlighted as a key issue by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership report. Sarah and Jack Hawkins believe if previous stillborn deaths had been investigated, their baby may have survived Sarah Hawkins' pregnancy had gone well. But during her labour Sarah was told that her baby, Harriet, had died. Nottingham University Hospitals Trust initially said it was because of an infection, but after Sarah and her husband Jack, who both worked at the trust, fought for an external review the full picture came to light. There had been gross errors and mismanagement coupled with intense pressure on services. One of the maternity units run by the trust had had to close its doors to new admissions because of under staffing. When she was admitted, opportunities were missed to identify problems early enough. Staff failed to diagnose she was in active labour, made mistakes monitoring the baby's heartbeat and did not respond quickly enough when the situation became critical. The trust later admitted if it was not for the shortcomings Harriet could have survived and apologised for the ""unimaginable distress and sadness caused"". Sarah said: ""It's taken us 19 months to get an external, independent review. We've been trying to find answers for our daughter and it shouldn't be us trying to fight. ""It has had such a significant mental and physical impact on our mental wellbeing."" The health secretary said there were ""not enough staff across the whole NHS"" and that would be addressed by a major expansion in training places in the coming years. But he also said there were steps that could be taken now to improve the way the health service dealt with mistakes. ""We make it really difficult for the NHS to learn what happened and to spread the message about what needs to be done differently next time. ""People are worried about lawyers, regulation and being fired by their own trust. We have to change a blame culture into a learning culture."" He said key to this would be the move to get the new Healthcare Safety Investigations Branch to automatically look at all cases of potentially avoidable harm. Currently it is up to local hospitals to investigate cases or for parents to bring clinical negligence cases. Mr Hunt said he hoped the move would give parents quick answers and ensure learning was shared across the NHS, which in turn would help curb the growing bill for settling clinical negligence claims relating to babies with brain injuries. An average of two claims a week are being settled at the moment, with each case costing millions of pounds in lifetime care for these babies. Mr Hunt also said the government would look into changing the law to allow coroners to investigate full-term stillbirths - currently they cannot do this, with some parents saying deaths have been classified as stillbirths to avoid the need for an inquest. Royal College of Midwives general secretary Gill Walton welcomed the measures being taken. But she added the findings on staffing levels were ""concerning"" - the union believes the NHS in England is 3,000 midwives short of what it needs. ""The increasing complexity of women being cared for in our maternity services exacerbates this issue,"" she said. ""We must ensure we have enough midwives and obstetricians to provide safe care throughout the maternity pathway and adequate facilities in all birth settings.""

Ireland talks aim to avoid snap election,"Frances Fitzgerald was Irish minister for justice during a police whistleblower controversy The leaders of Ireland's two main political parties are holding crisis talks on Tuesday in an attempt to avoid a snap general election. Calls for Ireland's deputy prime minister to resign over a controversy involving a police whistleblower could end a deal between the parties. Fianna FÃ¡il abstains in key votes to allow the biggest party, Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael, to lead a ruling coalition. It comes ahead of an EU summit in which Ireland will play a major role. If an election is called, there are fears that it could complicate next month's EU meeting, at which Ireland's position will influence the assessment of the UK's progress in Brexit talks. Revelations about a plan to discredit a police whistleblower during an inquiry have led opposition parties to call for the tanaiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Frances Fitzgerald to resign over her handling of the affair. Irish government 'new politics' era survives first year Fianna FÃ¡il agrees to back minority Fine Gael government On Monday,documents revealed that Ms Fitzgerald had received a letter from an official discussing what was described as an aggressive stance towards the whistleblower,external. At the time she was the Irish minster for justice. She faces a vote of no confidence in the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) on Tuesday. However, a spokesperson for the government said it retained full confidence in Ms Fitzgerald. The dispute has created a political crisis and if the parties fail to reach an agreement then it could force a general election before Christmas. Both parties have said that they want to avoid a poll. Mr Varadkar, Ireland's taoiseach (prime minister), would still travel to the EU summit next month which will decide whether the Brexit talks will move onto the next phase. Audit reveals Garda irregularities Timeline: The Garda McCabe whistleblower controversy In 2015, the O'Higgins Commission was established by the government to examine malpractice allegations in the Garda's (Irish police) Cavan/Monaghan division. On Monday evening, it was revealed that the now tÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) was personally sent a letter from one of her officials in July 2015, which discussed the ""aggressive stance towards Sgt Maurice McCabe at the commission"". The letter is one of a number of documents published by the department of justice from a record trawl requested by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Garda Commissioner Noirin O'Sullivan retired in September In a series of tweets on Monday evening, Ms Fitzgerald wrote: ""As Justice Minister I could not interfere with the O'Higgins Commission. This is confirmed twice in today's docs & has been confirmed by the Attorney General."" A judge-led tribunal is also being held to establish whether senior Garda officers were involved in an alleged smear campaign against whistleblower Sgt Maurice McCabe. Ms Fitzgerald also wrote: ""The Tribunal will objectively judge the appropriateness of my conduct. I look forward to giving my evidence to the Tribunal early in January."" Allow Twitter content?

Last week, Ms Fitzgerald faced questions in the DÃ¡il over an email she was sent by former Garda (Police)Commissioner, NoirÃ­n O'Sullivan, which outlined the legal strategy to be pursued against Sgt Maurice McCabe. Ms Fitzgerald said she could not remember reading it. However, she recently admitted she was made aware a year earlier than she had previously stated, that lawyers for the garda were going to attempt to discredit Sgt McCabe. Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin said the situation would be resolved if Ms Fitzgerald resigned On Sunday, it alsoemerged that NoirÃ­n O'Sullivan had discussed the controversial legal action relating to Mr McCabe in a phone call with a senior member of the department of justice in May 2015.

Volcanic ash keeps Bali airport shut,"Thousands of travellers have been stranded by the airport closure Indonesian officials have shut the international airport in Bali for a second day, as Mount Agung spews volcanic ash into the atmosphere. Massive plumes of dark ash were seen reaching as high as 3km (2 miles) above the summit of the rumbling volcano, which began erupting last week. Officials raised the alert to the highest level on Monday, fearing an imminent major eruption. Up to 100,000 people have been ordered to evacuate the vicinity. Volcanic ash can damage aeroplane engines or even cause them to fail, and also clogs fuel and cooling systems. Pilot visibility can also be hampered. Feared volcano has Bali on alert What does volcanic ash do to planes? In pictures:Prayers and preparations The Transportation Ministry initially closed the Ngurah Rai (Denpasar) airport on Monday morning for 24 hours, cancelling more than 400 flights and stranding 59,000 travellers. On Tuesday, they announced they would extend the closure to Wednesday 07:00 local time (00:00 GMT). This video can not be played We ask an expert: Is a large volcanic eruption inevitable? Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's national disaster agency, said that the ash was being drawn southwest - towards Bali's main airport - by a tropical cyclone in the Indian Ocean. Story behind the spectacular pictures Bali tourism hit by volcano threat The airport on neighbouring Lombok island however has been re-opened, he added. Authorities have also arranged for buses to take tourists to ferry terminals. The volcano is about 70km from the popular tourist areas of Kuta and Seminyak. The disaster agencysaid in a separate statement (in Indonesian),externalthat as of Tuesday morning, the volcano was still emitting thick ash clouds and that ""rays of flares from the glowing lava"" were also observed overnight. Besides ash,streams of rock mixed with water known as lahar,externalhave also been spotted flowing down from the mountain. Officials have warned people to stay away from them. Face masks are also being distributed to help residents cope with the continuous ash fall Officials have told everyone living in a 10km exclusion zone around the volcano to evacuate. Mr Sutopo said that officials faced difficulties estimating the exact number of evacuees given varying population data, but they believe between 90,000 and 100,000 people needed to leave. So far, only 29,000 people had moved to shelters, while others have fled to other places like Lombok, he said. Still, there were ""many people"" who have remained, as some still feel safe while others are unwilling to leave their cattle and fields, he said. Authorities have warned thatthey may forcibly evacuate peopleif they do not move to shelters soon. Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Bali A large banner reads: ""You're entering active volcanic hazard zone."" But looking around, you wouldn't know. Just behind the sign Seriyani is selling flowers for offers to the Balinese Hindu gods. She says she is worried, but needs to stay here and work to feed the family. ""When it really erupts I will run,"" she says with a nervous laugh. Further in the exclusion zone we find a school open. Here the teacher is showing the children how to put on simple surgical masks. To protect them from the ash, the headmaster tells me. The volcano has been rumbling for weeks now he says so they don't want to move yet and be left in limbo. Authorities say they will force people to evacuate. But those still on the mountain haven't heard that. Are you in the area? Have your travel plans been affected? What are conditions like currently?

Poisoning threat to red kite revival,"The red kite (Milvus milvus) is declining throughout Europe The red kite has become more common in the past 30 years in the UK, thanks to conservation schemes. But, while numbers of the birds of prey are on the rise, scientists say human factors threaten to derail progress. Post-mortem tests on wild red kites show many have been poisoned by lead shot, rat poison or pesticides. The study, published in theEuropean Journal of Wildlife Research, suggests poisoning of red kites may be slowing their rate of recovery in England. Dr Jenny Jaffe of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), who worked on the study, said birds of prey, and especially scavengers, eat animals that contain lead shot, leading to lead poisoning. ''That can be changed by changing the shot gun cartridges to non lead, which a lot of countries do,'' she told BBC News. ''And, there is some legislation already in the UK, but it is very limited.'' Another threat - pesticide poisoning - is ''mostly deliberate'', she said, caused by baiting of bird or rabbit carcasses. ''You'll find red kites that are in good body condition that have died very suddenly and where toxicology shows that they have high levels of pesticides,'' said Dr Jaffe. ''It might not per se be focussed on red kites specifically, but the people who put out these poisons are focussed on killing predators of their, for example, game birds or livestock.'' In the study, scientists carried out detailed post mortems and toxicological analysis on 110 red kites found dead between 1989 and 2007, when the birds were being re-introduced at four sites in England. Of these, 32 had been poisoned by rodenticides, other pesticides and lead. However, the researchers say there are simple ways to prevent poisoning, including: Best practice in controlling rodents Tackling the illegal use of pesticides The use of non-toxic alternatives to lead ammunition. The red kite feeds mainly on carrion and small mammals or birds RSPB head of nature policy Jeff Knott described the research as ''a worrying development''. He said the bird has been at the heart of one of the UK's greatest conservation success stories, going from the brink of extinction to a common sight in many parts of the UK, in the past 30 years. ''Poisons shouldn't always be the first port of call, as there are other methods of rodent control, such as traps, that are effective and reduce the risk to other species,'' he explained. ''It is therefore vital that government continues to fund monitoring schemes to keep a close eye on the impacts that poison is having on other wildlife."" The red kite was saved from extinction in England and Scotland by schemes to re-introduce the bird into the wild. The UK population has increased in recent decades, and is estimated to number upwards of 3,000 breeding pairs. The IUCN lists the red kite is listed as Near Threatened in Europe, where it is experiencing a population decline, owing mostly to poisoning from pesticides and persecution, and changes in land-use. Dr Matt Ellis, of the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, said that while red kite populations are declining across southern Europe, the population in the UK is growing faster than in any other country. ""This is no reason to be complacent and we support evidence-based approaches to tackling the greatest risks to these birds, including the 28% that die from physical trauma such as electrocution from power lines and collisions with vehicles,'' he said. ""Any bird dying from lead poisoning is an avoidable death and we are working to produce and promote best practice guidance on the ways to mitigate these risks. "" He said since red kites scavenge carrion it was important that every conceivable effort was made to collect all shot birds or rabbits. However, he said with lead poisoning implicated in only a minority of deaths ""it would be a scandalous waste of precious conservation resources"" to focus on this. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

Clean bill of health for UK banks,"Mark Carney became governor of the Bank of England in 2013 The UK's banks could cope if Britain leaves the European Union in a ""disorderly Brexit"" in 2019, the Bank of England has said. For the first time since the financial crisis, all of the UK's biggest lenders have passed the Bank's stress tests. The tests of adverse economic scenarios discover if the banks could continue to lend money to support the UK economy. Bank governor Mark Carney said they would be able to, even in ""the unlikely event"" of no deal when Brexit happens. Mr Carney said that all parties were working to avoid the situation, but warned that if the UK did leave in a ""sharp, disorderly"" way there would be some economic ""pain"" for households and businesses. The worst case scenario the Bank imagined in the stress tests included a 33% fall in house prices, a rise in interest rates from 0.5% to 4% within two years, and the unemployment rate rising to 9.5% from its current rate of 4.3%. The tests flagged up other Brexit concerns. Six million UK customers buy insurance policies from EU companies and, after Brexit, those firms would not have permission to collect premiums or pay claims. The same is true of the financial insurance that banks buy and sell to each other. Here the numbers are staggering - the notional value of those contracts are Â£26 trillion. Without legislation from both the EU and the UK they may be hard to enforce and that would create financial instability. The Bank of England offered a checklist of items to mitigate the impact of Brexit which included: A clear EU-UK regulatory framework in place Timely agreement on an implementation period Legislation on both sides to preserve continuity of existing cross-border insurance and derivative contracts Michael Snapes, financial services director at PwC, said: ""There is some comfort to be had in the knowledge that the UK banking system is strong enough to withstand a severe economic deterioration. ""The results suggest that the major UK banks may finally be emerging fully from their post-crisis downturn."" The headline of the report sounds comforting - the UK financial system is strong enough to withstand a ""disorderly Brexit"". By that, the Bank means an exit from the EU without a trade deal to replace our current relationship, the introduction of tariff and regulatory barriers and the potential forced relocation of people and businesses from the UK to the EU. So everything is all right then? Er, not quite. What the Bank is actually saying is that the economic shock to the system would be no worse than the economic tests it puts banks through anyway. These economic tests are severe. A 33% fall in house prices, a more than doubling of the unemployment rate, a 25% drop in the pound and a rapid rise in interest rates from 0.5% to 4%. This is a dire economic scenario. All the Bank is saying is that a disorderly Brexit would be no more apocalyptic than that. That is not much comfort. Read more of Simon's blog here. The Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) also said it was increasing the amount that banks had to hold in reserve in case of an economic downturn. Mr Carney said the growth of consumer credit in the UK had created ""pockets of risk"". He said that domestic financial risks and the potential for new global economic issues meant banks should be prepared for further losses. Mr Carney said the FPC was ""taking action to ensure the financial system is resilient to a very broad range of risks"". Both Barclays and RBS, who did not pass the stress tests in a snapshot of their businesses at the end of 2016, had improved their financial positions since then, said the Bank. As a result, both were deemed to have passed the stress tests overall. Lloyds, HSBC, Santander, Nationwide and Standard Chartered were the other lenders who took part. Looking at this year's results, RBS's chief financial officer, Ewen Stevenson, said: ""We continue to make progress towards the stress-resilient bank we aspire to be and 2017 represented another year of material improvement. ""Until we have resolved our remaining major legacy conduct issues and non-core portfolio interests, we will continue to show stress test results weaker than our long term targets."" In a statement, Barclays said: ""Barclays was not asked to submit a revised capital plan by the Bank of England in light of the steps already taken during 2017.""

Banks pass Brexit stress test,"Mark Carney became governor of the Bank of England in 2013 The UK's banks could cope if Britain leaves the European Union in a ""disorderly Brexit"" in 2019, the Bank of England has said. For the first time since the financial crisis, all of the UK's biggest lenders have passed the Bank's stress tests. The tests of adverse economic scenarios discover if the banks could continue to lend money to support the UK economy. Bank governor Mark Carney said they would be able to, even in ""the unlikely event"" of no deal when Brexit happens. Mr Carney said that all parties were working to avoid the situation, but warned that if the UK did leave in a ""sharp, disorderly"" way there would be some economic ""pain"" for households and businesses. The worst case scenario the Bank imagined in the stress tests included a 33% fall in house prices, a rise in interest rates from 0.5% to 4% within two years, and the unemployment rate rising to 9.5% from its current rate of 4.3%. The tests flagged up other Brexit concerns. Six million UK customers buy insurance policies from EU companies and, after Brexit, those firms would not have permission to collect premiums or pay claims. The same is true of the financial insurance that banks buy and sell to each other. Here the numbers are staggering - the notional value of those contracts are Â£26 trillion. Without legislation from both the EU and the UK they may be hard to enforce and that would create financial instability. The Bank of England offered a checklist of items to mitigate the impact of Brexit which included: A clear EU-UK regulatory framework in place Timely agreement on an implementation period Legislation on both sides to preserve continuity of existing cross-border insurance and derivative contracts Michael Snapes, financial services director at PwC, said: ""There is some comfort to be had in the knowledge that the UK banking system is strong enough to withstand a severe economic deterioration. ""The results suggest that the major UK banks may finally be emerging fully from their post-crisis downturn."" The headline of the report sounds comforting - the UK financial system is strong enough to withstand a ""disorderly Brexit"". By that, the Bank means an exit from the EU without a trade deal to replace our current relationship, the introduction of tariff and regulatory barriers and the potential forced relocation of people and businesses from the UK to the EU. So everything is all right then? Er, not quite. What the Bank is actually saying is that the economic shock to the system would be no worse than the economic tests it puts banks through anyway. These economic tests are severe. A 33% fall in house prices, a more than doubling of the unemployment rate, a 25% drop in the pound and a rapid rise in interest rates from 0.5% to 4%. This is a dire economic scenario. All the Bank is saying is that a disorderly Brexit would be no more apocalyptic than that. That is not much comfort. Read more of Simon's blog here. The Bank's Financial Policy Committee (FPC) also said it was increasing the amount that banks had to hold in reserve in case of an economic downturn. Mr Carney said the growth of consumer credit in the UK had created ""pockets of risk"". He said that domestic financial risks and the potential for new global economic issues meant banks should be prepared for further losses.

Volcanic ash keeps Bali airport shutMassive plumes of dark ash reached as high as 3km (2 miles) above the summit of the rumbling volcano.2h2 hours agoAsia,"Thousands of travellers have been stranded by the airport closure Indonesian officials have shut the international airport in Bali for a second day, as Mount Agung spews volcanic ash into the atmosphere. Massive plumes of dark ash were seen reaching as high as 3km (2 miles) above the summit of the rumbling volcano, which began erupting last week. Officials raised the alert to the highest level on Monday, fearing an imminent major eruption. Up to 100,000 people have been ordered to evacuate the vicinity. Volcanic ash can damage aeroplane engines or even cause them to fail, and also clogs fuel and cooling systems. Pilot visibility can also be hampered. Feared volcano has Bali on alert What does volcanic ash do to planes? In pictures:Prayers and preparations The Transportation Ministry initially closed the Ngurah Rai (Denpasar) airport on Monday morning for 24 hours, cancelling more than 400 flights and stranding 59,000 travellers. On Tuesday, they announced they would extend the closure to Wednesday 07:00 local time (00:00 GMT). This video can not be played We ask an expert: Is a large volcanic eruption inevitable? Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's national disaster agency, said that the ash was being drawn southwest - towards Bali's main airport - by a tropical cyclone in the Indian Ocean. Story behind the spectacular pictures Bali tourism hit by volcano threat The airport on neighbouring Lombok island however has been re-opened, he added. Authorities have also arranged for buses to take tourists to ferry terminals. The volcano is about 70km from the popular tourist areas of Kuta and Seminyak. The disaster agencysaid in a separate statement (in Indonesian),externalthat as of Tuesday morning, the volcano was still emitting thick ash clouds and that ""rays of flares from the glowing lava"" were also observed overnight. Besides ash,streams of rock mixed with water known as lahar,externalhave also been spotted flowing down from the mountain. Officials have warned people to stay away from them. Face masks are also being distributed to help residents cope with the continuous ash fall Officials have told everyone living in a 10km exclusion zone around the volcano to evacuate. Mr Sutopo said that officials faced difficulties estimating the exact number of evacuees given varying population data, but they believe between 90,000 and 100,000 people needed to leave. So far, only 29,000 people had moved to shelters, while others have fled to other places like Lombok, he said. Still, there were ""many people"" who have remained, as some still feel safe while others are unwilling to leave their cattle and fields, he said. Authorities have warned thatthey may forcibly evacuate peopleif they do not move to shelters soon. Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Bali A large banner reads: ""You're entering active volcanic hazard zone."" But looking around, you wouldn't know. Just behind the sign Seriyani is selling flowers for offers to the Balinese Hindu gods. She says she is worried, but needs to stay here and work to feed the family. ""When it really erupts I will run,"" she says with a nervous laugh. Further in the exclusion zone we find a school open. Here the teacher is showing the children how to put on simple surgical masks. To protect them from the ash, the headmaster tells me. The volcano has been rumbling for weeks now he says so they don't want to move yet and be left in limbo. Authorities say they will force people to evacuate. But those still on the mountain haven't heard that. Are you in the area? Have your travel plans been affected? What are conditions like currently?

The other American in Prince Harry's family,"Prince Harry and his American great-great grandmother When Prince Harry marries LA-born Meghan Markle next year, she will not be the first American in his family tree. The prince's great-great grandmother was Frances Ellen Work - a ""Dollar Princess"" whose life reads like a Downton Abbey storyline. Frances - known as Fannie - was born in New York City in 1857, the elder daughter of Frank Work. He was a self-made American banker who left a $15,000,000 fortune when he died. Fannie was considered ""a great beauty in her youth"" according to herobituary in the New York Times,external. ""She spent lavishly, enjoying parties and the excitement of being admired in beautiful clothes,"" writesAnne de Courcy in The Husband Hunters,external. ""At the same time, she was very well read, spoke French fluently, and took a great interest in paintings and furniture."" In 1880, she married the English-born James Boothby Burke Roche - the son of Irish politician Edmund Burke Roche, 1st Baron Fermoy. Fannie's dad - the self-made millionaire - was not impressed. ""I am an American to my backbone,"" he said. ""Therefore I have only contempt for these helpless, hopeless, lifeless men that cross the ocean to carry off the very flower of our womanhoodâ¦ ""If I had anything to say about the matter I'd make international marriage a hanging offence."" The line from Frances Ellen Work to Prince Harry It's fair to say James Roche - known as Jim - wasn't the ideal son-in-law. Firstly, he was broke. ""He had led a life far beyond what he could actually afford,"" writes Anne de Courcy. He was also - to put it mildly - somewhat of a schemer. By the time he married Fannie, Jim had been a ""ranchman in the west, a revolutionist in South America, a gold miner in Alaska, an explorer in Patagonia, and a blockade runner during the Russo-Japanese war,"" according to the New York Times. Worst of all - for Frank at least - he was ""tall, good looking, with good skin, dark eyes, a dark moustache, and a sizeable dollop of Irish charm"". Princess Diana was Frances Work's great-granddaughter Fannie and Jim lived in England and had four children in London (one died in infancy). But in 1891, Fannie was granted a divorce in the US. The divorce wasfront page news,external. The court said Jim had ""deserted"" her more than three years earlier, and had ""wilfully neglected to provide for his wife"". The American court also gave Fannie custody of their three children - Cynthia Burke Roche, Edmund Maurice Burke Roche, and Francis George Burke Roche. Edmund Maurice Burke Roche - who died in 1955 - was Princess Diana's grandfather. In 1905, Fannie married again - this time to a Hungarian, Aurel Batonyi. Her father was so incensed, he removed her from his will (she was later left a ""small portion""). After divorcing for a second time, Fannie divided her later years between the US and Europe. Her obituary said she ""entertained extensively"" in Paris. She died in 1947 at her home in Fifth Avenue in New York City. Her great-granddaughter, Diana, was born across the Atlantic 14 years later. Autumn Kelly and Peter Phillips married in 2008 The Royal Family's links to North America don't end with Fannie Work. In fact, Prince Harry isn't even the Queen's first grandson to marry a North American. Peter Phillips - son of the Princess Royal -married Autumn Kelly, a Canadian, in 2008,external. The couple met at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal in 2003 (Peter was working for the Williams Formula One team). Before the wedding, she gave up her Catholic faith - a move that allowed Peter to retain his right to the throne(the law changed in 2015). If that seemed old-fashioned, the pre-wedding publicity was more modern. The couple spoke to Hello magazine for a reported Â£500,000. The ceremony took place at Windsor Castle in front of 300 friends and family, 70 of them from Canada. Prince Harry was among the guests - as was his then-girlfriend, Chelsy Davy. Koo Stark in 1977 Prince Harry's and Peter Phillips' uncle, the Duke of York, also dated an American. In February 1981, on the night of his 21st birthday, he met Koo Stark - an understudy at the National Theatre in London. After their first date, in which old York met New York, he invited her to ""BP for lunch"". She thought he meant the petrol station;it was actually an invitation to Buckingham Palace,external. News of the relationship broke in 1982 while the couple were in Mustique in the Caribbean. Some paparazzi hired light aircraft. Others swam to the beach in scuba gear. The similarity to Prince Harry -who complained about media ""abuse and harassment"" last year- is clear. Indeed, the New York Post recently called Ms Stark the""Meghan Markle of the 1980s"",external. Prince Andrew and Ms Stark broke up but remained friends. He is godfather to Ms Stark's daughter. This video can not be played Graffiti appeared reading ""down with the American harlot"" But - no matter what Prince Harry and Meghan Markle do - they won't shake the Royal Family like Harry's great-great uncle did in 1936. The future Edward VIII met Wallis Simpson, an American socialite,at a house party in 1931,external. She was married to her second husband, Ernest, after divorcing her first. In January 1936, Edward became king when his father, George V, died. In October that year, Mrs Simpson was granted a divorce for the second time. In November, King Edward told the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, that he wanted to marry Mrs Simpson. Mr Baldwin told him the public would not accept Mrs Simpson as queen. The King proposed a morganatic marriage - in which he would be King but she not the Queen - but it was rejected by the prime minister and other Commonwealth governments. On 11 December 1936, he gave up the throne. In his abdication speech, he talked about ""the woman I love"". The couple married in 1937 and, after World War Two, lived in France. He died there in 1972, while she lived until 1986. More than 80 years after the constitutional crisis, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will write a new chapter in the long history between North America and the Royal Family. This one, hopefully, will be much smoother.

LiveBank stress tests revealed,"Get in touch: bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk IAG plans second Level base Ocado shares surge on Casino deal OECD warns on higher UK unemployment UK's seven biggest banks pass stress tests FTSE 100 and sterling flat Russell Hotten Inflation and Brexit are blamed for a 16% rise in the cost of the traditional festive feast. That's all from us on the livepage for today. The A team will be back from 6am tomorrow. Wall Street surged to record highs on
Tuesday led by sharp gains in bank stocks, and boosted by
progress for a tax cut bill, strong consumer confidence data and
encouraging comments from President Donald Trump's nominee to
lead the Federal Reserve. The S&P financial sector soared 2.6%, its
biggest daily percentage increase since 1 March. JP Morgan rose 3.5% and Bank of America
 gained 3.9%, while the S&P 500 banks index
 jumped 3.3%. Trump's push for a big package of tax cuts moved past a
potential obstacle as a Senate panel approved the measure
despite lingering concerns from some Republican members. Wall Street is closely watching progress on the Republicans'
tax-reform efforts, with hopes that corporate tax cuts will
further fuel the record-setting rally for equities.     
    ""People are trying to move in front of what they think now
is likely to be some tax reform on the corporate side,"" Rick
Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management. The Dow Jones rose 255.93 points,
or 1.09%, to 23,836.71, the S&P 500 gained 25.63
points, or 0.99%, to 2,627.05, and the Nasdaq added 33.84 points, or 0.49%, to 6,912.36. All three indexes notched record closing highs.
    The small-cap Russell 2000, which is viewed as a
barometer for tax reform's chances, rose 1.5% and also
tallied a record closing high. Wall Street looks set for another strong performance. Although a North Korea missile test initially dampened share price rises, fresh hopes for US tax reform offset investors' concerns. The S&P 500 jumped as much as 1% to 2,627.7 points, leaving it poised for its best day since 11 September. The Dow Jones gained as much as 1.1% to 23,849.6. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has called for quicker progress on agreeing a transitional UK-EU trade period following Brexit. Speaking at SMMT's annual dinner, president Tony Walker said such a period ""should be on the current terms and, crucially, not time-limited"". The UK automotive sector is worth about Â£14.6bn a year to the UK economy and employs 162,000 people.
""Like every other industry, we need certainty now,"" added Mr Walker. Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab has
never been asked by Russian intelligence services to spy on
targets in the West and the company's founder and chief
executive says he would move his firm out of the country if
he ever faced such a demand. Fears about Kaspersky's ties to Russian intelligence has prompted an escalating series of warnings and actions
from US authorities. They culminated in the Department of Homeland Security this
year barring government agencies from using Kaspersky products. ""Never, never,"" Eugene Kaspersky told reporters at a
media briefing at the company's offices in London, when asked if
Russian intelligence had ever asked him to help them spy on the
West. ""They have never asked us to spy on people. Never. ""If the Russian government comes to me and asks me to
anything wrong, or my employees, I will move the business out of
Russia,"" Kaspersky said. Leandra English says she'll spend the day at work,despite a Trump-appointed rival claiming her job. Palmer & Harvey goes into administration with 2,500 jobs lost Mark Todd, national officer of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied
Workers, has responded to news of the wholesaler's appointment of administrators. He says: ""Usdaw is deeply concerned at the devastating news that
Palmer & Harvey has gone into administration and that a significant number of
redundancies have already been announced. ""The union is seeking an urgent meeting with the administrators to clarify
what is going on and the implications for Usdaw members. ""Today's announcement is a massive shock to our members and is an extremely
distressing situation for all concerned, especially in the run up to Christmas. We will of course be doing everything possible to protect our members'
interests going forward."" The campaignerswho are quitting their jobs(or not) to fight for the UK to remain in the EU. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Wall Street indexes are edging up to record highs after Federal Reserve chair nominee Jerome
Powell made comments on interest rate hikes and deregulation which fired
up financial stocks. JPMorgan and Bank of America climbed about 2%, setting up the S&P financial index for its
biggest percentage gain in more than two weeks. ""When you look at the financials as a group, they probably
have a couple of tail winds - in terms of how he [Powell] thinks
about regulation and interest rates and certainly the progress
being made so far on tax reform,"" said Art Hogan, chief market
strategist at B. Riley FBR. The Dow Jones Industrial
Average was up 184 points, or 0.*, at
23,765, the S&P 500 was up 16 points, or 0.6%,
at 2,617 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 17 points, or 0.25%, at 6,895. Palmer & Harvey customer Costcutter Supermarkets Group says that it is
looking to other suppliers in the wake of the company's collapse.
 A spokesman for Costcutter Supermarkets Group said: ""We have activated our
contingency plans to provide alternative sources of supply through appropriate
regional and national options."" Matthew Callaghan, joint administrator and PwC partner, said:""The Palmer & Harvey name has been a trusted partner for retailers and suppliers for nearly 100 years. ""This is a devastating blow for everyone who has been involved in the business. The administration team will focus on working with employees, clients and suppliers to facilitate a smooth and effective wind-down or transfer of operations over the next few weeks. âThe P&H Group has faced a challenging trading environment, and the need for significant restructuring has been recognised for some while. The company has insufficient cash resources to continue to trade beyond the short term and the directors have concluded that there is no longer any reasonable prospect of a sale. Therefore, the directors have had no choice but appoint administrators. âThe administrators are working closely with employees affected by the closure of the business to ensure they receive the support they need during this difficult time to assist with their claims for redundancy and other compensatory payments. Our priority is to ensure that all employees made redundant are assisted in processing their claims with immediate effect. We will be circulating correspondence to all staff as soon as possible which will outline the support available to complete redundancy payment forms.â More on the P&H administration The US private equity fund was looking to snap up a controlling stake in P&H in
exchange for a significant capital investment, but attempts to secure a tie-up failed. P&H, is the UK's biggest supplier of cigarettes, and provides
alcohol, groceries and frozen food to 90,000 retail accounts, including Tesco. The privately-owned group has been working with stakeholders Imperial Brands
and Japan Tobacco International as it searches for relief from thin profit
margins and a substantial debt burden. Around 2,500 staff have been made redundant at Palmer & Harvey after the
troubled wholesaler collapsed into administration, joint administrators at PwC
confirmed. Virgin Trains has responded to news that another union has joined the RMT in voting for strike action. A spokesman says: ""We are disappointed by the result of the
TSSA's ballot, but can reassure customers that we will be able to run the
majority of services during any industrial action. ""We have discussed a 3.6% annual pay increase with the TSSA leadership as part
of a two-year deal, at a time when the average increase across public and
private sector employees is around 2%. We remain open to continuing talks with
the TSSA."" The FTSE 100 rose on
Tuesday as oil heavyweight Royal Dutch Shell surged
after a solid earnings update and a Bank of England stress test
on banks delivered no nasty shocks. The index extended gains to end the session
1% higher at 7,460.6 points. Shell rose 4%, leading the gainers on the FTSE 100. On the FTSE 250, a rally of more than 20% in Ocado following an ""transformative"" deal with French supermarket Casino livened up the session for mid cap stocks. The FTSE 250 ended 0.73% higher at 20,026. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"The worst places to grow up poorFormer industrial towns, rural and coastal areas fare worst in ""spiral of ever-growing division"".2m3 minutes agoFamily & Education","Rhythmical Mike is a successful performer - but says his schooldays were ""a nightmare"" ""You've got this - the whirlwind that you're in - is the beginning of something wonderfully new - for you."" Rhythmical Mike, a 24-year-old East Midlands poet, performs his work to pupils at Lovers' Lane Primary school in Newark, Nottinghamshire. It's an area where many children face big challenges and, according to a new State of the Nation report from the Social Mobility Commission, their educational and career prospects are too often limited from the outset. It ranks all 324 local authorities in England in terms of the life chances of someone born into a disadvantaged background and it debunks the notion of a simple North-South divide. Instead, it says, there is a ""postcode lottery"" with ""hotspots"" (shown in orange on the map below) and ""cold spots"" (shown in blue) found in all regions. The report highlights a ""self-reinforcing spiral of ever growing division"", with children in some areas getting a poor start in life from which they can never recover. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map created with Carto. If you can't see the map,tap here,external. West Somerset sits at the bottom of the league table, with average wages less than half those in the best performing parts of London. There are some surprises, with wealthy areas such as West Berkshire, Cotswold and Crawley performing badly for their most vulnerable residents. The report explains that wealthy areas can see high levels of low pay, with poorer young people at risk of being ""somewhat neglected"", particularly if they are scattered around isolated rural schools Conversely, some of the most deprived areas are ""hotspots"", providing good education, employment opportunities and housing for their most disadvantaged residents. These include London boroughs with big deprived populations such as Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Newham. In Kensington and Chelsea half of disadvantaged teenagers make it to university, but the figure for the same group in Barnsley, Hastings and Eastbourne is just 10%. ""London and its hinterland are increasingly looking like a different country from the rest of Britain,"" says Alan Milburn, who chairs the Social Mobility Commission. ""It is moving ahead, as are many of our country's great cities. ""But too many rural and coastal areas and towns of Britain's old industrial heartlands are being left behind economically and hollowed out socially."" Large variations were also found within Scotland and Wales, although the data is not directly comparable with that for England, says the report. This video can not be played ""Not many opportunities"": People in the town of Newark share their experiences The East Midlands is the English region with the worst outcomes for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, says the report - and within the East Midlands, Newark and Sherwood is the worst performing local authority. In Newark, only 43% of children are ready for school when they start Reception, compared with 52% nationally, the research finds. And by adulthood only 21% are in professional or managerial roles, compared with 51% in Oxford. Mike, real name Mike Markham, has been a poet for about six years, running his own company and playing at festivals, supporting stars like Rizzle Kicks and Russell Brand. For him, school was a really negative experience. He feels he failed there. ""It was a nightmare,"" he says, but believes overcoming his early difficulties helped him succeed later in life. ""Anybody can achieve anything,"" is his message to the children. He believes that, despite class structures, the world is changing. ""I think you've just got to be driven, you've got to be inspired you've got to be inspiring."" Efforts to improve social mobility need to start early, says the report The children themselves have big ambitions. ""I want to be a boxer. I want to get to the highest level and be a professional,"" says one boy. ""I want to be a heart surgeon and to do that I am going to have to get into the best universities there are and I've just got to try and pass all my exams,"" says a girl. But head teacher Jenny Hodgkinson says too many parents are caught between low pay and rising living costs and are working so hard simply to put food on the table, that they often lack time and energy to focus on their children's schooling. ""There's a lot of challenges facing families at the moment,"" she says. ""In terms of working more than one job, people with low income aren't time rich. ""They want to do the best for their children and they work ever so hard but they don't always have the resources to do what they need to."" ""It can be difficult trying to earn a living in this town,"" says parent Sian Mclachlan. In the town centre, one young woman complained of few opportunities for young people. ""If there's a good job going it will be gone within a week or so,"" she adds. ""I've got job security,"" says one young man. ""But I could be doing a lot more. I took better money where I should have gone to college - but you're not really pushed in this area."" The school is making great efforts to improve children's mental health, resilience and self-esteem, along with extra reading support and individual mentoring. It is working to draw in families, with classes to improve parents' basic skills which can help improve attitudes to education and boost their children's attendance. Ms Mclachlan says workshops on CV writing, job interviews and money management are also on offer. But the report warns of ""mind-blowing inconsistency"" in efforts to improve social mobility. ""Tinkering around the edges will not do the trick,"" says Mr Milburn. ""The analysis in this report substantiates the sense of political alienation and social resentment that so many parts of Britain feel."" He wants ""a new level of effort to tackle the phenomenon of left-behind Britain"" and urges the government to increase spending on regions that most need it. For example, estimates suggest that the North of England is Â£6bn underfunded compared with London. This video can not be played Alan Milburn: ""Your chances of getting on really depend on where you're born and where you live"" His recommendations include: all councils to develop a strategy for boosting disadvantaged children's prospects all councils to pay the living wage greater efforts to attract teachers to poorer regions struggling schools to develop partnerships with successful schools to boost attainment fairer transport funding, including transport subsidies for poor young people in rural areas Education Secretary Justine Greening said the findings underlined ""the importance of focusing our efforts in more disadvantaged areas where we can make the biggest difference"". ""We are making progress. There are now 1.8 million more children in good or outstanding schools than in 2010. Disadvantaged young people are entering universities at record rates and the attainment gap between them and their peers has narrowed. ""We are also boosting salaries through the introduction of the National Living Wage, creating more full-time, permanent jobs and investing Â£9bn in affordable housing. Taken together, this won't just change individual lives, it will help transform our country into a fairer society.""

"Mental health issues 'affect third of mums'Stress, anxiety and depression can follow on from becoming a new mum, a survey by BBC 5 live reveals.5h5 hours agoHealth","Lauren Doyle suffered PTSD after having her first daughter Ava More than a third of mothers have experienced mental health issues related to parenthood, according to an online survey of 1,800 British parents by theBBC Radio 5 liveand YouGov. The study revealed that, in comparison, 17% of fathers had experienced similar issues. More than two-thirds of the affected mothers sought professional help - suffering from conditions such as acute stress, severe anxiety and postpartum depression. Lauren Doyle experienced post-traumatic stress disorder after giving birth to her first daughter Ava. ""It just wipes you out really - you just become a completely different person,"" said the mother-of-three from West Yorkshire. ""I'd get upset over something as simple as we'd ordered a takeaway and they'd forgotten the fried rice and I just couldn't stop crying,"" she said. The birth was physically traumatic and it meant that Lauren and her daughter were looked after in different hospitals, which prevented them from developing a strong bond. She said: ""I didn't think I was unwell. I thought, 'All mums feel like that, this is just mum mode, I'm a mum now.' ""I've got to put up with feeling this way."" Lauren would cry in the shops and find herself getting angry and upset all the time. She also felt burdened with guilt when she couldn't breastfeed. ""It's another factor that makes you feel isolated, that you're not being the best mum,"" she said. Lauren's children Isaac, Isla and Ava Lauren's not alone. Many of the parents surveyed reported feeling criticised by a large number of people. Mothers said their parents were the most critical of their parenting (26%), followed by their spouse/partner (24%) and other family members (18%). About 14% said they had been criticised by strangers, compared with 5% of the 800 fathers who responded to the survey. New parents can experience troubles in the workplace as well. About 30% of mothers who responded said they had felt discriminated against at work through being a parent, compared with 14% of working fathers. According to Citizens Advice, new mothers are reportingincreasing levels of unfair treatment at work. The survey also found women turn to online forums for support more than men. A total of 60% of women said they had received emotional support from their friends, 56% from their partner and 18% went online. But 15% of mothers and a quarter of fathers say they didn't receive any emotional support for their parenting at all. This is despite a growing understanding thatpostpartum depression affects men as well as women. For Lauren, receiving support in her local community was challenging because she had recently moved to a new area and therefore didn't have many established friendships. The mother-of-three relied on her parents-in-law and her husband, Rob, who first noticed there was a problem and encouraged her to seek help. ""I didn't know where to go to, where to turn to, to get support,"" she said. She saw a doctor after the birth of her second daughter Isla. She said all they could provide was medication and eventually received support through the parenting support groupPandas.,external ""It looked so effortless being a parent and that's what I thought it was going to be,"" she said. Six years on, Lauren says things have improved. ""I'm happy - I feel that I'm doing my job properly now.""

Security tight for Kenya inaugurationPresident Kenyatta is to be sworn in for a second term in a ceremony boycotted by the opposition.2h2 hours agoAfrica,"This video can not be played Uhuru Kenyatta is sworn in for a second term as Kenya's president Uhuru Kenyatta has vowed to overcome Kenya's divisions after being sworn in for a second term as president, at a ceremony boycotted by the opposition. Speaking after his inauguration in the capital Nairobi, he said he would try to incorporate some of the opposition's ideas ""in the spirit of inclusivity"". Two people died when police clashed with opposition supporters in the city. Opposition leader Raila Odinga announced plans to be sworn in himself as president next month. Live updates He boycotted last month's repeat election and has not recognised Mr Kenyatta's victory. Mr Kenyatta was officially re-elected with 98% of the vote on 26 October but just under 39% of voters turned out. The original election on 8 August was held again after being annulled by the Supreme Court on grounds of irregularities. Kenya's 'digital president' Raila Odinga - Love him or loathe him Embarking on his second and last term in office, he promised to act as ""the custodian of the dreams of all"" Kenyans. Without specifying whether he would reach out to Mr Odinga, he said: ""We may have chosen different candidates and different visions, but each one of us voted for a better life. ""To my competitors, and in the spirit of inclusivity, I will endeavour to incorporate some of their ideas. The election was not a contest between a good dream and a bad dream. It was a contest between two competing visions. ""I will devote my time and energy to build bridges, to unite and bring prosperity to all Kenyans."" Spectators inside Nairobi's Kasarani sports stadium were entertained by music and dance performances, while the military paraded. A cannon salute was fired The stadium was packed with supporters The luckier Kenyatta supporters had seats inside the stadium However, there were scenes of chaos outside when people without seats tried to rush in and were driven back by police with tear gas and batons, with some officers on horseback. Big screens had been promised so that tens of thousands of people could watch the ceremony from outside the stadium but no screens were provided, AFP news agency reports. People fell down as police fired tear gas outside the stadium Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and Rwandan President Paul Kagame were among  a number of African leaders at the inauguration. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was also expected in Nairobi but for a later event in the presidential palace, the Jerusalem Post reports.,external Chief Justice David Maraga said the August election had not been ""conducted in accordance with the constitution"" and declared it ""invalid, null and void"". The Supreme Court ruled that the result had been ""neither transparent nor verifiable"". But Mr Odinga urged his supporters to boycott the second vote because he said no reforms had been made to the electoral commission since the original poll. Correspondents say the election dispute has left Kenya deeply divided. About 50 people are reported to have been killed in violence since the August ballot. By Anne Soy, BBC News, Nairobi There were confrontations between police and opposition supporters in the suburb of Doonholm. Angry protesters lit tyres, barricaded roads and threw stones at the police and some ruling party supporters. ""No Raila, no peace,"" they shouted as police lobbed tear gas canisters to disperse them. ""We do not recognise Uhuru Kenyatta,"" one protester holding a sling loaded with a stone told me. Another protester said he was angry that the police had blocked access to the venue where the opposition had planned to hold a rally. Mr Odinga told the BBC that they wanted to mourn the death of their supporters who were allegedly killed by police over the past week-and-a-half. The police have denied shooting and killing any opposition supporters. Addressing his supporters on a road in Nairobi, Mr Odinga said he himself would be sworn in as president on 12 December. According to Mr Odinga, Mr Kenyatta was elected by ""just a small section of the country"". Raila Odinga greeted his supporters from the sunroof of a car Local media and police sources reported the deaths of two people, at least one of whom was shot as police battled protesters with tear gas and batons. Opposition activists had been trying to hold a rally in the city's Jacaranda grounds, far away from the stadium, to commemorate 50 or so people killed since the August vote. At least one vehicle was set on fire during Tuesday's clashes In the opposition stronghold of Kisumu, in the west of the country, local people told BBC News they were not happy with the inauguration. ""I am going to peacefully accept and move on but I won't recognise this presidency,"" said one man. A woman said Mr Kenyatta had not won fairly. ""So we feel that it's not time to move on,"" she said. ""It will not be an easy thing to do.""

BA owner wins Monarch's Gatwick slotsAirline group IAG has secured most of the collapsed carrier's take-off slots at Gatwick.5h5 hours agoBusiness,"British Airways owner IAG has secured take-off and landing slots at London's Gatwick Airport that used to belong to Monarch before it collapsed. IAG said the deal would enable its airlines - primarily BA - to offer more flights and new routes from Gatwick. Monarch collapsed in early October andthousands of its customers had to be returned on government rescue flights. Its administrator, KPMG, won a court appeal last week for the right to sell Monarch's slots at Gatwick. KPMG's lawyers said at the time that the slots were its ""most valuable asset"". IAG chief executive Willie Walsh said last month that he was interested in the Gatwick slots as a way to boost its fledgling long-haul budget airline Level, which launched in June. But an IAG spokesman said they would be used ""primarily"" for British Airways. ""These slots will be used by the group's airlines, primarily British Airways, enabling them to grow their presence at the airport and launch new destinations and add extra frequencies,"" he added. The firm, which also owns Vueling and Aer Lingus, faced competition from budget rivals, with EasyJet, Wizz and Norwegian reportedly keen to acquire the slots. Monarch's take-off and landing slots at Luton Airport are also due to be auctioned off. Together, the Gatwick and Luton slots are believed to be worth about Â£60m. IAG refused to say how much it had paid to secure the Gatwick landing slots. KPMG partner and joint administrator Blair Nimmo said the Gatwick slots sale ""represented an excellent recovery for creditors"". ""Our continuing focus is now on MAL's [Monarch] Luton slots, as well as exploring potential rescue opportunities for MAL and its residual assets including its brand and associated licenses,"" he added.

"The Brexit documents row isn't going awayLabour says Parliament is being kept ""in the dark"", because the impact assessments have been edited.8h8 hours agoUK Politics","The government has handed over its analysis of the impact of Brexit on parts of the economy - but the reports are not complete. There has been a long-running row over the studies of 58 sectors. MPs voted on 1 November for them to be released. Labour and some Conservative MPs have demanded their publication, saying they were being kept in the dark about the impact Brexit might have. Documents have now been sent to the Brexit Committee of MPs. But BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says she now expects a ""big row"" because Brexit Secretary David Davis has admitted the reports are incomplete. Allow Twitter content?

In his letter to Brexit Committee chairman Hilary Benn, Mr Davis said the papers had been redacted because there was no guarantee the committee would keep them secret. He said: ""Given that we have received no assurances from the committee regarding how any information passed will be used, we have sought not to include commercially, market and negotiation sensitive information. ""Delivering a successful outcome to our EU exit negotiations for the whole country requires keeping some information confidential for the purposes of the negotiations."" By Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor Understanding the possible economic impact of Britain's decision to leave the European Union is a difficult business. It is likely to become easier when the Department for Exiting the European Union makes available its ""sector analyses"" on relations with our biggest trading partner. I am told in no uncertain terms that the reports - which will run to hundreds of pages - are not ""impact assessments"". That is, they will not put a figure on the possible costs if there is a sharp dislocation between the free trading arrangements we have with the EU now and what might follow after we leave. Rather, I understand the reports will show the size of each of the sectors and their worth to the UK economy and then detail how the sectors work at present within the EU single market and customs union. Read more of Kamal's blog here. The government said it had satisfied the Commons motion passed by MPs - in which Conservatives abstained - with the release of the documents to the committee. ""We have always been clear that our analysis does not exist in the form Parliament requested,"" a spokesman said. But Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said ""serious questions"" would be raised if the full reports were not handed to the Brexit Select Committee. He told BBC News: ""It was a decision of the House of Commons that was binding. ""It was clear that these reports, unredacted [and] in full should be handed over. ""The government didn't vote against that decision and they have accepted that decision, so if they are changing their position now, they are going to have to explain that. ""We in the Labour party will raise this in parliament when we know the full picture, but ultimately, it could be a question of contempt of Parliament."" Keir Starmer said ""serious questions"" will be raised if the reports are not handed over in full Labour committee member Seema Malhotra said it appeared the government had ""already decided what should and should not be seen"" by editing the studies. She added: ""The select committee must be given the full analyses which were completed, and nothing less. ""We cannot and should not be short-changed. This will not be in the national interest.

Profumo 'had relationship with Nazi spy'The former Tory minister is thought to have met a future Nazi spy while in Oxford in the 1930s.3h3 hours agoUK,"Gisela Winegard and John Profumo met in Oxford in the 1930s, before she started working for German intelligence Tory minister John Profumo - who resigned over a notorious 1960s sex scandal - had a relationship with a Nazi spy, declassified records suggest. MI5 documents suggest he had a relationship with German model Gisela Winegard in Oxford in the early 1930s. Dr Stephen Twigge from the National Archives said this could have exposed him to blackmail. In 1963 Profumo resigned as a minister after it was revealed he lied to MPs about his affair with Christine Keeler. The declassified papers - published on Tuesday - were compiled by MI6, the UK's foreign intelligence service, and then given to MI5, the domestic branch of the secret services, at the height of the so-called Profumo Affair. In the letters, Winegard's American husband Edward - who was her jailer when she was convicted of espionage - claimed that the couple separated in 1950 because of her ""endearing letters from John Denis Profumo... written on House of Commons notepaper"". Secret Service papers state Profumo wrote to Winegard while he was an MP. This video can not be played A brief explanation of the complexities of the Profumo affair In the early 1960s John Profumo, then the Conservative secretary of state for war, had a two-year affair with model Christine Keeler, who was also having a relationship with Russian military attache Yevgeny Ivanov. In March 1963 he told the House of Commons there was no ""impropriety"" in their relationship after being asked about it by opposition MPs who said they were concerned about the national security implications. However, more newspaper stories emerged and Profumo eventually admitted lying to the House, resigning from the cabinet and the Commons, and devoting the rest of his life to charity work. His fall from grace is often considered a contributory factor to the fall of the MacMillan government. Labour would win under Harold Wilson's leadership in 1964. A classic Westminster scandal The documents claim that the fashion model - whose maiden name was Klein - worked for German intelligence during World War Two. Profumo, who was MP for Kettering from 1940 to 1945 and then for Stratford-upon-Avon, told MI5 about the spy in a memo in 1941, where he admitted to meeting her in 1936 ""and got to know her well"". ""Lady Astor is alleged to have expressed the opinion that she was a spy,"" he added. MI5 documents unveil the extent of the Secret Service's probe in to John Profumo's life at the height of the 1963 sex scandal The file adds that Winegard was rejected for a UK visa in 1951 as it was thought she had ""recently engaged in blackmail activities"". ""Jack Profumo, MP for South Cattering [sic]"" was named as a reference on the visa. Dr Stephen Twigge, head of the Modern Collections section at the National Archive said Profumo ""sounded like he was vulnerable to blackmail."" ""He wrote to Gisela Winegard in Tangiers and her husband found letters from Profumo on House of Commons note paper in their apartment."" This video can not be played Dr Steven Twigge of the National Archives discusses Profumo's affairs ""It was enough for the MI6 head of station in Tangiers to be alarmed."" However a historian who has written on the case challenged the idea that Profumo could have been blackmailed. Richard Davenport-Hines, author of ""An English Affair: Sex, Class and Power in the Age of Profumo,external""  said: ""Profumo was a man of the world, rich, handsome and charismatic, who was very open about his sex life. ""As a junior backbencher, he would not have been a security risk in the 1950s. ""He was also a single man when this happened."" Winegard was imprisoned for espionage after the Allies liberated Paris in 1944, marrying Edward on her release in 1950. She had run a secret information service for German intelligence in Paris under the guise of a ""commercial information bureau"". She was also the mistress of a high-ranking German officer, having a child with him. After the war she came to the attention of the US Secret Service and was accused of harbouring the on-the-run chief of a German spy ring while living in the south of France. The records also show she was sacked from the Voice of America radio station in Tangier in 1950 when her ""pro-German sympathies"" were revealed. The Profumo affair.

Mental health issues 'affect third of mums',"Lauren Doyle suffered PTSD after having her first daughter Ava More than a third of mothers have experienced mental health issues related to parenthood, according to an online survey of 1,800 British parents by theBBC Radio 5 liveand YouGov. The study revealed that, in comparison, 17% of fathers had experienced similar issues. More than two-thirds of the affected mothers sought professional help - suffering from conditions such as acute stress, severe anxiety and postpartum depression. Lauren Doyle experienced post-traumatic stress disorder after giving birth to her first daughter Ava. ""It just wipes you out really - you just become a completely different person,"" said the mother-of-three from West Yorkshire. ""I'd get upset over something as simple as we'd ordered a takeaway and they'd forgotten the fried rice and I just couldn't stop crying,"" she said. The birth was physically traumatic and it meant that Lauren and her daughter were looked after in different hospitals, which prevented them from developing a strong bond. She said: ""I didn't think I was unwell. I thought, 'All mums feel like that, this is just mum mode, I'm a mum now.' ""I've got to put up with feeling this way."" Lauren would cry in the shops and find herself getting angry and upset all the time. She also felt burdened with guilt when she couldn't breastfeed. ""It's another factor that makes you feel isolated, that you're not being the best mum,"" she said. Lauren's children Isaac, Isla and Ava Lauren's not alone. Many of the parents surveyed reported feeling criticised by a large number of people. Mothers said their parents were the most critical of their parenting (26%), followed by their spouse/partner (24%) and other family members (18%). About 14% said they had been criticised by strangers, compared with 5% of the 800 fathers who responded to the survey. New parents can experience troubles in the workplace as well. About 30% of mothers who responded said they had felt discriminated against at work through being a parent, compared with 14% of working fathers. According to Citizens Advice, new mothers are reportingincreasing levels of unfair treatment at work. The survey also found women turn to online forums for support more than men. A total of 60% of women said they had received emotional support from their friends, 56% from their partner and 18% went online. But 15% of mothers and a quarter of fathers say they didn't receive any emotional support for their parenting at all. This is despite a growing understanding thatpostpartum depression affects men as well as women. For Lauren, receiving support in her local community was challenging because she had recently moved to a new area and therefore didn't have many established friendships. The mother-of-three relied on her parents-in-law and her husband, Rob, who first noticed there was a problem and encouraged her to seek help. ""I didn't know where to go to, where to turn to, to get support,"" she said. She saw a doctor after the birth of her second daughter Isla. She said all they could provide was medication and eventually received support through the parenting support groupPandas.,external ""It looked so effortless being a parent and that's what I thought it was going to be,"" she said. Six years on, Lauren says things have improved. ""I'm happy - I feel that I'm doing my job properly now.""

BA owner wins Monarch's Gatwick slots,"British Airways owner IAG has secured take-off and landing slots at London's Gatwick Airport that used to belong to Monarch before it collapsed. IAG said the deal would enable its airlines - primarily BA - to offer more flights and new routes from Gatwick. Monarch collapsed in early October andthousands of its customers had to be returned on government rescue flights. Its administrator, KPMG, won a court appeal last week for the right to sell Monarch's slots at Gatwick. KPMG's lawyers said at the time that the slots were its ""most valuable asset"". IAG chief executive Willie Walsh said last month that he was interested in the Gatwick slots as a way to boost its fledgling long-haul budget airline Level, which launched in June. But an IAG spokesman said they would be used ""primarily"" for British Airways. ""These slots will be used by the group's airlines, primarily British Airways, enabling them to grow their presence at the airport and launch new destinations and add extra frequencies,"" he added. The firm, which also owns Vueling and Aer Lingus, faced competition from budget rivals, with EasyJet, Wizz and Norwegian reportedly keen to acquire the slots. Monarch's take-off and landing slots at Luton Airport are also due to be auctioned off. Together, the Gatwick and Luton slots are believed to be worth about Â£60m. IAG refused to say how much it had paid to secure the Gatwick landing slots. KPMG partner and joint administrator Blair Nimmo said the Gatwick slots sale ""represented an excellent recovery for creditors"". ""Our continuing focus is now on MAL's [Monarch] Luton slots, as well as exploring potential rescue opportunities for MAL and its residual assets including its brand and associated licenses,"" he added.

Teenager guilty of plotting terror attack,"The trial heard he searched the internet for details of security at a Justin Bieber concert A teenager from south Wales has been found guilty of plotting a terror attack in Cardiff. The boy, from Rhondda Cynon Taff, who cannot be named, was arrested on the day of a Justin Bieber concert at the Principality Stadium on 30 June. The 17-year-old has been found guilty of five terror-related charges at Birmingham Crown Court. The trial heard he was found with a ""martyrdom letter"" when arrested, which revealed details of his planned attack. The court heard the A-level student, who is white and British, had set up an Instagram account encouraging jihad and supporting al-Qaeda. Police found the password for the account was ""truck attack"". One post read: ""May Allah bring terrorism to Cardiff on 30th June."" A claw hammer and a gutting knife were found in the boy's school rucksack Police also found he had conducted numerous online searches into how to carry out a vehicle ramming attack and how to stab and kill. Other targets he researched included Cardiff Castle, the New Theatre, the Capitol shopping centre, the Central Library and Bridgend's McArthur Glen shopping outlet. His internet history included searches for ""Isis beheading video"", ""how to create a terror attack"" and ""what does getting shot feel like"". The court heard he also researched the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby and information on how to steal a car. His mobile phone contained images of the truck attacks in Nice and Berlin. When arrested, the boy was found with a gutting knife and a hammer in his school rucksack, and the ""martyrdom letter"" said he was a ""soldier of the Islamic state"" and ""more attacks will follow"". He had also told police in an interview he had been talking to someone called ""Al Baghdadi"" online, who had told the boy he would go to hell as he did not believe in Islam. But his defence barrister Delroy Henry argued he was not planning an attack but had a ""stupid interest in the gory"". The boy told the jury he wanted to see how easy it was to research terror-related topics online. The boy was found guilty of one charge of engaging in the preparation of a terrorist act, two charges of encouraging terrorism, and a further two charges of possessing terrorist information. Sentencing will take place on 10 January. The court heard the teenager posted a picture of Cardiff Castle online Sue Hemming, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said: ""This teenager's behaviour over many months leaves no doubt that he intended to kill and maim as many people as possible in an attack reminiscent of the incident on Westminster Bridge. ""He was also posting extremist content online that could have encouraged others to commit terrorist acts and downloading instructions on how to carry out 'lone wolf' attacks. ""He will now rightly face the prospect of a substantial prison sentence."" Det Supt Lee Porter, of Wales Extremism Counter Terrorism Unit, said the investigation ""prevented further offences being committed"" and warned the public to be ""vigilant"". He added: ""This case has highlighted the ongoing concerns with young people gaining access to extremist material on the internet and how quickly that can lead to radicalisation.""

Irish deputy PM resists calls to resign,"Frances Fitzgerald was Irish minister for justice during a police whistleblower controversy The leaders of Ireland's two main political parties are holding crisis talks on Tuesday in an attempt to avoid a snap general election. Calls for Ireland's deputy prime minister to resign over a controversy involving a police whistleblower could end a deal between the parties. Fianna FÃ¡il abstains in key votes to allow the biggest party, Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael, to lead a ruling coalition. It comes ahead of an EU summit in which Ireland will play a major role. If an election is called, there are fears that it could complicate next month's EU meeting, at which Ireland's position will influence the assessment of the UK's progress in Brexit talks. Revelations about a plan to discredit a police whistleblower during an inquiry have led opposition parties to call for the tanaiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Frances Fitzgerald to resign over her handling of the affair. Irish government 'new politics' era survives first year Fianna FÃ¡il agrees to back minority Fine Gael government On Monday,documents revealed that Ms Fitzgerald had received a letter from an official discussing what was described as an aggressive stance towards the whistleblower,external. At the time she was the Irish minster for justice. She faces a vote of no confidence in the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) on Tuesday. However, a spokesperson for the government said it retained full confidence in Ms Fitzgerald. The dispute has created a political crisis and if the parties fail to reach an agreement then it could force a general election before Christmas. Both parties have said that they want to avoid a poll. Mr Varadkar, Ireland's taoiseach (prime minister), would still travel to the EU summit next month which will decide whether the Brexit talks will move onto the next phase. Audit reveals Garda irregularities Timeline: The Garda McCabe whistleblower controversy In 2015, the O'Higgins Commission was established by the government to examine malpractice allegations in the Garda's (Irish police) Cavan/Monaghan division. On Monday evening, it was revealed that the now tÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) was personally sent a letter from one of her officials in July 2015, which discussed the ""aggressive stance towards Sgt Maurice McCabe at the commission"". The letter is one of a number of documents published by the department of justice from a record trawl requested by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Garda Commissioner Noirin O'Sullivan retired in September In a series of tweets on Monday evening, Ms Fitzgerald wrote: ""As Justice Minister I could not interfere with the O'Higgins Commission. This is confirmed twice in today's docs & has been confirmed by the Attorney General."" A judge-led tribunal is also being held to establish whether senior Garda officers were involved in an alleged smear campaign against whistleblower Sgt Maurice McCabe. Ms Fitzgerald also wrote: ""The Tribunal will objectively judge the appropriateness of my conduct. I look forward to giving my evidence to the Tribunal early in January."" Allow Twitter content?

Last week, Ms Fitzgerald faced questions in the DÃ¡il over an email she was sent by former Garda (Police)Commissioner, NoirÃ­n O'Sullivan, which outlined the legal strategy to be pursued against Sgt Maurice McCabe. Ms Fitzgerald said she could not remember reading it. However, she recently admitted she was made aware a year earlier than she had previously stated, that lawyers for the garda were going to attempt to discredit Sgt McCabe. Fianna FÃ¡il leader MicheÃ¡l Martin said the situation would be resolved if Ms Fitzgerald resigned On Sunday, it alsoemerged that NoirÃ­n O'Sullivan had discussed the controversial legal action relating to Mr McCabe in a phone call with a senior member of the department of justice in May 2015.

"The other American in Prince Harry's family'A real representation of British society'Corgis, camping... seven things we've learned","Prince Harry and his American great-great grandmother When Prince Harry marries LA-born Meghan Markle next year, she will not be the first American in his family tree. The prince's great-great grandmother was Frances Ellen Work - a ""Dollar Princess"" whose life reads like a Downton Abbey storyline. Frances - known as Fannie - was born in New York City in 1857, the elder daughter of Frank Work. He was a self-made American banker who left a $15,000,000 fortune when he died. Fannie was considered ""a great beauty in her youth"" according to herobituary in the New York Times,external. ""She spent lavishly, enjoying parties and the excitement of being admired in beautiful clothes,"" writesAnne de Courcy in The Husband Hunters,external. ""At the same time, she was very well read, spoke French fluently, and took a great interest in paintings and furniture."" In 1880, she married the English-born James Boothby Burke Roche - the son of Irish politician Edmund Burke Roche, 1st Baron Fermoy. Fannie's dad - the self-made millionaire - was not impressed. ""I am an American to my backbone,"" he said. ""Therefore I have only contempt for these helpless, hopeless, lifeless men that cross the ocean to carry off the very flower of our womanhoodâ¦ ""If I had anything to say about the matter I'd make international marriage a hanging offence."" The line from Frances Ellen Work to Prince Harry It's fair to say James Roche - known as Jim - wasn't the ideal son-in-law. Firstly, he was broke. ""He had led a life far beyond what he could actually afford,"" writes Anne de Courcy. He was also - to put it mildly - somewhat of a schemer. By the time he married Fannie, Jim had been a ""ranchman in the west, a revolutionist in South America, a gold miner in Alaska, an explorer in Patagonia, and a blockade runner during the Russo-Japanese war,"" according to the New York Times. Worst of all - for Frank at least - he was ""tall, good looking, with good skin, dark eyes, a dark moustache, and a sizeable dollop of Irish charm"". Princess Diana was Frances Work's great-granddaughter Fannie and Jim lived in England and had four children in London (one died in infancy). But in 1891, Fannie was granted a divorce in the US. The divorce wasfront page news,external. The court said Jim had ""deserted"" her more than three years earlier, and had ""wilfully neglected to provide for his wife"". The American court also gave Fannie custody of their three children - Cynthia Burke Roche, Edmund Maurice Burke Roche, and Francis George Burke Roche. Edmund Maurice Burke Roche - who died in 1955 - was Princess Diana's grandfather. In 1905, Fannie married again - this time to a Hungarian, Aurel Batonyi. Her father was so incensed, he removed her from his will (she was later left a ""small portion""). After divorcing for a second time, Fannie divided her later years between the US and Europe. Her obituary said she ""entertained extensively"" in Paris. She died in 1947 at her home in Fifth Avenue in New York City. Her great-granddaughter, Diana, was born across the Atlantic 14 years later. Autumn Kelly and Peter Phillips married in 2008 The Royal Family's links to North America don't end with Fannie Work. In fact, Prince Harry isn't even the Queen's first grandson to marry a North American. Peter Phillips - son of the Princess Royal -married Autumn Kelly, a Canadian, in 2008,external. The couple met at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal in 2003 (Peter was working for the Williams Formula One team). Before the wedding, she gave up her Catholic faith - a move that allowed Peter to retain his right to the throne(the law changed in 2015). If that seemed old-fashioned, the pre-wedding publicity was more modern. The couple spoke to Hello magazine for a reported Â£500,000. The ceremony took place at Windsor Castle in front of 300 friends and family, 70 of them from Canada. Prince Harry was among the guests - as was his then-girlfriend, Chelsy Davy. Koo Stark in 1977 Prince Harry's and Peter Phillips' uncle, the Duke of York, also dated an American. In February 1981, on the night of his 21st birthday, he met Koo Stark - an understudy at the National Theatre in London. After their first date, in which old York met New York, he invited her to ""BP for lunch"". She thought he meant the petrol station;it was actually an invitation to Buckingham Palace,external. News of the relationship broke in 1982 while the couple were in Mustique in the Caribbean. Some paparazzi hired light aircraft. Others swam to the beach in scuba gear. The similarity to Prince Harry -who complained about media ""abuse and harassment"" last year- is clear. Indeed, the New York Post recently called Ms Stark the""Meghan Markle of the 1980s"",external. Prince Andrew and Ms Stark broke up but remained friends. He is godfather to Ms Stark's daughter. This video can not be played Graffiti appeared reading ""down with the American harlot"" But - no matter what Prince Harry and Meghan Markle do - they won't shake the Royal Family like Harry's great-great uncle did in 1936. The future Edward VIII met Wallis Simpson, an American socialite,at a house party in 1931,external. She was married to her second husband, Ernest, after divorcing her first. In January 1936, Edward became king when his father, George V, died. In October that year, Mrs Simpson was granted a divorce for the second time. In November, King Edward told the prime minister, Stanley Baldwin, that he wanted to marry Mrs Simpson. Mr Baldwin told him the public would not accept Mrs Simpson as queen. The King proposed a morganatic marriage - in which he would be King but she not the Queen - but it was rejected by the prime minister and other Commonwealth governments. On 11 December 1936, he gave up the throne. In his abdication speech, he talked about ""the woman I love"". The couple married in 1937 and, after World War Two, lived in France. He died there in 1972, while she lived until 1986. More than 80 years after the constitutional crisis, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will write a new chapter in the long history between North America and the Royal Family. This one, hopefully, will be much smoother.

"'A real representation of British society'Corgis, camping... seven things we've learned","This video can not be played When Harry met Meghan Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's engagement is shining a light on inter-racial couples in the UK. Ms Markle, who is ofAfrican-American and white heritage,external, is set to become the first mixed-race member of the British Royal Family, with her and Prince Harry the first interracial royal couple. But inter-racial relationships in general in the UK are nothing new. According to the Office for National Statistics, the rate of mixed relationships has increased in the last few years,with one in 10 people being in them,externalat the last census. Some other inter-racial couples told us about their personal experiences of being in a mixed relationship - and their thoughts on the royal couple. Astrid and Mike say Prince Harry and Meghan represent true British society French native Astrid and her partner of 10 years, Mike, who is Kenyan and Rwandan, live together in Birmingham. Astrid says at first she did think about how some people might react to their relationship, particularly how her grandparents would react to Mike. ""Because of World War Two, my grandpa expressed certain views towards Africans, so I worried about how he would be. ""But when he met Mike, he loved him. Sometimes I over-think how people will react."" The couple, who are both 28, welcomed their first daughter a year ago and gave her five names so that she would have links to both her European and African descent. They say they think it is time for people to drop the inter-racial label, and see mixed couples as the norm. Speaking about the royal relationship, Astrid says: ""I think it's amazing. It shows how diverse and modern the Royal Family are. ""This will set a great example for England and it's an honest representation of British society."" Shantania and Billy have faced offensive insults online Shantania Beckford, 24, and Billy Clifford, 23, from Birmingham, are from Jamaican and English heritage. The couple, who met online, collectively have a social media following of over 300,000, and they say their public mixed relationship has resulted in some insults and trolling. ""Some people don't believe that black and white should be together, but we laugh it off. ""We can't let negative stuff get to us, we delete the comments and get over it. ""You can't live for other people, you have to live for you."" Despite being in a mixed relationship, Shantania says that when she first found out about Prince Harry and Ms Markle's relationship, she was surprised. ""To be honest with you, I didn't think they were going to let a black person into the Royal Family. ""Meghan really has substance to her, but I wonder how the Queen feels?"" The couple believe this is a step forward for the future of the Royal Family. ""People will be a lot more accepting of mixed couples now, and talk about interracial issues. ""I'm happy for them, it's a positive thing."" Sara and Adam say it's 'difficult' for people to still have bad views on mixed relationships Sara Khoo, 23, is of mixed Icelandic and Chinese heritage and Adam D'hill, 28, is Portuguese and African American. The couple have been together for two years, after meeting in Brighton. They say their families were accepting of their relationship, and say that in this day and age ""it's difficult to still have biased views"". Sara says: ""I was scared to introduce Adam to my family because he's a boy, not because he's black - that's never been a problem."" When asked about Prince Harry's relationship, they both felt it was a ""great thing"". ""We find it hard to comment, because I don't see how people would have an issue with their relationship; we don't see it as a problem."" Andrea, who met her husband in the 1980s, was worried about how her parents would react English-born Andrea Walker, from Sheffield, met her Pakistani husband Zahid in 1987. The couple got married and had three children before splitting up four years later. When introducing Zahid to her family, Andrea, 55, remembers her main worry being the fact he was from a different religious background. ""It wasn't about the race, but the religion. I was worried about how my parents would react. ""I was brought up in a Christian home, so in my head I thought 'what are my parents going to say about this?'"" She says both her and Zahid's family gave their blessing to the relationship, but her colleagues and some strangers were not as accepting. On one occasion, Andrea says, she was told off at work for wearing trousers. ""Someone told my boss I wore trousers because I was married to a Muslim man; he called me in and demanded I start wearing a skirt."" People were curious to see what Andrea's children would look like Following the birth of her first son, she says, people were often curious to see him. ""I would see them looking, and they'd try to look into the pram to see what colour the baby was."" Andrea says that since the 80s people's attitudes towards mixed marriages have changed, but she is unsure whether or not an interracial royal marriage will be met with open arms. ""I think royalists are going to be really torn with this relationship - yes, she's part black, but she's also very good looking and smart, so it may not be a huge problem. ""Racism is always going to be around no matter what, but you'd hope people would get over it."" And as for the prince and Ms Markle, she said: ""I think it's exciting.""

Volcanic ash keeps Bali airport shutMassive plumes of dark ash reached as high as 3km (2 miles) from the summit of the rumbling volcano.13m13 minutes ago,"Thousands of travellers have been stranded by the airport closure Indonesian officials have shut the international airport in Bali for a second day, as Mount Agung spews volcanic ash into the atmosphere. Massive plumes of dark ash were seen reaching as high as 3km (2 miles) above the summit of the rumbling volcano, which began erupting last week. Officials raised the alert to the highest level on Monday, fearing an imminent major eruption. Up to 100,000 people have been ordered to evacuate the vicinity. Volcanic ash can damage aeroplane engines or even cause them to fail, and also clogs fuel and cooling systems. Pilot visibility can also be hampered. Feared volcano has Bali on alert What does volcanic ash do to planes? In pictures:Prayers and preparations The Transportation Ministry initially closed the Ngurah Rai (Denpasar) airport on Monday morning for 24 hours, cancelling more than 400 flights and stranding 59,000 travellers. On Tuesday, they announced they would extend the closure to Wednesday 07:00 local time (00:00 GMT). This video can not be played We ask an expert: Is a large volcanic eruption inevitable? Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's national disaster agency, said that the ash was being drawn southwest - towards Bali's main airport - by a tropical cyclone in the Indian Ocean. Story behind the spectacular pictures Bali tourism hit by volcano threat The airport on neighbouring Lombok island however has been re-opened, he added. Authorities have also arranged for buses to take tourists to ferry terminals. The volcano is about 70km from the popular tourist areas of Kuta and Seminyak. The disaster agencysaid in a separate statement (in Indonesian),externalthat as of Tuesday morning, the volcano was still emitting thick ash clouds and that ""rays of flares from the glowing lava"" were also observed overnight. Besides ash,streams of rock mixed with water known as lahar,externalhave also been spotted flowing down from the mountain. Officials have warned people to stay away from them. Face masks are also being distributed to help residents cope with the continuous ash fall Officials have told everyone living in a 10km exclusion zone around the volcano to evacuate. Mr Sutopo said that officials faced difficulties estimating the exact number of evacuees given varying population data, but they believe between 90,000 and 100,000 people needed to leave. So far, only 29,000 people had moved to shelters, while others have fled to other places like Lombok, he said. Still, there were ""many people"" who have remained, as some still feel safe while others are unwilling to leave their cattle and fields, he said. Authorities have warned thatthey may forcibly evacuate peopleif they do not move to shelters soon. Rebecca Henschke, BBC News, Bali A large banner reads: ""You're entering active volcanic hazard zone."" But looking around, you wouldn't know. Just behind the sign Seriyani is selling flowers for offers to the Balinese Hindu gods. She says she is worried, but needs to stay here and work to feed the family. ""When it really erupts I will run,"" she says with a nervous laugh. Further in the exclusion zone we find a school open. Here the teacher is showing the children how to put on simple surgical masks. To protect them from the ash, the headmaster tells me. The volcano has been rumbling for weeks now he says so they don't want to move yet and be left in limbo. Authorities say they will force people to evacuate. But those still on the mountain haven't heard that. Are you in the area? Have your travel plans been affected? What are conditions like currently?

"Corgis, camping... seven things we've learnedVideoVideoRoyal engagement gets EastEnders mention","This video can not be played Meghan Markle has revealed that Prince Harry proposed on a Sunday night at home Prince Harry and Meghan Markle havegiven their first interviewsince their engagement was announced. Here are seven things we learned about their relationship. Just weeks after they met, Prince Harry convinced Ms Markle to join him on a trip to Botswana. ""We camped out with each other under the stars,"" the prince said. ""She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic."" He said being away allowed them to get to know each other without the usual pressures of royal life. The prince made sure his fiancee's engagement ring is personal to their relationship. Set in yellow gold - Ms Markle's ""favourite"" - the central diamond is from Botswana, where they first spent significant time together. It is flanked by two stones taken from the collection of Princess Diana, the prince's late mother. The couple spoke of how important it was to include Princess Diana in their engagement. Ms Markle said: ""Not being able to meet his mother, it's so important to me to know that she's a part of this with us."" Prince Harry said his mother would have been ""over the moon, jumping up and down"" at the engagement and ""best friends with Meghan"". ""It's days like this I really miss having her around,"" he added. Ms Markle credited her American background - and lack of exposure to British tabloids - with allowing her to get to know Prince Harry naturally and organically. For his part, the prince had never seen Suits, the American legal drama in which Ms Markle stars, and had never even heard of her before they met.
