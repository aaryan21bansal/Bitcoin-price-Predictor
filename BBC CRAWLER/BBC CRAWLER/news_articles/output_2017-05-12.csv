How Conte turned Chelsea into champions,"This video can not be played Full-time scenes as Chelsea seal title Antonio Conte's transformation of Chelsea from fallen champions to Premier League title winners inside 12 months was completed with victory at West Bromwich Albion - a remarkable success story in his first season at Stamford Bridge. The 47-year-old inherited a squad that had declined from domestic superpower to mid-table mediocrity amid acrimony andthe sackingof title-winning manager Jose Mourinho. But he has shown the personality, tactical brilliance and sure touch to put them back at the top of the English game. So how has the charismatic Italian achieved what many inside Stamford Bridge regard as a miraculous rejuvenation of fortunes to return the Premier League crown to Chelsea? This video can not be played Chelsea found right way to be stronger - Conte The scene is a side room in an Austrian hotel on 16 July 2016. Chelsea's players are coming down from their rooms for a pre-match meal before a friendly against Rapid Vienna, as the Conte reign officially gets under way. In the past, tables would have been laden with chicken, pasta, pizza, sandwiches, scrambled egg and salad - this time Chelsea's squad set eyes on a selection of seeds, nuts and dried fruit. Some players, bemused, turn on their heels and leave, assuming they have wandered into the wrong room rather than a new era. They soon return. Conte, as he has done since day one at Stamford Bridge, outlines in detail and from personal experience why this is happening. He explains how long some food might take to digest, running the risk of players perhaps carrying an extra half a kilo into games. The message was swiftly embraced as players felt fitter, healthier and better equipped for the season ahead. As Chelsea decamped to Los Angeles to continue preparations for the new season, Conte's trademark attention to detail was becoming even more obvious, as the Italian put on tough double sessions, sometimes in 30-degree heat. He proved a hard tactical taskmaster, as opposed to running players into the ground. Conte loves the role of head coach rather than manager. Unlike Mourinho, it was Conte who put out the cones - measuring exact distances - and the emphasis was on drill after drill. It was repetition until Chelsea's players knew exactly what was expected, even using shadow sessions of 11 players against none. Video analysis was, and continues to be, exhaustive as Conte goes through every aspect of Chelsea's training, preparation and games in minute, meticulous detail. Some days Conte was left frustrated that the message was not quite getting across, but on others the signs were there that any initial reservations his players had, inevitable when a new manager arrives, were disappearing. The foundations and building blocks were being put in place for a season of Premier League title-winning success. Reaction: Champion Conte turns sights to Double Quiz: The big goals, the big players - how Chelsea won the title How well do you know Chelsea's champions? This video can not be played Jose Mourinho: How it went wrong at Chelsea When Chelsea technical director Michael Emenalo spoke of ""palpable discord between manager and players"" following the sacking of Mourinho just seven months after winning the title, it underlined the scale of the task that would await his full-time successor. The trustedGuus Hiddinkreturned for a second spell in interim charge as a sticking plaster over the wounds, but at season's end a squad used to success looked broken and lacking in unity as it finished in 10th place. Conte was seen by Chelsea's decision-makers - Emenalo, highly influential director Marina Granovskaia and, of course, owner Roman Abramovich - as a man with a pedigree of success - having won three Scudetto in Italy with Juventus - and the personality to organise and galvanise. It was an impression he confirmed when, after his appointment at Chelsea had been announced, he took what most regarded as an ordinary Italy team to the last eight of Euro 2016,losing on penalties to Germanyafter outstanding wins over Belgium and Spain. Conte, even before Euro 2016, had taken time out from his Italy duties to visit Chelsea's Cobham training base to introduce himself to his future charges. He arrived on one occasion while Hiddink was conducting a training session, but insisted on showing full respect to the veteran Dutch coach, waiting around a corner out of sight until he finished the final 30 minutes' work before introducing himself to the players. Conte was assuming a role that the long list of his predecessors proves is highly demanding, but he has forged a close and productive working relationship with Chelsea's hierarchy. He is in daily contact with Emenalo and speaks regularly to Granovskaia, who is in charge of transfers and heavily involved throughout the club, as well as with Abramovich when the opportunity and occasion arises, as when the Russian billionaire flew in to attend Chelsea's FA Youth Cup final win against Manchester City at Stamford Bridge. Abramovich may have many other demands on his time but still has a major input and involvement in every significant decision taken at the club. Conte is sure to want to refresh and improve his title-winning squad for the added demands of Champions League football next season, so Chelsea's tried and trusted acquisition strategy will be at his full disposal. Gone are the days when the likes of Andriy Shevchenko would arrived gift-wrapped (and in Mourinho's case unappreciated) for a manager. The current system, with Emenalo's scouting network at its hub, involves the manager being presented with a list of long-term club targets, to which he can add his own and even set aside those names he does not require. When Conte makes his moves at the end of the season, withEverton striker Romelu Lukakuheavily linked with a return, they will not be spur-of-the-moment transactions. He will have been a key figure in the drawing up of potential signings. Conte has silenced the sound of palpable discord and it has been a harmonious Chelsea, on and off the pitch, that has secured a richly deserved Premier League title. Podcast: Chelsea are champions A tactically superior display against holders Spain saw Italy reach the quarter-finals of Euro 2016 Italy's over-achievement at Euro 2016 was compelling evidence of how close bonds within a camp can produce results beyond expectation. It is something Conte has brought to Chelsea and placed at the heart of his approach and success. Conte organised a pre-season barbecue for players, staff and families at Cobham. Marquees were erected and a five-a-side pitch set out for the children. It set the tone for the season, with striker Diego Costa spoiling his villainous public image by happily joining in with the youngsters for 40 minutes, during which he was even taken out by a tackle. When pre-season got under way in Austria and LA, Chelsea's support staff were surprised to be singled out for warm handshakes and words every day from a manager intent on providing unity at a club that has had its share of instability, often actually generating renewed success, over the years. At the staff Christmas party, the tradition is for the manager to record a message to be played at the event. Conte duly obliged, but then asked if he could also attend the event for about 500 people at the Under The Bridge music venue at Stamford Bridge, staying for more than two hours, spending time mingling with guests and happily posing for pictures and selfies. He spent a similar amount of time at a trampoline party organised for players' children around the festive period - while staff at Cobham also saw evidence of his personal touch last Christmas. Conte ensured staff received wine and Prosecco, with every bottle personally addressed to the individual as thanks, and accompanied by a card with the words of Hannibal as he prepared to cross the Alps by elephant: ""We shall either find a way or make one."" Conte's seasonal goodwill even extended to the media, with a group invited to a local pub and bought drinks after a pre-match news conference in the build-up to the Boxing Day game with Bournemouth. The irony is the manager intent on developing the Chelsea ""family"" has had to cope for long spells without wife Elisabetta and nine-year-old daughter Vittoria, who have remained in Italy but will soon join him in London. Every month, players and staff will go out together for a meal - but Chelsea's players also know when to keep their distance. Former Chelsea and Scotland winger Pat Nevin witnessed a moment that underlined how Conte, while always available to any player, is not to be trifled with. He told BBC Sport: ""The fun guys at the training ground, the daft ones, David Luiz and Diego Costa, are always having a laugh. ""Costa was sneaking up behind people and throwing big buckets of iced water over them. He was running up behind Antonio and he was going to do the ice bucket over the top and, even though you know Antonio is a good laugh and he was having a joke, he got all the way up then chickened out. ""The players kind of think you're one of them but they're not quite sure. As a manager you've nailed it then - and Conte has nailed it."" This video can not be played Conte interrupts news conference to eat journalist's cake Nevin added: ""I have also spent a couple of hours with him and interviewed him. We spoke before, just chatting, but he is the classic mix in that he can be great fun but then you see the steely eyes and think you wouldn't want to get on the wrong side of him. ""You judge a manager by whether he gets the most out of his players. If you are managing a company, a newspaper, a shop or a football team, your job is to get the best out of your staff. He has done that."" Conte's success has meant the potentially thorny issue of captain John Terry's absence from the team andsubsequent departurehas become an amicable and dignified parting - while a reported training-ground row with Costa in January was handled with the striker left out of the 3-0 win at Leicester City before returning with a goal as Hull City were beaten 2-0. He is close to his players but also prepared to draw the line. As the card in the Christmas present promised, he has found his way at Chelsea. Conte's attention to detail and determination to create the perfect environment at Cobham has produced what he wants most in football - success. Italian journalist Stefano Boldrini, London correspondent for Italian daily Gazzetta dello Sport, told BBC Sport: ""Conte is a person who lives football every hour, every minute of the day. ""Conte thinks about football 48 hours a day. ""He is always focused on his work, not only on the training ground or in his office. When he is at his house in Chelsea he watches football, speaks with his staff. His mind is always on his work. ""It was the same in Italy but this is a new experience. He has had to fight against Jose Mourinho's Manchester United, Pep Guardiola's Manchester City, Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool, Arsenal of Arsene Wenger, Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham. ""He likes the sea and he likes good restaurants but his life is about good football. He is enjoying life in England but Conte does not go into London a lot. His life is Cobham and his house. He is very focused on his work. ""He is a very reserved person. For him it was not easy because in one year he has had to learn English, to learn about English football. I don't know about the future but he is really focused on his work now."" Conte's affection for aspects of English football was demonstrated when he applauded the Middlesbrough fans who continued to support their team even though they were relegated with defeat at Chelsea. Boldrini says: ""I know he is a passionate man but it was fantastic when he went to the Middlesbrough fans to applaud them. It was class behaviour and this is Antonio Conte. ""He loves England. He was celebrating the civilisation of English football with what happened with the Boro fans. It was honest."" The idea of Conte as a reserved figure is at odds with the manic touchline celebrations that saw him swinging from a dugout after Gary Cahill's later winner at Stoke City, and ripping an expensive pair of trousers and injuring his leg in one outpouring of joy earlier this season. Conte, it is believed, finds it awkward to watch those moments back, but it is an insight into the pleasure Chelsea's progress under his tutelage has brought him. This video can not be played Archive: Everybody loves N'Golo: Pundits purr over Kante The transformation in Chelsea's season started to unfold in the corridors at Emirates Stadium after a humbling3-0 loss to Arsenalon 24 September left Conte's side in eighth place, eight points behind leaders Manchester City. Conte was emotional and downcast as he conducted post-match media duties, but he was cold enough to deliver the clearest of messages: ""We must reflect a lot. From the first minute, we have had a bad attitude. ""We are now a great team only on paper not on the pitch. We must show we are a great team on the pitch not on paper."" The loss followed a home defeat by Liverpool in their previous league game that even had some bookmakers suggesting Conte might be an early winner of the managerial sack race. There was no panic behind the scenes. The club's power-brokers had full faith in their manager and he justified their confidence with a tactical switch that turned Chelsea from a team with doubts about its top-six credentials into an all-conquering force en route to the title. Chelsea already had futuredouble player of the year N'Golo Kanteas a brilliant midfield bedrock after hisÂ£30m movefrom Premier League champions Leicester City - but Conte pulled off a strategic coup that was even more audacious. Conte reverted to a three-man central-defensive system for the subsequent 2-0 win at Hull City. It was the first of 13 successive league wins. Chelsea's quality had moved from paper to pitch. New signingMarcos Alonso and the returning Luizwere key figures. Cesar Azpilicueta was part of the central triumvirate but Conte's finest moment may even have come in his reinvention of Victor Moses as a right wing-back of high calibre. Moses had almost become an itinerant footballer, lost and unloved at Chelsea after being signed by Roberto di Matteo from Wigan Athletic for Â£9m in August 2012. He arrived on the same day as Azpilicueta signed from Marseille - but their courses could not have been more different as the 26-year-old spent unspectacular loan spells at Liverpool, Stoke City and West Ham United before Conte spotted something no-one else had uncovered. Moses made 59 league appearances in those three loan seasons, scoring five goals, and had only made 23 appearances with 12 starts for Chelsea before this season, during which he has played 38 times. This video can not be played Nevin: Fabregas sums up Conte's success Nevin said: ""You see he is going 3-4-3 and you know who the wide man in the four is. It is Cesar Azpilicueta - only it isn't. It's Victor Moses. ""I love it and it impresses me so much when managers do things you don't expect. It is also about the player who plays alongside him. ""Moses was often alongside the manager, who was shouting and telling him almost inch by inch where to be, and he also has Azpilicueta beside him who is as good as there is in the business at closing down, getting close to people and not letting crosses in."" And for Boldrini, it is a prime example of Conte's acumen. He says: ""He has been very important for Moses because he hadn't made an impact at Chelsea until Conte came. ""Conte discovered what Moses could do in pre-season and it was a success for Conte because he saw something other managers didn't see."" He added: ""He speaks with every player. Conte has a very good relationship with Cesc Fabregas, who has not played all the time, and he also has a very good relationship with Diego Costa. He has spoken to him a lot of times about his behaviour, to be more focused on the game and not his opponent."" The tactical change was seen as Conte returning to old instincts, but Nevin disagrees: ""Looking historically at what he'd done before to what he does now, he's not a 3-4-3 man. 100% not. ""That worked because he needed to try something else. I'd seen Juventus a lot. I think most people thought they were a 3-5-2, or a version of that, and sometimes a 3-4-3 as well. ""I looked because I wanted to prove to myself how often he played Andrea Barzagli, Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci together and quite often it was four at the back but very adaptable. If he needed it, he could utilise it. ""At heart he wants to play two centre-forwards but when Andrea Pirlo came in at Juve he couldn't play a 4-4-2. You can't do that with Fabregas either because you need two in there like Kante and Nemanja Matic, who can do all the dogged work as well. ""What has interested me is that when he changed to a 3-4-3, which I thought was really quite out there as I didn't see it coming, it worked. I then thought he would change that quite quickly - he didn't."" Nevin has an ominous warning for Chelsea's rivals, saying: ""I actually think you have only seen 20% of his tactical nous. I think you have seen something that has scratched the surface so far."" Has his success surprised his countrymen in Italy? ""Maybe we didn't think he would win in his first year but we were sure he would be a success,"" says Boldrini. ""We knew of his focus and passion and had faith. ""In Italy, the pressure is outside the pitch. In England, the pressure is on the pitch because you play against Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Tottenham, Everton, Liverpool - the pressure is the football and this is the pressure he enjoys and is the big difference between Italy and England."" Chelsea must cope with the added demands of the Champions League next season - and history shows this is not a club or an owner that enters Europe's elite competition to make up the numbers. Conte has won the title with a relatively small squad. He has used 23 players this season so far, equal lowest with Liverpool, Spurs and West Bromwich Albion. Chelsea used 30 players when they won titles in 2004-05 and 2009-10, and 25 in 2005-06 and 2014-15. Conte lost the likes of Branislav Ivanovic, Oscar and Jon Mikel Obi but their absences were compensated for. There has already been speculation about departures this summer. Costa has been linked with a lucrative move to China, and there has been speculation surrounding the future of Fabregas after a season in which he has excelled when called upon but, at 30, could seek more regular football. Lukaku's links with Chelsea, where he may feel he has unfinished business after being sold toEverton for Â£28min 2014, continue, while Real Madrid's Alvaro Morata could be another attacking target. Chelsea will also be in the market for a central defender following Terry's departure, with names such as Southampton's Virgil van Dijk and Napoli's Kalidou Koulibaly on the radar. If Fabregas leaves, Chelsea will surely be in the market for a midfielder, and Tiemoue Bakayoko's excellence as Monaco reached the Champions League semi-final has drawn attention from a host of Europe's top clubs. The FA Youth Cupwas won by Chelsea for a fourth successive season - and fifth time in six - by beating Manchester City, but it remains to be seen if any make the leap to serious senior duty. Nevin is convinced it will be a busy summer for Chelsea, saying: ""I think there is a lot to do. There is no way you will get into the latter reaches of the Champions League and the Premier League with the current squad unless some of the kids step up unbelievably and that's a massive jump, too big. ""Will you keep everybody that's here? Antonio's probably got his eye on four or five and if he gets them there is no reason why he will not continue to be successful.""

Aberdeen 1-3 Celtic,"Champions Celtic scored three times in a blistering opening 11 minutes to overcome Aberdeen at Pittodrie and move to within two games of completing an unbeaten Scottish Premiership season. Dedryck Boyata headed Celtic in front in three minutes, with Stuart Armstrong doubling the lead five minutes later. Leigh Griffiths fired in a third, before Jonny Hayes gave the Dons hope with a curling shot within 60 seconds. But the hosts could not to stop Celtic taking their points tally to 100. This video can not be played Aberdeen 1-3 Celtic: Derek McInnes and Brendan Rodgers post-match interviews Derek McInnes' side may look back ruefully at referee Steven McLean's decision not to award them a penalty when Craig Gordon collided with Graeme Shinnie. But they will likely also reflect on their slow start to a fantastic contest, with Celtic apparently out of sight within 11 minutes. Patrick Roberts signalled an early warning when he escaped and tested Joe Lewis, but that was not heeded and Griffiths' deep corner was headed in by an unchallenged Boyata. Wonderful Griffiths skill created the second, the striker escaping on the right and feeding Callum McGregor. His shot was blocked by Shay Logan, but Armstrong was on hand to slam in a composed finish. It quickly got even worse for Aberdeen. Griffiths turned, fired powerfully from distance and found the net, although Lewis should have done better than help the ball into his top-right corner. Dedryck Boyata opens the scoring after just three minutes It was a devastating start from the champions and the game looked finished. Aberdeen boss McInnes must have feared his side were on course for a damaging hammering in the run up to their meeting with Celtic in the Scottish Cup final. But the Dons showed remarkable strength and ability to claw their way back in. Hayes was the inspiration for a revival when he turned and fired a wonderful left foot shot over Gordon and into the net. Jayden Stockley should have netted a second moments later but his header slid marginally wide. Aberdeen pressed on with confidence and Niall McGinn could only hit straight at Gordon from a great position. It could have been 3-3, or 5-3, with both sides looking likely to score again. Shinnie claimed for a penalty when he nicked the ball before Gordon took him out but referee McLean said no, much to Aberdeen's fury. It looked a spot-kick and could have made such a difference. It was mainly Aberdeen pushing forward in the second period. Kenny McLean should have hit the target when he broke into the box but fired off-target, as did McGinn shortly after. Leigh Griffiths took his goals tally to 16 for the season With the home side unable to turn pressure into goals, Nir Bitton's introduction for Celtic seemed to take the sting out of the game in the latter stages. Both teams have much to ponder before coming together again at Hampden Park; positives and negatives. Aberdeen looked all over the place defensively in the early stages, but responded strongly and caused Celtic problems. From that, they will take great belief. Celtic manager Rodgers will be disappointed at how things panned out after that clinical opening period. His side failed to control long periods of the contest and had to absorb a lot of pressure, which they did, but more than was comfortable. However, the champions did demonstrate that when they fire, they are pretty much unstoppable.

Could women decide Iran's next president?,"Women form nearly half the electorate in Iran When Iranians go to the polls to choose a new president next Friday, all the names on the ballot paper will be male. In the nearly four-decade history of the Islamic Republic, no woman has been allowed to stand for the top office. But it's certainly not for want of trying. This year, 137 women put their names forward. Most famous by far is Azam Taleghani, a 72-year old former MP and daughter of a well-known ayatollah. She has registered to stand in most presidential elections since 1997, determined to challenge the archaic and ambiguous wording of the Iranian constitution which has traditionally been interpreted as meaning only men can become president. Ms Taleghani argues that the criteria can apply to both men and women and that, as an experienced politician, she is eminently qualified. But the electoral supervisory body, the Guardian Council, disagrees and has disqualified her at every attempt. This March, now frail and walking with the help of a frame, Ms Taleghani once again determinedly made her way up the stone steps of the interior ministry to register. And once again she failed to qualify. Women's civil liberties are curtailed in Iran Even though they are not allowed to stand, women comprise just under half the electorate, so their vote is important and presidential candidates usually make an effort to reach out to them. Early on in the campaign the incumbent, President Hassan Rouhani, posted a photo of himself on social media which caused a flurry of comment. He was out on a weekend walk in the mountains standing next to two young female hikers, both of whose hijab is far from what would be considered proper by the hardliners. It was a clear message to young, modern female voters, that he was the candidate who was not overly bothered about the country's restrictive dress code and other curbs on social freedom. President Rouhani (left) was pictured with casually dressed women Mr Rouhani's campaign video makes a point of praising Iranian women's achievements in the worlds of both work and sport, and offering his support. He is also the only candidate so far to have held a rally specifically for female voters. He was given a rapturous welcome by thousands of young women gathered at Tehran's Shiroudi stadium this week. Many were wearing purple headscarves - the colour of his campaign - and many held placards demanding more rights and freedoms. Women are poorly represented in politics and government in Iran Well-known MP Parvaneh Salahshouri was cheered when she told the crowd that the morality police should leave women alone and focus on fighting corruption instead. Flanked by female MPs, Mr Rouhani took to the stage and indirectly rebuked his hardline rival Ebrahim Raisi over the conservatives' view that women's employment is less important than their role as wives and mothers. ""Aren't you the one trying to stop women from going out to work?"" he asked.  ""If you really believe in female employment then why haven't you done anything about it?"" Why the Iranian elections matter Iran elections: Six things to know The six men fighting to lead Iran Economy the critical election issue Will Iran turn its back on the West? As an ultra-conservative, Mr Raisi clearly has a harder job appealing to young, modern-minded female voters. But that hasn't stopped him from trying. On the campaign trail he makes frequent mention of his wife - who has a PhD and is a university professor. ""I don't mind eating a cold dinner when my wife has to work late,"" he told a journalist recently. Mr Raisi's critics are sceptical about his sudden interest in women's rights. A photograph of a recent campaign rally in which his supporters are clearly segregated by gender, has prompted much mockery from moderates. Hardline candidate Ebrahim Raisi has also been courting the female vote Many suspect Mr Raisi's real views are actually closer to those of the man he's widely tipped to succeed Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei. Mr Khamenei is famous for dismissing gender equality as a ""failed Western idea"", and stressing the importance of Iranian women's role in the home and family. The other key candidate in this race, Tehran Mayor Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, is also using social media to reach out to women. He recently posted a photo of himself surrounded by young ethnic Kurds, including girls wearing colourful headscarves with their hair clearly visible. But on social media he has been constantly reminded of his past proposals to segregate men and women in the workplace in Tehran. And President Rouhani has made several swipes at him for the same reason. Alongside the presidential poll, voters will also be electing new local councils and here women are involved and having more impact. Record numbers of women won seats in local elections four years ago, and many are hoping to repeat that achievement this time round. Overall representation by women both in local councils and in parliament is still low - Iran ranks 177 out of 193 on the United Nation's 2017Women in Politics,externalreport. But the involvement of women on local councils has made an impact and it is here that they are clearly able to make a difference. Iranian women are politically active in local councils Back on the campaign trail in Tehran women voters are listening hard to the pledges now being made to them by the candidates. Many are wondering whether the rhetoric will translate into policies that will really address the many pressures of their everyday lives. Veteran would-be presidential candidate Azam Taleghani has been taking part in an election meeting at Amir Kabir university. She pledged to continue her campaign for women to be allowed to stand for president, but said that this time round she would be casting her vote for President Rouhani. ""Maybe we will never have a female president,"" she told students, ""But it doesn't mean the right to stand should be taken away from us."" Will Iran turn its back on the West?

A Russian honeytrap for Gen Flynn? Not me...,"When Svetlana Lokhova saw the internet light up with suggestions she was a Russian spy, she initially thought it was a joke. But the Russian-born academic soon found herself, in her words, ""collateral damage"" in the controversies surrounding the Trump administration and the swirl of allegations about Russian espionage. The claims revolved around her contact with Gen Michael Flynn in Cambridge in 2014. Flynn resigned after just 24 days as US National Security Adviser after allegations he had failed to be honest about contacts with the Russian Ambassador to the US during the transition to the Trump administration. After his resignation in February, there were reports in the US and UK media about Lokhova, including the claim that Flynn's contact with Lokhova ""troubled,external"" US intelligence officials. On social media, thesuggestion,externalwas that she was some kind of Russian spy or honeytrap. Michael Flynn resigned as President Trump's National Security Adviser after just 23 days ""Are you a Russian spy?"" I begin by asking her. ""Absolutely not,"" she replies. ""I have no formal or informal connection with Russian intelligence whatsoever."" She acknowledges that the cynical will respond: ""She would say that wouldn't she"" - which has left her in what she describes as a ""Kafkaesque situation""'. The context of the story, she acknowledges, was part of the problem. She is female, originally from Russia and linked to Cambridge, home of the famous Cambridge spy ring recruited by the KGB in the 1930s. ""There is a sad irony that someone who is writing about Cambridge traitors ended up being painted as one herself,"" she says. The story begins with a dinner in February 2014 in Cambridge. The dinner was organised by Sir Richard Dearlove, former head of MI6 and then master of Pembroke College, who was starting up an organisation called the Cambridge Security Initiative (CSI). Also involved was Christopher Andrew, authorised historian of MI5 and a professor at Corpus Christi College. The guest of honour at the dinner - which had around a dozen or so attendees - was Flynn, then head of America's Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The aim was to build a relationship between CSI and DIA ahead of a conference the following year, says Lokhova. ""The hope by DIA was that by visiting top universities in Europe they would be able to spot people who would be able to help or assist their organisation,"" she says. At the dinner she was seated a fair distance away from Flynn. After more senior officials had talked, junior members were asked to talk about their research. As an expert on Soviet intelligence in the 1930s, Lokhova says she was asked to present some of her research. ""The idea was that I would impress the DIA with the Cambridge pedigree of research."" Lokhova showed Flynn a 1912 postcard from Stalin to the fiancee of his best friend. The fiancee was helping Stalin obtain a fake passport to escape surveillance when he was an early revolutionary working against the Tsarist regime. ""The first reaction was that of amusement,"" Lokhova says. She translated the document and explained how it showed that Stalin was the most spied-upon leader in history as well as the one who later spied on people the most. She says Flynn asked her to send the document to him. This was because he was expecting some senior officials visiting Washington from Russia. At this point, there was a move towards trying to increase co-operation with Russia in the field of counter-terrorism, as it had recently emerged that those involved in the 2013 Boston bombing had been known to the Russians. Lokhova says both Flynn and his assistant provided their emails, looking forward to using the postcard to break the ice when the Russian officials arrived in Washington. Claims she was asked to travel to Russia and act as his translator, Lokhova says, are not true. She says she exchanged some emails with Flynn and his assistant after the event, although Flynn soon after left the DIA, after reportedly being forced out. ""We had maybe a few emails going backwards and forwards,"" Lokhova says. These included details of events at Cambridge. She says Flynn was also interested in Russian espionage and she sent hima BBC story(written by myself, in which I had interviewed Lokhova) about a ""sixth man"" in the Cambridge spy ring. ""Gen Flynn replied to me saying how it is important to keep exposing espionage and making it accessible to not just intelligence officials but regular people."" US media claimed the problem for Flynn may have been that he should have declared his contact with Lokhova as a Russian. British media then followed up on the Cambridge connection saying that both the CIA and FBI were discussing this episode. A lawyer for Flynn declined to comment. Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence with Michael Flynn On social media and websites, people went further, saying that Lokhova was a Russian spy or agent targeting Flynn. That led to a flurry of further press interest and journalists outside her house and asking friends and neighbours if she was a spy. She moved out of her flat to avoid them. She says the accusation that she recruited Flynn - under the eyes of a former head of MI6 and the official historian of MI5 - is ludicrous. ""Apparently I managed to turn General Flynn in 15 minutes with a postcard which Josef Stalin sent in 1912,"" she says. ""If I did recruit Flynn that would have been one of the greatest - if not the greatest - Russian coup of all times. So it is utterly ridiculous, totally unbelievable. But, for some reason, the world today is such that people buy it."" Lokhova was born in Russia but took British citizenship soon after coming to the UK in 1998 (whilst retaining her Russian citizenship). ""I am British and I have a British passportâ¦ If I were indeed a Russian spy that would make me a traitorâ¦ For me, it's very normal to have contact with current and former intelligence officials because of the field I am in,"" she says, denying reports she has any kind of ""special access"" to Russian intelligence archives. ""It is absolutely not the case,"" she says. Jack Barsky died in September 1955, at the age of 10, and was buried in the Mount Lebanon Cemetery in the suburbs of Washington DC. His name is on the passport of the man sitting before me now - a youthful 67-year-old East German, born Albert Dittrich. The passport is not a fake. (January 2017) The KGB spy who lived the American dream On the contrary, she says that because of her work with Prof Andrew, who has worked with defectors from the Soviet Union such as former KGB archivist Vasily Mitrokhin, who smuggled out its secrets, she is viewed with suspicion in Russia. ""In Britain, I am now being accused of being a Russian spy. In Russia, some think I am a British spy. And I am neither. I am just a historian who writes about an area that has become incredibly politicised."" ""My life has been completely changed by this,"" says Lokhova, who gave birth to her first child just before the reports emerged this year. She says she became worried about being followed and also nervous of speaking on the phone or meeting friends, unsure if they suspected her of being a spy. She had already been involved in a public row with her former employers - a Russian bank - against whom shewon an employment tribunaland was clearly left bruised by the experience of being drawn into a spy row. ""I felt betrayed that suddenly I had been turned on in such a horrible way forâ¦ attending a dinner to help Western intelligence services understand Russia better.""

Reality Check: Who loves the UK at Eurovision?,"It's Eurovision time again, which means it's time to take the voting very personally indeed. Who is rejecting the UK's tunes and who is telling us we're not alone? Downloading the voting from fan siteeschome.net,externalyou can find out how many points all other countries have given the UK at Eurovision since it started in 1957. A continuous data set is tricky because of rule changes over the years, especially last year when telephone votes were separated from jury votes, increasing the number of votes available. Also, not all of the countries that participated in the early days have survived to the end. But some steps may be taken to check the facts on the site, for example, it gives the total number of votes received by the UK as 3,911, which is confirmed bythe official Eurovision site.,external Nonetheless, by dividing the number of points given to the UK by the number of times a country has participated we can find out who our real friends are. We're excluding countries that have participated fewer than five times, although Morocco deserves a special mention having only appeared once in 1980, when it gave the UK and the song Love Enough for Two a creditable eight points. That's even better than honorary Europeans Australia, who gave the UK eight points in one of the two years it has participated. This video can not be played Lucie Jones performs Never Give Up On You, the UK's entry for the 2017 Eurovision Song Contest. So, excluding the occasional contestants, our best friends are Luxembourg, which has averaged a touch under five points per contest. Luxembourg was one of the original participants in Eurovision but has not taken part since 1993. Sadly the love was not reciprocated, with the UK giving Luxembourg only an average of 2.5 points per contest. Luxembourg is closely followed by Malta and then Ireland, which is widely seen as our best Eurovision friend because it has given the UK the most points overall in the history of the competition. The UK has given Ireland an average of almost 5.5 points in finals. Completing the top 10 in order are: Austria, Israel, Switzerland, Turkey, Portugal, Yugoslavia (which competed 27 times before it was broken up) and Monaco. At the bottom end, the country that has snubbed the UK the most consistently is Montenegro, which has failed to give the UK a single point in the eight times it has participated. The other countries averaging less than one point per contest are Moldova, Belarus, Georgia, this year's hosts Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Armenia. Clearly, those countries that have been withholding their love from the UK are relative newcomers to the competition, with all of them having competed fewer than 15 times. Among the seven countries that participated in the first contest, the least love has been shown by the Netherlands, which is halfway down the list, having given the UK an average of 2.7 points per contest.

The maps that show how France voted and why,"At 39, Emmanuel Macron will be sworn in as France's youngest president after a landslide victory over far-right leader Marine Le Pen. Voterschose a man who had never held elected officebut they also backed the National Front in record numbers. The election left France's decades-oldSocialist and Republican political elite reeling, and became a choice between a relative novice from the centre of politics and a populist agenda. In his victory speech, Mr Macron told his fellow countrymen and women that France had turned a new page and spoke of ""hope and renewed trust"". He has promised a new, dynamic France that is both socially and business-friendly. Half of his candidates for next month's parliamentary elections are women, half are from civil society. So, how did Mr Macron win the race for the presidency? He swept the board geographically, with Marine Le Pen winning just two of France's 107 departments. He won the first round well ahead of the other candidates and attracted voters from many of those he had defeated. His opponent's backing remained largely confined to her traditional strongholds in France's north, north-east and south-east. What are Macron's plans for France? Meteoric rise of Macron Five reasons he won The two departments won by Ms Le Pen were both in the north. But even here, the vote was very close. She won with 52.9% in Aisne and by a slightly smaller margin in the coastal Pas de Calais region. Most of France and all of the country's overseas territories voted for Emmanuel Macron Each of France's 107 departments is made up of a number of smaller administrative areas, known as communes. Emmanuel Macron attracted more than 80% of the vote in more than 1,000 communes across France. By comparison, Ms Le Pen scored more than 80% in just 30 communes, most spread across the north. Mr Macron scored best in the big cities, including Paris where nine out of 10 voters backed him. It was his strongest area of support. In contrast, Ms Le Pen's biggest support came from the countryside. The department of Gironde, on the west coast, illustrates this split between voters. Although Emmanuel Macron won the department with more than 70% of the vote, most of his supporters were concentrated in the city of Bordeaux. Marine Le Pen scored better in the more rural areas. What does Marine Le Pen do now? The National Front has traditionally done well in northern France  - in places where traditional industries have been on the decline. Ms Le Pen took Pas de Calais, which includes the port of Calais, with 52.1% of the vote. The town used to be known for its lace-making, but cheap imports have led to the industry's decline. Here, it seems, her promise to put France first struck a chord with voters. In the south-eastern department of Var, where Toulon elected France's first National Front mayor in 1995, the FN has traditionally scored highly. But Marine Le Pen failed to make the breakthrough she needed in the second round, with Mr Macron taking 50.9% of the vote. Two of the biggest factors that won the two candidates support were employment and education. Marine Le Pen won strongest support in areas with high jobless rates and low wages where she campaigned to stop immigration and renegotiate France's relationship with the European Union. The two departments where she won, Pas de Calais and Aisne, had unemployment rates of 12.2% and 13.8% respectively in the last quarter of 2016 - well above the national rate of 10%. Meanwhile, Mr Macron is said to have won support among voters with higher levels of educational attainment, which helps to explain why he did so well in Paris. A 2012 survey byofficial French statistical agency Insee,externalfound that more than half the residents of Ile de France in the 25-34 age bracket had a postgraduate qualification, or were studying for one. Although Ms Le Pen lost the election, support for the National Front in the first round of voting was up on previous contests. In fact, the party's vote share in the first round has increased in four of the five presidential elections since 1995. Ms Le Pen will be hoping to build on that support ahead of the country's parliamentary elections in June. Her party currently has only two seats in the 577-seat national assembly, but she is hoping to win up to 15. Mr Macron, in his victory speech, may well have been looking ahead to his next battle with the FN when he said: ""I will fight with all my power against the divisions that undermine us, and which are tearing us apart.""

5 ways Jessica Chastain wants Hollywood to change,"Chastain plays the lead role in Miss Sloane, which is released in the UK this weekend It's difficult to find a more varied CV in Hollywood than Jessica Chastain's. She's played a CIA analyst in Zero Dark Thirty, a housewife in The Help and is about to be seen as a ruthless lobbyist in political thriller Miss Sloane. But having worked in the industry for well over a decade, Chastain says she remains disappointed by many aspects of Hollywood. The actress spoke to BBC News during a visit to London last week, and shared her thoughts on what exactly needs to change. Obviously all actors dislike bad reviews, but Chastain's problem is a little more specific - she thinks some critics are too close-minded. ""I had a lot of problems with Zero Dark Thirty and some reviews of Miss Sloane,"" she says. ""[Some reviews] said 'Yes it's a great character, but why can't she be a woman, why does she have to be so masculine?'. ""And I want to go back to those people and say Elizabeth Sloane is a woman, so that makes her feminine. ""Femininity for each person is whatever they define it to be, and to say that femininity is to be soft, kind, loving, compassionate and weak, and masculinity is aggression, power, ambition and strength - [we're in] 2017 and we need to move away from that."" This video can not be played Jessica Chastain reacts to some interesting news about Johnny Depp Earlier this month, Johnny Depp's former managersclaimedthe actor is often fed his lines through an earpiece instead of actually learning them. Chastain had, err, an interesting reaction to this when we mentioned it to her (see the video above). And it's fair to say her policy for learning the huge amount of dialogue in Miss Sloane was slightly different to Depp's. ""My technique is working hard,"" she says simply. ""So on the weekends before I go into my work week I spend my entire day working on a script. ""I couldn't search for my lines, it had to be cold, it had to be second nature, and the only way to get that is to spend the hours doing it."" A third Pitch Perfect film is currently being made after the huge success of the first two You could certainly argue that Hollywood has come along way since Chastain's 2009 film The Help, which had an all-female principle cast. Since then, we've seen films with female ensemble casts slay the box office - such as Bridesmaids, Ghostbusters and Pitch Perfect. But, in the grand scheme of things, such films are still few and far between, perhaps because of Hollywood's reluctance to put women centre stage. ""It's so old-fashioned, we don't have very many of them,"" Chastain says. She points out: ""Films with male ensembles don't work all the time and no-one talks about it."" ""So I think we need to acknowledge that movies with female ensembles have a greater chance of making money than movies with male ensembles, and it's because the audience wants diversity in their storytelling - they want stories they haven't seen before."" Mark Strong co-stars in Miss Sloane alongside Chastain Diversity has been a hot topic in Hollywood for some time, not least with#OscarsSoWhiteand the move by some awards ceremonies to scrapgender-specific categories. It's become fashionable for actors and industry types to back campaigns for more diversity, but Chastain thinks not enough people are putting their money where their mouth is. ""I think there's a lot of talk going on, but if you're part of the industry you're part of the problem, so you need to put your talk into action,"" she says. ""It's not enough to say 'Oh there's a wage gap' and 'Oh only 7% of American film directors are women', you have to say, 'Well if I'm part of the industry I'm part of the problem, what can I do to help?'. ""And so I'm doing whatever I can to work with female film-makers. I'm always speaking up whenever I see an injustice. I'm always doing whatever I can to create opportunities for people who haven't had a voice in American cinema. She's not kidding - one of Chastain's most recent films was The Zookeeper's Wife, directed by Niki Caro, whorecently becameonly the fifth woman to direct a film budgeted at more than $100m. ""I feel like 'okay I'm doing my part', but everyone needs to do their part and once we do we're going to hopefully have a more balanced industry,"" Chastain adds. Chastain plays the lead role in political thriller Miss Sloane Chastain's character in Miss Sloane is ruthless, tough and smart - a role she thinks will help audiences start to see female characters in a new way. ""I was really excited about playing the smartest person in the room, I knew it was going to be a big challenge,"" Chastain says of the role. ""I liked to play a character who shattered a stereotype of what a woman is supposed to be. ""I think an audience isn't used to seeing a woman who isn't a caregiver. Society expects women to be the nurturers of their families and to be mothers and to want that - and Elizabeth Sloane doesn't want that. Miss Sloane is released in UK cinemas this weekend.

Trump quietly mulled over FBI bombshell,"How US President Donald Trump spent his time before the firing of the FBI director - quietly and away from the public - sheds light on his decision-making. In the days leading up to the president's momentous decision to fire FBI director James Comey, President Trump spent his time with members of his family and close aides. The group didn't include his high-profile senior advisors, revealing the way that he was tightening the circle of trust before the bombshell announcement. Earlier this month Comey spoke with Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, about the investigation into Russia's attempts to interfere in the November election. Comey made it clear that he was working hard on the investigation and had no plans to drop the matter or go easy on the president. Comey also spoke with lawmakers about the bureau's investigation into the Russians, and about its investigation into the emails of Hillary Clinton. On 3 May he told members of Congress that he felt he'd approached both investigations in an impartial manner. This video can not be played What do Trump supporters think about Comey's firing? This did not sit well with the president, who was hoping that the investigation into his past ties with Russia would be dropped. Trump had expected Comey to make a public statement saying there was no investigation of him. He'd made sure Comey knew he was hoping for that statement, but Comey had refused to do it. That had gnawed away at Trump over recent weeks. Trump became even more wary when Comey testified before Congress on 3 May. The president, as White House officials explained later, was inclined to remove him from his post. In a termination letter written to the FBI director, the president laid out his complaint and explained the rationale for his firing: ""While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgement of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau."" Five days earlier - the day after Comey spoke with members of Congress - the president left on a trip to New York and then headed to New Jersey. For three days - from Thursday night until Sunday - the president was not seen by the public. He was staying at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, not far from New York City. Trump appeared before the press on Sunday 7 May, after three days out of the spotlight. While the president was spending time at his club, other members of the press pool and I - a small group of reporters who are responsible for tracking the president's activities on a daily basis - were waiting around in a hotel in nearby Branchburg. We weren't allowed to visit the resort. Instead White House officials would occasionally stop by the hotel and tell us that the president was having meetings - but wouldn't tell us with whom or what about. Presidents - like everybody else - like to have down time and relax. They're also free to work wherever they want. But it was unusual for a president to disappear from the public for this long and without a more detailed explanation from his aides about his activities. As it turned out, he was thinking about the FBI director - and the possibility of his ouster. On Sunday evening Trump rode in a motorcade through New Jersey, driving past red barns and horse pastures, but he was in a dark vehicle and couldn't be seen. Then he got on Air Force One to fly from New Jersey to Washington. That's when members of the press saw him for the first time since Thursday. He and his daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared Kushner were seated in a cabin in the front of the aeroplane. KT McFarland, the deputy national security adviser, was on the flight. Stephen Miller, wearing a navy jacket and a white shirt with no tie, paced around the cabin. I didn't see HR McMaster, the national security adviser, or Stephen Bannon, the chief White House strategist. I was surprised because on most of the trips I'd gone on with the president, I'd seen Bannon on the aeroplane. That evening I was sitting in the back of the aeroplane with the other reporters, and someone told me that Trump waved at us. During the short flight, the people in the front of the cabin were laughing and joking around. Reporters and staff wait on the tarmac at Join Base Andrews on Sunday Then the aeroplane landed - and something seemed wrong. Kushner and his family came downstairs and headed towards a dark sedan, but the president didn't. Members of the travelling press pool wait until the president gets off the plane and gets on his helicopter, Marine One, before they leave the tarmac - and so I stood there. It was cold and blustery, and I spent a long time looking at the windows of the aeroplane and trying to figure out what was going on. We were there for so long that even the Secret Service agents started to look bored. One of them yawned. I asked White House aides about the delay, and they told me the president was in a meeting. ""He didn't want to break it off,"" one of the aides told me later. While we waited on the tarmac, an aide carried two or three golf clubs down the stairs, holding them close to his side so they'd be less visible. (Still they clanked together as he walked down the stairs - it's hard to hide golf clubs.) At one point Kushner went back up the stairs of the plane. Every family has a mediator, someone who calms everyone else down, and he seems to play that role. After a while he came down the stairs again. ""Everything's OK,"" Kushner told me, talking about the president and his reasons for staying the plane. ""He was just working on something."" Finally - after 45 minutes - Trump came out. He wasn't wearing a tie, and his hair looked messy. He gripped the handrail and walked down the stairs and headed for Marine Force One and back to the White House. I'm still not sure whom the president was meeting with on the plane or why the meeting was so important that it couldn't be interrupted when the plane landed. McFarland wasn't in the meeting - at least I don't think she was. I could see her walking past the windows of the plane. White House officials haven't provided me with more of an explanation for what was happening on the plane. One thing seemed clear, though: the president was preparing for the important announcement about the FBI director in a safe, cloistered environment, an atmosphere in which he was unlikely to be challenged in a dramatic way. That changed, of course, on Tuesday when Comey was sacked, and people outside the president's circle found out about the president's plans. The relaxed, contemplative world that he'd created had come to an end. Unlike previous presidents, he does not seem to have an established system either for his decision-making or for the rollout of major announcements. Trump may have thought long and hard about the termination of Comey, but analysts said that he didn't lay the groundwork for what would happen next. ""You'd think if you're going to fire someone, you'd have a successor lined up,"" said David Greenberg, the author of Nixon's Shadow: The History of an Image. Right now the search is on for a new FBI director: stay tuned. Some Republicans irked by Comey firing. Video, 00:01:16Some Republicans irked by Comey firing Will Comey sacking embolden autocrats?

China's big push for its global trade narrative,"China's President Xi Jinping intends to tell you a story. But first he's going to try it out on the world's political leaders. Not those of the United States, Japan, India or much of the European Union. They've declined the invitation. But this weekend Mr Xi is gathering all the presidents and prime ministers he can muster in Beijing, hoping to inspire them with a vision about China as a force for good in the world. Xi Jinping came to power five years ago with a determination that China should stop hiding its light under a bushel. Instead of creeping up timidly on the world order, he felt it should walk tall as a mighty and ancient civilisation which had gone from marginal economic player to the world's biggest trading nation in less than four decades. ""The relationship between China and the rest of the world is undergoing historic changes. Tell China stories well,"" he urged the nation's media, diplomats and think tanks, adding that they must present China as a builder of world peace and contributor to global development. This weekend he himself takes the stage as storyteller in chief at Beijing's Belt and Road Forum. It helps that there is currently no competing global narrative from the United States or the European Union, as President Trump turns inward to ""Make America Great Again"" and the EU struggles with Brexit and a slew of other challenges. China's underlying narrative is well known to all Mr Xi's guests. Economic transformation and breakneck growth have returned it to its traditional position at the centre of the East Asian economy. This video can not be played What China's One Belt, One Road really means And now Mr Xi wants to use Chinese money and construction might to rebuild much of Eurasia's infrastructure of ports, roads and rails and put China at its heart. A giant exercise in joining the dots whose buzzword is connectivity. Critics in Washington, Tokyo and New Delhi observe that some of the biggest belt and road projects seem to be for strategically significant assets. Like the oil and gas pipelines across Central Asia, and the Indian Ocean ports in Pakistan and Sri Lanka which might serve military as well as commercial uses. Many observers see an obvious geopolitical agenda to the belt and road initiative, but in a suspicious and prickly neighbourhood China firmly denies it. To make the plan less threatening, it frames it as a revival of the ancient Silk Road whose camel caravans carried Chinese goods west across Asia more than 1,000 years ago. China seeks to boost its connection with global markets The aim is a soft-power message of a China which is mighty but peaceful, delivering what it can to the world in exchanges of mutual benefit. But the belt and road is much more ambitious than a camel caravan. By land and by sea, through transport networks, telecoms, energy pipelines and industrial hubs, it promises to integrate more than 60 countries and 60% of the world's population. And for domestic Chinese audiences, the story of the belt and road is told with a different emphasis, focusing less on the wins for foreigners and more on opportunities for China's impoverished west and assisting China's push up the value chain into industries like high speed rail and nuclear power. There's even a narrative aimed at foreign children. Mr Xi may be the headline act on stage this weekend but in the scramble to offer the warm up, the state-owned China Daily newspaper is running online videos of an American father telling his daughterbedtime stories about the belt and road,externalas ""China's idea which belongs to the world"". The video insists that it's a win-win project And in a catchy music video, ukulele strumming multi-ethnic children surrounded by cut-out camels sing the praises of the belt and road. ""We're paving new roads, building more ports, finding new options with friends of all sorts, It's a culture exchange, we trade in our wealth, we connect with our hearts, it strengthens our health,"" it goes. Mr Xi has been telling the belt and road story for four years now. Why gather the world's decision makers in Beijing for a grand rendition now? One short answer is that he needs to drum up growth.China's domestic economy is slowingand exporting Chinese construction capacity to the belt and road would help boost the domestic economy in the short and medium term. If even some of the infrastructure projects succeed, they might in turn contribute to growth in the long term by spurring demand from China's neighbours. But a more personal reason for the timing is Mr Xi's own political cycle. In the one-party state, being Communist Party leader is more important than being president and this year China will hold a vital Party Congress. Hosting the world this weekend burnishes Xi Jinping's aura of invincibility by reminding his party and public that he is increasing China's clout on the international stage. President Xi is happy to step in as the US becomes more isolationist A third reason for the timing is the international picture. Many of America's friends and allies in the region were dismayed by Mr Trump's decision to walk away from the TPP trade agreement, an agreement which his predecessor had said was vital to the US setting the rules of the road in Asia rather than letting China set them. Mr Xi's new push for the belt and road initiative is the same kind of canny political opportunism that spurredhis defence of globalisationat the Davos forum in January. So China's president has been lucky in his timing and bold in seizing the stage. And it will certainly look to his guests as if he usually gets what he wants. No country puts on a grand spectacle of purpose and progress quite like China does. This weekend Beijing's sky will be blue. Smog, traffic snarl and ghost towns littered with white elephant infrastructure will be safely far from view. This is the show and tell of Xi Jinping's storyâ¦ China the can-do master builder inspiring awe in all beholders and giving hope that what China has achieved at home it might replicate elsewhere. But the truth is that Mr Xi's will works as an organising principle only for some of the people some of the time, and usually only for a very small number of highly specific objectives. Even in Beijing, the sky is not always blue, the traffic is often snarled and resources are often misallocated. How much more is this true beyond the glittering capital. China is an economy with a perilous debt overhang precisely because its investors are just as fallible as those of other countries. Yes, on the right project and for the right price, Chinese money and Chinese master builders can work infrastructure wonders. But that was always the case. The belt and road is an important initiative, but one of indeterminate boundaries, duration and outcome. Mr Xi's guests should not make the mistake of thinking all Chinese players will do his bidding and all bedtime stories will come true.

Explaining the global malware outbreak,"Experts are warning that there could be further ransomware cases this week after the global cyber-attack. So, what has happened and how can organisations and individuals protect themselves from such attacks? Ransomware - a malicious program that locks a computer's files until a ransom is paid - is not new but the size of this attack by the WannaCry malware is ""unprecedented"", according to EU police body Europol. It said on Sunday that there were believed to be more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries. However, that figure is likely to grow as people switch on their computers on Monday if their IT has not been updated and their security systems patched over the weekend. There are also many other strains of ransomware which cyber-security experts say they are seeing being given new leases of life. In the UK, the NHS was hit hard, but by Saturday morning the majority of the 48 affected health trusts in England had their machines back in operation. The NHS has not yet revealed what steps it took. The malware has not proved hugely profitable for its owners so far. The wallets set up to receive ransom payments  - $300 (Â£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin was demanded for each infected machine - contained about $30,000 when seen by the BBC. This suggests that most victims have not paid up. WannaCry infects only machines running Windows operating systems. If you do not update Windows, and do not take care when opening and reading emails, then you could be at risk. However, home users are generally believed to be at low risk to this particular strain. You can protect yourself by running updates, using firewalls and anti-virus software and by being wary when reading emailed messages. Regularly back up your data so you can restore files without having to pay up should you be infected, as there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will result in your files being unlocked. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre websitecontains advice,externalon how to apply the patch to stop the ransomware - MS17-010 - and what to do if you can't. The culprit is malware called WannaCry and seems to have spread via a type of computer malware known as a worm. Unlike many other malicious programs, this one has the ability to move around a network by itself. Most others rely on humans to spread by tricking them into clicking on an attachment harbouring the attack code. The ransomware has been identified as WannaCry Once WannaCry is inside an organisation, it will hunt down vulnerable machines and infect them too. This perhaps explains why its impact is so public - because large numbers of machines at each victim organisation are being compromised. It has been described as spreading like the vomiting bug norovirus. In March, Microsoft issued a free patch for the weakness that has been exploited by the ransomware. WannaCry seems to be built to exploit a bug found by the US National Security Agency. When details of the bug were leaked, many security researchers predicted it would lead to the creation of self-starting ransomware worms. It may, then, have taken only a couple of months for malicious hackers to make good on that prediction. It was originally thought that a number of victims were using Windows XP, a very old version of the Windows operating system that is no longer supported by Microsoft. However, according to cyber-security expert Alan Woodward, from Surrey University, the latest statistics suggest this figure is actually very small. Large organisations have to test that security patches issued by the provider of their operating systems will not interfere with the running of their networks before they are applied, which can delay them being installed quickly. It's not yet known, but some experts are saying that it was not particularly sophisticated malware. The ""kill switch""  that stopped it spreading -accidentally discovered by a security researcher- may have been intended to stop the malware working if captured and put in what's called a sandbox - a safe place where security experts put computer malware to watch what they do - but not applied properly. Ransomware has been a firm favourite of cyber-thieves for some time as it lets them profit quickly from an infection. They can cash out easily thanks to the use of the Bitcoin virtual currency, which is difficult to trace. However it's unusual for an expert criminal gang to use so few Bitcoin wallets to collect their ransom demands - as in this case - as the more wallets there are, the more difficult the gang is to trace.

Is Harry Styles' album worth the wait?,"The album is themed around the colour pink, in a nod to The Clash's Paul Simonon, who said: ""Pink is the only true rock and roll colour."" ""I wanted to see if I could write something that people liked, without knowing everything about me,"" says Harry Styles in a documentary about the making of his first solo record. Of course, the number of people who are unfamiliar with former One Direction heartthrob and paparazzi magnet Harold Edward Styles, are few and far between - but in accordance with boy band tradition, he's wiped the slate clean for his solo debut. The first single,Sign of the Times,external, is a billowing rock ballad about a woman dying during childbirth (yes, really), adorned with blazing guitar solos and a choir singing from the gates of heaven. Stylophiles will know it's the sort of song he's wanted to make for years - having worked with Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody as far back as 2013 - but there's always a delicate balance between establishing your musical credentials and subliminally telling fans, ""That pop music? The stuff that soundtracked your life? I thought it was naff."" So far he's gotten away with it. Sign of the Times went to number one and his self-titled album will undoubtedly punch an Ed Sheeran-sized hole in the charts next week. But the real test is whether those songs will stick around the week after that, and the week after that. The album is a mixed bag - good, odd, awkward, clever and heavily indebted to 1970s soft rock. Here's our verdict on the 10 tracks. The album was released on Friday 12 May Harry counts in the opening song - ""2... 3... 4..."" - because that is how real musicians do it. The band come in with a gentle finger-picked guitar and a few ambient synth bleeps as Harry's drowsy lyric establishes the album's main theme - two lovers who have fallen out of sync with each other. ""Maybe we'll work it out,"" he sings in the chorus. ""I gotta get better."" It's a strong, confident opening that sets the tone for what follows. You know this one already - a weepy, six-minute piano ballad that nods to Queen, Bowie and Prince, with a rather unconventional lyric. ""The song is written from a point of view as if a mother was giving birth to a child and there's a complication,""Harry told Rolling Stone,external. ""The mother is told, 'The child is fine, but you're not going to make it.' The mother has five minutes to tell the child, 'Go forth and conquer.'"" We're not sure why she sings about ""running away from the bullets"", though. Harry Styles recorded the album in Jamaica and California last year After two pensive ballads, this pulse-raising rock number is a breath of fresh air. With its snaky bassline and Muppety ""la la la"" backing vocals, it sounds very much like Wings playing Stuck in the Middle With You. Speaking of which, the pedigree of Harry's influences can't be faulted on this album - he's delved into rock's back catalogue for sustenance and, while he sometimes fails to put his stamp on those influences, his love of the music shines through. This one features some of his best lyrics so far, about a girl who ""gets into parties without invitations"". ""How could I tell her what I think about her?"" he sings. ""Well, I guess she just found out."" This video can not be played Is Harry Styles singing about Taylor Swift? Fans have long suspected that when Taylor Swift's Style - with its references to a boy with ""long hair, slicked back, and a white T-shirt"" - was about Harry Styles. So this song, in which one of the characters wears that ""same white shirt"", is bound to set tongues wagging. Whether it's about the couple's failed relationship or not, Swift's influence is apparent in the storied lyrics, which describe a couple who've become ""two ghosts, standing in the place of you and me, trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat"". In which Harry reveals he has listened to, and enjoyed, the songBlackbird,externalby The Beatles. That said, this is the album's most effective, direct song - a folksy ballad about a lover who's Harry's lifeline. ""When I run out of rope, you bring me home,"" he sings over a sprightly guitar line. It wouldn't have come as a surprise to discover this was the star's long-rumoured collaboration with Ed Sheeran - but, in fact, it's a co-write with erstwhile Skrillex collaborator Kid Harpoon. The star previewed the album on a few select TV shows, including Saturday Night Live and Graham Norton (pictured) A sweeping, orchestral introduction suddenly gives way to a Rolling Stones rock hustle, complete with hollered ""woo-hoo""s and copious amounts of cowbell. Indeed, Harry goes full Jagger in this song, about a girl who claims to be an angel but is a ""devil in the sheets"". ""Couldn't bring you home to mother in a skirt like that,"" he drawls, ""but I think that's what I like about it."" It's easy to imagine this as the album's opening track in an earlier configuration. A partner piece to Only Angel, this is another song about an irresistible bad girl, who tells Harry she's having his baby ""but it's none of your business"". The loudest, rawest track on the album, it's faintly ridiculous, but bound to go down a treat at live shows. And the rumour mill will have a field day with that title - given that one of Harry's (rumoured) ex-girlfriends is New Zealand-born lingerie model Georgia Fowler. After the glam rock rush of Only Angel and Kiwi, its back to the ballads with this jittery track, which Harrypremiered on Saturday Night Live,externallast month. Once again, it finds the star wandering the streets of Brooklyn, fretting over the state of his relationship. It's pretty stodgy stuff, elevated only by Harry's supple backing vocals. This video can not be played Harry Styles' obsession with rom-coms Woman opens with a snatch of conversation: ""Shall we just search for romantic comedies on Netflix and then see what we find?"" It sets the tone for the album's quirkiest song, whose menagerie of sounds includes what appears to be an asthmatic duck. Over a backing track that recalls the juddering stomp of Elton John's Benny and the Jets, Harry issues a plea to a girlfriend who's run off with someone else. ""I hope you can see the state that I'm in while he's touching your skin,"" he pleads, before confessing his jealousy ""howls like a beast"". Cripes. The album closes with - you guessed it - a ballad about a relationship on the rocks. This one is more reflective, as Harry sings sotto voce about waking up alone in his hotel room (and, in a frankly unnecessary detail, ""playing with myself""). ""Even my phone misses your call,"" he sighs wearily in the chorus. A hopeful mid-section is all blossoming, Beatles-esque strings and gorgeous harmonies as the singer fantasises: ""Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me you're sorry."" But the facade collapses and he's left alone and bereft as the album fades out. It's a subdued ending to an album that strains to establish Harry Styles as a credible musician. Taken as a whole, it just about works, often in spite of itself - and there's certainly something intriguing about the idea of Harry as a tortured rock balladeer. But we'd still like to see him doBest Song Ever,externalwhen he tours later this year. Harry Styles is out now on Columbia records.

The songs to look out for at Eurovision,"This video can not be played UK Eurovision artist Lucie Jones shares her predictions for this year The nation's hopes will be pinned on Lucie Jones this year as she heads to Eurovision in the hope of reversing the UK's poor run of recent form. Yet with 24 songs in contention at Kiev, it's anybody's guess who'll be leaving Ukraine with the famous glass microphone trophy in their hands. We've listened to all of them on your behalf and have picked eight tracks we think will make a splash at Saturday's grand final. There is more than a dash of The Shires to this melodious slice of ukelele-backed folk from Belarussian duo Artem Lukyanenko and Ksenia Zhuk. Pointedly sung in their native language, it's a jaunty holler whose references to ""new desires and better ideas"" could be read as a coded rebuke to neighbouring Russia. Belarus have only made it past the semis on four occasions since joining the contest in 2004. Could the first entry to be sung in the country's native tongue see it better its best ever showing - a sixth-place finish in 2007? Watch the video,external. Think Lana Del Ray and Lorde with a sprinkling of Birdy and you have this moodily credible slice of indie pop from 17-year-old Blanche. Real name Ellie Delvaux, she'll be hoping to continue Belgium's recent run of top 10 finishes after a lengthy period in which it struggled to make it past the semis. ""All alone in the danger zone, are you ready to take my hand?"" she moans over a dark soundscape of ambient electronica. Belgium were the last country to be confirmed as finalists at the end of Tuesday's semi-final, prompting a massive sigh of relief and more than a few tears. Russia's departurefrom this year's competition could work in favour of 17-year-old Kostov, the youngest performer at Kiev and the first Eurovision entrant to be born in this century. Born in Moscow in March 2000, he could pick up a lot of the votes that would have gone to Russia's Julia Samoilova were she still participating in the contest. His dramaticself-penned ballad,externalis also a stirring enough composition to put him on course to better the fourth-place finish Bulgaria's Poli Genova managed last year. Indeed, Kristian could go all the way to the top - provided, of course, he does better than this guyâ¦ A firm favourite with both the fans and the bookies, Italy's entrant is the one to beat this year. An irresistible explosion of playful pop with a sing-along chorus,Occidentali's Karma,external- Westerner's Karma in English - also comes with a dancing gorilla that will be sure to send the audience bananas on Saturday. The gorilla, explains Gabbani, derives from Desmond Morris's seminal work The Naked Ape - referred to in the lyrics - and its theory that we are all simians under the skin. As one of the so-called ""big five"", Italy get a free pass into the final along with the UK, France, Germany, Spain and host nation Ukraine. Remember Epic Sax Guy, the saxophone-playing Moldovan who became an internet sensationafter performing at Eurovision in 2010,external? Well, Sergey Stepanov is back to represent the former Soviet republic again with the other two members of Sunstroke Project, violinist Anton Ragoza and vocalist Sergei Yalovitsky. This year's offering is an upbeat slice of pure pop froth that comes with backing singers in wedding gowns and plenty of opportunities for Stepanov to blow his own trumpet. Moldova's last appearance in the final came in 2013 when they finished 11th. Watch the video,external. Amidst Eurovision's sea of generic Anglophone pop, this lush Portuguese love song stands out like a rebellious rose in a garden of dandelions. So does Salvador Sobral himself, his man-bun, Pacino-esque features and air of genial scruffiness setting him apart as surely as if he'd arrived wearing a clown's costume. Written by Sobral's sister Luisa, Amar Pelos Dois translates into English as Love for the Two of Us. There's a lot of love for Portugal's entry this year - not least because Salvador has a serious heart condition that saw him miss the first week of rehearsals. Don't be surprised if we see the land of the fado record its first top five finish. Watch the video,external. Ever wondered what rap and yodelling would sound like in close proximity? Thanks to our friends in Romania, you no longer have to. Yodel It! is just the kind of offbeat combo that Eurovision was made for, and one that ensures Romania is back with a bang after beingbarred from taking partlast year. Singer Ilinca Bacila, 25, describes herself as Romania's only yodelling artist and says she likes to drink palinka - a kind of fruit brandy - before performing with her rapping cohort Alex Florea. By the way, we're not kidding about Romania being back with a bang. Their Eurovision performance sees them joined on stage by a pair of glittery cannons. Watch the video,external. Sweden has an impressive track record at Eurovision. It's won six times in all, most recently in 2015 when Mans Zelmerlowtriumphed with Heroes. It's also mastered the art of making its submission stand out from the crowd. Remember the stylish computer visuals that saw Zelmerlow accompanied on stage in Vienna by a stick-figured animated buddy? Robin Bengtsson will be hoping to match that with a slick routine involving four suit-wearing male dancers on treadmills that recalls nothing so much as Take That in their prime. The song is not bad either - an up-tempo pop ditty in which 26-year-old Bengtsson sings about wanting to take off all his clothes for his ""freakin' beautiful"" partner. Watch the video,external.

Saying goodbye to your old ground...,"The end of an era: White Hart Lane will host a Tottenham match for the final time on Sunday You don't forget your first visit to your team's home stadium: how green the pitch looks, how big the stands seem, how tall everyone in front of you is. The noise, the suddenness of it. The speed of the football, the soft touch of the star names, the swearing. And you don't forget your last, all those seasons of hope and frustration later, when your club upgrades to something altogether cleaner and smarter and more comfortable, and it is time to say goodbye to it all - cramped concourses, tight seating, reeking toilets and the cheap temporary fixes, all of it held together by old memories and faded promises, a shared past that binds you to friends and strangers alike. You know when it is time to move on. Stadiums age just like the players and tactics they house. Stairs are too steep, sight-lines compromised. Stands that once felt huge and light and imposing begin to feel weary and archaic. When Spurs play their final match at White Hart Lane on Sunday, the logic of their move to a 61,559-seat grand design built across much of the same site will be inescapable. So too will the sadness for an old home shortly to be reduced to rubble. Football grounds should feel prosaic. The cheaper part of town, steel and grey concrete, painted wood and moulded plastic. A space that is empty and unused most days of the year. And then, for a few hours every couple of weeks, like nowhere else you ever go - shouting like you can't shout anywhere else, feeling both totally immersed yet horribly powerless, singing in unison with people whose names you will never know. Spurs have been at White Hart Lane for 118 years. Much of the ground, which now holds 36,240 fans, is unrecognisable to that history. The Shelf is long gone, the Paxton Road end transformed, even the new West Stand that once seemed so vast and modern in the 1980s, as you came in on the train or along the High Road, now a little tired and outdated. Supporters can still look out at that rectangle of grass and know that was the stage where so many unforgettable moments played out. They can picture where, before their time, the great players ran and great goals were scored in glory games. That pitch is the living connection to it all: where the league titles of 1951 and 1961 were finally won, both against Sheffield Wednesday; the left wing where Gareth Bale tortured Inter Milan's Maicon in November 2010; the goalmouth where Tony Parks saved a penalty from Anderlecht's Arnor Gudjohnsen to win the Uefa Cup final in 1984. The penalty boxes where Steve Perryman scored twice against AC Milan in the semi-final of the 1972 Uefa Cup; the little patch where Terry Dyson played a one-two with Danny Blanchflower before lashing in his third goal against Arsenal in August 1961. The past: The famous Shelf is packed out as Tottenham host Manchester United in May 1984 There are the hauntings, too - Arsenal's 5-0 win at Christmas 1978, Manchester United scoring five in one half past Neil Sullivan as Spurs surrendered a 3-0 half-time lead in September 2001, being 3-0 up against a 10-man Manchester City in the FA Cup in 2004 and somehow losing 4-3. And there are the sacred ghosts to go with them: the artists like John White, Cliff Jones and Jimmy Greaves, the entertainers like Chris Waddle, Paul Gascoigne and Jurgen Klinsmann, the tough nuts like Ted Ditchburn, Dave Mackay and Graham Roberts. ""Every supporter will tell you this about their own ground, but it's the memories you build up from when you're a kid,"" says Dave Bricknell, who has had season tickets on the Shelf, Paxton Road and now Park Lane over the past 40 years, and who as a coach up the road in Chingford 18 years ago picked a six-year-old kid called Harry Kane for the youth team he ran, Ridgeway Rovers. ""My first game was a home match against Millwall, League Cup, 1972. A night game, loud. My mate's dad picked me up. He'd built his son a little box so he could stand at the front and see. In the corner you had the bloke at half-time manually putting the scores on from the other matches. ""It's those memories, and it's the things you do now - parking at the same place, walking the same way. A lot of people have moved away from Tottenham, and the only time they come back now is for the game. ""It's the part when you walk into the ground, you've got all the terrace above you, and you look forward and the ground opens up around you. To me, that is it. That is the best part of the game, because it takes you back to your childhood. ""Over the years there have been some really bad games. Games when you think, why do I keep coming over here? But you do go back. And every supporter of every club will tell you the same thing. We all think our home ground is special."" Spurs will make Wembley their temporary home next season, before moving in to their new stadium - which is expected to set them back Â£750m. They have left their house move late compared to their neighbours. Arsenal departed Highbury's marble halls and Art Deco facades in 2006, West Ham the partisan, claustrophobic Upton Park a year ago. Of the football stadia in London also designed by the great football architect Archibald Leitch, only Fulham's Craven Cottage remains recognisable. It was Leitch's East Stand that sheltered arguably the most iconic single element of White Hart Lane, the long stretch of terrace down the side of the pitch known as the Shelf. As the North Bank defined Highbury, as the old terraced Kop did Anfield, the Gallowgate End St James's Park and the Holte End Villa Park, the Shelf was what set the ground apart: its tribal heart, its noisy soul. The future: A young Tottenham fan and the ground the club will soon call home ""People won't believe it, but in that 1984 season I went to White Hart Lane most midweeks,"" says former Chelsea, Everton and Scotland winger Pat Nevin. ""I was actually Chelsea's player of the year at the time, but I was standing on the Shelf, watching Spurs. If you've got Ossie Ardiles, if you've got Glenn Hoddle, if you've got the likes of Micky Hazard - they were brilliant players in that team, and I was really keen to watch those players and learn what I could. ""White Hart Lane was a brilliant place to play, because the supporters were so close to you. The atmosphere was always great. It's a small pitch, but because Spurs were almost always an attacking side, it was almost like an elongated five-a-side game. I loved playing at that ground."" For Tottenham's own guard the memories are more vivid still. ""When I was there you would regularly get 60,000 for a match,"" former club captain Alan Mullery told BBC Sport. ""When we won the Uefa Cup in 1972, beating Wolves, the last match I ever played, and I scored the winning goal. I remember every minute of it."" Thirteen years later, Spurs would win the same tournament on the same pitch, 21-year-old Parks' two penalty saves in the shootout and all. ""We went out to an old building on the High Road that had a balcony, and the whole of the High Road was full of thousands of Spurs fans,"" remembers Gary Mabbutt, early, that night, in a Spurs career that would see him captain the club for more than a decade. ""118 years of tradition and history, all embedded in White Hart Lane."" ""It's an old cliche, but it's a proper football ground,"" says Dave Bricknell. ""You're packed in. You're right next to the players, you're getting noise from most sides. ""The new stadium is eating the old stadium. It's like playing Pac-Man on a grand scale. You can see three new stands going up, and it looks fantastic. ""It will be bigger, and it will be better, and hopefully we can keep the team together and move on to the next level. You've got to look forward, haven't you?"" You do. But you can also look back, one final time. And when you do, no matter which ground you are saying farewell to, the days and nights that meant so much come alive one more time, as they have this past week for Bricknell. ""Parksey saving those penalties, Roberts stealing in to equalise. The noise! ""Harry scoring against Arsenal last year, fantastic. What a goalâ¦ But the other week against Arsenal was pretty special too - beating them 2-0, making sure we stayed above them. ""That 5-3 defeat by United - it was my son's birthday. One of his first games. The City loss was worse. It was Man Utd in the next round, so at half-time we were all looking at booking flights up to Manchester. Liam Brady smashing one into the top corner in that 5-0 in '78â¦ ""Beating Arsenal 5-0 and Mark Falco scoring a volley from the edge of the box with his right foot, Terry Gibson crossing it, Chris Hughton scoring another belter in that matchâ¦ beating Feyenoord 4-2 under the lights, with Cruyff in their team and saying before the match that Hoddle wasn't all that good and he was going to show it, and Hoddle absolutely destroying themâ¦ ""It's been special. And Sunday will be a very special goodbye.""

'Season still a success without Europa',"Jose Mourinho is chasing a second major trophy of the season after Manchester United won the EFL Cup in February Manchester United's season will be a success even if they lose the Europa League final, says boss Jose Mourinho. But Mourinho accepts it would ""make sense"" for the season to be viewed as a failure if United, whoedged out Celta Vigoto reach the final, lose to Ajax. Mourinho, 54, became the first manager in United history to win a major trophy in his first season when heclaimed the EFL Cup in February. ""We did things nobody did in this club in the first season,"" said Mourinho. Bailly could have Uefa ban extended The Portuguese guided his team to a record 25-game unbeaten run in the Premier League before it was ended by Arsenal on Sunday to dent their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. Mourinho believes his side, currently sixth in the Premier League, will not now finish in the top four so must win the Europa League to reach next season's Champions League. When asked if the result of the 24 May final in Stockholm would determine whether United's season was a success or failure, he said the media ""have the right to say it and it makes sense to say it, but I don't feel like that"". ""We have these things, but [the media] are always looking at these kind of capital letters, big headlines,"" added the former Chelsea and  Real Madrid manager. ""I probably work, this season, harder than ever. When I analyse, I don't think [losing the final would be failure], but if I was in your chair, maybe."" Sergio Romero is set to start for United in the Europa League final, with Mourinho saying there was ""no dilemma"" in sticking with the Argentina goalkeeper in favour of regular first-choice David de Gea. Spain's De Gea, 26, played three games during the group stages but Romero, 30, has started each Europa League tie since the last-32 stage. ""I never saw in all my career two goalkeepers to be so friendly because it is a position when you always have a little bit of rivalry, especially if you are both the same kind of level,"" said Mourinho. ""I think it is fair Sergio is going to play the final and David accepts, because he has already played Europa League matches and if we win the trophy, David wins the trophy."" Centre-back Eric Bailly will miss the final after being sent off late on against Celta Vigo, with Mourinho anticipating Uefa rules will not ""allow any chance of an appeal"". He added that Bailly, 23, will now play inUnited's three remaining Premier League fixturesto ""give rest to some of the others"", with the final match at home against Crystal Palace three days before the Europa League final.

8 songs to look out for at Eurovision,"This video can not be played UK Eurovision artist Lucie Jones shares her predictions for this year The nation's hopes will be pinned on Lucie Jones this year as she heads to Eurovision in the hope of reversing the UK's poor run of recent form. Yet with 24 songs in contention at Kiev, it's anybody's guess who'll be leaving Ukraine with the famous glass microphone trophy in their hands. We've listened to all of them on your behalf and have picked eight tracks we think will make a splash at Saturday's grand final. There is more than a dash of The Shires to this melodious slice of ukelele-backed folk from Belarussian duo Artem Lukyanenko and Ksenia Zhuk. Pointedly sung in their native language, it's a jaunty holler whose references to ""new desires and better ideas"" could be read as a coded rebuke to neighbouring Russia. Belarus have only made it past the semis on four occasions since joining the contest in 2004. Could the first entry to be sung in the country's native tongue see it better its best ever showing - a sixth-place finish in 2007? Watch the video,external. Think Lana Del Ray and Lorde with a sprinkling of Birdy and you have this moodily credible slice of indie pop from 17-year-old Blanche. Real name Ellie Delvaux, she'll be hoping to continue Belgium's recent run of top 10 finishes after a lengthy period in which it struggled to make it past the semis. ""All alone in the danger zone, are you ready to take my hand?"" she moans over a dark soundscape of ambient electronica. Belgium were the last country to be confirmed as finalists at the end of Tuesday's semi-final, prompting a massive sigh of relief and more than a few tears. Russia's departurefrom this year's competition could work in favour of 17-year-old Kostov, the youngest performer at Kiev and the first Eurovision entrant to be born in this century. Born in Moscow in March 2000, he could pick up a lot of the votes that would have gone to Russia's Julia Samoilova were she still participating in the contest. His dramaticself-penned ballad,externalis also a stirring enough composition to put him on course to better the fourth-place finish Bulgaria's Poli Genova managed last year. Indeed, Kristian could go all the way to the top - provided, of course, he does better than this guyâ¦ A firm favourite with both the fans and the bookies, Italy's entrant is the one to beat this year. An irresistible explosion of playful pop with a sing-along chorus,Occidentali's Karma,external- Westerner's Karma in English - also comes with a dancing gorilla that will be sure to send the audience bananas on Saturday. The gorilla, explains Gabbani, derives from Desmond Morris's seminal work The Naked Ape - referred to in the lyrics - and its theory that we are all simians under the skin. As one of the so-called ""big five"", Italy get a free pass into the final along with the UK, France, Germany, Spain and host nation Ukraine. Remember Epic Sax Guy, the saxophone-playing Moldovan who became an internet sensationafter performing at Eurovision in 2010,external? Well, Sergey Stepanov is back to represent the former Soviet republic again with the other two members of Sunstroke Project, violinist Anton Ragoza and vocalist Sergei Yalovitsky. This year's offering is an upbeat slice of pure pop froth that comes with backing singers in wedding gowns and plenty of opportunities for Stepanov to blow his own trumpet. Moldova's last appearance in the final came in 2013 when they finished 11th. Watch the video,external. Amidst Eurovision's sea of generic Anglophone pop, this lush Portuguese love song stands out like a rebellious rose in a garden of dandelions. So does Salvador Sobral himself, his man-bun, Pacino-esque features and air of genial scruffiness setting him apart as surely as if he'd arrived wearing a clown's costume. Written by Sobral's sister Luisa, Amar Pelos Dois translates into English as Love for the Two of Us. There's a lot of love for Portugal's entry this year - not least because Salvador has a serious heart condition that saw him miss the first week of rehearsals. Don't be surprised if we see the land of the fado record its first top five finish. Watch the video,external. Ever wondered what rap and yodelling would sound like in close proximity? Thanks to our friends in Romania, you no longer have to. Yodel It! is just the kind of offbeat combo that Eurovision was made for, and one that ensures Romania is back with a bang after beingbarred from taking partlast year. Singer Ilinca Bacila, 25, describes herself as Romania's only yodelling artist and says she likes to drink palinka - a kind of fruit brandy - before performing with her rapping cohort Alex Florea. By the way, we're not kidding about Romania being back with a bang. Their Eurovision performance sees them joined on stage by a pair of glittery cannons. Watch the video,external. Sweden has an impressive track record at Eurovision. It's won six times in all, most recently in 2015 when Mans Zelmerlowtriumphed with Heroes. It's also mastered the art of making its submission stand out from the crowd. Remember the stylish computer visuals that saw Zelmerlow accompanied on stage in Vienna by a stick-figured animated buddy? Robin Bengtsson will be hoping to match that with a slick routine involving four suit-wearing male dancers on treadmills that recalls nothing so much as Take That in their prime. The song is not bad either - an up-tempo pop ditty in which 26-year-old Bengtsson sings about wanting to take off all his clothes for his ""freakin' beautiful"" partner. Watch the video,external.

Hamilton fastest as Alonso breaks down,"Listen to commentary of second practice on line from 12:55 BST Lewis Hamilton set the pace as Mercedes impressed in first practice at the Spanish Grand Prix. Hamilton was 0.029 seconds quicker than team-mate Valtteri Bottas, and a second clear of Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen and Sebastian Vettel in third and fourth. Red Bull's Max Verstappen was fifth, just 0.250secs behind Raikkonen. McLaren-Honda's dismal season of unreliability continued, with Fernando Alonso sent into a spin by a major engine failure on his first lap. Predict your top three for qualifying Hedonism, history and Arnie's neck - F1 heads to Barcelona Rain in Spain? Your F1 forecast Alonso spun to a halt in a cloud of smoke with oil pouring from underneath the engine after it failed coming out of Turn Two on his first lap. The Spaniard then left the track to go back to his hotel. Honda blamed the failure on ""an oil leak"" and said Alonso would be back out with a new power-unit in second practice. Alonso posted a tweet saying: ""Keeping the body active,"" accompanied by an emoji with a halo and a photograph of himself with his trainer playing tennis. What do you do if your McLaren breaks down after three corners? Honda have a small upgrade on the engine for this weekend but said the one he was using had previously run in Australia and China and in Bahrain until qualifying. In lovely spring sunshine and under a beautiful blue sky north of Barcelona, the teams spent the session evaluating the upgrades they have brought to this race. All the teams have new aerodynamic parts, as is traditional at this first European race of the season, and the most striking are on the Mercedes. Leave the circuit and hit the tennis court, of course The silver cars have a narrower nose, under which is fitted a unique new snow-plough style aerodynamic shaping device, as well as new parts all the way along the side of the car. So far, they appear to be working well, and Hamilton and Bottas traded times throughout the session, rarely separated by more than a few hundredths of a second. Hamilton arrived in Spain determined to make amends for a poor weekend two weeks ago in Russia, where he finished fourth and Bottas won. Mercedes have brought a new snow-plough style nose to Barcelona Bottas, by contrast, has made it clear that his focus has shifted to trying to win every race after an up-and-down start to the season in which he has been alternately impressive - with his first win in Russia and first pole in Bahrain - and not, such as when he spun behind the safety car during the Chinese Grand Prix. The two men are separated by 10 points in the championship, with Hamilton ahead and 13 points behind Vettel. Ferrari also have a series of aerodynamic changes on their car, as do Red Bull, who are hopeful their upgrade will clos the one-second gap that has separated them from the front-runners so far this season. Alonso: Still a legend in the eyes of his Spanish fans, clearly It is too early to make any conclusions about relative pace, not least because Vettel's session was disrupted by a gearbox problem on the pit straight. He managed to pull of into the pit lane exit, from where the car was recovered and the Ferrari mechanics were able to repair the car and send him out again to set his fastest time.

What's it like to be accused of spying for Russia?,"When Svetlana Lokhova saw the internet light up with suggestions she was a Russian spy, she initially thought it was a joke. But the Russian-born academic soon found herself, in her words, ""collateral damage"" in the controversies surrounding the Trump administration and the swirl of allegations about Russian espionage. The claims revolved around her contact with Gen Michael Flynn in Cambridge in 2014. Flynn resigned after just 24 days as US National Security Adviser after allegations he had failed to be honest about contacts with the Russian Ambassador to the US during the transition to the Trump administration. After his resignation in February, there were reports in the US and UK media about Lokhova, including the claim that Flynn's contact with Lokhova ""troubled,external"" US intelligence officials. On social media, thesuggestion,externalwas that she was some kind of Russian spy or honeytrap. Michael Flynn resigned as President Trump's National Security Adviser after just 23 days ""Are you a Russian spy?"" I begin by asking her. ""Absolutely not,"" she replies. ""I have no formal or informal connection with Russian intelligence whatsoever."" She acknowledges that the cynical will respond: ""She would say that wouldn't she"" - which has left her in what she describes as a ""Kafkaesque situation""'. The context of the story, she acknowledges, was part of the problem. She is female, originally from Russia and linked to Cambridge, home of the famous Cambridge spy ring recruited by the KGB in the 1930s. ""There is a sad irony that someone who is writing about Cambridge traitors ended up being painted as one herself,"" she says. The story begins with a dinner in February 2014 in Cambridge. The dinner was organised by Sir Richard Dearlove, former head of MI6 and then master of Pembroke College, who was starting up an organisation called the Cambridge Security Initiative (CSI). Also involved was Christopher Andrew, authorised historian of MI5 and a professor at Corpus Christi College. The guest of honour at the dinner - which had around a dozen or so attendees - was Flynn, then head of America's Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The aim was to build a relationship between CSI and DIA ahead of a conference the following year, says Lokhova. ""The hope by DIA was that by visiting top universities in Europe they would be able to spot people who would be able to help or assist their organisation,"" she says. At the dinner she was seated a fair distance away from Flynn. After more senior officials had talked, junior members were asked to talk about their research. As an expert on Soviet intelligence in the 1930s, Lokhova says she was asked to present some of her research. ""The idea was that I would impress the DIA with the Cambridge pedigree of research."" Lokhova showed Flynn a 1912 postcard from Stalin to the fiancee of his best friend. The fiancee was helping Stalin obtain a fake passport to escape surveillance when he was an early revolutionary working against the Tsarist regime. ""The first reaction was that of amusement,"" Lokhova says. She translated the document and explained how it showed that Stalin was the most spied-upon leader in history as well as the one who later spied on people the most. She says Flynn asked her to send the document to him. This was because he was expecting some senior officials visiting Washington from Russia. At this point, there was a move towards trying to increase co-operation with Russia in the field of counter-terrorism, as it had recently emerged that those involved in the 2013 Boston bombing had been known to the Russians. Lokhova says both Flynn and his assistant provided their emails, looking forward to using the postcard to break the ice when the Russian officials arrived in Washington. Claims she was asked to travel to Russia and act as his translator, Lokhova says, are not true. She says she exchanged some emails with Flynn and his assistant after the event, although Flynn soon after left the DIA, after reportedly being forced out. ""We had maybe a few emails going backwards and forwards,"" Lokhova says. These included details of events at Cambridge. She says Flynn was also interested in Russian espionage and she sent hima BBC story(written by myself, in which I had interviewed Lokhova) about a ""sixth man"" in the Cambridge spy ring. ""Gen Flynn replied to me saying how it is important to keep exposing espionage and making it accessible to not just intelligence officials but regular people."" US media claimed the problem for Flynn may have been that he should have declared his contact with Lokhova as a Russian. British media then followed up on the Cambridge connection saying that both the CIA and FBI were discussing this episode. A lawyer for Flynn declined to comment. Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence with Michael Flynn On social media and websites, people went further, saying that Lokhova was a Russian spy or agent targeting Flynn. That led to a flurry of further press interest and journalists outside her house and asking friends and neighbours if she was a spy. She moved out of her flat to avoid them. She says the accusation that she recruited Flynn - under the eyes of a former head of MI6 and the official historian of MI5 - is ludicrous. ""Apparently I managed to turn General Flynn in 15 minutes with a postcard which Josef Stalin sent in 1912,"" she says. ""If I did recruit Flynn that would have been one of the greatest - if not the greatest - Russian coup of all times. So it is utterly ridiculous, totally unbelievable. But, for some reason, the world today is such that people buy it."" Lokhova was born in Russia but took British citizenship soon after coming to the UK in 1998 (whilst retaining her Russian citizenship). ""I am British and I have a British passportâ¦ If I were indeed a Russian spy that would make me a traitorâ¦ For me, it's very normal to have contact with current and former intelligence officials because of the field I am in,"" she says, denying reports she has any kind of ""special access"" to Russian intelligence archives. ""It is absolutely not the case,"" she says. Jack Barsky died in September 1955, at the age of 10, and was buried in the Mount Lebanon Cemetery in the suburbs of Washington DC. His name is on the passport of the man sitting before me now - a youthful 67-year-old East German, born Albert Dittrich. The passport is not a fake. (January 2017) The KGB spy who lived the American dream On the contrary, she says that because of her work with Prof Andrew, who has worked with defectors from the Soviet Union such as former KGB archivist Vasily Mitrokhin, who smuggled out its secrets, she is viewed with suspicion in Russia. ""In Britain, I am now being accused of being a Russian spy. In Russia, some think I am a British spy. And I am neither. I am just a historian who writes about an area that has become incredibly politicised."" ""My life has been completely changed by this,"" says Lokhova, who gave birth to her first child just before the reports emerged this year. She says she became worried about being followed and also nervous of speaking on the phone or meeting friends, unsure if they suspected her of being a spy. She had already been involved in a public row with her former employers - a Russian bank - against whom shewon an employment tribunaland was clearly left bruised by the experience of being drawn into a spy row.

World number 11 Scott dropped four shots in the last two holes. The 2013 Masters champion was on six under through 16 holes but hit a five on the par-three 17th and a six on the par-four 18th to shoot a two-under 70. England's Lee Westwood shot a bogey-free round of 70 to reach two under, with compatriot Paul Casey and Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell a stroke further back. Scott's fellow Australian Jason Day, the world number three, is two under, a shot ahead of a group including world number one Dustin Johnson and Bernhard Langer, who at 59 is the oldest player in the tournament. Rory McIlroy is one over, while Luke Donald and Masters runner-up Justin Rose both opened with a two-over 74. Read Luke Donald's exclusive Sawgrass diary Players Championship: Will Sawgrass event become a major? Garcia started with three bogeys and a double bogey in the first six holes but three birdies in total and the ace on 17 helped him recover to stay in contention. The Spaniard is just the the eighth player to make a hole-in-one on the 17th at Sawgrass in Players Championship history. ""It was nice to see it bounce and kind of spin back into the hole, maybe because I needed it after the start I had,"" said Garcia. ""I wasn't quite in the tournament because of everything that's been going on after the Masters win and media and people congratulating you left, right and centre - I was a little bit up in the clouds, and when I woke up, I was four over after six."" American Johnson narrowly missed out on winning his fourth straight tournament at the Wells Fargo Championship last week, finishing second on his return from the back injury that saw him pull out of the Masters on the first tee. He started with a bogey at Sawgrass, hitting three in total, but two birdies and an eagle on the par-five 16th saw him move to four shots behind the leader. ""I could never really get any momentum - I hit some good shots, then I would lip-out the putt,"" said Johnson. Co-leader McGirt hit three birdies on the front nine and eagled both of the par five holes on the back nine to offset two bogeys. It is the fifth time the 37-year-old American, who won the 2016 Memorial Tournament, has held the lead or a share of the lead after 18 holes but is yet to convert an opening-round lead into victory. Adam Scott won the Masters in 2013 BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter Players can go through spells when they cannot avoid being centre of attention. It seems this is the case for Masters winner Sergio Garcia, who repaired a stumbling start with a hole-in-one on probably the most iconic par three on the PGA Tour. That capped an odd opening day in which a string of big names - Jason Day, Adam Scott and Rickie Fowler included - handed back promising starts. Sawgrass represents an exacting test with no margin for error and that remains the case following the latest renovations to the layout. Rory McIlroy has been troubled with a back problem that hampered his preparations and he will need to shed rust rapidly to have any chance of contending over the weekend.

Manchester United 1-1 Celta Vigo (2-1 agg),"Marouane Fellaini heads home United's goal Manchester United survived a huge late scare to edge past Spanish visitors Celta Vigo and set up a Europa League final against Dutch giants Ajax. Leading 1-0 from the first leg, United took control as Marouane Fellaini headed home Marcus Rashford's cross. But Celta, needing two goals, levelled on the night through Facundo Roncaglia to set up a tense final few minutes. United's Eric Bailly and Roncaglia were sent off after a mass brawl, and the hosts hung on to reach the final. Indeed they could only celebrate after Celta striker John Guidetti scuffed a golden chance to put the visitors through to their first major European final with the final kick of the game. The aggregate victory took the Red Devils a step closer to their first Europa League triumph and a return to the Champions League. They will meet Ajax, who beat Lyon in the other semi-final, in Stockholm on 24 May. Reaction: Mourinho targets 'perfect' end to season Relive a tense night at Old Trafford Listen: United survive 'white-knuckle ride' 'As long as he isn't sitting next to me' Spanish commentator v 5 live Sport There were just six seconds left when Guidetti missed the chance to put Celta through United had never lost a two-legged European tie after winning the first leg away from home, and knew they would reach the final by keeping a clean sheet at an expectant Old Trafford. The hosts looked nervy as Celta made an attacking start, before Fellaini settled the tension by converting his side's first effort on target. The Belgium midfielder sneaked in at the far post to powerfully head in Rashford's clipped left-wing cross. Jose Mourinho's side created few other chances as they aimed to frustrate the visitors with an organised and largely defensive approach. Although Henrikh Mkhitaryan, Rashford and Fellaini all drew saves from Celta keeper Sergio Alvarez after the break, it was a functional - not flashy - performance. This video can not be played How many Man Utd Euro finals can you remember? Celta, who had lost their previous five matches and are 12th in La Liga, had more possession than the home side, and forced United keeper Sergio Romero into instinctive saves at the start of each half. They then ignited the tie with Roncaglia's glancing header following a corner. The away goal, which left them needing one more to eliminate United, increased the tension inside Old Trafford, leading to a scuffle involving almost all 22 players on the field. Bailly was sent off for a swipe at former Manchester City striker Guidetti, with Roncaglia dismissed for retaliating. With six minutes of added time, there was still opportunity for Celta to create one final chance - but Guidetti blew it. While United's players greeted the final whistle with a mixture of relief and jubilation, the visitors slumped to the turf with Guidetti in tears. ""You cannot win a semi-final easily, or be calm. We are in the final, that's what counts,"" said United midfielder Ander Herrera. United defender Bailly (second left) will miss the final after his red card Winning the Europa League has become Mourinho's priority as he looks to secure a return to the Champions League in his debut season at Old Trafford. And the campaign will be deemed a disappointing one if his team lose to Ajax, who edged out Lyon 5-4 on aggregate. Expectations were high that Mourinho's arrival would bring an end to the malaise that has surrounded the Red Devils since Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement. United have finished seventh, fourth and fifth in the three Premier League seasons since the Scot's departure - and Mourinho arrived with loftier ambitions than simply scraping into the top four. Ten months later, the Portuguese has been forced to drastically reassess his ambitions. He appears to have conceded defeat in the top-four race, with his team sixth, four points adrift of Manchester City going into their final three matches. With the return leg against Celta at the forefront of his mind, Mourinho made eight changes for Sunday's 2-0 defeat at Arsenal - a clear admission he felt winning the Europa League was more attainable than breaking into the top four. However, his decision will only be justified if they are successful in beating Ajax and claiming their sixth European trophy. This video can not be played Who are Ajax's young academy stars making history? The Red Devils have won 65 trophies in their illustrious 115-year history, a figure including 20 English league titles and three European Cup/Champions League victories. However, there is one piece of silverware missing from the Old Trafford trophy room. In recent seasons winning the Europa League may have been considered an unwanted honour. Now it is considered a must-win as the club looks to complete a clean sweep of the major competitions at home and abroad. The front cover of Thursday's matchday programme creatively illustrated how United hope to complete a clean sweep Former England winger Chris Waddle on BBC Radio 5 live: ""They are not the most technical Man Utd team I've ever seen. Mourinho is very good at setting a team up but it is not entertaining. ""United have always been entertainers and even if they win the Europa League, people will say: 'Yes they won it, but it wasn't entertaining.' ""The goal for Celta came from United's lack of concentration and it became a little bit ""panic stations"" for the rest of the match. ""Ajax are a young team - they could easily freeze in that final."" Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho: ""We were the best team in the first leg but we never kill, we never score goals related to the chances we have. It was an open game at home, all the pressure on our side. ""They were completely free of responsibility and gave us a very hard match. We suffered until the end and it was open until the last second. The boys gave everything they had. I'm really pleased for them. ""After 14 matches, we are in the final. If we win the Europa League, I am more than happy. It would be amazing."" Fellaini has regularly been criticised by Red Devils fans since arriving from Everton, but the Belgium midfielder was one of United's better players against Celta. As well as scoring what proved to be the decisive goal, he impressed in a more advanced role Before they can fully focus on the Europa League final, United have three more Premier League matches to think about. They go to second-placed Tottenham on Sunday (16:30 BST), before games against Southampton and Crystal Palace.

Mourinho targets 'perfect' end to season,"Mourinho has already led United to the EFL Cup in his debut season Winning the Europa League to qualify for the Champions League would be the ""perfect"" end to Manchester United's season, says manager Jose Mourinho. The Red Devils survived a late scareagainst Spanish side Celta Vigoto join Ajax in the 24 May final in Stockholm. Mourinho fears Ajax, who finish the Dutch season on Sunday, will be better prepared after a 12-day break. ""This season has been so difficult, so if we manage to win the Europa League it will be amazing,"" he said. ""It means a chance to win a trophy and the opportunity to be back in the Champions League."" Listen: United survive 'white-knuckle ride' Gantry battle: Spanish commentator v 5 live team Leading 1-0 from the first leg, United took control of the tie as Marouane Fellaini headed home Marcus Rashford's cross. Celta, needing two goals, levelled on the night through Facundo Roncaglia to set up a tense final few minutes. And Celta striker John Guidetti scuffed a golden chance to put the visitors through to their first major European final with the final kick of the game. Mourinho has prioritised winning Europe's secondary club competition, which guarantees a place in next season's Champions League, in his debut season at Old Trafford. United have three Premier League games left before they can fully focus on their seventh European final. The Red Devils, who are sixth and four points adrift of Manchester City in fourth, visit second-placed Tottenham on Sunday. Mourinho's side also face a trip to Southampton before rounding off their campaign with a home game against Crystal Palace. The Eagles, who could still be fighting for their top-flight survival, visit Old Trafford three days before the Europa League final. ""Ajax's league finishes Sunday,"" said Mourinho. ""They have 12 days to prepare. We have three games and three days. ""Hopefully Palace have nothing to play for because I will make a lot of changes."" Celta coach Eduardo Berizzo bemoaned the fact United scored with what he said was their ""one chance"". ""We performed much better than United did at our place,"" he said. ""We possibly deserved to get through. ""Given the huge gap on all levels between the clubs, we managed to bridge that gap. ""I want my team to play the way I live life. We express ourselves through attacking football. I think our opponents wanted to break up our fluidity."" Former England international Chris Waddle, who was at Old Trafford for BBC Radio 5 live: ""Manchester United have always been known as entertainers, but I think they showed against Celta Vigo what they are now, which is a well-disciplined and well-organised team - the bit of them that was off the cuff has gone. ""United were set up defensively and playing on the counter-attack, and doing that they are never going to score a lot goals. You can see why they have struggled to beat teams at Old Trafford this season. ""Yes, results and trophies are what matters to Jose Mourinho, and his side have won the tie and are into the Europa League final, but the way they did it was not very entertaining. ""Trophies are brilliant to lift and they go in the cabinet and add to a club's history. You can look at them and say a team were winners but they do not tell you how well, or how badly, they played to do it. ""In the final they will be playing against an Ajax team who play the way Ajax have always played - entertaining, attack-minded and looking to get on the front foot. ""United won't do that. They will have the same game plan as they did against Celta Vigo - Mourinho is going to set up his side in an identical way and he will not take any risks."" 1968 European Cup - WON Led by Bobby Charlton and George Best, Matt Busby's side became the first English team to win the European Cup with a 4-1 win over Benfica at Wembley. 1991 Cup Winners' Cup - WON Two goals from Mark Hughes, now Stoke manager, gave United a 2-1 win over Barcelona in Rotterdam. Ronald Koeman, now manager of Everton, scored for Barca. 1999 Champions League - WON ""...and Solskjaer HAS WON IT!"" Perhaps United's most famous success. Trailing Bayern Munich in the Nou Camp heading into stoppage time, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scored following David Beckham corners to complete an incredible turnaround and seal an unprecedented Treble. 2008 Champions League - WON An all-English affair in late-night Moscow. Cristiano Ronaldo and Frank Lampard exchanged goals to take the tie to penalties and, after Ronaldo missed, John Terry had the chance to win it for Chelsea. However, he slipped, missed, and Edwin van der Sar then saved from Nicolas Anelka. 2009 Champions League - LOST Ronaldo's final game for United ended in defeat as Samuel Eto'o and Lionel Messi scored to give Pep Guardiola's Barcelona victory in Rome. 2011 Champions League - LOST A repeat performance from Guardiola's Barcelona as United were outclassed at Wembley.

What it's like to be accused of spying for Russia?,"When Svetlana Lokhova saw the internet light up with suggestions she was a Russian spy, she initially thought it was a joke. But the Russian-born academic soon found herself, in her words, ""collateral damage"" in the controversies surrounding the Trump administration and the swirl of allegations about Russian espionage. The claims revolved around her contact with Gen Michael Flynn in Cambridge in 2014. Flynn resigned after just 24 days as US National Security Adviser after allegations he had failed to be honest about contacts with the Russian Ambassador to the US during the transition to the Trump administration. After his resignation in February, there were reports in the US and UK media about Lokhova, including the claim that Flynn's contact with Lokhova ""troubled,external"" US intelligence officials. On social media, thesuggestion,externalwas that she was some kind of Russian spy or honeytrap. Michael Flynn resigned as President Trump's National Security Adviser after just 23 days ""Are you a Russian spy?"" I begin by asking her. ""Absolutely not,"" she replies. ""I have no formal or informal connection with Russian intelligence whatsoever."" She acknowledges that the cynical will respond: ""She would say that wouldn't she"" - which has left her in what she describes as a ""Kafkaesque situation""'. The context of the story, she acknowledges, was part of the problem. She is female, originally from Russia and linked to Cambridge, home of the famous Cambridge spy ring recruited by the KGB in the 1930s. ""There is a sad irony that someone who is writing about Cambridge traitors ended up being painted as one herself,"" she says. The story begins with a dinner in February 2014 in Cambridge. The dinner was organised by Sir Richard Dearlove, former head of MI6 and then master of Pembroke College, who was starting up an organisation called the Cambridge Security Initiative (CSI). Also involved was Christopher Andrew, authorised historian of MI5 and a professor at Corpus Christi College. The guest of honour at the dinner - which had around a dozen or so attendees - was Flynn, then head of America's Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). The aim was to build a relationship between CSI and DIA ahead of a conference the following year, says Lokhova. ""The hope by DIA was that by visiting top universities in Europe they would be able to spot people who would be able to help or assist their organisation,"" she says. At the dinner she was seated a fair distance away from Flynn. After more senior officials had talked, junior members were asked to talk about their research. As an expert on Soviet intelligence in the 1930s, Lokhova says she was asked to present some of her research. ""The idea was that I would impress the DIA with the Cambridge pedigree of research."" Lokhova showed Flynn a 1912 postcard from Stalin to the fiancee of his best friend. The fiancee was helping Stalin obtain a fake passport to escape surveillance when he was an early revolutionary working against the Tsarist regime. ""The first reaction was that of amusement,"" Lokhova says. She translated the document and explained how it showed that Stalin was the most spied-upon leader in history as well as the one who later spied on people the most. She says Flynn asked her to send the document to him. This was because he was expecting some senior officials visiting Washington from Russia. At this point, there was a move towards trying to increase co-operation with Russia in the field of counter-terrorism, as it had recently emerged that those involved in the 2013 Boston bombing had been known to the Russians. Lokhova says both Flynn and his assistant provided their emails, looking forward to using the postcard to break the ice when the Russian officials arrived in Washington. Claims she was asked to travel to Russia and act as his translator, Lokhova says, are not true. She says she exchanged some emails with Flynn and his assistant after the event, although Flynn soon after left the DIA, after reportedly being forced out. ""We had maybe a few emails going backwards and forwards,"" Lokhova says. These included details of events at Cambridge. She says Flynn was also interested in Russian espionage and she sent hima BBC story(written by myself, in which I had interviewed Lokhova) about a ""sixth man"" in the Cambridge spy ring. ""Gen Flynn replied to me saying how it is important to keep exposing espionage and making it accessible to not just intelligence officials but regular people."" US media claimed the problem for Flynn may have been that he should have declared his contact with Lokhova as a Russian. British media then followed up on the Cambridge connection saying that both the CIA and FBI were discussing this episode. A lawyer for Flynn declined to comment. Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence with Michael Flynn On social media and websites, people went further, saying that Lokhova was a Russian spy or agent targeting Flynn. That led to a flurry of further press interest and journalists outside her house and asking friends and neighbours if she was a spy. She moved out of her flat to avoid them. She says the accusation that she recruited Flynn - under the eyes of a former head of MI6 and the official historian of MI5 - is ludicrous. ""Apparently I managed to turn General Flynn in 15 minutes with a postcard which Josef Stalin sent in 1912,"" she says. ""If I did recruit Flynn that would have been one of the greatest - if not the greatest - Russian coup of all times. So it is utterly ridiculous, totally unbelievable. But, for some reason, the world today is such that people buy it."" Lokhova was born in Russia but took British citizenship soon after coming to the UK in 1998 (whilst retaining her Russian citizenship). ""I am British and I have a British passportâ¦ If I were indeed a Russian spy that would make me a traitorâ¦ For me, it's very normal to have contact with current and former intelligence officials because of the field I am in,"" she says, denying reports she has any kind of ""special access"" to Russian intelligence archives. ""It is absolutely not the case,"" she says. Jack Barsky died in September 1955, at the age of 10, and was buried in the Mount Lebanon Cemetery in the suburbs of Washington DC. His name is on the passport of the man sitting before me now - a youthful 67-year-old East German, born Albert Dittrich. The passport is not a fake. (January 2017) The KGB spy who lived the American dream On the contrary, she says that because of her work with Prof Andrew, who has worked with defectors from the Soviet Union such as former KGB archivist Vasily Mitrokhin, who smuggled out its secrets, she is viewed with suspicion in Russia. ""In Britain, I am now being accused of being a Russian spy. In Russia, some think I am a British spy. And I am neither. I am just a historian who writes about an area that has become incredibly politicised."" ""My life has been completely changed by this,"" says Lokhova, who gave birth to her first child just before the reports emerged this year. She says she became worried about being followed and also nervous of speaking on the phone or meeting friends, unsure if they suspected her of being a spy. She had already been involved in a public row with her former employers - a Russian bank - against whom shewon an employment tribunaland was clearly left bruised by the experience of being drawn into a spy row.

British media then followed up on the Cambridge connection saying that both the CIA and FBI were discussing this episode. A lawyer for Flynn declined to comment. Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence with Michael Flynn On social media and websites, people went further, saying that Lokhova was a Russian spy or agent targeting Flynn. That led to a flurry of further press interest and journalists outside her house and asking friends and neighbours if she was a spy. She moved out of her flat to avoid them. She says the accusation that she recruited Flynn - under the eyes of a former head of MI6 and the official historian of MI5 - is ludicrous. ""Apparently I managed to turn General Flynn in 15 minutes with a postcard which Josef Stalin sent in 1912,"" she says. ""If I did recruit Flynn that would have been one of the greatest - if not the greatest - Russian coup of all times. So it is utterly ridiculous, totally unbelievable. But, for some reason, the world today is such that people buy it."" Lokhova was born in Russia but took British citizenship soon after coming to the UK in 1998 (whilst retaining her Russian citizenship). ""I am British and I have a British passportâ¦ If I were indeed a Russian spy that would make me a traitorâ¦ For me, it's very normal to have contact with current and former intelligence officials because of the field I am in,"" she says, denying reports she has any kind of ""special access"" to Russian intelligence archives. ""It is absolutely not the case,"" she says. Jack Barsky died in September 1955, at the age of 10, and was buried in the Mount Lebanon Cemetery in the suburbs of Washington DC. His name is on the passport of the man sitting before me now - a youthful 67-year-old East German, born Albert Dittrich. The passport is not a fake. (January 2017) The KGB spy who lived the American dream On the contrary, she says that because of her work with Prof Andrew, who has worked with defectors from the Soviet Union such as former KGB archivist Vasily Mitrokhin, who smuggled out its secrets, she is viewed with suspicion in Russia. ""In Britain, I am now being accused of being a Russian spy. In Russia, some think I am a British spy. And I am neither. I am just a historian who writes about an area that has become incredibly politicised."" ""My life has been completely changed by this,"" says Lokhova, who gave birth to her first child just before the reports emerged this year. She says she became worried about being followed and also nervous of speaking on the phone or meeting friends, unsure if they suspected her of being a spy. She had already been involved in a public row with her former employers - a Russian bank - against whom shewon an employment tribunaland was clearly left bruised by the experience of being drawn into a spy row. ""I felt betrayed that suddenly I had been turned on in such a horrible way forâ¦ attending a dinner to help Western intelligence services understand Russia better.""

Garcia, playing his first tournament since Masters victory last month, recovered from a poor start to card a one-over round of 73. William McGirt and Mackenzie Hughes lead after five-under 67s. World number 11 Scott dropped four shots in the last two holes. The 2013 Masters champion was on six under through 16 holes but hit a five on the par-three 17th and a six on the par-four 18th to shoot a two-under 70. England's Lee Westwood shot a bogey-free round of 70 to reach two under, with compatriot Paul Casey and Northern Ireland's Graeme McDowell a stroke further back. Scott's fellow Australian Jason Day, the world number three, is two under, a shot ahead of a group including world number one Dustin Johnson and Bernhard Langer, who at 59 is the oldest player in the tournament. Rory McIlroy is one over, while Luke Donald and Masters runner-up Justin Rose both opened with a two-over 74. Read Luke Donald's exclusive Sawgrass diary Players Championship: Will Sawgrass event become a major? Garcia started with three bogeys and a double bogey in the first six holes but three birdies in total and the ace on 17 helped him recover to stay in contention. The Spaniard is just the the eighth player to make a hole-in-one on the 17th at Sawgrass in Players Championship history. ""It was nice to see it bounce and kind of spin back into the hole, maybe because I needed it after the start I had,"" said Garcia. ""I wasn't quite in the tournament because of everything that's been going on after the Masters win and media and people congratulating you left, right and centre - I was a little bit up in the clouds, and when I woke up, I was four over after six."" American Johnson narrowly missed out on winning his fourth straight tournament at the Wells Fargo Championship last week, finishing second on his return from the back injury that saw him pull out of the Masters on the first tee. He started with a bogey at Sawgrass, hitting three in total, but two birdies and an eagle on the par-five 16th saw him move to four shots behind the leader. ""I could never really get any momentum - I hit some good shots, then I would lip-out the putt,"" said Johnson. Co-leader McGirt hit three birdies on the front nine and eagled both of the par five holes on the back nine to offset two bogeys. It is the fifth time the 37-year-old American, who won the 2016 Memorial Tournament, has held the lead or a share of the lead after 18 holes but is yet to convert an opening-round lead into victory. Adam Scott won the Masters in 2013 BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter Players can go through spells when they cannot avoid being centre of attention. It seems this is the case for Masters winner Sergio Garcia, who repaired a stumbling start with a hole-in-one on probably the most iconic par three on the PGA Tour. That capped an odd opening day in which a string of big names - Jason Day, Adam Scott and Rickie Fowler included - handed back promising starts. Sawgrass represents an exacting test with no margin for error and that remains the case following the latest renovations to the layout. Rory McIlroy has been troubled with a back problem that hampered his preparations and he will need to shed rust rapidly to have any chance of contending over the weekend.
