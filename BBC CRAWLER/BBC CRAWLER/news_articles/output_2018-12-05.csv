George HW Bush mourned at state funeral,"This video can not be played Highlights from an emotional state funeral for former President George HW Bush An emotional George W Bush has paid tribute to his father, former President George HW Bush, during a state funeral in Washington. Mr Bush Jr, himself a former president, described him as ""a noble man, the best father"". All surviving US presidents attended the funeral, sharing a pew in the US National Cathedral in Washington DC. Mr Bush senior, who served as the 41st US president between 1989 and 1993, died on Friday at the age of 94. He will be buried in his home state of Texas, alongside his wife Barbara. Four presidents sat (awkwardly) on one pew As it happened: US bids farewell to George HW Bush The funeral in pictures In his eulogy, George W Bush said his father had taught him that ""public service is noble and necessary"". ""He accepted failure is part of living a full life, but taught us never to be defined by failure. He showed us how setbacks can strengthen,"" he added. His voice breaking with emotion at the end of his eulogy, Mr Bush said: ""Through our tears, let us know the blessings of knowing and loving you. A great and noble man, the best father a son or daughter could have."" The Trumps, Obamas, Clintons and Carters all attended The invitation-only funeral at the National Cathedral was attended by President Donald Trump and his predecessors Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. The Prince of Wales, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Jordan's King Abdullah II were among the world figures there to pay their respects. Former leaders, including John Major, who was UK prime minister for most of Mr Bush's term, also attended. A life in pictures Service dog Sully pays touching last tribute Wednesday has been declared a national day of mourning - many government offices and US stock exchanges are closed. Following the funeral service, Mr Bush's flag-draped casket was carried from the cathedral by a military honour guard and was later flown to Texas, arriving in Houston at 23:00 GMT. The casket will lie in public repose at St Martin's Episcopal Church until Thursday morning. There will be a second service before the Bush 4141 - a train which was named in honour of the president - takes his body to its final resting place, next to his wife Barbara at the George HW Bush presidential library. Jim McGrath, who was Mr Bush's spokesman, said the president had once wondered if anyone would attend his funeral. Presidential historian Jon Meachamdescribed Mr Bush Sr as ""America's last great soldier statesman"", recounting how he had served as a US Navy pilot in World War Two and survived after his plane was shot down over the Pacific. ""His life was a perennial effort to prove himself worthy of his salvation on that distant morning,"" he said. What is Bush Senior's legacy? The making of a president Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroneypraised Mr Bush Sr's role in navigating the end of the Cold War. ""When George Bush was president of the United States of America, every single head of government in the world knew that they were dealing with a gentleman, a genuine leader, one who was distinguished, resolute and brave,"" he said. Former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpsonsaid Mr Bush had a simple credo: ""What would we do without family and friends?"" George HW Bush was a decorated fighter pilot in World War Two, a head of the CIA and vice-president to Ronald Reagan before being elected president in 1988. His time in office was dominated by foreign policy - and he was praised for how he navigated the end of the Cold War, and handled the first Gulf War. This video can not be played A look back at the life of George Bush Senior However, he was accused of neglecting domestic affairs and, after reneging on a campaign promise not to increase taxes, lost to Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election. He has been described as a bipartisan figure who tried to make conservatism ""kinder and gentler"". Mr Trump has in the past clashed with the Bush family - and Mr Bush told a historian he voted for Mr Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Mr Bush's former White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, told Reuters: ""It's important for our presidents to pay respect to each other and I'm glad President Trump will be there.""

Huawei executive arrested in Canada,"Meng Wanzhou was detained while transferring between flights in Vancouver The daughter of the founder of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei has been arrested in Canada and faces extradition to the United States. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and deputy chair, was arrested in Vancouver on 1 December. Details of the arrest have not been released but the US has been investigating Huawei over possible violation of sanctions against Iran. China's embassy in Canada protested at the arrest and demanded her release. Huawei said it had little information about the charges and was ""not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms Meng"". Why hasn't the UK blocked Huawei? A quick guide to the US-China trade war The arrest comes at a sensitive time for US-China relations. The nations are engaged in a trade war that has seen both impose duties of billions of dollars on one another's goods. The arrest will not help the 90-day tariff truce the nations agreed after President Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping met at the G20. It also coincides with moves to restrict the use of Huawei technology in Western countries. The US, Australia and New Zealand have blocked the use of the Chinese firm's equipment in infrastructure for new faster 5G mobile networks. The UK has not blocked firms from using Huawei, although BT, which dominates the UK's telecoms network,said this weekit would not use the Chinese firm's equipment in its ""core"" 5G infrastructure. Canada's ministry of justice confirmed the date and place of Ms Meng's arrest and added: ""She is sought for extradition by the United States, and a bail hearing has been set for Friday."" It said it could not say more as Ms Meng had sought a ban on the publication of details and this had been ordered by the courts. A spokesman for the US justice department in the Eastern District of New York - which Huawei said had brought the charges - declined to comment. US media have reported that Huawei is under investigation for potential violations of US sanctions against Iran. Huawei is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world One report in the New York Times said the US commerce and treasury departments had subpoenaed the firm over suspected violation of sanctions against both Iran and North Korea. US lawmakers have repeatedly accused the company of being a threat to US national security, arguing that its technology could be used for spying by the Chinese government. Reacting to the arrest, US Senator Ben Sasse told Associated Press that China was aggressively engaged in undermining US national security interests, often ""using private sector entities"". ""Americans are grateful that our Canadian partners have arrested the chief financial officer,"" he added. Huawei said Ms Meng, the daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, was detained while transferring between flights. In a statement, it said it had complied with ""all applicable laws and regulations where it operates, including applicable export control and sanction laws and regulations of the UN, US and EU. ""The company believes the Canadian and US legal systems will ultimately reach a just conclusion."" A statement from the Chinese embassy in Canada,externalwas far angrier. It said that Canada, at the request of the US, had arrested a Chinese citizen ""not violating any American or Canadian law"". ""The Chinese side has lodged stern representations with the US and Canadian side, and urged them to immediately correct the wrongdoing and restore the personal freedom of Ms Meng Wanzhou."" The company is one of the largest telecommunications equipment and services providers in the world, recently passing Apple to become the second-biggest smartphone maker after Samsung.

"Australia releases bilbies into the wildThe small nocturnal animals with long, rabbit-like ears were last seen in New South Wales in 1912.Australia","Bilbies feed on plant roots, ants, beetles and spiders A rare marsupial that once ran wild in Australia's New South Wales has been reintroduced into the state for the first time in more than a century. Bilbies - small nocturnal mammals with long, rabbit-like ears - were last recorded in the state in 1912. But now 30 captive-bred animals were released into a large predator-free enclosure near the town of Narrabri, northwest of Sydney. This is seen as a major victory in efforts to save them from extinction. Royal visit: Prince George was clearly impressed when he saw a bilby at Sydney's zoo in 2014 However, without the protection of a 32km (20 miles) fence they probably would not survive, the BBC's Phil Mercer in Sydney reports. Bilbies - who feed on plant roots, ants, beetles and spiders - disappeared in Australia's most populous state before the start of World War One following the introduction of predators including cats and foxes.

Brexit advice warns of Irish border 'stalemate',"This video can not be played The SNP's Ian Blackford says the Brexit deal denies Scottish rights Theresa May's Brexit backstop plan risks a ""stalemate"" and ""protracted rounds of negotiations"" with the EU,the full legal advice,externalon her deal says. Newly published documents show the PM was told an arrangement designed to prevent a hard Irish border could last ""indefinitely"" and the UK could not ""lawfully exit"" without EU agreement. The Democratic Unionists said this would be ""devastating"" for the UK. But Mrs May rejected SNP claims she has misled Parliament on the issue. Ministers were forced to publish Attorney General Geoffrey Cox's full advice after ministers were found to be in contempt of Parliament on Tuesday for providing only a legal overview earlier this week. Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister said there was ""no difference"" between the two documents and the legal position on her proposed ""temporary"" customs arrangement with the EU was clear. Parliament Live: MPs debating Brexit Reality Check: Legal advice on the Brexit deal Kuenssberg: May making new enemies, not finding fans DUP 'would back Tories in confidence vote' While the UK would have no unilateral right to withdraw from the backstop - a measure designed to prevent the return of physical checks on the Irish border by the UK and EU sharing a single customs territory - she insisted neither the UK nor the EU wanted it to come into force in the first place. But the Democratic Unionists said the advice was explicit that Northern Ireland would end up subject to different EU regulatory and customs rules from the rest of the UK and be treated as a ""third country"" in terms of trade with England, Scotland and Wales. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that, amid fears Mrs May was heading for a heavy defeat in next Tuesday's vote on the final deal, there was talk among MPs about a compromise amendment being tabled on the backstop, giving Parliament some kind of check on it coming into force.

The government argued that Mr Cox's analysis of the Brexit deal, published on Monday, was adequate and disclosing his full and final advice would be against the national interest. Labour and other opposition parties said ministers had ""wilfully"" refused to comply with a binding vote in the Commons last month which demanded full disclosure and MPs agreed with this in a vote on Tuesday. In his six-page letter,externalto Mrs May, written on 13 November but published on Wednesday, Mr Cox said the ""current drafting"" of the backstop ""does not allow for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK to lawfully exit the UK wide customs union without a subsequent agreement"". ""This remains the case even if the parties are negotiating many years later and even if the parties agree that talks have clearly broken down and there is no prospect of a future relationship agreement."" MPs may try to steal Brexit, says Liam Fox No deal 'would risk public's protection' MPs may try to steal Brexit, says Liam Fox The backstop has become a defining issue for many Tory critics of the PM's deal - who say that it infringes the UK's sovereignty and will prevent the UK from being able to negotiate its own trade deals. Mr Cox said that despite assurances that the arrangement was not intended to be permanent ""in international law the protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place"". ""In the absence of a right of termination, there is a legal risk that the UK might become subject to protracted and repeated rounds of negotiations,"" he said. ""The resolution of such a stalemate would have to be political."" However, he also put forward the case that the ""risk"" of getting entangled in the backstop had to be weighed ""against the political and economic imperative of both sides to reach an agreement that constitutes a politically stable and permanent basis for their future relationship"". The BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman When lawyers give legal advice they are expected to speak frankly. Many will conclude this advice is franker and starker than the way in which the government has presented the legal implications of the withdrawal agreement. In particular on the Northern Ireland backstop, it is there in black and white, that in the absence of an agreement replacing it, the backstop will continue indefinitely. The UK could not force the EU to conclude an agreement bringing it to an end. That punctures the government's optimism on the issue. Whereas Article 50 allowed the UK to pull out of the EU, there is no provision for the UK to pull out of the withdrawal agreement. That will pour petrol on the flames of the political debate. Reality Check: Legal advice on the Brexit deal Kuenssberg: May making new enemies, not finding fans The prime minister has insisted there can be no Brexit deal without a backstop of some kind to protect commitments made to Northern Ireland in the Good Friday Agreement. But she came under fire at Prime Minister's Questions from the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford. ""The legal advice is clear,"" he said. ""It states: despite statements in the protocol it is not permanent, in international law the protocol would endure indefinitely. Since the prime minister returned from Brussels with her deal, the prime minister has been misleading the House inadvertently or otherwise. ""Is it time that the prime minister took responsibility for concealing the facts on her Brexit deal from members in this House and the public? The PM told MPs all the material published in the past few days was consistent. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict What do the Commons defeats mean for Brexit? What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? She said she had made it clear that the UK could not unilaterally leave the backstop plan, so had not been at odds with the legal advice, which made it clear the UK had no sovereign right to withdraw. But she insisted the arrangement would, if it came into force, give the UK a number of competitive advantages and therefore the EU would not want the UK ""to be in it any longer than necessary"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: EU makes 'predatory claim' on Northern Ireland But the DUP's Sammy Wilson said other EU members would use the backstop as a ""cudgel"" to obtain concessions from the UK in future trade talks. And former foreign secretary Boris Johnson suggested the backstop could easily be dispensed with as it was ""not essential"" to the wider deal and everybody believed ""you can solve this without a hard border"". ""Let's just get rid of this nightmarish system that keeps us effectively clamped in the EU, and really stopping Brexit from taking place,"" he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. Labour said the legal advice showed the ""central weakness"" of the PM's Brexit deal while the Lib Dems said it would leave the UK trapped in a ""Brexit hamster wheel"". This video can not be played Sam Gyimah: Brexit negotiations have been set up for failure The second of five days of debate on Mrs May's Brexit agreement is under way, focusing on security and immigration. The government suffered three embarrassing defeats on Tuesday, on the role that MPs will play if Mrs May's deal is rejected as well as the disclosure of the legal advice. Ex-defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon told MPs he could not support Mrs May's deal, saying it was too much of a ""gamble"" to sign up to EU rules when the UK did not know what it was getting in return. ""We put all our cards and all our money on the table and we wait for another two years for the EU to set the rules of the game. That is a risk too far"". But Chancellor Philip Hammond warned that if the deal was rejected, either the UK could end up leaving without a deal or Brexit could unravel entirely, leaving ""half the nation feeling betrayed"". ""I take the judgement that when there is a deal on the table that has very, very modest costs to the economy, which will allow us to move on as a nation both economically and politically, I judge that even narrowly, economically that will be in the best interests of the country,"" he told the Treasury committee. Earlier, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox warned there was a risk of Parliament trying to ""steal Brexit from the British people"". He said there was a ""natural Remain majority"" in Parliament and that any attempts to delay the UK's departure or overturn the 2016 referendum result would be a ""democratic affront"".

Neo-Nazis suggest Harry should be shot,"Andrew Dymock (left) and Oskar Koczorowski are both linked to the UK group A university student from Bath and a London teenager are among those involved with a UK version of a violent American neo-Nazi group linked to five murders, a BBC investigation has found. A propaganda image placed online by the British group suggests Prince Harry is a ""race traitor"" and should be shot. Private messages between members show the leader stating that police officers should be raped and killed. Evidence suggests the leader is Andrew Dymock, 21. He denies wrongdoing. The BBC has seen evidence he set up the new British group known as the Sonnenkrieg Division. Mr Dymock, who is originally from Bath and whose father is a dentistry professor, has been studying at university in Wales. A key propagandist - responsible for designing extremist material - is said to be Oskar Koczorowski from west London, who is only 17 years old. He did not respond to a request for comment. A BBC researcher has been able to obtain hundreds of messages sent by several extremists over several months on an online gaming server. The messages show neo-Nazis from Europe and the US - hiding behind pseudonyms - engaging in racism and misogyny, glorifying violence and cruelty, and discussing the production of propaganda. The chat logs include senior members of the Atomwaffen Division, a nihilistic American organisation that encourages terrorism and says civilisation needs to be smashed in order to build a national socialist state. Neo-Nazis from Europe and the US hide behind pseudonyms in the online chats The group promotes a dystopian ideology it calls ""universal order"" which lionises Adolf Hitler, the murderous cult leader Charles Manson, and the veteran neo-Nazi ideologue James Mason, who provides regular diatribes for a website run by Atomwaffen members. Atomwaffen - the word means atomic weapons in German - has been linked to five murders and its co-founder was jailed earlier this year for explosives offences. Online propaganda videos show Atomwaffen members engaging in firearms training and calling for a ""race war now"". Messages from the gaming server include correspondence about the creation of the Sonnenkrieg Division. ""Blitzy"" described Sonnenkrieg as ""full on Universal Order"" and ""atomwaffen with less guns"". He also discussed his plans to travel to the US to meet Atomwaffen members in person. In one exchange, he stated ""kill all police officers"" and said they should be ""raped to death"". The BBC has obtained evidence that ""Blitzy"" is Mr Dymock, and that he and Mr Koczorowski, who uses a separate pseudonym, both placed Sonnenkrieg propaganda into the chats. Violent images posted by the group on social media state ""fill your heart with hate"" and glorify the Norwegian terrorist and mass murderer Anders Breivik. One image suggests that Prince Harry should be shot for marrying someone of mixed race and exclaims ""see ya later race traitor"". A further image, showing a female hanging from a noose, states that white women who date non-white men should be killed. Mr Koczorowski posted images of himself wearing an Atomwaffen top near Parliament and a video of a British flag being burnt. It is thought Sonnenkrieg has no more than 10-15 members in the UK and some European countries. The parents of American teenager Blaze Bernstein, allegedly murdered by an Atomwaffen member in what is being treated as a hate crime, told the BBC that people in the UK should be wary of spin-offs of the group. Jeanne Pepper Bernstein, whose son was allegedly killed because he was gay and Jewish, said the ""group is a disease and the only way to eradicate it is to figure out where it is and root it out"". The killing of Blaze Bernstein is being treated as a hate crime Blaze's father Gideon said: ""If it can happen to us it can happen anywhere in the world."" Other private messages show some neo-Nazis claiming they have encouraged young women to engage in acts of self-harm along with pictures of the mutilation and criticism of the women concerned. It is understood that Mr Dymock has been questioned by police over alleged sexual offences against a teenage girl. Images, allegedly shared by Mr Dymock with his associates and later placed online, show a swastika and runic symbols cut into a girl's naked body and - in another image - Mr Dymock appears to brandish a book by James Mason in the air as she lies on the floor. The bed seen in the images is consistent with the background in a picture posted by ""Blitzy"" and another of Mr Dymock himself. It is understood that both Mr Dymock and Mr Koczorowski were previously involved with the neo-Nazi group System Resistance Network, which can be linked to acts of racist vandalism in as many as 10 UK cities. The BBC has been told that Mr Koczorowski was a pre-ban member of National Action, which became the first extreme-right organisation to be outlawed in the UK since the war when it was proscribed under terrorism legislation in December 2016. The BBC approached both men setting out our findings and seeking comment. Mr Dymock said through his lawyer that all our allegations were ""wholly incorrect"", that he was not a member of any organisation mentioned and any interest he did have was ""associated with his university studies"". Mr Koczorowski came to the door of his London home wearing a hooded top emblazoned with the Atomwaffen Division logo. He did not respond to our allegations.

The key bits of the legal advice,"The government has been forced to publish the legal advice given to Prime Minister Theresa May by the Attorney General Geoffrey Cox on the proposed backstop plan, which aims to avoid a hard  border in Ireland under all circumstances. The backstop, or guarantee, appears in a ""Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland"", which forms part of the UK's Withdrawal Agreement with the EU. It would only come into effect if a UK-EU trade agreement keeping the border open is not ready by the end of a post-Brexit transition period. Much of the advice given by the attorney general is not new, but it isset out in black and white,externalfor the first time. Here are some excerpts from the six-page document. This is a reminder that Northern Ireland would be more deeply entwined in the EU's customs rules and procedures than the rest of the UK. Northern Ireland would retain full membership of the EU customs union, while Great Britain would be in a separate customs union with the EU. The outcome of this complex arrangement is that the whole of the United Kingdom would be in a single customs territory with the EU. That means there would be no tariffs on goods passing between anywhere in the UK and the EU, but declarations would have to be made (not involving any kind of border checks) for goods passing from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. It is a carefully crafted fudge, in other words, with which no-one is entirely happy. This section spells out clearly the implications of Northern Ireland remaining in the EU's single market for goods while the rest of the UK does not. Again, there are no surprises here, but the attorney general emphasises that, for regulatory purposes, Great Britain would be treated as a third (or separate) country by Northern Ireland. That means that for goods crossing the Irish Sea to Northern Ireland (but not in the other direction) regulatory checks would have to take place. The EU has conceded that many of them (on things like product standards) could take place online or away from ports or airports. But that is not the case for checks on food and animal produce. There are already checks on live animals arriving  in Northern Ireland from Great Britain, but this would be a much broader system of controls. This point is already clear in the text of the Withdrawal Agreement, but the attorney general is giving a legal opinion about international law: everyone says the backstop is intended to be temporary, but it could - in theory - remain in place indefinitely ""unless or until"" another permanent agreement takes its place. This is only one of several ways in which many supporters of Brexit fear a trap, although it is quite clear that the EU is equally uncomfortable with many aspects of the backstop. Please upgrade your browser The attorney general sets out at some length why the EU does not like the backstop either. It raises awkward legal questions about the UK (a country that will no longer be part of the EU) being responsible for protecting one of the borders of the EU single market. It could also, he suggests, provoke complaints (legal or otherwise) from Irish companies, which might argue that the EU is giving rival companies in Northern Ireland the competitive advantage of full access to both the EU and UK markets. And it complicates the EU's ability to strike future trade deals around the world, because the EU would not be able to define the extent of its customs territory precisely. It is likely to be important for the EU, the attorney general says, that the backstop can be presented as ""a temporary arrangement with a clear and early end"". As if there was not already enough concern being expressed about the backstop and the lack of a UK right to leave it unilaterally, this will add fuel to the fire. It suggests that the language used in the protocol to the Withdrawal Agreement might allow the EU to suggest that the UK-wide part of the backstop should be abandoned, while keeping Northern Ireland closely tied to the EU. But the lack of a unilateral exit clause cuts both ways. If the UK cannot bring the backstop to an end without the EU's approval, then similarly the UK would have to agree to the EU ending it. It has been designed deliberately to concentrate minds on a permanent alternative solution. In the end, as the attorney general points out, this is a highly political construction. But the prospect of the UK being unable to leave a temporary customs union without a subsequent agreement on the Irish border makes many people extremely uncomfortable. This gets to the heart of the problem. The EU believes the only way for the Irish border to remain as open as it is now is for either Northern Ireland or the whole of the UK to stay in the customs union and the single market. And it says it is still waiting for the UK to come up with a credible alternative plan. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external Brexit Basics: Customs union.

"Kuenssberg: Enemies, not fans","Theresa May is holding meetings with MPs to try to win their backing over her deal This is not - I repeat NOT - a re-run of the referendum. Theresa May will never convince purists on either side of the Brexit debate that they are wrong to believe it's right to leave, or heresy to argue to stay. What she needs to do is get enough of her colleagues to accept they can't have everything they desire, but that there is enough in her compromise to say yes to an arrangement that fulfils the Tories' political promises. So far, however, her arguments don't seem to be holding much sway. The tally of Tory MPs who've declared they're willing to vote against is rising - irrespective of whether the public detests or ignores the circus. Brexit advice warns of border 'stalemate' No deal 'would risk public's protection' Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict With less than a week to go, despite the prime minister's private meetings with dozens of backbenchers, they are not emerging convinced. If anything, her compromise seems to be making new enemies, not finding new fans. And fresh from a trio of defeats, Mrs May seems to be arguing the case with diminishing authority. A tentative hunt for changes that could peel rebels away seems fruitless so far. Just when the prime minister needs goodwill, respect and trust, it is in very short supply. One senior Tory told me: ""She doesn't listen to anyone, so why should we.""

DUP will vote down deal but back Tories,"The Democratic Unionists will back Theresa May's government in any vote of no confidence should her Brexit deal be rejected, its Westminster leader says. Nigel Dodds told ITV his party would vote against the deal, but it would be ""illogical"" to vote out the government. Labour has said it will immediately press for a confidence vote if the deal is voted down next Tuesday. If successful, the move could trigger a general election if no alternative government is formed in 14 days. At a meeting of Tory backbenchers on Wednesday evening, Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith appealed for civility in internal party arguments over Brexit. Government sources said the whip's office was ""looking at all options"" to secure the support of the Commons. The vote on the withdrawal deal and the declaration on future relations will take place on 11 December. Live: MPs debate Brexit deal Brexit advice warns of border 'stalemate' Mr Dodds told ITV's Robert Peston: ""Clearly if [the deal] is defeated, it would be somewhat illogical - having achieved our aim trying to get to a better deal - it would be illogical then to turn around the next day and say 'let's vote the government out'. ""I think then we start on a process to try to get a better deal."" Following a meeting of Conservative members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group in Westminster - attended by leading DUP figures - its chair Jacob Rees-Mogg said there was a risk of the DUP withholding its support for the government if Parliament approved the PM's deal on the terms of leaving the EU. The DUP currently has a parliamentary pact with the Conservatives, known as a confidence and supply agreement, in which it effectively props up Mrs May's government by supporting it in key votes. But Mr Dodds reiterated that the deal ""is with the Conservative Party, not with Theresa May or any particular politician"". The party's 10 MPs are expected to vote against the withdrawal deal amid anger over a proposed customs arrangement between the UK and the EU. They say it will see Northern Ireland separated economically and politically from England, Scotland and Wales. Speaking earlier during a debate on the Brexit deal in the Commons, DUP MP Sammy Wilson said Mrs May had ""broken promises"" made to her party to protect the constitutional integrity of the UK and if the deal went through it would create ""further tensions"". Mrs May is struggling to muster sufficient support to get her deal through, with Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP all opposed and scores of Tory MPs saying they cannot support it. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the tally of potential Tory rebels was rising and backbenchers who have held private meetings with the prime minister were not emerging convinced.

Neo-Nazis suggest Harry should be shotA BBC investigation finds a UK student has set up a British version of a violent US group.UK,"Andrew Dymock (left) and Oskar Koczorowski are both linked to the UK group A university student from Bath and a London teenager are among those involved with a UK version of a violent American neo-Nazi group linked to five murders, a BBC investigation has found. A propaganda image placed online by the British group suggests Prince Harry is a ""race traitor"" and should be shot. Private messages between members show the leader stating that police officers should be raped and killed. Evidence suggests the leader is Andrew Dymock, 21. He denies wrongdoing. The BBC has seen evidence he set up the new British group known as the Sonnenkrieg Division. Mr Dymock, who is originally from Bath and whose father is a dentistry professor, has been studying at university in Wales. A key propagandist - responsible for designing extremist material - is said to be Oskar Koczorowski from west London, who is only 17 years old. He did not respond to a request for comment. A BBC researcher has been able to obtain hundreds of messages sent by several extremists over several months on an online gaming server. The messages show neo-Nazis from Europe and the US - hiding behind pseudonyms - engaging in racism and misogyny, glorifying violence and cruelty, and discussing the production of propaganda. The chat logs include senior members of the Atomwaffen Division, a nihilistic American organisation that encourages terrorism and says civilisation needs to be smashed in order to build a national socialist state. Neo-Nazis from Europe and the US hide behind pseudonyms in the online chats The group promotes a dystopian ideology it calls ""universal order"" which lionises Adolf Hitler, the murderous cult leader Charles Manson, and the veteran neo-Nazi ideologue James Mason, who provides regular diatribes for a website run by Atomwaffen members. Atomwaffen - the word means atomic weapons in German - has been linked to five murders and its co-founder was jailed earlier this year for explosives offences. Online propaganda videos show Atomwaffen members engaging in firearms training and calling for a ""race war now"". Messages from the gaming server include correspondence about the creation of the Sonnenkrieg Division. ""Blitzy"" described Sonnenkrieg as ""full on Universal Order"" and ""atomwaffen with less guns"". He also discussed his plans to travel to the US to meet Atomwaffen members in person. In one exchange, he stated ""kill all police officers"" and said they should be ""raped to death"". The BBC has obtained evidence that ""Blitzy"" is Mr Dymock, and that he and Mr Koczorowski, who uses a separate pseudonym, both placed Sonnenkrieg propaganda into the chats. Violent images posted by the group on social media state ""fill your heart with hate"" and glorify the Norwegian terrorist and mass murderer Anders Breivik. One image suggests that Prince Harry should be shot for marrying someone of mixed race and exclaims ""see ya later race traitor"". A further image, showing a female hanging from a noose, states that white women who date non-white men should be killed. Mr Koczorowski posted images of himself wearing an Atomwaffen top near Parliament and a video of a British flag being burnt. It is thought Sonnenkrieg has no more than 10-15 members in the UK and some European countries. The parents of American teenager Blaze Bernstein, allegedly murdered by an Atomwaffen member in what is being treated as a hate crime, told the BBC that people in the UK should be wary of spin-offs of the group. Jeanne Pepper Bernstein, whose son was allegedly killed because he was gay and Jewish, said the ""group is a disease and the only way to eradicate it is to figure out where it is and root it out"". The killing of Blaze Bernstein is being treated as a hate crime Blaze's father Gideon said: ""If it can happen to us it can happen anywhere in the world.""

"George HW Bush mourned at state funeralHis son George W Bush paid an emotional tribute, describing the former president as ""a noble man"".US & Canada","This video can not be played Highlights from an emotional state funeral for former President George HW Bush An emotional George W Bush has paid tribute to his father, former President George HW Bush, during a state funeral in Washington. Mr Bush Jr, himself a former president, described him as ""a noble man, the best father"". All surviving US presidents attended the funeral, sharing a pew in the US National Cathedral in Washington DC. Mr Bush senior, who served as the 41st US president between 1989 and 1993, died on Friday at the age of 94. He will be buried in his home state of Texas, alongside his wife Barbara. Four presidents sat (awkwardly) on one pew As it happened: US bids farewell to George HW Bush The funeral in pictures In his eulogy, George W Bush said his father had taught him that ""public service is noble and necessary"". ""He accepted failure is part of living a full life, but taught us never to be defined by failure. He showed us how setbacks can strengthen,"" he added. His voice breaking with emotion at the end of his eulogy, Mr Bush said: ""Through our tears, let us know the blessings of knowing and loving you. A great and noble man, the best father a son or daughter could have."" The Trumps, Obamas, Clintons and Carters all attended The invitation-only funeral at the National Cathedral was attended by President Donald Trump and his predecessors Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. The Prince of Wales, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Jordan's King Abdullah II were among the world figures there to pay their respects. Former leaders, including John Major, who was UK prime minister for most of Mr Bush's term, also attended. A life in pictures Service dog Sully pays touching last tribute Wednesday has been declared a national day of mourning - many government offices and US stock exchanges are closed. Following the funeral service, Mr Bush's flag-draped casket was carried from the cathedral by a military honour guard and was later flown to Texas, arriving in Houston at 23:00 GMT. The casket will lie in public repose at St Martin's Episcopal Church until Thursday morning. There will be a second service before the Bush 4141 - a train which was named in honour of the president - takes his body to its final resting place, next to his wife Barbara at the George HW Bush presidential library. Jim McGrath, who was Mr Bush's spokesman, said the president had once wondered if anyone would attend his funeral. Presidential historian Jon Meachamdescribed Mr Bush Sr as ""America's last great soldier statesman"", recounting how he had served as a US Navy pilot in World War Two and survived after his plane was shot down over the Pacific. ""His life was a perennial effort to prove himself worthy of his salvation on that distant morning,"" he said. What is Bush Senior's legacy? The making of a president Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroneypraised Mr Bush Sr's role in navigating the end of the Cold War. ""When George Bush was president of the United States of America, every single head of government in the world knew that they were dealing with a gentleman, a genuine leader, one who was distinguished, resolute and brave,"" he said. Former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpsonsaid Mr Bush had a simple credo: ""What would we do without family and friends?"" George HW Bush was a decorated fighter pilot in World War Two, a head of the CIA and vice-president to Ronald Reagan before being elected president in 1988. His time in office was dominated by foreign policy - and he was praised for how he navigated the end of the Cold War, and handled the first Gulf War. This video can not be played A look back at the life of George Bush Senior However, he was accused of neglecting domestic affairs and, after reneging on a campaign promise not to increase taxes, lost to Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election. He has been described as a bipartisan figure who tried to make conservatism ""kinder and gentler"". Mr Trump has in the past clashed with the Bush family - and Mr Bush told a historian he voted for Mr Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Mr Bush's former White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, told Reuters: ""It's important for our presidents to pay respect to each other and I'm glad President Trump will be there.""

A BBC researcher has been able to obtain hundreds of messages sent by several extremists over several months on an online gaming server. The messages show neo-Nazis from Europe and the US - hiding behind pseudonyms - engaging in racism and misogyny, glorifying violence and cruelty, and discussing the production of propaganda. The chat logs include senior members of the Atomwaffen Division, a nihilistic American organisation that encourages terrorism and says civilisation needs to be smashed in order to build a national socialist state. Neo-Nazis from Europe and the US hide behind pseudonyms in the online chats The group promotes a dystopian ideology it calls ""universal order"" which lionises Adolf Hitler, the murderous cult leader Charles Manson, and the veteran neo-Nazi ideologue James Mason, who provides regular diatribes for a website run by Atomwaffen members. Atomwaffen - the word means atomic weapons in German - has been linked to five murders and its co-founder was jailed earlier this year for explosives offences. Online propaganda videos show Atomwaffen members engaging in firearms training and calling for a ""race war now"". Messages from the gaming server include correspondence about the creation of the Sonnenkrieg Division. ""Blitzy"" described Sonnenkrieg as ""full on Universal Order"" and ""atomwaffen with less guns"". He also discussed his plans to travel to the US to meet Atomwaffen members in person. In one exchange, he stated ""kill all police officers"" and said they should be ""raped to death"". The BBC has obtained evidence that ""Blitzy"" is Mr Dymock, and that he and Mr Koczorowski, who uses a separate pseudonym, both placed Sonnenkrieg propaganda into the chats. Violent images posted by the group on social media state ""fill your heart with hate"" and glorify the Norwegian terrorist and mass murderer Anders Breivik. One image suggests that Prince Harry should be shot for marrying someone of mixed race and exclaims ""see ya later race traitor"". A further image, showing a female hanging from a noose, states that white women who date non-white men should be killed. Mr Koczorowski posted images of himself wearing an Atomwaffen top near Parliament and a video of a British flag being burnt. It is thought Sonnenkrieg has no more than 10-15 members in the UK and some European countries. The parents of American teenager Blaze Bernstein, allegedly murdered by an Atomwaffen member in what is being treated as a hate crime, told the BBC that people in the UK should be wary of spin-offs of the group. Jeanne Pepper Bernstein, whose son was allegedly killed because he was gay and Jewish, said the ""group is a disease and the only way to eradicate it is to figure out where it is and root it out"". The killing of Blaze Bernstein is being treated as a hate crime Blaze's father Gideon said: ""If it can happen to us it can happen anywhere in the world."" Other private messages show some neo-Nazis claiming they have encouraged young women to engage in acts of self-harm along with pictures of the mutilation and criticism of the women concerned. It is understood that Mr Dymock has been questioned by police over alleged sexual offences against a teenage girl. Images, allegedly shared by Mr Dymock with his associates and later placed online, show a swastika and runic symbols cut into a girl's naked body and - in another image - Mr Dymock appears to brandish a book by James Mason in the air as she lies on the floor. The bed seen in the images is consistent with the background in a picture posted by ""Blitzy"" and another of Mr Dymock himself. It is understood that both Mr Dymock and Mr Koczorowski were previously involved with the neo-Nazi group System Resistance Network, which can be linked to acts of racist vandalism in as many as 10 UK cities. The BBC has been told that Mr Koczorowski was a pre-ban member of National Action, which became the first extreme-right organisation to be outlawed in the UK since the war when it was proscribed under terrorism legislation in December 2016. The BBC approached both men setting out our findings and seeking comment. Mr Dymock said through his lawyer that all our allegations were ""wholly incorrect"", that he was not a member of any organisation mentioned and any interest he did have was ""associated with his university studies"". Mr Koczorowski came to the door of his London home wearing a hooded top emblazoned with the Atomwaffen Division logo. He did not respond to our allegations. The BBC will be passing all its evidence to the police.

Footage of school murder gunman released,"This video can not be played CCTV footage of the gunman before and after the shooting has been released by police Police investigating the murder of a man outside a west Belfast school have arrested two men, aged 49 and 51. Jim Donegan, 43, was shot in his car as he waited for his 13-year-old son near St Mary's Grammar School on Tuesday. The arrests on Wednesday evening came after police carried out searches in west Belfast. On Wednesday afternoon, police released CCTV footage of the gunman before and after the shooting. Det Ch Insp Peter Montgomery described the murder as a ""barbaric assassination"". Jim Donegan was shot dead as he waited to pick his son up from school CCTV footage shows the gunman walking to the scene and later running from it. The victim was a husband, a brother, a father to two sons and a stepfather, said Det Ch Insp Montgomery of the Police Servivce of Northern Ireland (PSNI). ""Hundreds of children were pouring out of the three schools in the Glen Road area of west Belfast at the time - many of them witnessing the assassination of the father of two,"" he said. ""Jim's son was spared from this thankfully but only by a few seconds. ""Mums, dads, grandparents, young siblings and people in the community also saw the brutal slaying. ""The callous actions of the gunman will have catastrophic psychological effects on them all."" This video can not be played ""We took our coats off and put them round the car"" Det Ch Insp Montgomery said the gunman walked past the children and fired eight times. That was ""utter madness"" as, in the circumstances, there could easily have been a ricochet resulting in multiple deaths. The shooter was wearing a hi-vis yellow jacket with ""Security"" printed on the back and was carrying a dark bag. Police believe the gun was in the bag. He walked from a lane, past parents and children. After the murder, he ran back up Glen Road and along the lane on to Clonelly Avenue. Police want to speak to anyone who saw the victim's red Porsche shortly before the shooting The detective thanked people in the community who had helped them and appealed for more information or dashcam footage. Speaking on Wednesday morning, the school's interim principal Fiona Crookes saidpupils ""had to walk past the scene"" of the shooting. St Mary's Grammar was closed on Wednesday. Mrs Crookes told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme: ""Our primary concern at that stage was that they wouldn't see what we had to see."" Mr Donegan's son soon became ""our priority"" as he walked down the lane to meet his father, she added. Pupils will be offered counselling when the school reopens on Thursday.

"Girls 'more likely to face loneliness'About one in 10 young people often feel lonely, with fears that loneliness will be seen as ""failing"".Family & Education","The worry about being seen as lonely becomes another pressure in itself Young women are more likely than young men to have feelings of loneliness, according to a study from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). About one in 10 young people in the UK often feel lonely, says the first such analysis from the ONS. The study found a ""stigma"" attached to loneliness, with young people fearing it would be seen as ""failing"". There were young people who used social media to ""cover up"" their feelings and pretend their lives were not lonely. Thestudy from the ONS looks at the extent of loneliness,externalamong people aged between 10 and 24. There were about 11% who often felt lonely and a further 34% who sometimes felt lonely - with more girls than boys feeling this way. The research looked at factors that seemed to make loneliness more likely - and found it was particularly associated with times of transition in young lives. The move from primary school to secondary school and from school to university were both likely to be associated with loneliness. Loneliness strategy to remove social stigma I'm surrounded by people but feel so lonely Loneliness more likely to affect young people Loneliness - the last taboo Young people in cities were more likely to be lonely than those in rural areas or smaller towns. Poorer youngsters, such as those eligible for free school meals, had higher rates of loneliness. Loneliness could also be associated with specific problems - such as illness, family tensions, bereavement or bullying. The fear of being seen as lonely was another problem in itself. There was an embarrassment about being seen as lonely, with a worry that it would label people as being socially unattractive or unpopular. Social media could be used to keep in touch with friends, but it could also be used by people wanting to pretend they were not lonely. Young people interviewed for the study said social media could make them feel excluded or leave them with only ""shallow"" exchanges instead of genuine friendship. The study from the ONS follows growing concern about the impact of loneliness. The governmentlaunched its first loneliness strategythis autumn, in response to worries about an ""epidemic of loneliness"". Dawn Snape, of the ONS, says the study will provide more information about how loneliness might affect people's health and wellbeing. ""We've looked at how often children and young people feel lonely and why. An important factor is going through transitional life stages such as the move from primary to secondary school and, later, leaving school or higher education and adapting to early adult life.""

Forced marriage husband 'raped me daily',"This video can not be played Rubie Marie was told her trip to Bangladesh was a holiday, when in fact she was about to be forced to marry a man twice her age Criminalising forced marriage could stop victims from speaking up if their parents are locked up, campaigners say. While legislation sends a ""strong message,"" a charity working with victims said it also scared off others. Rubie Marie, 35, who was forced to marry in Bangladesh when she was 15, said: ""It is hard because you love your family of course you do... But at the end of the day abuse is abuse."" The Home Office said it was essential victims had confidence to speak out. Forced marriage became a criminal offence in 2014, butonly one case has been brought in Walessince then - with four convictions in total across the UK. However, the Welsh Government estimates there are up to 100 cases of forced marriage every year. Rubie Marie was raped almost daily by her husband in Bangladesh after being forced to marry him at the age of 15 In 2018, the forced marriage unit - a joint effort between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Home Office -gave advice or support in 1,196 UK cases,external. Shahien Taj of the Cardiff-based Henna Foundation told BBC Wales Live more prevention work was needed to educate perpetrators, who are often the victims' parents. The charity said victims often wanted to return to the family home once the situation was resolved. ""I don't know a single victim that I've worked with that has said she's ok with the police coming down on parents like a tonne of bricks - all too often they don't want any intervention because of that,"" said Ms Taj. Ms Marie, who now lives in the Midlands, said once she was married, she was raped ""more or less, every single day"" so her new husband could have a child and a ticket to live in the UK. Why are there so few forced marriage prosecutions? Using spoons to stop forced marriage 'I want to explain arranged marriage to Westerners' Rubie Marie was forced to marry a man twice her age after being taken to Bangladesh The Home Office is consulting on proposals that would legally require those who work closely with young people, such as teachers and social workers, to report suspected cases of forced marriage. Ms Taj believesforced marriage protection orders,externalare the preferred route - allowing young people to apply to the courts for protection, while keeping the family out of the criminal system. ""We've had eight cases where young women have gone home and been able to move on with their lives,"" she said. Samsunear Ali from the charity Bawso said education was key as many parents did not even realise they were breaking the law. ""For them they are doing the right thing and that's the only way they know how to reduce the level of shame in the family that this child could potentially bring. ""It's a huge problem in Wales, and it's still not being talked about as much."" She said there were cases in rural Wales where women had no support and they were at greater risk, with forced marriages potentially ""going on for generations and nobody knows about it"". Rubie Marie - pictured here aged five - was told her trip to Bangladesh was a holiday Rubie Marie was born and raised in south Wales. She had a happy childhood but everything changed once she hit puberty. She was taken to Bangladesh in 1998 at the age of 15 under the pretence of it being a holiday. ""We were only supposed to go for six weeks but then it went to two months, then it went to three months, then it got to six months and we all got homesick,"" she said. ""I asked my father, I said we want to go home. I want to go back to school. I want my friends. But he would say things like 'we spent so much money coming here'â¦ That was his excuse, his cover up, his facade to plan what he was planning which was the marriage. ""I was sitting down having dinner with the whole family and he just came in and he sat down and he started to eat and out of the blue, and I remember it like it was yesterday, ""'Wouldn't it be great if we got Rubie married?' And I was mortified. I was a kid and I had a tantrum. I threw my plate on the floor. I started kicking off, banging the doors, ran into my room screaming, shouting. I just didn't know how to comprehend that information. ""I was put on a bidding system. One of my uncles went and started bidding me. It was horrible. I was treated like a slave. ""I was in this alien country - I didn't know where to go, where to turn to, didn't know where there was a phone. Nothing."" Ms Marie was forced to marry a man twice her age and for her engagement she was ""dressed up like a doll"". ""The house was full of laughing people, you know there was people everywhere trying to come into my room to see me, to have a peek at this new bride,"" she said. ""And I was just sitting there just thinking 'I'm just an object'. You just got to do what you've got to do and that's it. My vision was just get home, do whatever you need to do to get home."" Once she was married, her new husband wanted a child. ""More or less, I'd been raped every single day to get pregnant, so then he's got an official British pathway of coming to Britain because he's got a child. That was their plan,"" she added. She got pregnant and came back to Wales to give birth. When the baby was born, she fled: ""That brought shame to the family again in their eyes. And I was disowned for a very long time."" Rubie now works as an ambassador, educating people about forced marriage. ""Now I'm speaking and talking to the world and sharing in that way of there is light at the end of the tunnel, there is a place for you in this world. ""It's not all doom and gloom. And it's not hell. You've got to turn it around. You've got to find that strength to turn it around and use it to your advantage and make it a happy place otherwise no one's going to do that for you."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""We know that forced marriage is often a hidden crime and so it is essential that victims have the confidence to come forward to get the help they need. ""We are seeking views on whether introducing a mandatory reporting duty might help strengthen protections for victims and ensure more perpetrators are brought to justice. ""The consultation is open to everyone and we are particularly interested in hearing from victims and survivors of forced marriage, and professionals with expertise in the issue of forced marriage.""

Arron Banks firm 'has no address',"The company which the Electoral Commission suspects may have been behind Britain's biggest political donation has no registered address - meaning it has failed to fulfil a key legal requirement - the BBC has found. Rock Holdings is a firm registered in the Isle of Man and controlled by Leave.EU founder Arron Banks. The Electoral Commission's ongoing investigation of Leave.EU funds was referred to the National Crime Agency. Mr Banks denies any wrongdoing. But BBC Newsnight has found that Rock Holdings has no official registered address on the Isle of Man and that it is therefore ""in default"", meaning it is not compliant with company law on the island. Meanwhile one of Mr Banks's companies has obstructed the BBC's attempt at seeing Rock Holdings' accounts - despite formally agreeing with Companies House that it would ensure the documents would be made publicly available. Brexit campaign and Banks staff 'switched' Banks challenged over Leave.EU funds Leave.EU and Banks firm face Â£135,000 fines Mr Banks is a multimillionaire insurance mogul behind the Go Skippy car insurance brand. He loaned Â£8m to the Leave.EU campaign before the 2016 EU referendum and says the money came from his company, Rock Services, based at his office in Catbrain Lane, Bristol. The Electoral Commission suspectsthe money may have come from another Banks entity, Rock Holdings, based on the Isle of Man. They, along with the National Crime Agency, are examining whether ""impermissible money"" may have been used to help fund the Leave campaign before the 2016 EU referendum. The law on political money is simple. The source should be clear, transparent and British. If the Â£8m came from Rock Holdings, then the money would be impermissible and Mr Banks would be in trouble. Mr Banks says he is a British taxpayer and the money was generated in Britain. For more than a year, accountant and investigative journalist Iain Campbell has been looking into Mr Banks's financial empire, all of which is private and some is held offshore in Gibraltar and the Isle of Man. Mr Campbell noted that Rock Services has successfully qualified for a limited disclosure exemption under the Companies Act, allowing it to provide less information in its accounts. But in order to gain this exemption, it had stated in its notes that the accounts of its parent company, Rock Holdings, were ""publicly available"" at Catbrain Lane. So last month, Mr Campbell tested this out in person. He went to the Catbrain Lane base, only to be told that they were not available ""that day"". Since then, lawyers for Rock Services, Browne Jacobson, have written to the accountant setting out a series of restrictions on how, when and where the ""publicly available"" accounts could be viewed and how their contents could be recorded. Mr Campbell told Newsnight: ""This is completely unacceptable."" Newsnight made its own trip to Catbrain Lane this week but when reporter John Sweeney requested an opportunity to inspect the ""publicly available"" accounts of Rock Holdings, he was asked to leave and escorted out of reception. Newsnight's John Sweeney went to Catbrain Lane to inspect the ""publicly available"" accounts, but was asked to leave. Browne Jacobson later emailed the BBC with an explanation - referring to a ""risk assessment"" by Mr Banks's company on ""safety and security""  - which, in effect, denied the BBC sight of the accounts at Catbrain Lane. At the time of the referendum, Rock Holdings' address had been registered at Murdoch Chambers, South Quay, Douglas, Isle of Man. Newsnight visited island this week and its first stop was to Murdoch Chambers, which now appears to be an accommodation address, facing a gas showroom overspill car park. The door was locked and no-one answered. The Newsnight team then moved on to 18 Athol Street, also in Douglas. This was the address, albeit ""care of Greystone"", that Rock Holdings filed with the Isle of Man registry in November this year. But when Newsnight dropped by, it was told by Greystone that Rock Holdings ""was neither approved nor agreed by or known to any director or officer of the company or ourselves"". This means that the company that the Electoral Commission suspects may be the source of the biggest donation in British political history is a closed book, in a secrecy jurisdiction with no official address and when you try to look at its accounts you cannot. Newsnight has separately investigated Ural Properties. This company name appeared in an internal email chain sent by Mr Banks's team to the BBC, to prove his innocence of the charge that the money might have come from Russia. Mr Banksfaced controversyafter his three meetings with the Russian ambassador became public knowledge and over whether he travelled to Russia in 2016, the year of the referendum. He previously told Newsnight: ""No money came from the men with snow on their boots."" One internal email in the documents sent to the BBC contained the comment: ""Redact the reference for Ural Properties and any references which include sensitive info e.g. the account numbers that the money was sent from."" An online website, Source Material, obtained the accounts of Ural Properties in Gibraltar and passed them on to Newsnight. Two nominee companies have owned Ural Properties and the first is linked to a known associate of Mr Banks, Alan Kentish. Last year Mr Kentish was arrested by the Gibraltar authorities for alleged non-disclosure of information. No charges followed. The company owns two flats in Gunwharf, Portsmouth, overlooking the sea lane into the Royal Navy base. Newsnight asked Mr Banks specific questions about Rock Holdings, the fact that it was in default and its lack of a registered address. Mr Banks was also asked about Ural Properties. He made no substantive reply. However, he did provide the following statement: ""This is the seventh programme designed to smear me and discredit Brexit. I have repeatedly stated that I am a UK taxpayer and the funds were from UK. The NCA have had 'full disclosure' of the relevant bank accounts and an explanation of the where the money came from. We will be doing a victory lap of the TV studios once this matter is resolved and look forward to being interviewed by John 'the Trot' Sweeney or the ever 'professional' Kirsty or Emily.""

"George HW Bush mourned at state funeralHis son George W Bush paid an emotional tribute, describing the former president as ""a noble man"".","This video can not be played Highlights from an emotional state funeral for former President George HW Bush An emotional George W Bush has paid tribute to his father, former President George HW Bush, during a state funeral in Washington. Mr Bush Jr, himself a former president, described him as ""a noble man, the best father"". All surviving US presidents attended the funeral, sharing a pew in the US National Cathedral in Washington DC. Mr Bush senior, who served as the 41st US president between 1989 and 1993, died on Friday at the age of 94. He will be buried in his home state of Texas, alongside his wife Barbara. Four presidents sat (awkwardly) on one pew As it happened: US bids farewell to George HW Bush The funeral in pictures In his eulogy, George W Bush said his father had taught him that ""public service is noble and necessary"". ""He accepted failure is part of living a full life, but taught us never to be defined by failure. He showed us how setbacks can strengthen,"" he added. His voice breaking with emotion at the end of his eulogy, Mr Bush said: ""Through our tears, let us know the blessings of knowing and loving you. A great and noble man, the best father a son or daughter could have."" The Trumps, Obamas, Clintons and Carters all attended The invitation-only funeral at the National Cathedral was attended by President Donald Trump and his predecessors Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. The Prince of Wales, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Jordan's King Abdullah II were among the world figures there to pay their respects. Former leaders, including John Major, who was UK prime minister for most of Mr Bush's term, also attended. A life in pictures Service dog Sully pays touching last tribute Wednesday has been declared a national day of mourning - many government offices and US stock exchanges are closed. Following the funeral service, Mr Bush's flag-draped casket was carried from the cathedral by a military honour guard and was later flown to Texas, arriving in Houston at 23:00 GMT. The casket will lie in public repose at St Martin's Episcopal Church until Thursday morning. There will be a second service before the Bush 4141 - a train which was named in honour of the president - takes his body to its final resting place, next to his wife Barbara at the George HW Bush presidential library. Jim McGrath, who was Mr Bush's spokesman, said the president had once wondered if anyone would attend his funeral. Presidential historian Jon Meachamdescribed Mr Bush Sr as ""America's last great soldier statesman"", recounting how he had served as a US Navy pilot in World War Two and survived after his plane was shot down over the Pacific. ""His life was a perennial effort to prove himself worthy of his salvation on that distant morning,"" he said. What is Bush Senior's legacy? The making of a president Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroneypraised Mr Bush Sr's role in navigating the end of the Cold War. ""When George Bush was president of the United States of America, every single head of government in the world knew that they were dealing with a gentleman, a genuine leader, one who was distinguished, resolute and brave,"" he said. Former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpsonsaid Mr Bush had a simple credo: ""What would we do without family and friends?"" George HW Bush was a decorated fighter pilot in World War Two, a head of the CIA and vice-president to Ronald Reagan before being elected president in 1988. His time in office was dominated by foreign policy - and he was praised for how he navigated the end of the Cold War, and handled the first Gulf War. This video can not be played A look back at the life of George Bush Senior However, he was accused of neglecting domestic affairs and, after reneging on a campaign promise not to increase taxes, lost to Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election. He has been described as a bipartisan figure who tried to make conservatism ""kinder and gentler"". Mr Trump has in the past clashed with the Bush family - and Mr Bush told a historian he voted for Mr Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Mr Bush's former White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, told Reuters: ""It's important for our presidents to pay respect to each other and I'm glad President Trump will be there.""

"Arron Banks firm 'has no address'BBC Newsnight finds that Rock Holdings, which is suspected of funding Leave.EU, is in default.UK","The company which the Electoral Commission suspects may have been behind Britain's biggest political donation has no registered address - meaning it has failed to fulfil a key legal requirement - the BBC has found. Rock Holdings is a firm registered in the Isle of Man and controlled by Leave.EU founder Arron Banks. The Electoral Commission's ongoing investigation of Leave.EU funds was referred to the National Crime Agency. Mr Banks denies any wrongdoing. But BBC Newsnight has found that Rock Holdings has no official registered address on the Isle of Man and that it is therefore ""in default"", meaning it is not compliant with company law on the island. Meanwhile one of Mr Banks's companies has obstructed the BBC's attempt at seeing Rock Holdings' accounts - despite formally agreeing with Companies House that it would ensure the documents would be made publicly available. Brexit campaign and Banks staff 'switched' Banks challenged over Leave.EU funds Leave.EU and Banks firm face Â£135,000 fines Mr Banks is a multimillionaire insurance mogul behind the Go Skippy car insurance brand. He loaned Â£8m to the Leave.EU campaign before the 2016 EU referendum and says the money came from his company, Rock Services, based at his office in Catbrain Lane, Bristol. The Electoral Commission suspectsthe money may have come from another Banks entity, Rock Holdings, based on the Isle of Man. They, along with the National Crime Agency, are examining whether ""impermissible money"" may have been used to help fund the Leave campaign before the 2016 EU referendum. The law on political money is simple. The source should be clear, transparent and British. If the Â£8m came from Rock Holdings, then the money would be impermissible and Mr Banks would be in trouble. Mr Banks says he is a British taxpayer and the money was generated in Britain. For more than a year, accountant and investigative journalist Iain Campbell has been looking into Mr Banks's financial empire, all of which is private and some is held offshore in Gibraltar and the Isle of Man. Mr Campbell noted that Rock Services has successfully qualified for a limited disclosure exemption under the Companies Act, allowing it to provide less information in its accounts. But in order to gain this exemption, it had stated in its notes that the accounts of its parent company, Rock Holdings, were ""publicly available"" at Catbrain Lane. So last month, Mr Campbell tested this out in person. He went to the Catbrain Lane base, only to be told that they were not available ""that day"". Since then, lawyers for Rock Services, Browne Jacobson, have written to the accountant setting out a series of restrictions on how, when and where the ""publicly available"" accounts could be viewed and how their contents could be recorded. Mr Campbell told Newsnight: ""This is completely unacceptable."" Newsnight made its own trip to Catbrain Lane this week but when reporter John Sweeney requested an opportunity to inspect the ""publicly available"" accounts of Rock Holdings, he was asked to leave and escorted out of reception. Newsnight's John Sweeney went to Catbrain Lane to inspect the ""publicly available"" accounts, but was asked to leave. Browne Jacobson later emailed the BBC with an explanation - referring to a ""risk assessment"" by Mr Banks's company on ""safety and security""  - which, in effect, denied the BBC sight of the accounts at Catbrain Lane. At the time of the referendum, Rock Holdings' address had been registered at Murdoch Chambers, South Quay, Douglas, Isle of Man. Newsnight visited island this week and its first stop was to Murdoch Chambers, which now appears to be an accommodation address, facing a gas showroom overspill car park. The door was locked and no-one answered. The Newsnight team then moved on to 18 Athol Street, also in Douglas. This was the address, albeit ""care of Greystone"", that Rock Holdings filed with the Isle of Man registry in November this year. But when Newsnight dropped by, it was told by Greystone that Rock Holdings ""was neither approved nor agreed by or known to any director or officer of the company or ourselves"". This means that the company that the Electoral Commission suspects may be the source of the biggest donation in British political history is a closed book, in a secrecy jurisdiction with no official address and when you try to look at its accounts you cannot. Newsnight has separately investigated Ural Properties. This company name appeared in an internal email chain sent by Mr Banks's team to the BBC, to prove his innocence of the charge that the money might have come from Russia. Mr Banksfaced controversyafter his three meetings with the Russian ambassador became public knowledge and over whether he travelled to Russia in 2016, the year of the referendum. He previously told Newsnight: ""No money came from the men with snow on their boots."" One internal email in the documents sent to the BBC contained the comment: ""Redact the reference for Ural Properties and any references which include sensitive info e.g. the account numbers that the money was sent from."" An online website, Source Material, obtained the accounts of Ural Properties in Gibraltar and passed them on to Newsnight. Two nominee companies have owned Ural Properties and the first is linked to a known associate of Mr Banks, Alan Kentish. Last year Mr Kentish was arrested by the Gibraltar authorities for alleged non-disclosure of information. No charges followed. The company owns two flats in Gunwharf, Portsmouth, overlooking the sea lane into the Royal Navy base. Newsnight asked Mr Banks specific questions about Rock Holdings, the fact that it was in default and its lack of a registered address. Mr Banks was also asked about Ural Properties. He made no substantive reply. However, he did provide the following statement: ""This is the seventh programme designed to smear me and discredit Brexit. I have repeatedly stated that I am a UK taxpayer and the funds were from UK. The NCA have had 'full disclosure' of the relevant bank accounts and an explanation of the where the money came from. We will be doing a victory lap of the TV studios once this matter is resolved and look forward to being interviewed by John 'the Trot' Sweeney or the ever 'professional' Kirsty or Emily.""

DNA project leading to faster disease diagnosis,"Hana's daughter was diagnosed with a treatable metabolic disorder caused by an inherited genetic error Scientists in Cambridge have completed the world's largest gene sequencing project in healthcare - which brings hope of better understanding of diseases and faster diagnosis.Â People with rare diseases, their family members and cancer patients took part. Genomics England,externaldescribed the project as ""transformational in what it means to society and humanity"". One in four participants with rare diseases received a diagnosis for the first time. Until now, parents of children with rare genetic conditions typically spent years trying to find out the cause. The 100,000 Genomes Project has ended this ""diagnostic odyssey"" for many families, and in some cases, led to effective treatments. Hana Young's daughter Tilly, aged six, who has a disorder which causes delayed development and seizures, had her genome sequenced, along with both her parents.Â In January 2018 she was diagnosed with GAMT deficiency, a treatable metabolic disorder, which is caused by an inherited genetic error.Â Hana, from Gosport in Hampshire, told the BBC: ""She used to be in and out of hospital and was often very aggressive towards her younger brother Arlo and others. ""She lost the ability to walk and was having hundreds of seizures a day."" Since Tilly has been on treatment, Hana says the ""difference is amazing"". Cancer and rare diseases are both strongly linked to changes in DNA ""She is communicating, full of life, her epilepsy is gone and she is no longer violent,"" her mum says.Â ""Tilly is still severely mentally disabled but she is so much better than she would have been without the diagnosis."" Had Tilly's illness been identified earlier, some long-term damage could have been prevented. NHS future: Why genome mapping could be good news Handheld device sequences human genome 100,000 Genomes project 'making huge difference' In all, about 85,000 people had their entire genetic code, or genome, sequenced, but because cancer patients also had their tumour DNA mapped, the number of genomes totalled 100,000. The human genome is made up of billions of pieces of DNA, found in nearly every cell in the body.  It is the instruction manual for life and errors can trigger a vast range of disorders. Cancer and rare diseases were chosen for the project because both are strongly linked to changes in DNA.Â Cancer is triggered by mutations in genes, while the majority of rare diseases are also caused by errors in our genome. Karen Carter, 46, is among 15,000 cancer patients who had the DNA of their cancer tumour sequenced, as well as the genome they inherited from their parents. She has had breast cancer and melanoma, but scans suggest she is clear of the disease. There are plans to sequence one million genomes in the UK in the next five years Karen, a pharmacist from Reading,Â told the BBC:Â  ""My brother and grandmother and two cousins were all diagnosed with cancers at an early age and I would like to find out if there is something in our family that causes us to get cancer - and that knowledge might help us to mitigate the risks for others."" About half of cancer patients sequenced as part of the project were then able to take part in a clinical trial or receive a targeted treatment. All the genome sequencing has been carried out at theWellcome Sanger Institute,external, near Cambridge, in laboratories run byIllumina,external, a Californian biotechnology company. The work has been overseen by Genomics England, which was set up in 2013 specifically to deliver the 100,000 Genomes Project. Although the sequencing has been completed, the analysis of the genomes - by researchers across the UK - is continuing and some participants are still awaiting results. There are now ambitious plans to sequence one million genomes in the UK in the next five years, as genetic testing becomes more embedded in NHS care. Prof Mark Caulfield, chief scientist at Genomics England said: ""The sequencing of 100,000 whole genomes marks an extraordinary UK achievement that is transforming the application of genomics in our NHS."" The hope is that it will lead to more rapid diagnosis, improved prevention of illness and more targeted medicines. Sir John Chisholm, chair of Genomics England, said:Â ""Your health record will eventually have a genomic backbone to it; that will enable what is happening to you to be compared with what your genome is telling your doctor, and therefore a more accurate diagnosis or treatment will be available."" When the first human genome was fully sequenced in 2003, it had taken 13 years and cost Â£2bn. Today, a genome's worth of DNA can be sequenced in only 30 minutes, at a cost of Â£600. The success of the 100,000 Genomes Project underlines the UK's position as a world leader in this field. Prof Dame Sue Hill, Chief Scientific Officer for England said: ""The results show how genomic medicine can transform lives,  and the opportunity now is to turn this research into reality by introducing sequencing technology as part of our world-leading NHS Genomic Medicine Service.""Follow Fergus onTwitter.,external Handheld device sequences human genome Genomes project 'making huge difference' Audio, 00:01:44Genomes project 'making huge difference' The 100,000 Genomes Project - Genomics England Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Girls 'more likely to face loneliness',"The worry about being seen as lonely becomes another pressure in itself Young women are more likely than young men to have feelings of loneliness, according to a study from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). About one in 10 young people in the UK often feel lonely, says the first such analysis from the ONS. The study found a ""stigma"" attached to loneliness, with young people fearing it would be seen as ""failing"". There were young people who used social media to ""cover up"" their feelings and pretend their lives were not lonely. Thestudy from the ONS looks at the extent of loneliness,externalamong people aged between 10 and 24. There were about 11% who often felt lonely and a further 34% who sometimes felt lonely - with more girls than boys feeling this way. The research looked at factors that seemed to make loneliness more likely - and found it was particularly associated with times of transition in young lives. The move from primary school to secondary school and from school to university were both likely to be associated with loneliness. Loneliness strategy to remove social stigma I'm surrounded by people but feel so lonely Loneliness more likely to affect young people Loneliness - the last taboo Young people in cities were more likely to be lonely than those in rural areas or smaller towns. Poorer youngsters, such as those eligible for free school meals, had higher rates of loneliness. Loneliness could also be associated with specific problems - such as illness, family tensions, bereavement or bullying. The fear of being seen as lonely was another problem in itself. There was an embarrassment about being seen as lonely, with a worry that it would label people as being socially unattractive or unpopular. Social media could be used to keep in touch with friends, but it could also be used by people wanting to pretend they were not lonely. Young people interviewed for the study said social media could make them feel excluded or leave them with only ""shallow"" exchanges instead of genuine friendship. The study from the ONS follows growing concern about the impact of loneliness. The governmentlaunched its first loneliness strategythis autumn, in response to worries about an ""epidemic of loneliness"". Dawn Snape, of the ONS, says the study will provide more information about how loneliness might affect people's health and wellbeing. ""We've looked at how often children and young people feel lonely and why. An important factor is going through transitional life stages such as the move from primary to secondary school and, later, leaving school or higher education and adapting to early adult life.""

Brother of arson death boy was 'at risk',"Joel dreamed of becoming a firefighter, his family said The brother of a seven-year-old boy who was killed in an arson attack was known to be at risk a month before his sibling's death, the BBC understands. Joel Urhie's body was foundin the bedroom he shared with his mother at the house in Adolphus Street, Deptford, south-east London, on 7 August. Sam Uhrie, 21, was stabbed in a fight outside the property on 11 June. The Met Police shared this information with social services at Lewisham Council before the fire. Joel's murder investigation is ongoing amid reports that his brother might have been the target and the arson attack was gang-related. Concerns have been raised over whether enough was done to safeguard the family. The family's home could have been fitted with a panic alarm and a fire-proof letterbox if the family were at risk, sources told the theLocal Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) The ground floor, first floor and stairs were badly damaged in the blaze Despite the family being known to social services, a council spokesperson confirmed there would not be a serious case review of the incident. Local authorities carry out such reviews when a child is killed or seriously injured and there are safeguarding concerns. A Lewisham Council spokesperson said: ""The death of an innocent child in his own home was an absolute tragedy that shook the local community and everyone concerned. ""The council is currently in contact with the Uhrie family and we are providing the support we can. ""Due to the ongoing police investigation, it is not possible to comment further."" On 11 August two men, aged 21 and 29, were arrested in south London on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and arson with intent to endanger life. They were released under investigation. The Met Police has been contacted for comment.

CO2 emissions reach 'all-time high',"The main factor in the rise is coal use in China A booming global market for cars has helped drive CO2 emissions to an all-time high in  2018, say researchers. The main factor in the near 3% rise has been coal use in China, driven by government efforts to boost a flagging economy. But emissions from cars, truck and planes using fossil fuels continue to rise in all parts of the world Renewables have also grown this year, but are not keeping pace with the CO2 rise. Theresearch,external, carried out by the Global Carbon Project (GCP), says that this year's ""strong"" rise is projected to be 2.7%. That's much bigger than 2017's 1.6%. This will worry scientists as they had seen CO2 emissions relatively flat for the three years before. Climate change 'greatest threat', UN told 'Trump effect' limits action on climate Australia teens defy PM in climate walkout While coal use remains below the historically high level of 2013, it has grown again this year. China, the world's largest emitter saw emissions rise an estimated 4.7%. At UN climate talks in Katowice, the lead researcher Prof Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ©, from the University of East Anglia, told BBC News that the rise in China was down to government activity. ""For the past two years, the Chinese government has boosted the economy and the economy is based on construction and heavy industry, coal and steel. When you boost the economy you actually see a rise in emissions,"" she said. Other factors include a rise in the US after several years of decline, which the researchers say is due to a very cold winter and a hot summer driving up demand for energy. 2018's top ten has China on top, followed by the US and the EU as a whole region. After these three come India, Russia, Japan, Germany, Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea and Canada. A booming economy has seen India's emissions grow by 6.3%. Renewables are growing fast but from a low base. The five countries contributing most to growth in global emissions outside of China, the US, the EU and India over the last decade are Saudi Arabia, Iran, Turkey, Iraq and South Korea. Climate change: Where we are in seven charts One common factor across rich and poor countries alike has been the continued rise in the consumption of oil in the transport sector. In the EU, the amount of fuel used for flights and road transport has surged by 4%. In US, use of coal actually fell while fossil fuels used in car journeys rose by 1.4%. ""Apart from the coal story, the emissions from oil use in cars and lorries and trucks and aviation have not been abated at all,"" said Prof Le QuÃ©rÃ©. ""They just keep rising and rising and that's associated with an increase in cars everywhere around the world."" According to the experts, people are driving bigger petrol and diesel cars, travelling further than before, in more countries. Electric car use is growing, but many think the transition is not happening fast enough It's not good news, says the scientists, who argue that global emissions have to start to fall by 2020 if the world is to meet the temperature goals of the Paris agreement. People are simply not keeping the promises they made three years ago when the Paris climate agreement was signed. ""Global commitments made in Paris in 2015 to reduce emissions are not yet being matched by proportionate actions,"" said Dr Glen Peters, a Research Director at the CICERO Centre for International Climate Research in Oslo, Norway, who led the emissions analysis. ""The rise in emissions in 2017 could be seen as a one-off, but the growth rate in 2018 is even higher, and it is becoming crystal clear the world is so far failing in its duty to steer onto a course consistent with the goals set out in the Paris Agreement in 2015."" It is being seen here as another warning shot from the real world that negotiators really need to make progress. ""All the warm words spoken at the UN climate summit in Poland won't help prevent climate change,"" said Mohammed Adow, who's at the conference for Christian Aid. ""The climate does not respond to lofty rhetoric, it responds to carbon dioxide emission reductions. ""If this is the most important issue of our time, as leaders repeatedly say, then why aren't they acting accordingly - and showing up for the climate talks?"" Despite the gloomy picture on cars in 2018, the future is not so solid for the internal combustion engine. While they were rare 10 years ago, there are now three million plug-in cars in use globally. Norway will stop selling cars that are not electric in 2025. The UK, France, the Netherlands and India say they will stop before 2040. Car manufacturers are responding to the fork in the road. Volkswagen says it will launch its last generation of petrol and diesel cars by 2026. The move has been welcomed but many think it is not fast enough. ""We simply cannot wait nearly a quarter of a century to phase out the cars warming our climate and making our air toxic,"" said Rosie Rogers from Greenpeace. ""People living in polluted cities and facing climate change-related disasters deserve better than that."" The overall growth in green energy has not been enough to keep pace with the rise in emissions - but that bald headline masks some significant progress, say experts. The costs of renewables continue to plummet. Morocco, Mexico, Chile and Egypt are now producing solar energy for three US cents or less per kilowatt hour. That's cheaper than natural gas. More than 50% of new electricity generating capacity being installed right now is green. Wind and solar are doubling every four years. Coal is going backwards in most of the developed world. While the US may not be staying in the Paris agreement, most US citizens live in a jurisdiction that still supports the Paris goals. Around the world, some 9,000 cities and municipalities representing some 16% of the world's population are committed to Paris. Over the past decade, 19 countries including the UK, Ireland, France and the US have all cut emissions while growing their economies. ""Before 2015, many people thought the Paris Agreement was impossible, yet thousands of people and institutions made the shift from impossible to unstoppable,"" wrote former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres, in acommentary,externalon the research. ""The same is true of decarbonising the economy. Propelled by the pursuit of clean air, jobs and energy-independence among other benefits, the intrepid, collective efforts of young people, civil society, businesses, investors, cities and states are charting the course to net zero emissions by 2050."" Follow Matton Twitter.,external The summit comes three years after the 2015 Paris accord on climate change, at which all countries agreed a plan to limit carbon emissions. Now is the moment governments must start deciding what to do to make sure that plan is put into effect. In graphics:Seven charts that show the rate of warming Advice:What can I do to help?

Fox: MPs may 'steal Brexit',"This video can not be played Liam Fox warns MPs 'may try to steal Brexit' There is a risk MPs could ""steal Brexit from the British people"" if Theresa May's proposed deal is rejected, a senior cabinet minister has warned. Liam Fox said there was ""natural Remain majority"" in Parliament and any attempt to overturn the 2016 referendum vote would be a ""democratic affront"". It came after MPs voted to exert more influence should the PM's deal fall. Ministers will again battle to win over MPs to Theresa May's withdrawal deal after three government defeats. Security will be the focus of the second of five days of debate in the Commons, where Tuesday's marathon session extended into the early hours. Ahead of Prime Minister's Questions at noon, the governmentpublished its Brexit legal advice,external- a move which came after MPs voted to find the government in contempt of Parliament for ignoring a Commons vote demanding publication. Parliament Live: Rolling updates Could Brexit defeats peel off some rebels? What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? BBC drops plans for Brexit TV debate Law officer says UK can cancel Brexit The PM's deal has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by the UK Parliament if it is to come into force. MPs will decide whether to reject or accept it next Tuesday, 11 December. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March, 2019. Ministers say that if MPs reject their deal they increase the chances of the UK leaving without a deal, or not leaving the EU at all. Ministers will plough on with attempts to win over MPs on Wednesday, with eight hours of debate on the security and immigration aspects of the withdrawal agreement. Meanwhile, Mrs May is expected to continue trying to convince small groups of her MPs to back the plan in private meetings. This video can not be played The moment the government lost a key vote - and was told to disclose its legal advice on Brexit Mrs May will face Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at prime minister's questions, at noon, before the Brexit debate gets under way. Senior Brexiteers in the cabinet have warned that the UK may not leave the EU if Mrs May's deal is voted down. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox suggested the PM's deal was the only way of guaranteeing the UK leaves the EU, as scheduled, on 29 March 2019. ""When you are in prison and someone offers you a key, you take it,"" he told a committee of MPs. While a no-deal exit would be ""disorderly"", he suggested the UK being kept in the EU against the will of the British people would be even more damaging. ""I think that there is a real danger that the House of Commons which has a natural remain majority may attempt to steal Brexit from British people which would be a democratic affront."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the deal on the table was in the best interests of the country. ""Everyone has to think at this momentous moment - do we want to ensure that Brexit gets over the line? Do we want to deliver on the verdict of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the European Union because if we don't back the prime minister, we risk there being no Brexit and that I think would be a fatal blow to faith in democracy."" But a former Conservative chief whip has said he expects the PM to lose the vote. Mark Harper, who backed Remain in the referendumtold the Daily Telegraph he would vote against the withdrawal agreement,external, and predicted the deal would be rejected by 80 of his party colleagues. He urged the prime minister to renegotiate the deal, insisting the current plan would leave the UK worse off. First, the government lost a bid to have the legal advice issue dealt with separately by the Privileges Committee of MPs. In a second defeat, ministers were found in contempt of parliament and forced to concede they would have to publish that advice in full, having previously argued this would break convention and was not in the national interest. This video can not be played BBC political correspondent Leila Nathoo explains how things unfolded Most significantly, the third defeat was over changes to the parliamentary process in the event that the Commons votes down Mrs May's deal. Instead of being confined to merely ""taking note"" of what the government tells them, MPs would also be able to exert more influence by voting on what they want the government to do next. This could potentially see Parliament wrest control of the Brexit process from ministers if, as expected, MPs push for a ""Plan B"" alternative to Mrs May's deal and seek to prevent any chance of Britain leaving the EU without a deal in place. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who brought the motion, told Channel 4 News it would ""allow the UK time to consider its options"", including re-starting negotiations with the EU or giving the public the final say. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""The Commons is now very likely to defeat the government again next week on the Brexit deal, at which point the country must be given a 'People's Vote', and asked to choose between the deal or remaining in the EU."" By BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg Former Remain rebels now have a possible route to get what they want if the PM's plan is rejected, as there is a possible - I emphasise the possible - way to get a vote with a majority for a Norway-style agreement or, less likely, a push for another referendum. That won't go unnoticed by Brexiteers too, who may feel (some of them at least) that Mrs May's deal might be their best bet in that case, rather than risk that softer, squidgier Brexit. It's possible therefore that Tuesday's shenanigans have made it less likely that the prime minister will face a terrible defeat next week because a few wobbly rebels on both sides might come in line. Read more from Laura This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Worth taking a moment to reflect on how we got here."" When she finally kicked off the debate about the deal itself, Mrs May insisted the UK would enjoy a ""better future"" outside the EU. She said the ""honourable compromise"" on offer was ""not the one-way street"" many had portrayed it to be and that the EU had made it clear that the agreement would not be improved on. ""I never said this deal was perfect, it was never going to be. That is the nature of a negotiation,"" she said. ""We should not let the search for a perfect Brexit prevent a good Brexit."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was a bad deal for the UK and that his party would seek a vote of no confidence in the government if it was thrown out by MPs. ""I hope and expect this House will reject that deal,"" he said. ""At that point, the government has lost the confidence of the House. Either they have to get a better deal from the EU or give way to those who will."" This video can not be played Not everyone agreed with Boris Johnson's analysis of the Brexit deal... Nigel Dodds, leader of the DUP in Westminster, said the agreement ""falls short"" of delivering Brexit ""as one United Kingdom"" and would mean entering ""a twilight world where the EU is given unprecedented powers over the UK"". Ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson dismissed the deal as a ""paint and plaster pseudo-Brexit"" and said its supporters would be ""turning their backs"" on the 17.4 million Leave voters. The leader of the SNP at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said the ""cold, hard truth"" was that the deal represented ""a moment of self-harm in our history"". ""It is not too late to turn back,"" he said. ""Fundamentally, there is no option that is going to be better for our economy, jobs, and for our communities than staying in the European Union."" However, in closing the debate shortly after 01:00 GMT on Wednesday, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay argued the deal would bring ""real changes which will improve the livelihoods of people up and down the country"".

DUP 'would back Tories in confidence vote',"The Democratic Unionists will back Theresa May's government in any vote of no confidence should her Brexit deal be rejected, its Westminster leader says. Nigel Dodds told ITV his party would vote against the deal, but it would be ""illogical"" to vote out the government. Labour has said it will immediately press for a confidence vote if the deal is voted down next Tuesday. If successful, the move could trigger a general election if no alternative government is formed in 14 days. At a meeting of Tory backbenchers on Wednesday evening, Conservative Chief Whip Julian Smith appealed for civility in internal party arguments over Brexit. Government sources said the whip's office was ""looking at all options"" to secure the support of the Commons. The vote on the withdrawal deal and the declaration on future relations will take place on 11 December. Live: MPs debate Brexit deal Brexit advice warns of border 'stalemate' Mr Dodds told ITV's Robert Peston: ""Clearly if [the deal] is defeated, it would be somewhat illogical - having achieved our aim trying to get to a better deal - it would be illogical then to turn around the next day and say 'let's vote the government out'. ""I think then we start on a process to try to get a better deal."" Following a meeting of Conservative members of the pro-Brexit European Research Group in Westminster - attended by leading DUP figures - its chair Jacob Rees-Mogg said there was a risk of the DUP withholding its support for the government if Parliament approved the PM's deal on the terms of leaving the EU. The DUP currently has a parliamentary pact with the Conservatives, known as a confidence and supply agreement, in which it effectively props up Mrs May's government by supporting it in key votes. But Mr Dodds reiterated that the deal ""is with the Conservative Party, not with Theresa May or any particular politician"". The party's 10 MPs are expected to vote against the withdrawal deal amid anger over a proposed customs arrangement between the UK and the EU. They say it will see Northern Ireland separated economically and politically from England, Scotland and Wales. Speaking earlier during a debate on the Brexit deal in the Commons, DUP MP Sammy Wilson said Mrs May had ""broken promises"" made to her party to protect the constitutional integrity of the UK and if the deal went through it would create ""further tensions"". Mrs May is struggling to muster sufficient support to get her deal through, with Labour, the Lib Dems and the SNP all opposed and scores of Tory MPs saying they cannot support it. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the tally of potential Tory rebels was rising and backbenchers who have held private meetings with the prime minister were not emerging convinced.

Syrian boy funds 'spent on relocation',"The video was filmed in a lunch break at Almondbury Community School on 25 October Money raised for a Syrian boy who was filmed being attacked at a school will be spent on relocating his family, a solicitor said. The online appeal raised more than Â£158,000 for the 15-year-old refugee who was dragged to the ground at Almondbury School in Huddersfield. Tasnime Akunjee, his family's lawyer, said they would stay in West Yorkshire. Remaining funds will be given to charity or used to set up a foundation to help other refugees, he added. GoFundMe said the appeal was one of its most widely shared and fastest growing of 2018, with donations made from 50 countries. Organiser Mohammed Tahir thanked everyone for their contributions and said it represented a ""life-changing"" amount for the family. Sajid Javid: I was bullied for being Asian Syrian refugee's sister 'also attacked' More stories from around Yorkshire Mr Tahir said: ""The donations have slowed down and I feel we are in a position where we can close the campaign. ""The donations have now been turned off and I personally would like to thank everyone who supported the cause."" Footage of the boy being pushed to the ground and having water poured in his face at the school on 25 October was shared widely on social media last week. A 16-year-old boy has been interviewed by police and reported for summons for an offence of assault ahead of a youth court appearance.

Facebook chief's emails exposed by MPs,"Emails written by Facebook's chief and his deputies show the firm struck secret deals to give some developers special access to user data while refusing others, according to MPs. A cache ofinternal documents has been published online,externalby a parliamentary committee. It said the files also showed Facebook had deliberately made it ""as hard as possible"" for users to be aware of privacy changes to its Android app. Facebook had objected to their release. It said that the documents had been presented in a ""very misleading manner"" and required additional context. The emails were obtained from the chief of Six4Three - a software firm that is suing the tech giant - and were disclosed by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee as part of its inquiry into fake news. About 250 pages have been published, some of which are marked ""highly confidential"". Damian Collins MP, the chair of the committee, highlighted several ""key issues"" in an introductory note. He wrote that: Facebook allowed some companies to maintain ""full access"" to users' friends data even after announcing changes to its platform in 2014/2015 to limit what developers' could see. ""It is not clear that there was any user consent for this, nor how Facebook decided which companies should be whitelisted,"" Mr Collins wrote Facebook had been aware that an update to its Android app that let it collect records of users' calls and texts would be controversial. ""To mitigate any bad PR, Facebook planned to make it as hard as possible for users to know that this was one of the underlying features,"" Mr Collins wrote Facebook used data provided by the Israeli analytics firm Onavo to determine which other mobile apps were being downloaded and used by the public. It then used this knowledge to decide which apps to acquire or otherwise treat as a threat there was evidence that Facebook's refusal to share data with some apps caused them to fail there had been much discussion of the financial value of providing access to friends' data Allow Twitter content?

Facebook documents seized by MPs Facebook reveals its data-sharing VIPs All our stories about the Cambridge Analytica data scandal ""We stand by the platform changes we made in 2015 to stop a person from sharing their friends' data with developers,"" said a spokeswoman. ""Like any business, we had many internal conversations about the various ways we could build a sustainable business model for our platform. ""But the facts are clear: we've never sold people's data."" Mr Zuckerberg has alsoposted a personal response on his Facebook page,external. ""I understand there is a lot of scrutiny on how we run our systems. That's healthy given the vast number of people who use our services around the world, and it is right that we are constantly asked to explain what we do,"" he said. ""But it's also important that the coverage of what we do - including the explanation of these internal documents - doesn't misrepresent our actions or motives."" The correspondence includes emails between Facebook and several other tech firms, in which the social network appears to agree to add third-party apps to a ""whitelist"" of those given permission to access data about users' friends. This might be used, for example, to allow an app's users to continue seeing which of their Facebook friends were using the same service. Netflix tapped into Facebook friends lists to let users see what titles their contacts had watched and rated highly They include: the dating service Badoo, its spin-off Hot or Not, and Bumble - another dating app that it had invested in the car pick-up service Lyft the video-streaming service Netflix the home rental service Airbnb However, others including the ticket sales service Ticketmaster, Twitter's short-video platform Vine and the connected-cars specialist Airbiquity seem to have been denied the privilege. Among the emails that have been published are the following extracts: The following concerns a decision to prevent Twitter's short-form video service having access to users' friends lists. It is dated 24 January 2012. Justin Osofsky(Facebook vice president): ""Twitter launched Vine today which lets you shoot multiple short video segments to make one single, 6-second video... Unless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today. We've prepared reactive PR, and I will let Jana know our decision."" Mark Zuckerberg(Facebook chief executive): ""Yup, go for it."" The following is part of a discussion about giving Facebook's Android app permission to read users' call logs. It is dated 4 February 2015. Michael LeBeau(Facebook product manager): ""As you know all the growth team is planning on shipping a permissions update on Android at the end of this month. They are going to include the 'read call log' permission... This is a pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it...[The danger is] screenshot of the scary Android permissions screen becomes a meme (as it has in the past), propagates around the web, it gets press attention, and enterprising journalists dig into what exactly the new update is requesting, then write stories about ""Facebook uses new Android update to pry into your private life in ever more terrifying ways"". The following is from a discussion in which Mark Zuckerberg mulled the idea of selling developers access to users' friends' data. It is dated October 2012, pre-dating the quiz involved in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It was sent to Sam Mullin, who was vice president of product management. Mark Zuckerberg(Facebook chief executive): ""It's not at all clear to me here that we have a model that will actually make us the revenue we want at scale. I'm getting more on board with locking down some parts of platform, including friends' data and potentially email addresses for mobile apps. I'm generally sceptical that there is as much data leak strategic risk as you think... I think we leak info to developers but I just can't think of any instances where that data has leaked from developer to developer and caused a real issue for us."" The following is from an email sent by Mark Zuckerberg to several of his executives in which he explains why he does not think making users pay for Facebook would be a good idea. It is dated 19 November 2012. Mark Zuckerberg(Facebook chief executive): ""The question is whether we could charge and still achieve ubiquity. Theoretically, if we could do that, it would be better to get ubiquity and get paid. My sense is there may be some price we could charge that wouldn't interfere with ubiquity, but this price wouldn't be enough to make us real money. Conversely, we could probably make real money of we were willing to sacrifice ubiquity, but that doesn't seem like the right trade here.""

"Kuenssberg: New enemies, not fans","Theresa May is holding meetings with MPs to try to win their backing over her deal This is not - I repeat NOT - a re-run of the referendum. Theresa May will never convince purists on either side of the Brexit debate that they are wrong to believe it's right to leave, or heresy to argue to stay. What she needs to do is get enough of her colleagues to accept they can't have everything they desire, but that there is enough in her compromise to say yes to an arrangement that fulfils the Tories' political promises. So far, however, her arguments don't seem to be holding much sway. The tally of Tory MPs who've declared they're willing to vote against is rising - irrespective of whether the public detests or ignores the circus. Brexit advice warns of border 'stalemate' No deal 'would risk public's protection' Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict With less than a week to go, despite the prime minister's private meetings with dozens of backbenchers, they are not emerging convinced. If anything, her compromise seems to be making new enemies, not finding new fans. And fresh from a trio of defeats, Mrs May seems to be arguing the case with diminishing authority. A tentative hunt for changes that could peel rebels away seems fruitless so far. Just when the prime minister needs goodwill, respect and trust, it is in very short supply.

HS2 and Crossrail chairman resigns,"Sir Terry Morgan in September 2017, when Crossrail's Elizabeth line track was completed The chairman of the Crossrail and HS2 rail programmes, two of Britain's biggest infrastructure projects, has resigned from both roles. Sir Terry Morgan, 70, has been involved in London's Crossrail project for the past decade and took up the HS2 role just four months ago. He told the BBC this week there was disappointment at Westminster about the delays affecting Crossrail. The Elizabeth Line had been due to open in December 2018. However, it has beendelayed until autumn 2019to allow more time for testing. Sir Terry said on Saturday that heexpected to be told to go. ""My expectation is that I will be asked to resign, and in the interests of both great programmes, that is what I will do,"" he told the BBC on Monday. He said the Crossrail programme had been put back partly because of delays in ordering the trains, which was ultimately the responsibility of the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. Mr Khan said: ""Not only was I angry when Crossrail informed us that the project would be delayed, but historically there has been a lack of adequate information shared by the senior Crossrail leadership with the project's joint sponsors - namely, the Department for Transport and Transport for London."" The project's budget was increased from Â£14.8bn to Â£15.4bn in July due to ""cost pressures"", and in October the Mayor of London was offered Â£350m of additional government funding. Allan Cook has been appointed as the new chair of HS2, and a Crossrail successor will be announced, the Department for Transport said. What do we know about HS2? Spending watchdog to probe Crossrail delay Crossrail running Â£600m over budget HS2, the government's planned Â£55bn high-speed rail network, promises to cut journey times from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds when up and running. But there has been criticism of the project in terms of how much it is expected to cost, and its impact on the environment. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""Sir Terry has been an integral part of Crossrail for almost a decade and I would like to thank him for his dedication and the expertise he brought to the role. I am also grateful to him for his work as chair of HS2.""

"Sex attack gang not rapists, say judges","The ""wolf pack"" case has sparked protests across Spain and led to an expert panel to review the law on rape A Spanish court's controversial decision to clear five men of gang rape has been upheld by five appeal judges, and the group are now set to go to jail for a lesser offence of sexual abuse. There were protests across Spain when the men, who became known asLa manada(the wolf pack), were acquitted of rape and then later freed on bail. The appeal judges agreed that the 18-year-old victim was not assaulted as no intimidation or violence was involved. The case now goes to the Supreme Court. ""We don't like it,"" the teenager's lawyer said, after the five judges in the northern Navarre region upheld the nine-year jail terms for abuse. Under current Spanish law, an offence of rape has to involve sexual assault, which includes violence or intimidation. Significantly, two of the five judges said that the attackers had used intimidation to carry out a ""continuous offence of sexual assault"" and called for 14-year jail terms. But they were outvoted by the other three judges. The case sparked such a wave of revulsion that a committee of experts was formed to reform Spain's penal code on sexual violence. Among those outraged by the verdict was Pedro SÃ¡nchez, who has since become prime minister and has promised to introduce a new law on sexual consent. Spanish court releases 'wolf pack' Spain to remove ambiguities on rape - PM Outcry as Spanish court says rape not violent During the San FermÃ­n bull-running festival in July 2016, in the crowded streets of Pamplona, the 18 year old was led to a basement where five men in their late 20s surrounded her and had unprotected sex. Some of the men filmed the attack on their phones and sent it around their WhatsApp chat group entitled ""La manada"". A police report said the victim maintained a ""passive or neutral"" attitude throughout the scene, keeping her eyes closed at all times. By James Badcock, Madrid The appeal court accepts as proven that the ""wolf pack"" victim did not give consent to sex and that the five men took advantage of circumstances and their own position of superiority to carry out the crime of sexual abuse. But, crucially, the ruling states that abuse of a situation of manifest superiority does not itself constitute intimidation, nor was any act of violence committed. A picture of the five men in Pamplona was shown during the trial The ruling describes the victim's role as one of ""passive suffering"" but finds no firm evidence of acts or threats designed to intimidate her. In their words: ""The key is the actual nature of the intimidatory act carried out by the active party, rather than the reaction of the victim to it."" Essentially, the judges are saying that the men cannot be blamed for her reaction to the situation, even though they were happy to take advantage of the teenager's weak position. Supporters of reform will say the ruling shows why a consent-based rape law is required. Bathers confront 'wolf pack' sex attackers Viewpoint: Spain rape case highlights enduring machismo Pamplona Mayor Joseba Asiron was among several figures to say that an appeal would be lodged against the latest ruling. ""There appears to be a very clear gap between society and certain sections of the judiciary,"" he complained, insisting that all of Pamplona supported the woman. A lawyer acting for four of the convicted men said he too would appeal to the Supreme Court, arguing that what took place was ""consensual sex between six adults"". The men visited a court in Seville on Wednesday as part of their bail conditions. But Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said the verdict enhanced the victim's credibility and she drew attention to the two appeal judges who considered that the attack constituted rape rather than abuse. ""It's foreseeable that the five convicted men will go to jail immediately,"" she said. Protest rallies against the appeal decision were being organised on Wednesday evening in Seville, Madrid and other cities.

Rubie Marie, 35, who was forced to marry in Bangladesh when she was 15, said: ""It is hard because you love your family of course you do... But at the end of the day abuse is abuse."" The Home Office said it was essential victims had confidence to speak out. Forced marriage became a criminal offence in 2014, butonly one case has been brought in Walessince then - with four convictions in total across the UK. However, the Welsh Government estimates there are up to 100 cases of forced marriage every year. Rubie Marie was raped almost daily by her husband in Bangladesh after being forced to marry him at the age of 15 In 2018, the forced marriage unit - a joint effort between the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Home Office -gave advice or support in 1,196 UK cases,external. Shahien Taj of the Cardiff-based Henna Foundation told BBC Wales Live more prevention work was needed to educate perpetrators, who are often the victims' parents. The charity said victims often wanted to return to the family home once the situation was resolved. ""I don't know a single victim that I've worked with that has said she's ok with the police coming down on parents like a tonne of bricks - all too often they don't want any intervention because of that,"" said Ms Taj. Ms Marie, who now lives in the Midlands, said once she was married, she was raped ""more or less, every single day"" so her new husband could have a child and a ticket to live in the UK. Why are there so few forced marriage prosecutions? Using spoons to stop forced marriage 'I want to explain arranged marriage to Westerners' Rubie Marie was forced to marry a man twice her age after being taken to Bangladesh The Home Office is consulting on proposals that would legally require those who work closely with young people, such as teachers and social workers, to report suspected cases of forced marriage. Ms Taj believesforced marriage protection orders,externalare the preferred route - allowing young people to apply to the courts for protection, while keeping the family out of the criminal system. ""We've had eight cases where young women have gone home and been able to move on with their lives,"" she said. Samsunear Ali from the charity Bawso said education was key as many parents did not even realise they were breaking the law. ""For them they are doing the right thing and that's the only way they know how to reduce the level of shame in the family that this child could potentially bring. ""It's a huge problem in Wales, and it's still not being talked about as much."" She said there were cases in rural Wales where women had no support and they were at greater risk, with forced marriages potentially ""going on for generations and nobody knows about it"". Rubie Marie - pictured here aged five - was told her trip to Bangladesh was a holiday Rubie Marie was born and raised in south Wales. She had a happy childhood but everything changed once she hit puberty. She was taken to Bangladesh in 1998 at the age of 15 under the pretence of it being a holiday. ""We were only supposed to go for six weeks but then it went to two months, then it went to three months, then it got to six months and we all got homesick,"" she said. ""I asked my father, I said we want to go home. I want to go back to school. I want my friends. But he would say things like 'we spent so much money coming here'â¦ That was his excuse, his cover up, his facade to plan what he was planning which was the marriage. ""I was sitting down having dinner with the whole family and he just came in and he sat down and he started to eat and out of the blue, and I remember it like it was yesterday, ""'Wouldn't it be great if we got Rubie married?' And I was mortified. I was a kid and I had a tantrum. I threw my plate on the floor. I started kicking off, banging the doors, ran into my room screaming, shouting. I just didn't know how to comprehend that information. ""I was put on a bidding system. One of my uncles went and started bidding me. It was horrible. I was treated like a slave. ""I was in this alien country - I didn't know where to go, where to turn to, didn't know where there was a phone. Nothing."" Ms Marie was forced to marry a man twice her age and for her engagement she was ""dressed up like a doll"". ""The house was full of laughing people, you know there was people everywhere trying to come into my room to see me, to have a peek at this new bride,"" she said. ""And I was just sitting there just thinking 'I'm just an object'. You just got to do what you've got to do and that's it. My vision was just get home, do whatever you need to do to get home."" Once she was married, her new husband wanted a child. ""More or less, I'd been raped every single day to get pregnant, so then he's got an official British pathway of coming to Britain because he's got a child. That was their plan,"" she added. She got pregnant and came back to Wales to give birth. When the baby was born, she fled: ""That brought shame to the family again in their eyes. And I was disowned for a very long time."" Rubie now works as an ambassador, educating people about forced marriage. ""Now I'm speaking and talking to the world and sharing in that way of there is light at the end of the tunnel, there is a place for you in this world. ""It's not all doom and gloom. And it's not hell. You've got to turn it around. You've got to find that strength to turn it around and use it to your advantage and make it a happy place otherwise no one's going to do that for you."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""We know that forced marriage is often a hidden crime and so it is essential that victims have the confidence to come forward to get the help they need. ""We are seeking views on whether introducing a mandatory reporting duty might help strengthen protections for victims and ensure more perpetrators are brought to justice. ""The consultation is open to everyone and we are particularly interested in hearing from victims and survivors of forced marriage, and professionals with expertise in the issue of forced marriage.""

"Syrian boy funds 'spent on relocation'An appeal raised more than ÃÂ£158,000 after a video emerged of a Syrian boy being attacked.Leeds & West Yorkshire","The video was filmed in a lunch break at Almondbury Community School on 25 October Money raised for a Syrian boy who was filmed being attacked at a school will be spent on relocating his family, a solicitor said. The online appeal raised more than Â£158,000 for the 15-year-old refugee who was dragged to the ground at Almondbury School in Huddersfield. Tasnime Akunjee, his family's lawyer, said they would stay in West Yorkshire. Remaining funds will be given to charity or used to set up a foundation to help other refugees, he added. GoFundMe said the appeal was one of its most widely shared and fastest growing of 2018, with donations made from 50 countries. Organiser Mohammed Tahir thanked everyone for their contributions and said it represented a ""life-changing"" amount for the family. Sajid Javid: I was bullied for being Asian Syrian refugee's sister 'also attacked' More stories from around Yorkshire Mr Tahir said: ""The donations have slowed down and I feel we are in a position where we can close the campaign. ""The donations have now been turned off and I personally would like to thank everyone who supported the cause."" Footage of the boy being pushed to the ground and having water poured in his face at the school on 25 October was shared widely on social media last week. A 16-year-old boy has been interviewed by police and reported for summons for an offence of assault ahead of a youth court appearance.

If US builds missiles so will we - Putin,"Russian President Vladimir Putin said Nato's accusation was a pretext for the US to leave the treaty Russia will develop missiles banned under a Cold War agreement if the US exits the pact, President Vladimir Putin has warned. His comments follow Nato's accusation on Tuesday that Russia has already broken the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty. Signed in 1987 by the US and USSR, it banned both countries' use of all short and medium-range missiles. But Mr Putin says the accusation is a pretext for the US to leave the pact. In televised comments, the Russian leader said many other countries had developed weapons banned under the INF treaty. ""Now it seems our American partners believe that the situation has changed so much that [they] must also have such a weapon,"" he said. ""What's our response? It's simple - in that case we will also do this."" Nato 'not planning more missiles in Europe' Russia denies breaking missile treaty Tensions rise as US threatens to 'take out' Russian missiles US President Donald Trump has previously said the country would leave the treaty because of Russian actions. Analysts say Russia sees the weapons as a cheaper alternative to conventional forces. Arriving for talks with Nato foreign ministers, EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini urged the two countries to save the treaty, saying it had ""guaranteed peace and security in European territory for 30 years now"". On Tuesday, the Western military alliance formally accused Russia of breaking the treaty. ""Allies have concluded that Russia has developed and fielded a missile system, the 9M729, which violates the INF Treaty and poses significant risks to Euro-Atlantic security,"" the Nato foreign ministers' statement read. The statement said the member nations ""strongly support"" the US claim that Russia is in breach of the pact, and called on Moscow to ""return urgently to full and verifiable compliance"". Russia denies building missiles that violate the accord Speaking after the release of Nato's statement, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Russia had 60 days to return to compliance with the treaty, after which time the US would suspend its own compliance. ""During this 60 days we will still not test or produce or deploy any systems, and we'll see what happens during this 60-day period,"" he said. Russia has repeatedly denied breaking the Cold War treaty. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan signed the INF Treaty in 1987 Signed by the US and the USSR in 1987,the arms control deal banned all nuclear and non-nuclear missiles with short and medium ranges,external, except sea-launched weapons The US had been concerned by the Soviet deployment of the SS-20 missile system and responded by placing Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe - sparking widespread protests By 1991, nearly 2,700 missiles had been destroyed Both countries were allowed to inspect the other's installations In 2007, Russian President Vladimir Putin declared the treaty no longer served Russia's interests The move came after the US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 In 2014,then US President Barack Obama accused Russia of breaching the INF Treatyafter it allegedly tested a ground-launched cruise missile. He reportedly chose not to withdraw from the treaty under pressure from European leaders, who said such a move could restart an arms race. The last time the US withdrew from a major arms treaty was in 2002, when President George W Bush pulled the US out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned weapons designed to counter ballistic nuclear missiles. His administration's move to set up a missile shield in Europe alarmed the Kremlin, and was scrapped by the Obama administration in 2009. It was replaced by a modified defence system in 2016.

DNA mapping project 'to transform society',"Hana's daughter was diagnosed with a treatable metabolic disorder caused by an inherited genetic error Scientists in Cambridge have completed the world's largest gene sequencing project in healthcare - which brings hope of better understanding of diseases and faster diagnosis.Â People with rare diseases, their family members and cancer patients took part. Genomics England,externaldescribed the project as ""transformational in what it means to society and humanity"". One in four participants with rare diseases received a diagnosis for the first time. Until now, parents of children with rare genetic conditions typically spent years trying to find out the cause. The 100,000 Genomes Project has ended this ""diagnostic odyssey"" for many families, and in some cases, led to effective treatments. Hana Young's daughter Tilly, aged six, who has a disorder which causes delayed development and seizures, had her genome sequenced, along with both her parents.Â In January 2018 she was diagnosed with GAMT deficiency, a treatable metabolic disorder, which is caused by an inherited genetic error.Â Hana, from Gosport in Hampshire, told the BBC: ""She used to be in and out of hospital and was often very aggressive towards her younger brother Arlo and others. ""She lost the ability to walk and was having hundreds of seizures a day."" Since Tilly has been on treatment, Hana says the ""difference is amazing"". Cancer and rare diseases are both strongly linked to changes in DNA ""She is communicating, full of life, her epilepsy is gone and she is no longer violent,"" her mum says.Â ""Tilly is still severely mentally disabled but she is so much better than she would have been without the diagnosis."" Had Tilly's illness been identified earlier, some long-term damage could have been prevented. NHS future: Why genome mapping could be good news Handheld device sequences human genome 100,000 Genomes project 'making huge difference' In all, about 85,000 people had their entire genetic code, or genome, sequenced, but because cancer patients also had their tumour DNA mapped, the number of genomes totalled 100,000. The human genome is made up of billions of pieces of DNA, found in nearly every cell in the body.  It is the instruction manual for life and errors can trigger a vast range of disorders. Cancer and rare diseases were chosen for the project because both are strongly linked to changes in DNA.Â Cancer is triggered by mutations in genes, while the majority of rare diseases are also caused by errors in our genome. Karen Carter, 46, is among 15,000 cancer patients who had the DNA of their cancer tumour sequenced, as well as the genome they inherited from their parents. She has had breast cancer and melanoma, but scans suggest she is clear of the disease. There are plans to sequence one million genomes in the UK in the next five years Karen, a pharmacist from Reading,Â told the BBC:Â  ""My brother and grandmother and two cousins were all diagnosed with cancers at an early age and I would like to find out if there is something in our family that causes us to get cancer - and that knowledge might help us to mitigate the risks for others."" About half of cancer patients sequenced as part of the project were then able to take part in a clinical trial or receive a targeted treatment. All the genome sequencing has been carried out at theWellcome Sanger Institute,external, near Cambridge, in laboratories run byIllumina,external, a Californian biotechnology company. The work has been overseen by Genomics England, which was set up in 2013 specifically to deliver the 100,000 Genomes Project. Although the sequencing has been completed, the analysis of the genomes - by researchers across the UK - is continuing and some participants are still awaiting results. There are now ambitious plans to sequence one million genomes in the UK in the next five years, as genetic testing becomes more embedded in NHS care. Prof Mark Caulfield, chief scientist at Genomics England said: ""The sequencing of 100,000 whole genomes marks an extraordinary UK achievement that is transforming the application of genomics in our NHS."" The hope is that it will lead to more rapid diagnosis, improved prevention of illness and more targeted medicines. Sir John Chisholm, chair of Genomics England, said:Â ""Your health record will eventually have a genomic backbone to it; that will enable what is happening to you to be compared with what your genome is telling your doctor, and therefore a more accurate diagnosis or treatment will be available."" When the first human genome was fully sequenced in 2003, it had taken 13 years and cost Â£2bn. Today, a genome's worth of DNA can be sequenced in only 30 minutes, at a cost of Â£600. The success of the 100,000 Genomes Project underlines the UK's position as a world leader in this field. Prof Dame Sue Hill, Chief Scientific Officer for England said: ""The results show how genomic medicine can transform lives,  and the opportunity now is to turn this research into reality by introducing sequencing technology as part of our world-leading NHS Genomic Medicine Service.""Follow Fergus onTwitter.,external Handheld device sequences human genome Genomes project 'making huge difference' Audio, 00:01:44Genomes project 'making huge difference' The 100,000 Genomes Project - Genomics England Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Mafia hit in major Europe-wide strike,"In Pulheim, Germany, police struck with a dawn raid on a local Italian restaurant Members of the notorious 'Ndrangheta Italian mafia have been targeted in a simultaneous police sting in Europe. Hundreds of police are understood to have been involved in the operation in Belgium, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. At least 90 people were arrested, and more than three tonnes of cocaine and 140kg of ecstasy were seized. Italian restaurants and ice cream parlours used to launder money were among the premises raided. Millions of euro in laundered money was seized at the businesses and homes raided across the four countries, officials said, and several ""high-ranking"" members of 'Ndrangheta are believed to have been among those arrested. Eurojust - the European judicial cooperation body involved - said operation ""Pollino"" had been in motion since 2016. The 'Ndrangheta mafia comes from Calabria in southern Italy. While the Sicilian Mafia was made famous in films and television, 'Ndrangheta is thought to control as much as 80% of Europe's cocaine trade, and with some 6,000 members, is a substantial and far-spread force in European crime. Italian mafia: How crime families went global Rome police seize mafia luxury villas Italy's chief anti-mafia prosecutor, Federico Cafiero De Raho, praised the ""extraordinary nature of this operation"". He congratulated the police forces involved, but also sounded a note of caution. ""Obviously we have not defeated 'Ndrangheta with this operation - 'Ndrangheta is extremely powerful and extremely rich,"" he said. This ice cream shop in Duisburg, Germany, was also raided Germany's Der Spiegel reported that the German operation was mostly concentrated in North Rhine-Westphalia - a stronghold for the mafia - and involved 240 police and another 240 support staff from the federal criminal agency. Dutch outlet NOS said that the 'Ndrangheta is known to operate its drug smuggling through the country's vibrant flower-trading industry. Meanwhile, in Belgium, broadcaster VRT reported that police were focused on the province of Limburg. The operation comes a day afterItalian police arrested the supposed new ""godfather"" of the Sicilian Mafia, Settimo Mineo, in a dawn raid. The 80-year-old jeweller is believed to have been chosen as the successor to Toto Riina, who died in jail a year ago. The new leader of the Cosa Nostra network was arrested alongside some 45 associates, in a move Interior Minister Matteo Salvini said ""dismantled"" the leadership.

"Deliveroo riders lose High Court battleRiders hired by the gig-economy delivery firm are not entitled to collective bargaining, court rules.Business","Riders hired by food courier Deliveroo are not entitled to collective bargaining, the High Court has ruled. The ruling confirmed a previous judgementby labour law body the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC). The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain was attempting to overturn the verdict, reached in November last year, that the riders are self-employed. However, the court rejected claims that this categorisation breached their human rights. Decisions by the CAC can be challenged in the High Court on a point of law, but the application for a judicial review was rejected. Mr Justice Supperstone said Deliveroo riders were not ""in an employment relationship"" with the firm, so the right to collective bargaining did not apply. This video can not be played Gig economy: Does flexible working come at a cost? The case follows a number of claims brought by workers in the ""gig"" economy demanding rights such as holiday pay, the minimum wage and pensions contributions. The IWGB said it would appeal against the latest ruling, saying that a majority of Deliveroo riders wanted workers' rights and union recognition. Its general secretary, Jason Moyer-Lee, said: ""Today's judgment is a terrible one, not just in terms of what it means for low-paid Deliveroo riders, but also in terms of understanding the European Convention on Human Rights. ""Deliveroo riders should be entitled to basic worker rights, as well as to the ability to be represented by trade unions to negotiate pay and terms and conditions."" But Deliveroo's UK managing director, Dan Warne, hailed the outcome, calling it ""a victory for riders who have consistently told us the flexibility to choose when and where they work, which comes with self-employment, is their number one reason for riding with Deliveroo"".

What defeats mean for Brexit,"It took little more than an hour for the government to be defeated on three fronts in the Commons on Tuesday, in what the papers are calling a day of mayhem and humiliation for Theresa May. But what does it all mean for Brexit? 17:45 GMT:The most significant defeat. Pro-European Conservative rebel Dominic Grieve wins support for his amendment, which he says will give Parliament a direct say in what happens if Mrs May's deal is rejected by MPs in a vote next Tuesday. This means instead of merely taking note of what the government tells them, MPs can exert more influence by voting on what they want the government to do. Some think this could effectively slim the chances of a no-deal Brexit, as MPs push for a ""Plan B"" alternative to Mrs May's deal and seek to prevent any chance of Britain leaving the EU without a deal in place. Anything MPs vote for would still have to be put into law by the government. Leader of the Commons Andrea Leadsom insists MPs still do not have the power to block a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played The moment the government lost a key vote - and was told to disclose its legal advice on Brexit Our political editor Laura Kuenssbergsays the amendment could possibly work in Mrs May's favour. She says some Brexiteers might feel the PM's deal would be their best bet - if Mrs May's deal is rejected, then amended, they risk it coming out softer than the current deal. 16:58 GMT:Ministers are found in contempt of Parliament for refusing to publish the full legal advice they had received before agreeing the Brexit deal. This is a very serious telling-off for ministers - and unprecedented in modern politics. They had argued that to publish it would break convention and was not in the national interest, but MPs ruled they had ignored a binding Commons vote to publish it, in full. Leader of the Commons Ms Leadsom was forced to back down and has now published thesix pages of advice in full.,external The attorney general gave MPs an overview of his legal advice to Cabinet but now every bit of his advice will be published Attorney General Geoffrey Cox had, on Monday, published an overview of his legal advice which Labour said was not legal advice but ""simply described the deal"". In his full letter to the PM, dated 13 November, Mr Cox said her deal could result in the UK becoming stuck in ""protracted and repeating rounds of negotiations"". He also advised that the proposed backstop arrangement with the EU to prevent a hard Irish border could ""endure indefinitely"". 16:40 GMT:Ministers try to refer the matter of releasing the full legal advice to the Commons Privileges Committee by tabling an amendment. MPs reject it by 311 votes to 307, opening the way for the contempt vote. MPs may try to steal Brexit, says Liam Fox Brexit advice warns of border 'stalemate' Could defeats peel off rebels?

Deliveroo riders lose High Court battle,"Riders hired by food courier Deliveroo are not entitled to collective bargaining, the High Court has ruled. The ruling confirmed a previous judgementby labour law body the Central Arbitration Committee (CAC). The Independent Workers Union of Great Britain was attempting to overturn the verdict, reached in November last year, that the riders are self-employed. However, the court rejected claims that this categorisation breached their human rights. Decisions by the CAC can be challenged in the High Court on a point of law, but the application for a judicial review was rejected. Mr Justice Supperstone said Deliveroo riders were not ""in an employment relationship"" with the firm, so the right to collective bargaining did not apply. This video can not be played Gig economy: Does flexible working come at a cost? The case follows a number of claims brought by workers in the ""gig"" economy demanding rights such as holiday pay, the minimum wage and pensions contributions. The IWGB said it would appeal against the latest ruling, saying that a majority of Deliveroo riders wanted workers' rights and union recognition. Its general secretary, Jason Moyer-Lee, said: ""Today's judgment is a terrible one, not just in terms of what it means for low-paid Deliveroo riders, but also in terms of understanding the European Convention on Human Rights. ""Deliveroo riders should be entitled to basic worker rights, as well as to the ability to be represented by trade unions to negotiate pay and terms and conditions."" But Deliveroo's UK managing director, Dan Warne, hailed the outcome, calling it ""a victory for riders who have consistently told us the flexibility to choose when and where they work, which comes with self-employment, is their number one reason for riding with Deliveroo"".

""This is a tragic case for her family and our condolences and thoughts are, and must be, with her children."" In a statement issued after the inquest, Ms Archer's family said: ""We still cannot believe that Vicki's not here. ""Her zest for life was infectious, she was a wonderful mother and daughter and her charm brought a smile to all those who knew her. ""She could light up a room.

Botox party mishap left woman housebound,"Rachael Knappier did not leave her house for more than a week after her lips swelled dramatically as a result of lip filler being ""incorrectly administered"" A woman's lips swelled up so much they touched her nose after she had filler injected at a Botox party. Rachael Knappier, from Leicestershire, said she ""shouted out in pain"" after she was given the treatment by a beautician at her friend's house. She rushed to A&E when her lips swelled dramatically, later seeking private treatment to fix the problem. The 29-year-old warned others against having lip fillers from someone not medically trained. After agreeing to Botox on her forehead, Miss Knappier said the beautician noticed a lump on her lip - an injury she sustained when a fire door hit her at the age of 13. ""That lump is my number one insecurity. As she pointed it out, I was just drawn in,"" she said. After returning home, Miss Knappier said she felt unwell. Later that night, she woke up and couldn't feel her lip. ""My lips were a size I had not seen before,"" she said. Miss Knappier said at one point her lips were so big they were touching her nose She contacted the beautician on FaceTime, who Miss Knappier said was ""gasping and holding her hand over her mouth"". ""She told me to put an ice pack on and take an antihistamine but my lips were growing,"" she said. ""Then she kept repeatedly shouting, 'get to A&E'."" At the hospital, doctors told Miss Knappier the NHS would not dissolve lip filler and would only check she was not in any immediate danger. She said she was vomiting and shaking and did not leave the house for seven days. After first seeing a local aesthetic nurse, she went to the Consultant Clinic in London where they dissolved the filler and, 72 hours later, her lips were back to normal. Miss Knappier before the lip filler was administered by the beautician ""It's left me traumatised. I would not wish it on my worst enemy,"" she said. She has since started a petition calling for aesthetic medical treatments to only be performed by doctors, nurses and dentists. Miss Knappier, from Broughton Astley, also believes the aesthetic medical industry should be regulated. Miss Knappier, pictured after a clinic dissolved her lip filler, has called for greater regulation of cosmetic procedures Dr Marc Pacifico, a consultant plastic surgeon from the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons (BAAPS), said dermal fillers are a ""complete wild west in the UK"". ""We are one of the few western countries who regard [fillers] as a device not a medicine,"" he said. ""There have even been cases of blindness. ""It was really about time stronger regulation was brought in."" 'We're homeless, how will Santa find us?' Giant snail sale raises Â£231k for hospice Skeleton in thigh-high boots discovery Dr Natalie Boyd, from the clinic, said she believed Miss Knappier suffered a vascular occlusion. She said this possibly happened by the filler being injected ""into or around an artery or vein, which then causes a vicious cycle of swelling and compression"".

British backpacker missing in New Zealand,"Grace Millane turned 22 on Sunday, but has not replied to her family's birthday messages Police in New Zealand are searching for a British woman who went missing five days ago. Backpacker Grace Millane, 22, from Essex, was last seen by her roommates at a hostel in Auckland on Saturday. Her family, who said they spoke to her ""most days"", became concerned when she failed to reply to birthday messages on Sunday and said her silence was ""completely out of character"". The Foreign Office said it was providing support to Auckland police. Miss Millane's brother, Michael, said his sister - who graduated from the University of Lincoln in September - had previously travelled as part of an organised group through South America for six weeks. However, she was travelling alone when she arrived in New Zealand about two weeks ago. ""It was what she wanted - she wanted to see the world,"" Mr Millane said. Miss Millane's family, from Wickford, near Basildon, reported her missing to New Zealand police, who are now investigating the disappearance. ""They are trawling through her social media posts and emails to see if there are any clues, but so far we have no news,"" Mr Millane said. His sister last spoke to a family member on Thursday, and has not put anything on social media since. Mr Millane said she had two mobile phones with her in New Zealand but calls go straight to voicemail. He added she had not travelled alone before and it was ""completely out of character for her not to have been in contact with us and her friends"". Miss Millane was staying at the Base Backpackers hostel in central Auckland Not only did Miss Millane fail to respond to any messages on her 22nd birthday on Sunday, but she also did not send Mr Millane a message on his birthday on Tuesday. ""We are really, really worried and concerned about Grace. We just want her to get in contact,"" he said. He said their father was flying out to New Zealand later. The family has posted pleas on Facebook in the hope other travellers in New Zealand can help in the search. A New Zealand Police spokeswoman said the force had received a missing persons report. ""She (Miss Millane) has not yet been located. Initial inquiries are under way,"" she said. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""We are in contact with New Zealand police and providing consular support after a British woman was reported missing in Auckland.""

Grindr cheat jailed for wife's murder,"Jessica Patel was found dead in the living room of the couple's home A pharmacist who murdered his wife with a Tesco carrier bag so he could start a new life with his boyfriend has been jailed for a minimum of 30 years. Mitesh Patel, 37, strangled and suffocated Jessica, 34, and then staged a burglary at the couple's home in Middlesbrough on 14 May. Jurors heard he had planned to claim a Â£2m life insurance payout and move to Australia with his lover Dr Amit Patel. Patel was sentenced to life and told he would serve a minimum of 30 years. Sentencing Patel, Mr Justice Goss told him: ""You have no remorse for your actions. Any pity you have is for yourself."" He told the defendant that Mrs Patel ""clearly loved you and was a dutiful wife"" of nine years, adding: ""She wanted nothing more than to have children and live a normal family life. Mitesh Patel (left) was planning to move to Australia to be with his boyfriend Dr Amit Patel ""The difficulty is that you had no sexual attraction to her; you were attracted to men."" He said Mrs Patel was to some extent aware of her husband's sexuality and was ""lonely, often upset and controlled by you"". The judge said Patel's messages revealed him to be ""needy and callous"" and he used Mrs Patel ""whilst indulging your own desires and whims"". This video can not be played Grindr cheat Mitesh Patel calls 999 after wife murder The two-week trial at Teesside Crown Court heard Patel, who ran a pharmacy on Roman Road with his 34-year-old wife, had a series of affairs with men he met via the dating app Grindr. Patel, who claimed his wife was his ""best mate"", injected her with insulin before strangling and suffocating her with the bag at their home on The Avenue. He then bound her with duct tape and ransacked the house in an attempt to blame burglars for her death.

This video can not be played Mitesh Patel tried to hide this CCTV footage which showed him after he killed his wife Reading a statement on behalf of Mrs Patel's sisters and cousins, her younger sister Divya told the court: ""The one thing we hope and prayed for above anything else was that in her final moments she did not suffer. ""The cruel reality is that she did in fact suffer, she knew exactly who her killer was, and he mercilessly ignored her attempts to fight for her own life as he ended it. ""We can only imagine the fear and panic she must have felt knowing herself this was it. Thinking of that moment makes our hearts so heavy."" Grindr cheat pharmacist guilty of murder Grindr cheat 'saw strangle film with wife' Latest news and stories from the North East Ms Patel also addressed her brother-in-law in the dock, saying: ""We do not just pray, we know, she will be free from you for ever.

The house was ransacked to make it look as if there had been a burglary Patel told his boyfriend he married Mrs Patel because she was in love with him and would provide a cover for his true sexuality. He wanted to move to Australia to be with Dr Patel and the pair had planned to raise a child conceived by Mrs Patel through IVF.

Mafia hit in major Europe-wide strikeHundreds of police across Europe are targeting the 'Ndrangheta mafia in a major coordinated strike.Europe,"In Pulheim, Germany, police struck with a dawn raid on a local Italian restaurant Members of the notorious 'Ndrangheta Italian mafia have been targeted in a simultaneous police sting in Europe. Hundreds of police are understood to have been involved in the operation in Belgium, Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. At least 90 people were arrested, and more than three tonnes of cocaine and 140kg of ecstasy were seized. Italian restaurants and ice cream parlours used to launder money were among the premises raided. Millions of euro in laundered money was seized at the businesses and homes raided across the four countries, officials said, and several ""high-ranking"" members of 'Ndrangheta are believed to have been among those arrested. Eurojust - the European judicial cooperation body involved - said operation ""Pollino"" had been in motion since 2016. The 'Ndrangheta mafia comes from Calabria in southern Italy.

Mr Bush Jr, himself a former president, described him as ""a noble man, the best father"". All surviving US presidents attended the funeral, sharing a pew in the US National Cathedral in Washington DC. Mr Bush senior, who served as the 41st US president between 1989 and 1993, died on Friday at the age of 94. He will be buried in his home state of Texas, alongside his wife Barbara. Four presidents sat (awkwardly) on one pew As it happened: US bids farewell to George HW Bush The funeral in pictures In his eulogy, George W Bush said his father had taught him that ""public service is noble and necessary"". ""He accepted failure is part of living a full life, but taught us never to be defined by failure. He showed us how setbacks can strengthen,"" he added. His voice breaking with emotion at the end of his eulogy, Mr Bush said: ""Through our tears, let us know the blessings of knowing and loving you. A great and noble man, the best father a son or daughter could have."" The Trumps, Obamas, Clintons and Carters all attended The invitation-only funeral at the National Cathedral was attended by President Donald Trump and his predecessors Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. The Prince of Wales, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Jordan's King Abdullah II were among the world figures there to pay their respects. Former leaders, including John Major, who was UK prime minister for most of Mr Bush's term, also attended. A life in pictures Service dog Sully pays touching last tribute Wednesday has been declared a national day of mourning - many government offices and US stock exchanges are closed. Following the funeral service, Mr Bush's flag-draped casket was carried from the cathedral by a military honour guard and was later flown to Texas, arriving in Houston at 23:00 GMT. The casket will lie in public repose at St Martin's Episcopal Church until Thursday morning. There will be a second service before the Bush 4141 - a train which was named in honour of the president - takes his body to its final resting place, next to his wife Barbara at the George HW Bush presidential library. Jim McGrath, who was Mr Bush's spokesman, said the president had once wondered if anyone would attend his funeral. Presidential historian Jon Meachamdescribed Mr Bush Sr as ""America's last great soldier statesman"", recounting how he had served as a US Navy pilot in World War Two and survived after his plane was shot down over the Pacific. ""His life was a perennial effort to prove himself worthy of his salvation on that distant morning,"" he said. What is Bush Senior's legacy? The making of a president Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroneypraised Mr Bush Sr's role in navigating the end of the Cold War. ""When George Bush was president of the United States of America, every single head of government in the world knew that they were dealing with a gentleman, a genuine leader, one who was distinguished, resolute and brave,"" he said. Former Wyoming Senator Alan Simpsonsaid Mr Bush had a simple credo: ""What would we do without family and friends?"" George HW Bush was a decorated fighter pilot in World War Two, a head of the CIA and vice-president to Ronald Reagan before being elected president in 1988. His time in office was dominated by foreign policy - and he was praised for how he navigated the end of the Cold War, and handled the first Gulf War. This video can not be played A look back at the life of George Bush Senior However, he was accused of neglecting domestic affairs and, after reneging on a campaign promise not to increase taxes, lost to Bill Clinton in the 1992 presidential election. He has been described as a bipartisan figure who tried to make conservatism ""kinder and gentler"". Mr Trump has in the past clashed with the Bush family - and Mr Bush told a historian he voted for Mr Trump's opponent Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. Mr Bush's former White House press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, told Reuters: ""It's important for our presidents to pay respect to each other and I'm glad President Trump will be there.""

MPs publish seized Facebook files,"Emails written by Facebook's chief and his deputies show the firm struck secret deals to give some developers special access to user data while refusing others, according to MPs. A cache ofinternal documents has been published online,externalby a parliamentary committee. It said the files also showed Facebook had deliberately made it ""as hard as possible"" for users to be aware of privacy changes to its Android app. Facebook had objected to their release. It said that the documents had been presented in a ""very misleading manner"" and required additional context. The emails were obtained from the chief of Six4Three - a software firm that is suing the tech giant - and were disclosed by the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee as part of its inquiry into fake news. About 250 pages have been published, some of which are marked ""highly confidential"". Damian Collins MP, the chair of the committee, highlighted several ""key issues"" in an introductory note. He wrote that: Facebook allowed some companies to maintain ""full access"" to users' friends data even after announcing changes to its platform in 2014/2015 to limit what developers' could see. ""It is not clear that there was any user consent for this, nor how Facebook decided which companies should be whitelisted,"" Mr Collins wrote Facebook had been aware that an update to its Android app that let it collect records of users' calls and texts would be controversial. ""To mitigate any bad PR, Facebook planned to make it as hard as possible for users to know that this was one of the underlying features,"" Mr Collins wrote Facebook used data provided by the Israeli analytics firm Onavo to determine which other mobile apps were being downloaded and used by the public. It then used this knowledge to decide which apps to acquire or otherwise treat as a threat there was evidence that Facebook's refusal to share data with some apps caused them to fail there had been much discussion of the financial value of providing access to friends' data Allow Twitter content?

Facebook said Six4Three had ""cherry-picked"" the documents and claimed they had omitted ""important context"". Facebook documents seized by MPs Facebook reveals its data-sharing VIPs All our stories about the Cambridge Analytica data scandal ""We stand by the platform changes we made in 2015 to stop a person from sharing their friends' data with developers,"" said a spokeswoman. ""Like any business, we had many internal conversations about the various ways we could build a sustainable business model for our platform. ""But the facts are clear: we've never sold people's data."" Mr Zuckerberg has alsoposted a personal response on his Facebook page,external. ""I understand there is a lot of scrutiny on how we run our systems. That's healthy given the vast number of people who use our services around the world, and it is right that we are constantly asked to explain what we do,"" he said. ""But it's also important that the coverage of what we do - including the explanation of these internal documents - doesn't misrepresent our actions or motives."" The correspondence includes emails between Facebook and several other tech firms, in which the social network appears to agree to add third-party apps to a ""whitelist"" of those given permission to access data about users' friends. This might be used, for example, to allow an app's users to continue seeing which of their Facebook friends were using the same service. Netflix tapped into Facebook friends lists to let users see what titles their contacts had watched and rated highly They include: the dating service Badoo, its spin-off Hot or Not, and Bumble - another dating app that it had invested in the car pick-up service Lyft the video-streaming service Netflix the home rental service Airbnb However, others including the ticket sales service Ticketmaster, Twitter's short-video platform Vine and the connected-cars specialist Airbiquity seem to have been denied the privilege. Among the emails that have been published are the following extracts: The following concerns a decision to prevent Twitter's short-form video service having access to users' friends lists. It is dated 24 January 2012. Justin Osofsky(Facebook vice president): ""Twitter launched Vine today which lets you shoot multiple short video segments to make one single, 6-second video... Unless anyone raises objections, we will shut down their friends API access today. We've prepared reactive PR, and I will let Jana know our decision."" Mark Zuckerberg(Facebook chief executive): ""Yup, go for it."" The following is part of a discussion about giving Facebook's Android app permission to read users' call logs. It is dated 4 February 2015. Michael LeBeau(Facebook product manager): ""As you know all the growth team is planning on shipping a permissions update on Android at the end of this month. They are going to include the 'read call log' permission... This is a pretty high-risk thing to do from a PR perspective but it appears that the growth team will charge ahead and do it...[The danger is] screenshot of the scary Android permissions screen becomes a meme (as it has in the past), propagates around the web, it gets press attention, and enterprising journalists dig into what exactly the new update is requesting, then write stories about ""Facebook uses new Android update to pry into your private life in ever more terrifying ways"". The following is from a discussion in which Mark Zuckerberg mulled the idea of selling developers access to users' friends' data. It is dated October 2012, pre-dating the quiz involved in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. It was sent to Sam Mullin, who was vice president of product management. Mark Zuckerberg(Facebook chief executive): ""It's not at all clear to me here that we have a model that will actually make us the revenue we want at scale. I'm getting more on board with locking down some parts of platform, including friends' data and potentially email addresses for mobile apps. I'm generally sceptical that there is as much data leak strategic risk as you think... I think we leak info to developers but I just can't think of any instances where that data has leaked from developer to developer and caused a real issue for us."" The following is from an email sent by Mark Zuckerberg to several of his executives in which he explains why he does not think making users pay for Facebook would be a good idea. It is dated 19 November 2012. Mark Zuckerberg(Facebook chief executive): ""The question is whether we could charge and still achieve ubiquity. Theoretically, if we could do that, it would be better to get ubiquity and get paid. My sense is there may be some price we could charge that wouldn't interfere with ubiquity, but this price wouldn't be enough to make us real money. Conversely, we could probably make real money of we were willing to sacrifice ubiquity, but that doesn't seem like the right trade here.""

UAE 'spy' man 'psychologically tortured',"This video can not be played Matthew Hedges tells the Today programme that standing in ankle cuffs was ""mentally exhausting"" The British academic jailed for spying in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has told how he endured ""psychological torture"". Matthew Hedges, 31, said he was forced to stand ""all day"" in ankle cuffs, suffered panic attacks and had suicidal thoughts. Mr Hedges, who denies being a spy, told the BBC he only confessed to being a captain in MI6 to stop the ""torture"". He said the UAE asked him to act as a double agent in the UK Foreign Office. Mr Hedges had denied spying and said he had been researching his PhD, but was jailed for life last month. The UAE government said the Durham academic was ""100% a spy"", but pardoned him on 26 November. The leader of MI6 has said he is""perplexed"" about the UAE's reasons for jailing Mr Hedges.

The PhD student told John Humphrys on Radio 4's Today programme that being in a cell had been ""lonely and isolating"". He was given a ""cocktail"" of medication to treat his depression and anxiety, he said, and deprived of natural light. ""I wasn't allowed to do anything to distract myself. My mental health was deteriorating,"" he said. ""I was handcuffed and blindfolded. I had to stand all day in ankle cuffs."" Visits to the bathroom were accompanied by four guards, he said. Daniela Tejada helped secure her husband's release Mr Hedges said standing in ankle cuffs was ""mentally exhausting"", but that adrenaline would kick in and help him cope. Shortly before his arrest he was due to have counselling to deal with anxiety and depression. ""I could not manage my thoughts throughout the incarceration,"" he said. Mr Hedges also said he regularly had panic attacks and some nights he dreamt of hanging himself in his cell. He said he was only able to speak to his wife Daniela Tejada - who had been campaigning for his release - once a week. Matthew Hedges has always maintained his innocence and said he had been researching his PhD During hours of interrogations he said the psychological pressure was so great he confessed. ""I panicked and told them I was a captain in MI6. I told them what they wanted to hear."" He also spoke of how he felt when he was sentenced to life in prison. ""It was total shock, I wasn't able to process it. I couldn't say goodbye to Danni."" British Academic pardoned by UAE Who is the man at the centre of the spy row? Hedges jailed for life on UAE spy charge Ms Tejada said academics would now have to think twice before doing research in the UAE. She said: ""At the heart of it it's about drawing red lines. I think the biggest issue is naturally the fact that there is no academic freedom in the UAE but also the fact that the red lines aren't clearly drawn. ""So it's sort of every man on their own. Each academic will have a different experience, to assess how safe it is to do research."" Durham University said it had a second PhD student in the UAE but they would not be required to return to the UK.

Alleged IRA spy admits pornography charges,"Fred Scappaticci denies he was an Army agent within the IRA The man alleged to have been the Army's highest-ranking IRA agent has pleaded guilty to two charges of possession of extreme pornographic images. West Belfast man Fred Scappaticci, 72, appeared at Westminster Magistrates Court on Wednesday. The court heard the charges related to at least 329 images, including some involving animals. Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot sentenced Scappaticci to three months in custody, suspended for 12 months. She said: ""You have not been before the court for 50 years - and that's good character in my book. ""I can see you are not a well man at all - you have very serious health issues - and that you live a lonely life."" The charges span from October 2015 to January 2018. The first charge was that he was in possession of 329 extreme pornographic images - understood to be mostly of women, but also of men and animals, although there were no images of children - on 9 January 2018. The second charge stated that he was in possession of extreme pornography between 6 October 2015 and 31 January 2018. Scappaticci told the court he was ""not doing anyone any real harm"" and said he had depression Scappaticci, dressed in a blue fleece and green tracksuit bottoms, spoke briefly to enter his guilty pleas to the charges. The west Belfast man is believed to have led the IRA's internal security unit during part of Northern Ireland's Troubles. The unit was responsible for identifying and interrogating suspected informers. Scappaticci has admitted, in the past, to being a republican, but denied that he was an IRA informer. An investigation into his alleged activities - known as Operation Kenova - is being led by Chief Constable Jon Boutcher, from Bedfordshire Police. Speaking after Wednesday's court case, Mr Boutcher said: ""Today's conviction came about as a result of material recovered during a search conducted by the Kenova team. ""This result is an indication that wherever criminal behaviour is identified during my investigation, evidence will be presented for the purposes of prosecution. ""Operation Kenova continues to recover evidence in relation to our core terms of reference and as and when it is appropriate to speak further, I will do so."" Westminster Magistrates' Court heard Scappaticci told police he was not sexually interested in animals, and preferred women with big breasts. He told them he was ""not doing anyone any real harm"" and said he had depression.

BT bars Huawei kit from core of 5G network,"Huawei and its rivals are competing to sell 5G equipment to mobile phone networks BT has said it will not use Huawei's equipment within the heart of its 5G mobile network when it is rolled out in the UK. The British firm, however, still plans to use the Chinese company's phone mast antennas and other products deemed not to be at the ""core"" of the service. BT also confirmed that it was stripping out Huawei equipment from the core of its existing 3G and 4G networks, as revealed by the Financial Times (FT). Huawei faces security concerns. The US-China Economic and Security Review Commissionrecently issued a report saying that Beijing could force Huawei and other Chinese 5G equipment-makers to,external""modify products to perform below expectations or fail, facilitate state or corporate espionage, or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability"" of networks that used them. Last week, New Zealand became the latest country to bar a local network from using Huawei's 5G gear. And on Monday, intelligence serviceMI6's chief Alex Younger said Britain needed to decidehow comfortable it was using Chinese-owned technologies within its communications infrastructure. Huawei denies having any ties to the Chinese government beyond those of being a law-abiding taxpayer. However, critics point out that its founder, Ren Zhengfei, was a former engineer in the country's army and joined the Communist Party in 1978. There are also questions about how independent of state influence any large Chinese company can be. BT has has long made use of Huawei's equipment within its fixed-line network, having signed a pioneering contract with the supplier in 2005. However, the BBC understands that BT introduced an internal policy a year later that restricted use of Huawei's equipment to the ""periphery"" of its infrastructure. Huawei finance chief arrested in Canada MI6 chief questions China's role in UK tech sector Why has UK not blocked Huawei? New Zealand bars Huawei 5G deal This kit is sometimes referred within the industry to being ""the dumb stuff at the end of the pipes"". It meant in theory that were Huawei's equipment to be compromised, some customers would be affected but the wider network would not collapse. Huawei can still bid to supply BT with phone mast antennas and other equipment In 2016, BT also acquired the mobile phone firm EE, which had been using the Shenzhen-based firm's kit to push about its customers' data. Shortly after, BT began removing Huawei equipment that it determined to be at the ""control plane"" - or core - of the network. Although this has been going on for two years, it was only publicly disclosed in response to a question by the FT. ""In 2016, following the acquisition of EE, we began a process to remove Huawei equipment from the core of our 3G and 4G networks, as part of network architecture principles in place since 2006,"" said a spokesman for BT. ""We're applying these same principles to our current RFP [request-for-proposal bid requests] for 5G core infrastructure. ""As a result, Huawei has not been included in vendor selection for our 5G core. Huawei remains an important equipment provider outside the core network, and a valued innovation partner."" One of the benefits to BT of having kept the restriction private until now was that other equipment-makers might have been encouraged to have tendered lower bids if they believed they were competing against the Chinese firm. Huawei has previously promoted its partnership with BT, andas recently as February issued a press release,externalthat said the two were working together on the ""development and live trials"" of 5G core network technologies. However, the BBC understands the Chinese firm did not expect to win any such contracts from BT and had been focused instead on selling 5G equipment for use elsewhere in its network. ""Since it acquired EE in 2016, the BT Group has been actively bringing EE's legacy network architecture in line with this long-standing agreement,"" said a spokesman for Huawei. ""This is a normal and expected activity, which we understand and fully support. ""Working together, we have already completed a number of successful 5G trials across different sites in London, and we will continue to work with BT in the 5G era.""

Ryanair customer claims to go to court,"Ryanair has experienced months of disruption in Europe The Civil Aviation Authority has said it is taking legal action against Ryanair over its refusal to compensate thousands of UK-based customers. Their flights were cancelled or delayed over the summer because of strikes by Ryanair pilots and cabin crew. The CAA says they are entitled to compensation under EU law. However, Ryanair argues the strike action amounts to ""extraordinary circumstances"" and that therefore, it does not have to pay. More Ryanair passengers have put in compensation claims for cancellations or delays to arbitration this year than any other airline. Thousands of Ryanair passengers were hit by the strikes Figures from the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) service showedthe airline accounted for the largest proportion- 30% - of all appeals. In the first nine months of 2018, it received 22,159 complaints, but only processed 1,347 of 6,653 Ryanair cases. Airports with worst flight delays revealed Ryanair sacks staff who 'slept on floor' According to the CAA, under EU legislation,passengers are allowed to make an EU261 claim,externalwhen flights are delayed by three hours or more, cancelled or when they are denied boarding. Ryanair, like other airlines, was signed up to abide by ADR decisions. Ryanair has now told the CAA that it has terminated its agreement with ADR. ""As a result of Ryanair's action, passengers with an existing claim will now have to await the outcome of the Civil Aviation Authority's enforcement action,"" the CAA said. Helen Derbyshire, 21, from Manchester, had to cut short her holiday in Berlin in September with her sister Abigail, 18, when their return Ryanair flight was cancelled because of strike action. She has since attempted to claim compensation herself, as well as through a claims company, Resolver, but Ryanair has refused. She told the BBC: ""We were really disappointed, because we'd been looking forward to it all year. ""Ryanair offered us a flight back the following week, but due to commitments with work and college, we had to fly back the next day. We also did not have enough euros to stay at our hotel for an extra two nights. ""We were very upset, as we had saved for months for this holiday, and we lost a lot of money on our hotel, as we had to check out two nights early. ""On top of this, we only had two full days in Berlin, out of the five we should have had. ""We were very worried and not sure what to do. Ryanair told us not to ring them, as they said the phone lines would be very busy, so we had to work it out for ourselves. ""I am very unhappy about the service we received from Ryanair. I have documents from Ryanair giving us two different stories about why they cancelled our flight, and evidence that they have refused to give us any money back."" In response to the CAA's announcement, a Ryanair spokesperson said: ""Courts in Germany, Spain and Italy have already ruled that strikes are an 'exceptional circumstance' and EU261 compensation does not apply. We expect the UK CAA and courts will follow this precedent."" Consumer rights organisations have welcomed the CAA's move. Rory Boland, Which? travel editor, said: ""Customers would have been outraged that Ryanair attempted to shirk its responsibilities by refusing to pay out compensation for cancelling services during the summer - which left hard-working families stranded with holiday plans stalled. ""It is right that the CAA is now taking legal action against Ryanair on the basis that such strikes were not 'extraordinary circumstances' and should not be exempt, to ensure that the airline must finally do the right thing by its customers and pay the compensation owed.""

First baby born after deceased womb transplant,"The baby was delivered by Caesarean section on 15 December 2017 A healthy baby girl has been born using a womb transplanted from a dead person. The 10-hour transplant operation - and later fertility treatment - took place in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in 2016. The mother, 32, was born without a womb. There have been 39 womb transplants using a live donor, including mothers donating their womb to their daughter, resulting in 11 babies. But the 10 previous transplants from a dead donor have failed or resulted in miscarriage. In this case,reported in The Lancet,external, the womb donor was a mother of three in her mid-40s who died from bleeding on the brain. The recipient had Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome, which affects about one in every 4,500 women and results in the vagina and uterus (womb) failing to form properly. However, her ovaries were fine. And doctors were able to remove eggs, fertilise them with the father-to-be's sperm and freeze them. The woman was given drugs that weakened her immune system to prevent her body attacking and rejecting the transplant. The 10-hour transplant operation - and later fertility treatment - took place in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, in 2016 And about six weeks later, she started having periods. After seven months, the fertilised eggs were implanted. And, after a normal pregnancy, a 6lb (2.5kg) baby was delivered by Caesarean section on 15 December 2017. This video can not be played ""Using deceased donor organs is a viable option"", a uterus transplant surgeon tells World at One Dr Dani Ejzenberg, from Hospital das ClÃ­nicas in SÃ£o Paulo, said: ""The first uterus transplants from live donors were a medical milestone, creating the possibility of childbirth for many infertile women with access to suitable donors and the needed medical facilities. ""However, the need for a live donor is a major limitation as donors are rare, typically being willing and eligible family members or close friends."" Dr Srdjan Saso, from Imperial College London, said the results were ""extremely exciting"". ""It enables use of a much wider potential donor population, applies lower costs and avoids live donors' surgical risks."" Second baby for womb transplant mum Womb transplants: how do they work?

LivePrime Minister's Questions,"MPs continued debating the government's Brexit deal, ahead of vote next Tuesday Thursday's debate focused on the economic impact of the agreement Commons business began with questions to Brexit ministers House of Lords also debated the Brexit deal this afternoon Sophie Morris, Ryan Brown and Robbie Hawkins The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Brexit officially happened on 31 January but the UK is now in a transition period until the end of 2020. Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. Members of Parliament (MPs) will vote next week on the Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated. Sir Graham Brady ""would welcome"" a delay in the Brexit vote if it would help resolve MPs' concerns. House of CommonsParliament That's it for our coverage today, as MPs complete their third day of debate on the withdrawal agreement. Tory MP Sir Hugo Swire is now introducing his adjournment debate on the illegal trade in seahorses in the UK. MPs are due to continue their debate on the Brexit deal on Monday afternoon. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament International Trade Secretary Liam Fox says the ""status quo has never been on offer"" as the EU ""wants an ever closer union"". ""We have to find a compromise that makes this workable,"" he says, adding: ""the withdrawal agreement achieves just that, and is the only deal on the table"". DUP MP Ian Paisley intervenes to says the ""gallows are being built"" for the deal ahead of Tuesday's planned vote - and asks if there have been discussions about delaying it. Liam Fox replies says ministers will ""continue to make the case"" for the deal, but adds: ""the government will want to talk to members, of course it will want to look to ways to give a reassurance"". He says ""I understand why MPs have concerns about the backstop, but it is clear that it is there to be a temporary measure"". Liam Fox says Labour is ""playing politics at a time of great national decision-making"", and their Brexit policy is ""ill-researched and delusional"". He says that by agreeing to hold to the referendum, Parliament ""sub-contracted its sovereignty"" to voters, and MPs must now ""live up to our side of the bargain"".  Allow Twitter content?

Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Winding up the debate for Labour, shadow international trade minister Barry Gardiner says the government has ""tried to exclude Parliament from the process at all stages"". ""This is a deal that members on all sides now believe is not in the best interest of the country,"" he says. Mr Gardiner says the UK will be ""much poorer than we otherwise would be"" under the government's agreement. He calls on Liam Fox to be ""yet more flexible still"" on the next steps for Brexit, and ""recall his own words"" given to a Sunday newspaper in 2012. Back then, he says, Mr Fox called for the UK to renegotiate a ""new relationship"" with the EU, based on ""an economic partnership involving a customs union and the single market in goods and services"". ""The secretary of state may not like it, but it sounds an awful lot like Labour party policy to me"", he adds. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Like other MPs today, the DUP's Jim Shannon picks up on the proposed 'backstop' plan for the Irish border in the government's deal. He says there is ""no legal form for leaving this international treaty without consent"", adding that this is ""not acceptable"". He says the people of Northern Ireland must stand up for themselves and he has ""a mistrust for the government at this time"". ""The government have voted for Northern Ireland to become a voiceless victim of the UK,"" he concludes. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Next up this evening is Labour MP Karen Lee - who was a Remainer in 2016 but her constituency of Lincoln voted to leave. She ""sincerely believes"" there is a Brexit deal that will benefit her constituents, she says. ""But this deal will not protect jobs, workplace rights or environmental standards, and it will inhibit business by failing to ensure frictionless trade"", she adds. ""We can renegotiate with the EU - or better still, hold a general election"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Vicky Ford - who used to be member of the European Parliament and voted Remain - says MPs need to respect the vote to leave. ""A second referendum would be even more divisive and no more decisive,"" she adds. Ms Ford says leaving the EU with no deal poses ""a huge risk"" and the withdrawal agreement helps real businesses remain secure and offers time to develop a future framework. She calls Labour's plan of ""a close relationship with the single market without being in it"" a ""fantasy land"". Ms Ford says the backstop plan is not a ""practical risk"", as remaining in the arrangement permanently ""is not in the EU's interest"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Andrew Bowie says many of his colleagues on the Conservative benches are still ""struggling to come to a conclusion"" on which way they will vote. He adds that he voted to leave the EU ""and supports the deal"". Mr Bowie says he backs the agreement ""as it is the best for business, his constituents and Scotland"". ""I believe this deal is better than what we have now,"" he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Dame Louise Ellman says the deal provides no certainty and there is no guarantee that a better one could be negotiated. Leaving without a deal on the other hand is not an option, she adds. The only other option is that MPs go back to the people and tell them the truth that ""we cannot leave the club and expect to keep all the benefits"". ""That is mission impossible"", she says. ""It is time for a people's vote"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Lee Rowley says ""we are arguing over commas in this deal, when whole paragraphs of it do not work"", and for this reason he will not be backing the deal. ""I did not come to this place to make people poorer,"" he says. ""I cannot go back to my constituents and say this deal gives them Brexit - it does not"". He says he disagrees with the deal as it is ""a failure of nerve and ambition"", and calls for it to be stopped. Mr Rowley calls on the government ""to move the UK out of its shadow"" and ""get Brexit back on track"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi says the Brexitlegal advicepublished this week shows Northern Ireland ""has been sold out"". The Brexit process has been ""blurred, botched and bungled from the very start"", he adds. Mr Singh Dhesi says the prime minister is ""not up to the task"" and ""has created division and discord"". The Conservatives must ""stand aside"" to allow a general election, he concludes. House of LordsParliament The debate on the government's Brexit deal has ended - and business in the House of Lords for today comes to an end. Peers will resume the debate on Monday. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of LordsParliament Wrapping up the Lords debate, Tory peer Lord Horam says the referendum result was ""a wake up call"". He says the withdrawal agreement is ""surprisingly good in the circumstances"", but Brexit is not the answer to the ""fundamental social problems"" that triggered the vote to leave. He does not expect the agreement to win Parliament's approval, he says, warning that if the decision is to be returned to the people the Remain side must do better. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate Conservative MP Maggie Throup says she will be supporting the government's Brexit deal next week ""if it stays the same"". She says another referendum would be ""undemocratic"". She calls for MPs to ""end the political games, and reflect on what the consequences of rejecting this deal will be"". ""This deal is in the public interest,"" she says. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Giles Watling, who voted Remain, says he was re-elected in his leave-voting constituency because his party pledged to ""deliver on their wishes"". The government's Brexit deal ""does tick so many of the boxes"", he says - but he adds that he still has ""serious concerns"" about the backstop. ""What has been the point of the last two years of uncertainty and pain"" he asks, if the UK is ""still under the dominion the European Court of Justice"". ""Best endeavours"" to negotiate a future relationship deal are ""not cast iron"", he concludes. Â© 2025 BBC.

Growth 'stalls' as UK service sector slides,"Growth in the UK's key services sector has hit its lowest level since July 2016, prompting fears of stagnation. The purchasing managers' index (PMI) from IHS Markit/CIPS sank to 50.4 in November, down from 52.2 in October. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. ""The survey results suggest that the pace of economic growth has stalled,"" said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. The services sector accounts for about 80% of the UK economy. The last time the index was this low came in the immediate aftermath of the UK's referendum vote to leave the European Union. Earlier in the week, similar surveys of the manufacturing and construction industries were less gloomy. The manufacturing PMI showed a reading of 53.1 last month, higher than the 51.1 in October, while construction rose to 53.4 from 53.2 in October. Dharshini David, economics correspondent The service sector forms not only by far the largest part of the economy, but typically its driving force. Now that engine is close to stalling. Strip out July 2016, when  firms were grappling with the referendum result, and this survey implies activity in the service sector is growing at its slowest rate for six years. In fact, the report claims that if firms didn't have backlogs of work to tackle, activity would have contracted last month. The prolonged uncertainty over Brexit trading arrangements is part of the reason behind the inertia, but so too is weaker global demand. As the latest falls in US markets have implied, there are rising concerns that growth in America - and elsewhere - may have peaked. Whatever the future trading arrangements, businesses may find the level of external demand is more challenging. It's perhaps unsurprising that optimism among service companies is at its lowest for more than two years, and that has filtered through into hiring plans. This survey - and its counterparts for the manufacturing and construction sectors - suggests the economy may expand by as little as 0.1% this quarter, which could mean the weakest growth across 2018 as a whole in the post-crisis era. ""A contraction of service sector business activity in November was only avoided by firms working through back-orders to an extent not exceeded since 2009,"" said Mr Williamson. ""As such, unless demand revives, a slide into economic decline at the turn of the year is a distinct possibility."" Mr Williamson added that clarity in relation to Brexit arrangements was ""urgently needed to help ensure the current stalling of growth does not translate into a downturn"". Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the decline was ""the clearest indication yet that Brexit uncertainty is draining momentum from the economy"". He said predictions by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee of 0.3% economic growth for the October-to-December period now looked ""too upbeat"", adding: ""While a small fall in GDP isn't likely, no one should rule it out at this stage either."" Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, described the figure as ""thoroughly disappointing"". She added: ""Unless there is a particularly strong bounce back in December, GDP growth of 1.3% seems likely over 2018 as a whole, the weakest since the financial crisis.""

"MPs may try to steal Brexit, says Liam Fox","This video can not be played Liam Fox warns MPs 'may try to steal Brexit' There is a risk MPs could ""steal Brexit from the British people"" if Theresa May's proposed deal is rejected, a senior cabinet minister has warned. Liam Fox said there was ""natural Remain majority"" in Parliament and any attempt to overturn the 2016 referendum vote would be a ""democratic affront"". It came after MPs voted to exert more influence should the PM's deal fall. Ministers will again battle to win over MPs to Theresa May's withdrawal deal after three government defeats. Security will be the focus of the second of five days of debate in the Commons, where Tuesday's marathon session extended into the early hours. Ahead of Prime Minister's Questions at noon, the governmentpublished its Brexit legal advice,external- a move which came after MPs voted to find the government in contempt of Parliament for ignoring a Commons vote demanding publication. Parliament Live: Rolling updates Could Brexit defeats peel off some rebels? What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? BBC drops plans for Brexit TV debate Law officer says UK can cancel Brexit The PM's deal has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by the UK Parliament if it is to come into force. MPs will decide whether to reject or accept it next Tuesday, 11 December. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March, 2019. Ministers say that if MPs reject their deal they increase the chances of the UK leaving without a deal, or not leaving the EU at all. Ministers will plough on with attempts to win over MPs on Wednesday, with eight hours of debate on the security and immigration aspects of the withdrawal agreement. Meanwhile, Mrs May is expected to continue trying to convince small groups of her MPs to back the plan in private meetings. This video can not be played The moment the government lost a key vote - and was told to disclose its legal advice on Brexit Mrs May will face Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at prime minister's questions, at noon, before the Brexit debate gets under way. Senior Brexiteers in the cabinet have warned that the UK may not leave the EU if Mrs May's deal is voted down. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox suggested the PM's deal was the only way of guaranteeing the UK leaves the EU, as scheduled, on 29 March 2019. ""When you are in prison and someone offers you a key, you take it,"" he told a committee of MPs. While a no-deal exit would be ""disorderly"", he suggested the UK being kept in the EU against the will of the British people would be even more damaging. ""I think that there is a real danger that the House of Commons which has a natural remain majority may attempt to steal Brexit from British people which would be a democratic affront."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the deal on the table was in the best interests of the country. ""Everyone has to think at this momentous moment - do we want to ensure that Brexit gets over the line? Do we want to deliver on the verdict of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the European Union because if we don't back the prime minister, we risk there being no Brexit and that I think would be a fatal blow to faith in democracy."" But a former Conservative chief whip has said he expects the PM to lose the vote. Mark Harper, who backed Remain in the referendumtold the Daily Telegraph he would vote against the withdrawal agreement,external, and predicted the deal would be rejected by 80 of his party colleagues. He urged the prime minister to renegotiate the deal, insisting the current plan would leave the UK worse off. First, the government lost a bid to have the legal advice issue dealt with separately by the Privileges Committee of MPs. In a second defeat, ministers were found in contempt of parliament and forced to concede they would have to publish that advice in full, having previously argued this would break convention and was not in the national interest. This video can not be played BBC political correspondent Leila Nathoo explains how things unfolded Most significantly, the third defeat was over changes to the parliamentary process in the event that the Commons votes down Mrs May's deal. Instead of being confined to merely ""taking note"" of what the government tells them, MPs would also be able to exert more influence by voting on what they want the government to do next. This could potentially see Parliament wrest control of the Brexit process from ministers if, as expected, MPs push for a ""Plan B"" alternative to Mrs May's deal and seek to prevent any chance of Britain leaving the EU without a deal in place. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who brought the motion, told Channel 4 News it would ""allow the UK time to consider its options"", including re-starting negotiations with the EU or giving the public the final say. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""The Commons is now very likely to defeat the government again next week on the Brexit deal, at which point the country must be given a 'People's Vote', and asked to choose between the deal or remaining in the EU."" By BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg Former Remain rebels now have a possible route to get what they want if the PM's plan is rejected, as there is a possible - I emphasise the possible - way to get a vote with a majority for a Norway-style agreement or, less likely, a push for another referendum. That won't go unnoticed by Brexiteers too, who may feel (some of them at least) that Mrs May's deal might be their best bet in that case, rather than risk that softer, squidgier Brexit. It's possible therefore that Tuesday's shenanigans have made it less likely that the prime minister will face a terrible defeat next week because a few wobbly rebels on both sides might come in line. Read more from Laura This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Worth taking a moment to reflect on how we got here."" When she finally kicked off the debate about the deal itself, Mrs May insisted the UK would enjoy a ""better future"" outside the EU. She said the ""honourable compromise"" on offer was ""not the one-way street"" many had portrayed it to be and that the EU had made it clear that the agreement would not be improved on. ""I never said this deal was perfect, it was never going to be. That is the nature of a negotiation,"" she said. ""We should not let the search for a perfect Brexit prevent a good Brexit."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was a bad deal for the UK and that his party would seek a vote of no confidence in the government if it was thrown out by MPs. ""I hope and expect this House will reject that deal,"" he said. ""At that point, the government has lost the confidence of the House. Either they have to get a better deal from the EU or give way to those who will."" This video can not be played Not everyone agreed with Boris Johnson's analysis of the Brexit deal... Nigel Dodds, leader of the DUP in Westminster, said the agreement ""falls short"" of delivering Brexit ""as one United Kingdom"" and would mean entering ""a twilight world where the EU is given unprecedented powers over the UK"". Ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson dismissed the deal as a ""paint and plaster pseudo-Brexit"" and said its supporters would be ""turning their backs"" on the 17.4 million Leave voters. The leader of the SNP at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said the ""cold, hard truth"" was that the deal represented ""a moment of self-harm in our history"". ""It is not too late to turn back,"" he said. ""Fundamentally, there is no option that is going to be better for our economy, jobs, and for our communities than staying in the European Union."" However, in closing the debate shortly after 01:00 GMT on Wednesday, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay argued the deal would bring ""real changes which will improve the livelihoods of people up and down the country"".

Boohoo 'broke advertising rules',"Boohoo, the fast fashion retailer, broke Advertising Standards Authority rules with ""misleading"" promotions. The BBC's investigative programme, Watchdog Live, recorded promotions on its website that did not end after the countdown clock reached zero. Time-limited sales put pressure on consumers to buy quickly. Keeping the clock running means the time limit - and the pressure - were false. Boohoo said it was never its intention to mislead. The company said customer demand drove it to extend certain offers. Between August and November 2018, Watchdog Live recorded 14 sales advertised on Boohoo's site with a countdown clock. But after the clocks on the sale reached zero, they were reset and the offers continued. This included a Black Friday offer for 30% off ""absolutely everything"" that urged customers: ""Hurry - ends soon."" In reality, the promotion did not ending anytime soon and when the clock reached zero, it simply started again. In these cases, Watchdog Live found the clocks were misleading as the promotions were not genuinely time-limited. The ASA has previously ruled against companies found to be advertising misleading time-limited sales. It told Watchdog Live that Boohoo was breaking rules on sales promotions that it had investigated and ruled against in the past. ""The use of a countdown clock is problematic if it misleadingly implies the offer is time-limited when that is not the case,"" said the ASA, which will work with Boohoo to bring its advertising into line. A Boohoo spokesperson said ""customer demand"" led it to extending offers on a ""small number"" of time-limited promotions. ""It is never our intention to mislead customers and we take full note of the BBC Watchdog's inquiry. We are looking into our processes to ensure that further diligence is exercised in relation to future promotions of this nature,"" she said. Mary Creagh, the MP who chairs the House of Commons environmental audit committee, said psychological sales tricks such as ticking clocks helped fuel over-consumption and encouraged a throwaway society. ""Our inquiry has already uncovered a number of serious concerns about the 'fast fashion' business model and sadly it comes as no surprise that Boohoo are one of the worst offenders,"" she added. The full report on Boohoo breaking advertising rules can be seen on Watchdog Live on Wednesday 5 December at 8pm on BBC One.

Mum fears child murderer may kill again,"Elsie Urry said she was told David McGreavy would go to prison for life A man cleared for release from his sentence for killing three children and impaling their bodies on railings could strike again, their mother has said. Elsie Urry's children, Paul Ralph, four, Dawn, two, and nine-month-old Samantha were killed by David McGreavy at their Worcester home in 1973. McGreavy has been cleared for release from prison after more than 45 years. Ms Urry criticised the Parole Board for ""not listening"" and said she was told he would go to prison for life. ""Therefore, it should mean life,"" she added. Ms Urry, who now lives in Hampshire, told BBC Hereford and Worcester: ""There is nothing to say that this man won't do something like this again and I'd hate to think that anyone would have to suffer again like how I have had to suffer for the rest of my life."" She said her marriage broke down after her children were murdered and said McGreavy continues to make her suffer. ""It split up my marriage, I lost my home. I wasn't allowed to go back into my house, I had to live with that,"" added Mrs Urry, who is also known as Dorothy. ""I wasn't able to have anymore children not as I would have wanted anymore children anyway because nothing could replace those that I'd lost."" David McGreavy was sentenced to life in 1973 McGreavy, who was dubbed the ""Monster of Worcester"", was 21 at the time of the murders and was the family's lodger. He had been staying with them because he had fallen out with his parents. He strangled Paul at the home in Gillam Street, Rainbow Hill, while Dawn was found with her throat cut. Samantha died from a compound fracture to the skull. A Parole Board report said McGreavy had ""changed considerably"" over 45 years in jail. The board confirmed a panel had directed his release following an oral hearing. Robin Walker, MP for Worcester, described McGreavy as ""extremely dangerous"" and said that the Parole Board's decision should be considered with ""the utmost seriousness by government"". Mr Walker said he met with Justice Minister David Gauke earlier to request that McGreavy should never be allowed to visit the city. McGreavy killed Paul Ralph, four, and his sisters Dawn, two, and nine-month-old Samantha Ms Urry said she struggles to mix with her family and their children ""because it hurts me so much because I feel what would have been if my children would have been there"". ""I don't go to any weddings or big parties or anything because I think what might have been,"" she added. ""I just don't know how to cope with it all some days."" Triple child killer cleared for release Mum visits graves of murdered children Latest news and stories from the West Midlands A Parole Board document said a psychologist had identified that McGreavy had ""improved self-control"" and had learned to ""remain calm in stressful situations"". It also said he has ""a network of supportive friends in the community"". The three children were murdered in their home in Gillam Street, Worcester, in 1973 The possible release of McGreavy has been discussed by authorities for at least 10 years. He is currently being held at HMP Warren Hill,a Category C jail near Woodbridge in Suffolk where inmates are called ""residents"". The prison was recently rated the best in the country by the Prison Service and has a capacity of 258 men.

Commons row as Brexit legal advice published,"This video can not be played The SNP's Ian Blackford says the Brexit deal denies Scottish rights Theresa May's Brexit backstop plan risks a ""stalemate"" and ""protracted rounds of negotiations"" with the EU,the full legal advice,externalon her deal says. Newly published documents show the PM was told an arrangement designed to prevent a hard Irish border could last ""indefinitely"" and the UK could not ""lawfully exit"" without EU agreement. The Democratic Unionists said this would be ""devastating"" for the UK. But Mrs May rejected SNP claims she has misled Parliament on the issue. Ministers were forced to publish Attorney General Geoffrey Cox's full advice after ministers were found to be in contempt of Parliament on Tuesday for providing only a legal overview earlier this week. Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister said there was ""no difference"" between the two documents and the legal position on her proposed ""temporary"" customs arrangement with the EU was clear. Parliament Live: MPs debating Brexit Reality Check: Legal advice on the Brexit deal Kuenssberg: May making new enemies, not finding fans DUP 'would back Tories in confidence vote' While the UK would have no unilateral right to withdraw from the backstop - a measure designed to prevent the return of physical checks on the Irish border by the UK and EU sharing a single customs territory - she insisted neither the UK nor the EU wanted it to come into force in the first place. But the Democratic Unionists said the advice was explicit that Northern Ireland would end up subject to different EU regulatory and customs rules from the rest of the UK and be treated as a ""third country"" in terms of trade with England, Scotland and Wales. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that, amid fears Mrs May was heading for a heavy defeat in next Tuesday's vote on the final deal, there was talk among MPs about a compromise amendment being tabled on the backstop, giving Parliament some kind of check on it coming into force.

The government argued that Mr Cox's analysis of the Brexit deal, published on Monday, was adequate and disclosing his full and final advice would be against the national interest. Labour and other opposition parties said ministers had ""wilfully"" refused to comply with a binding vote in the Commons last month which demanded full disclosure and MPs agreed with this in a vote on Tuesday. In his six-page letter,externalto Mrs May, written on 13 November but published on Wednesday, Mr Cox said the ""current drafting"" of the backstop ""does not allow for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK to lawfully exit the UK wide customs union without a subsequent agreement"". ""This remains the case even if the parties are negotiating many years later and even if the parties agree that talks have clearly broken down and there is no prospect of a future relationship agreement."" MPs may try to steal Brexit, says Liam Fox No deal 'would risk public's protection' MPs may try to steal Brexit, says Liam Fox The backstop has become a defining issue for many Tory critics of the PM's deal - who say that it infringes the UK's sovereignty and will prevent the UK from being able to negotiate its own trade deals. Mr Cox said that despite assurances that the arrangement was not intended to be permanent ""in international law the protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place"". ""In the absence of a right of termination, there is a legal risk that the UK might become subject to protracted and repeated rounds of negotiations,"" he said.

The BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman When lawyers give legal advice they are expected to speak frankly. Many will conclude this advice is franker and starker than the way in which the government has presented the legal implications of the withdrawal agreement. In particular on the Northern Ireland backstop, it is there in black and white, that in the absence of an agreement replacing it, the backstop will continue indefinitely. The UK could not force the EU to conclude an agreement bringing it to an end. That punctures the government's optimism on the issue. Whereas Article 50 allowed the UK to pull out of the EU, there is no provision for the UK to pull out of the withdrawal agreement. That will pour petrol on the flames of the political debate. Reality Check: Legal advice on the Brexit deal Kuenssberg: May making new enemies, not finding fans The prime minister has insisted there can be no Brexit deal without a backstop of some kind to protect commitments made to Northern Ireland in the Good Friday Agreement. But she came under fire at Prime Minister's Questions from the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford. ""The legal advice is clear,"" he said. ""It states: despite statements in the protocol it is not permanent, in international law the protocol would endure indefinitely. Since the prime minister returned from Brussels with her deal, the prime minister has been misleading the House inadvertently or otherwise. ""Is it time that the prime minister took responsibility for concealing the facts on her Brexit deal from members in this House and the public? The PM told MPs all the material published in the past few days was consistent. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict What do the Commons defeats mean for Brexit? What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? She said she had made it clear that the UK could not unilaterally leave the backstop plan, so had not been at odds with the legal advice, which made it clear the UK had no sovereign right to withdraw. But she insisted the arrangement would, if it came into force, give the UK a number of competitive advantages and therefore the EU would not want the UK ""to be in it any longer than necessary"".

""Let's just get rid of this nightmarish system that keeps us effectively clamped in the EU, and really stopping Brexit from taking place,"" he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg.

Could defeats peel off rebels?,"A busy day in the Commons for MPs - and Theresa May Down is up. Up is down. Black is white. And white is black. Friend is foe. Foe is friend. Stop me now, or else I'll go on forever. But the point is this - the prime minister has had a terrible day today as the government made history in two excruciating ways. Ministers were found to be in contempt of Parliament - a very serious telling off - and the government had a hat trick of defeats - the first time since the 1970s that's happened. As you'd expect too, MP after MP after MP rose after Theresa May's remarks to slam her deal as Tory divisions were played out on the green benches, with harsh words exchanged. But in this topsy-turvy world, the overall outcome of the day for Mrs May's big test a week tonight might have been not all bad. Three defeats for May in Commons Brexit fight Can the government avoid Brexit defeat? How MPs Brexit debate and vote will work The amendment from Tory Remain rebel Dominic Grieve is, on the face of it, a strait jacket for Mrs May - a way that MPs can more easily push the government around. So far, so disaster. Except it could actually peel off some rebels on both sides... possibly. Former Remain rebels now have a possible route to get what they want if the PM's plan is rejected, as there is a possible - I emphasise the possible - way to get a vote with a majority for a Norway-style agreement or, less likely, a push for another referendum. That won't go unnoticed by Brexiteers too, who may feel (some of them at least) that Mrs May's deal might be their best bet in that case, rather than risk that softer, squidgier Brexit. It's possible therefore that today's shenanigans have made it less likely that the prime minister will face a terrible defeat next week because a few wobbly rebels on both sides might come in line. It's also worth noting the involvement of several former, normally loyal, cabinet ministers such as Sir Oliver Letwin. He has often been used as a fixer by the chief whip, whispers suggest. It's perfectly possible that his moves today are completely unrelated. But also not impossible that somehow today's result has been influenced by conversations about finding the prime minister a softer landing. Suggestions there was any kind of collusion were described as something that's too rude to write here. But nothing much happens around here at the moment without motive and suspicion being questioned. Three defeats for May in Commons Brexit fight Can the government avoid Brexit defeat?

"Commons row as Brexit legal advice publishedThe SNP accuses Theresa May of ""misleading Parliament, inadvertently or otherwise"".UK Politics","This video can not be played The SNP's Ian Blackford says the Brexit deal denies Scottish rights Theresa May's Brexit backstop plan risks a ""stalemate"" and ""protracted rounds of negotiations"" with the EU,the full legal advice,externalon her deal says. Newly published documents show the PM was told an arrangement designed to prevent a hard Irish border could last ""indefinitely"" and the UK could not ""lawfully exit"" without EU agreement. The Democratic Unionists said this would be ""devastating"" for the UK. But Mrs May rejected SNP claims she has misled Parliament on the issue. Ministers were forced to publish Attorney General Geoffrey Cox's full advice after ministers were found to be in contempt of Parliament on Tuesday for providing only a legal overview earlier this week. Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister said there was ""no difference"" between the two documents and the legal position on her proposed ""temporary"" customs arrangement with the EU was clear. Parliament Live: MPs debating Brexit Reality Check: Legal advice on the Brexit deal Kuenssberg: May making new enemies, not finding fans DUP 'would back Tories in confidence vote' While the UK would have no unilateral right to withdraw from the backstop - a measure designed to prevent the return of physical checks on the Irish border by the UK and EU sharing a single customs territory - she insisted neither the UK nor the EU wanted it to come into force in the first place. But the Democratic Unionists said the advice was explicit that Northern Ireland would end up subject to different EU regulatory and customs rules from the rest of the UK and be treated as a ""third country"" in terms of trade with England, Scotland and Wales. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that, amid fears Mrs May was heading for a heavy defeat in next Tuesday's vote on the final deal, there was talk among MPs about a compromise amendment being tabled on the backstop, giving Parliament some kind of check on it coming into force.

"MPs may try to steal Brexit, says Liam FoxThe international trade secretary says it would be a ""democratic affront"" if MPs stop Brexit.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Liam Fox warns MPs 'may try to steal Brexit' There is a risk MPs could ""steal Brexit from the British people"" if Theresa May's proposed deal is rejected, a senior cabinet minister has warned. Liam Fox said there was ""natural Remain majority"" in Parliament and any attempt to overturn the 2016 referendum vote would be a ""democratic affront"". It came after MPs voted to exert more influence should the PM's deal fall. Ministers will again battle to win over MPs to Theresa May's withdrawal deal after three government defeats. Security will be the focus of the second of five days of debate in the Commons, where Tuesday's marathon session extended into the early hours. Ahead of Prime Minister's Questions at noon, the governmentpublished its Brexit legal advice,external- a move which came after MPs voted to find the government in contempt of Parliament for ignoring a Commons vote demanding publication. Parliament Live: Rolling updates Could Brexit defeats peel off some rebels? What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? BBC drops plans for Brexit TV debate Law officer says UK can cancel Brexit The PM's deal has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by the UK Parliament if it is to come into force. MPs will decide whether to reject or accept it next Tuesday, 11 December. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March, 2019. Ministers say that if MPs reject their deal they increase the chances of the UK leaving without a deal, or not leaving the EU at all. Ministers will plough on with attempts to win over MPs on Wednesday, with eight hours of debate on the security and immigration aspects of the withdrawal agreement. Meanwhile, Mrs May is expected to continue trying to convince small groups of her MPs to back the plan in private meetings. This video can not be played The moment the government lost a key vote - and was told to disclose its legal advice on Brexit Mrs May will face Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at prime minister's questions, at noon, before the Brexit debate gets under way. Senior Brexiteers in the cabinet have warned that the UK may not leave the EU if Mrs May's deal is voted down. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox suggested the PM's deal was the only way of guaranteeing the UK leaves the EU, as scheduled, on 29 March 2019. ""When you are in prison and someone offers you a key, you take it,"" he told a committee of MPs. While a no-deal exit would be ""disorderly"", he suggested the UK being kept in the EU against the will of the British people would be even more damaging. ""I think that there is a real danger that the House of Commons which has a natural remain majority may attempt to steal Brexit from British people which would be a democratic affront."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the deal on the table was in the best interests of the country. ""Everyone has to think at this momentous moment - do we want to ensure that Brexit gets over the line? Do we want to deliver on the verdict of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the European Union because if we don't back the prime minister, we risk there being no Brexit and that I think would be a fatal blow to faith in democracy."" But a former Conservative chief whip has said he expects the PM to lose the vote. Mark Harper, who backed Remain in the referendumtold the Daily Telegraph he would vote against the withdrawal agreement,external, and predicted the deal would be rejected by 80 of his party colleagues. He urged the prime minister to renegotiate the deal, insisting the current plan would leave the UK worse off. First, the government lost a bid to have the legal advice issue dealt with separately by the Privileges Committee of MPs. In a second defeat, ministers were found in contempt of parliament and forced to concede they would have to publish that advice in full, having previously argued this would break convention and was not in the national interest. This video can not be played BBC political correspondent Leila Nathoo explains how things unfolded Most significantly, the third defeat was over changes to the parliamentary process in the event that the Commons votes down Mrs May's deal. Instead of being confined to merely ""taking note"" of what the government tells them, MPs would also be able to exert more influence by voting on what they want the government to do next. This could potentially see Parliament wrest control of the Brexit process from ministers if, as expected, MPs push for a ""Plan B"" alternative to Mrs May's deal and seek to prevent any chance of Britain leaving the EU without a deal in place. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who brought the motion, told Channel 4 News it would ""allow the UK time to consider its options"", including re-starting negotiations with the EU or giving the public the final say. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""The Commons is now very likely to defeat the government again next week on the Brexit deal, at which point the country must be given a 'People's Vote', and asked to choose between the deal or remaining in the EU."" By BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg Former Remain rebels now have a possible route to get what they want if the PM's plan is rejected, as there is a possible - I emphasise the possible - way to get a vote with a majority for a Norway-style agreement or, less likely, a push for another referendum.

Read more from Laura This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Worth taking a moment to reflect on how we got here."" When she finally kicked off the debate about the deal itself, Mrs May insisted the UK would enjoy a ""better future"" outside the EU. She said the ""honourable compromise"" on offer was ""not the one-way street"" many had portrayed it to be and that the EU had made it clear that the agreement would not be improved on. ""I never said this deal was perfect, it was never going to be. That is the nature of a negotiation,"" she said. ""We should not let the search for a perfect Brexit prevent a good Brexit."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was a bad deal for the UK and that his party would seek a vote of no confidence in the government if it was thrown out by MPs. ""I hope and expect this House will reject that deal,"" he said. ""At that point, the government has lost the confidence of the House. Either they have to get a better deal from the EU or give way to those who will."" This video can not be played Not everyone agreed with Boris Johnson's analysis of the Brexit deal... Nigel Dodds, leader of the DUP in Westminster, said the agreement ""falls short"" of delivering Brexit ""as one United Kingdom"" and would mean entering ""a twilight world where the EU is given unprecedented powers over the UK"". Ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson dismissed the deal as a ""paint and plaster pseudo-Brexit"" and said its supporters would be ""turning their backs"" on the 17.4 million Leave voters. The leader of the SNP at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said the ""cold, hard truth"" was that the deal represented ""a moment of self-harm in our history"". ""It is not too late to turn back,"" he said. ""Fundamentally, there is no option that is going to be better for our economy, jobs, and for our communities than staying in the European Union."" However, in closing the debate shortly after 01:00 GMT on Wednesday, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay argued the deal would bring ""real changes which will improve the livelihoods of people up and down the country"".

Ex-Trump aide 'helpful' to Russia probe,"Michael Flynn has admitted one count of lying to the FBI The special counsel investigating alleged Russian collusion in the 2016 US election will not be pursuing a jail sentence for former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mr Flynn has admitted lying to the FBI. But in a memo, Robert Mueller said Mr Flynn had provided ""substantial"" details about links between the Trump election team and Russian officials. The heavily redacted memo hints at future revelations in a criminal probe that could trouble Donald Trump. President Trump has called the investigation a witch hunt and denies there was any collusion between his team and Russian officials to try to secure his election victory. Five big things Mueller is looking at Trump Russia: The saga in 250 words The sentencing memo released on Tuesday advising that Mr Flynn should not be imprisoned could have further implications in the ongoing investigation, should other senior members of Mr Trump's team be called upon to co-operate with additional statements. Mr Flynn is due to be sentenced in the US District Court for the District of Columbia on 18 December. Mr Mueller's office released the memo as guidance to the judge,externalwho will sentence Mr Flynn, the only member of the Trump administration so far to plead guilty as a result of the collusion investigation. Michael Flynn: Former US national security adviser Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Mr Flynn has pleaded guilty to one count of making materially false statements to the FBI. He admitted that he discussed lifting US sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to Washington before Mr Trump took office, and that he lied to the US vice-president about that conversation. It says Mr Flynn has been interviewed 19 times, providing assistance in multiple investigations. This included giving information on co-ordination between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. Robert Mueller's investigation has been described as a witch hunt by the president Consequently, it says: ""A sentence at the low end of the guideline range - including a sentence that does not impose a term of incarceration - is appropriate and warranted."" It points to Mr Flynn's ""exemplary"" military and public service and that he ""deserves credit for accepting responsibility in a timely fashion and substantially assisting the government"". It had been thought details of Russian collusion might be included in the memo but the document says that, due to the ""sensitive information about ongoing investigations"", certain aspects have been sealed. An addendum to the memo on Mr Flynn's assistance,externalis heavily redacted. But it does say Mr Flynn provided ""first-hand information about the content and context of interactions between the transition team and Russian government officials"" - clearly part of the ongoing investigation. And then there is this intriguing element. In one section there is the simple sentence ""the defendant has provided substantial assistance in a criminal investigation"" but everything below it is blacked out. Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Michael Flynn may end up not spending a day in prison for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials during the Trump presidential transition. Part of the reason is because of his clean record prior to this offence. The other part could cause Donald Trump and those close to him sleepless nights in the days ahead. In an addendum to the sentencing memo, Robert Mueller details the help Mr Flynn provided to his investigation in exchange for a lenient sentence. Some of it is old news. The former national security advisor told Mr Mueller ""first-hand"" about his communications with Russians after Mr Trump's election - and similar communications by others in the transition team. Buried beneath thick black lines below this ""useful information"" is an entire section on further help Mr Flynn provided to Mr Mueller's collusion investigation. Even the subhead appears to be redacted. Then there's a mysterious ""criminal investigation"" to which Mr Flynn provided ""substantial assistance"". That portion of the memo, without a few introductory words, is entirely redacted. Who is being investigated? And what type of criminal wrongdoing is suspected? The Flynn document raises as many questions as it answers - and points toward explosive revelations to come. He had been a fervent supporter of Mr Trump during the election campaign and was appointed Mr Trump's national security adviser even though former President Barack Obama had warned against the appointment. It was a short tenure, ending in February 2017 after just 23 days, his departure forced by the revelation he had lied to Vice-President Mike Pence about the discussion with then-Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Further allegations then arose over a failure to disclose payments from Russian and Turkish lobbyists that he was given for speeches and consulting work. The retired US Army three-star lieutenant-general had earlier led the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) but was fired, on the surface for comments about Islamist extremism, although insiders also pointed to his unpopular overhaul of the agency. Yes, although not on charges related to collusion with Russia. Mr Trump's former deputy campaign manager,Rick Gates, has admitted conspiracy and lying to investigators.

"Breaking|Breaking newsBrexit full legal advice publishedGovernment publishes Brexit legal advice in full, the day after MPs found it in contempt of UK parliamentUK Politics","This video can not be played The SNP's Ian Blackford says the Brexit deal denies Scottish rights Theresa May's Brexit backstop plan risks a ""stalemate"" and ""protracted rounds of negotiations"" with the EU,the full legal advice,externalon her deal says. Newly published documents show the PM was told an arrangement designed to prevent a hard Irish border could last ""indefinitely"" and the UK could not ""lawfully exit"" without EU agreement. The Democratic Unionists said this would be ""devastating"" for the UK. But Mrs May rejected SNP claims she has misled Parliament on the issue. Ministers were forced to publish Attorney General Geoffrey Cox's full advice after ministers were found to be in contempt of Parliament on Tuesday for providing only a legal overview earlier this week. Speaking in the Commons, the prime minister said there was ""no difference"" between the two documents and the legal position on her proposed ""temporary"" customs arrangement with the EU was clear. Parliament Live: MPs debating Brexit Reality Check: Legal advice on the Brexit deal Kuenssberg: May making new enemies, not finding fans DUP 'would back Tories in confidence vote' While the UK would have no unilateral right to withdraw from the backstop - a measure designed to prevent the return of physical checks on the Irish border by the UK and EU sharing a single customs territory - she insisted neither the UK nor the EU wanted it to come into force in the first place. But the Democratic Unionists said the advice was explicit that Northern Ireland would end up subject to different EU regulatory and customs rules from the rest of the UK and be treated as a ""third country"" in terms of trade with England, Scotland and Wales. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said that, amid fears Mrs May was heading for a heavy defeat in next Tuesday's vote on the final deal, there was talk among MPs about a compromise amendment being tabled on the backstop, giving Parliament some kind of check on it coming into force.

The government argued that Mr Cox's analysis of the Brexit deal, published on Monday, was adequate and disclosing his full and final advice would be against the national interest. Labour and other opposition parties said ministers had ""wilfully"" refused to comply with a binding vote in the Commons last month which demanded full disclosure and MPs agreed with this in a vote on Tuesday. In his six-page letter,externalto Mrs May, written on 13 November but published on Wednesday, Mr Cox said the ""current drafting"" of the backstop ""does not allow for a mechanism that is likely to enable the UK to lawfully exit the UK wide customs union without a subsequent agreement"". ""This remains the case even if the parties are negotiating many years later and even if the parties agree that talks have clearly broken down and there is no prospect of a future relationship agreement."" MPs may try to steal Brexit, says Liam Fox No deal 'would risk public's protection' MPs may try to steal Brexit, says Liam Fox The backstop has become a defining issue for many Tory critics of the PM's deal - who say that it infringes the UK's sovereignty and will prevent the UK from being able to negotiate its own trade deals. Mr Cox said that despite assurances that the arrangement was not intended to be permanent ""in international law the protocol would endure indefinitely until a superseding agreement took its place"". ""In the absence of a right of termination, there is a legal risk that the UK might become subject to protracted and repeated rounds of negotiations,"" he said. ""The resolution of such a stalemate would have to be political."" However, he also put forward the case that the ""risk"" of getting entangled in the backstop had to be weighed ""against the political and economic imperative of both sides to reach an agreement that constitutes a politically stable and permanent basis for their future relationship"". The BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman When lawyers give legal advice they are expected to speak frankly. Many will conclude this advice is franker and starker than the way in which the government has presented the legal implications of the withdrawal agreement. In particular on the Northern Ireland backstop, it is there in black and white, that in the absence of an agreement replacing it, the backstop will continue indefinitely. The UK could not force the EU to conclude an agreement bringing it to an end. That punctures the government's optimism on the issue. Whereas Article 50 allowed the UK to pull out of the EU, there is no provision for the UK to pull out of the withdrawal agreement. That will pour petrol on the flames of the political debate. Reality Check: Legal advice on the Brexit deal Kuenssberg: May making new enemies, not finding fans The prime minister has insisted there can be no Brexit deal without a backstop of some kind to protect commitments made to Northern Ireland in the Good Friday Agreement. But she came under fire at Prime Minister's Questions from the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford. ""The legal advice is clear,"" he said. ""It states: despite statements in the protocol it is not permanent, in international law the protocol would endure indefinitely. Since the prime minister returned from Brussels with her deal, the prime minister has been misleading the House inadvertently or otherwise. ""Is it time that the prime minister took responsibility for concealing the facts on her Brexit deal from members in this House and the public? The PM told MPs all the material published in the past few days was consistent. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict What do the Commons defeats mean for Brexit? What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? She said she had made it clear that the UK could not unilaterally leave the backstop plan, so had not been at odds with the legal advice, which made it clear the UK had no sovereign right to withdraw. But she insisted the arrangement would, if it came into force, give the UK a number of competitive advantages and therefore the EU would not want the UK ""to be in it any longer than necessary"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: EU makes 'predatory claim' on Northern Ireland But the DUP's Sammy Wilson said other EU members would use the backstop as a ""cudgel"" to obtain concessions from the UK in future trade talks. And former foreign secretary Boris Johnson suggested the backstop could easily be dispensed with as it was ""not essential"" to the wider deal and everybody believed ""you can solve this without a hard border"". ""Let's just get rid of this nightmarish system that keeps us effectively clamped in the EU, and really stopping Brexit from taking place,"" he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg. Labour said the legal advice showed the ""central weakness"" of the PM's Brexit deal while the Lib Dems said it would leave the UK trapped in a ""Brexit hamster wheel"". This video can not be played Sam Gyimah: Brexit negotiations have been set up for failure The second of five days of debate on Mrs May's Brexit agreement is under way, focusing on security and immigration. The government suffered three embarrassing defeats on Tuesday, on the role that MPs will play if Mrs May's deal is rejected as well as the disclosure of the legal advice. Ex-defence secretary Sir Michael Fallon told MPs he could not support Mrs May's deal, saying it was too much of a ""gamble"" to sign up to EU rules when the UK did not know what it was getting in return. ""We put all our cards and all our money on the table and we wait for another two years for the EU to set the rules of the game. That is a risk too far"". But Chancellor Philip Hammond warned that if the deal was rejected, either the UK could end up leaving without a deal or Brexit could unravel entirely, leaving ""half the nation feeling betrayed"". ""I take the judgement that when there is a deal on the table that has very, very modest costs to the economy, which will allow us to move on as a nation both economically and politically, I judge that even narrowly, economically that will be in the best interests of the country,"" he told the Treasury committee. Earlier, International Trade Secretary Liam Fox warned there was a risk of Parliament trying to ""steal Brexit from the British people"". He said there was a ""natural Remain majority"" in Parliament and that any attempts to delay the UK's departure or overturn the 2016 referendum result would be a ""democratic affront"".

Dry summer leads to subsidence surge,"The hot summer led to a huge surge in subsidence problems as British homes suffered in the dry heat. Insurers said claims between July and September were at the highest level for 12 years, reaching numbers last seen in the heatwaves of 2006 and 2003. More than 10,000 households made claims worth Â£64m, but experts told homeowners not to panic if cracks appear. ""There are many reasons why cracks may have occurred,"" said Laura Hughes of the Association of British Insurers. The worst hit was south-eastern England, where buildings are well-known for being constructed on subsidence-prone clay soil. Subsidence happens when the ground beneath a building loses moisture and shrinks. It can be caused by several factors, including prolonged dry spells that cause soil to lose water, as well as trees and shrubs which can absorb significant volumes of water from the soil. Clay soils in particular are seen as vulnerable, while leaking underground pipes because of problems with drains and water mains can also cause soil to soften. The good news for victims is that it is normally covered by buildings insurance. Laura Hughes said: ""Insurers understand that this is a stressful time for affected homeowners and are providing widespread support to help with repairs. ""Get in touch with your insurer if you believe your home is experiencing subsidence and they'll be on hand with the best expertise and the best technology."" Car and house insurance faces price probe Consumer loyalty 'rip off' faces probe Insurers 'penalising' loyal customers Subsidence warning signs can include cracks suddenly emerging in properties, perhaps around doors and windows, and often appearing thicker than a 10p coin. The 10,000 claims between July and September were about four times the 2,500 claims seen during the previous quarter, when the total value was Â£14m. The ABI said the 357% increase in the value of claims was the highest quarterly jump since records started more than 25 years ago. There is no typical approach to subsidence repairs, as this depends on the building, the circumstances and the severity of individual cases, the ABI said. Extreme weather also prompted a surge in insurance claims earlier in 2018. The Beast from the East and Storm Emma caused widespread disruption in late February and March and led to property insurers paying out a record-breaking Â£194m in burst pipe claims in the first quarter of the year. Here are the ABI's tips for spotting the potential signs of subsidence, rather than just general wear and tear to buildings: Subsidence cracks usually appear very suddenly, rather than gradually. They are usually diagonal, and wider at the top than the bottom. They tend to be thicker than a 10p coin. They are often found around doors and windows. Subsidence may also cause dry wallpaper to rip or crinkle. Meanwhile, insurance giant Aviva has responded to a Competition and Markets Authority inquiry into so-called ""loyalty penalties"" by introducing a new type of ""subscription-style"" cover. AvivaPlus will be rolled out over the next few weeks and will have a renewal price guarantee to ensure existing customers are offered a price that matches or betters that quoted for an equivalent new customer. The CMA acted after receiving a super-complaint from Citizens Advice in September about long-term customers overpaying for key services such as household insurance, broadband and savings accounts.

Brexit officially happened on 31 January but the UK is now in a transition period until the end of 2020. Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. Members of Parliament (MPs) will vote next week on the Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated. Sir Graham Brady ""would welcome"" a delay in the Brexit vote if it would help resolve MPs' concerns. House of CommonsParliament That's it for our coverage today, as MPs complete their third day of debate on the withdrawal agreement. Tory MP Sir Hugo Swire is now introducing his adjournment debate on the illegal trade in seahorses in the UK. MPs are due to continue their debate on the Brexit deal on Monday afternoon. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament International Trade Secretary Liam Fox says the ""status quo has never been on offer"" as the EU ""wants an ever closer union"". ""We have to find a compromise that makes this workable,"" he says, adding: ""the withdrawal agreement achieves just that, and is the only deal on the table"". DUP MP Ian Paisley intervenes to says the ""gallows are being built"" for the deal ahead of Tuesday's planned vote - and asks if there have been discussions about delaying it. Liam Fox replies says ministers will ""continue to make the case"" for the deal, but adds: ""the government will want to talk to members, of course it will want to look to ways to give a reassurance"". He says ""I understand why MPs have concerns about the backstop, but it is clear that it is there to be a temporary measure"". Liam Fox says Labour is ""playing politics at a time of great national decision-making"", and their Brexit policy is ""ill-researched and delusional"". He says that by agreeing to hold to the referendum, Parliament ""sub-contracted its sovereignty"" to voters, and MPs must now ""live up to our side of the bargain"".  Allow Twitter content?

Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Winding up the debate for Labour, shadow international trade minister Barry Gardiner says the government has ""tried to exclude Parliament from the process at all stages"". ""This is a deal that members on all sides now believe is not in the best interest of the country,"" he says. Mr Gardiner says the UK will be ""much poorer than we otherwise would be"" under the government's agreement. He calls on Liam Fox to be ""yet more flexible still"" on the next steps for Brexit, and ""recall his own words"" given to a Sunday newspaper in 2012. Back then, he says, Mr Fox called for the UK to renegotiate a ""new relationship"" with the EU, based on ""an economic partnership involving a customs union and the single market in goods and services"". ""The secretary of state may not like it, but it sounds an awful lot like Labour party policy to me"", he adds. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Like other MPs today, the DUP's Jim Shannon picks up on the proposed 'backstop' plan for the Irish border in the government's deal. He says there is ""no legal form for leaving this international treaty without consent"", adding that this is ""not acceptable"". He says the people of Northern Ireland must stand up for themselves and he has ""a mistrust for the government at this time"". ""The government have voted for Northern Ireland to become a voiceless victim of the UK,"" he concludes. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Next up this evening is Labour MP Karen Lee - who was a Remainer in 2016 but her constituency of Lincoln voted to leave. She ""sincerely believes"" there is a Brexit deal that will benefit her constituents, she says. ""But this deal will not protect jobs, workplace rights or environmental standards, and it will inhibit business by failing to ensure frictionless trade"", she adds. ""We can renegotiate with the EU - or better still, hold a general election"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Vicky Ford - who used to be member of the European Parliament and voted Remain - says MPs need to respect the vote to leave. ""A second referendum would be even more divisive and no more decisive,"" she adds. Ms Ford says leaving the EU with no deal poses ""a huge risk"" and the withdrawal agreement helps real businesses remain secure and offers time to develop a future framework. She calls Labour's plan of ""a close relationship with the single market without being in it"" a ""fantasy land"". Ms Ford says the backstop plan is not a ""practical risk"", as remaining in the arrangement permanently ""is not in the EU's interest"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Andrew Bowie says many of his colleagues on the Conservative benches are still ""struggling to come to a conclusion"" on which way they will vote. He adds that he voted to leave the EU ""and supports the deal"". Mr Bowie says he backs the agreement ""as it is the best for business, his constituents and Scotland"". ""I believe this deal is better than what we have now,"" he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Dame Louise Ellman says the deal provides no certainty and there is no guarantee that a better one could be negotiated. Leaving without a deal on the other hand is not an option, she adds. The only other option is that MPs go back to the people and tell them the truth that ""we cannot leave the club and expect to keep all the benefits"". ""That is mission impossible"", she says. ""It is time for a people's vote"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Lee Rowley says ""we are arguing over commas in this deal, when whole paragraphs of it do not work"", and for this reason he will not be backing the deal. ""I did not come to this place to make people poorer,"" he says. ""I cannot go back to my constituents and say this deal gives them Brexit - it does not"". He says he disagrees with the deal as it is ""a failure of nerve and ambition"", and calls for it to be stopped. Mr Rowley calls on the government ""to move the UK out of its shadow"" and ""get Brexit back on track"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi says the Brexitlegal advicepublished this week shows Northern Ireland ""has been sold out"". The Brexit process has been ""blurred, botched and bungled from the very start"", he adds. Mr Singh Dhesi says the prime minister is ""not up to the task"" and ""has created division and discord"". The Conservatives must ""stand aside"" to allow a general election, he concludes. House of LordsParliament The debate on the government's Brexit deal has ended - and business in the House of Lords for today comes to an end. Peers will resume the debate on Monday. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of LordsParliament Wrapping up the Lords debate, Tory peer Lord Horam says the referendum result was ""a wake up call"". He says the withdrawal agreement is ""surprisingly good in the circumstances"", but Brexit is not the answer to the ""fundamental social problems"" that triggered the vote to leave. He does not expect the agreement to win Parliament's approval, he says, warning that if the decision is to be returned to the people the Remain side must do better. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate Conservative MP Maggie Throup says she will be supporting the government's Brexit deal next week ""if it stays the same"". She says another referendum would be ""undemocratic"". She calls for MPs to ""end the political games, and reflect on what the consequences of rejecting this deal will be"". ""This deal is in the public interest,"" she says. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Giles Watling, who voted Remain, says he was re-elected in his leave-voting constituency because his party pledged to ""deliver on their wishes"". The government's Brexit deal ""does tick so many of the boxes"", he says - but he adds that he still has ""serious concerns"" about the backstop. ""What has been the point of the last two years of uncertainty and pain"" he asks, if the UK is ""still under the dominion the European Court of Justice"". ""Best endeavours"" to negotiate a future relationship deal are ""not cast iron"", he concludes. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Dry summer leads to subsidence surgeMore than 10,000 households made subsidence claims worth ÃÂ£64m, the highest level for 12 years.Business","The hot summer led to a huge surge in subsidence problems as British homes suffered in the dry heat. Insurers said claims between July and September were at the highest level for 12 years, reaching numbers last seen in the heatwaves of 2006 and 2003. More than 10,000 households made claims worth Â£64m, but experts told homeowners not to panic if cracks appear. ""There are many reasons why cracks may have occurred,"" said Laura Hughes of the Association of British Insurers. The worst hit was south-eastern England, where buildings are well-known for being constructed on subsidence-prone clay soil. Subsidence happens when the ground beneath a building loses moisture and shrinks. It can be caused by several factors, including prolonged dry spells that cause soil to lose water, as well as trees and shrubs which can absorb significant volumes of water from the soil. Clay soils in particular are seen as vulnerable, while leaking underground pipes because of problems with drains and water mains can also cause soil to soften. The good news for victims is that it is normally covered by buildings insurance. Laura Hughes said: ""Insurers understand that this is a stressful time for affected homeowners and are providing widespread support to help with repairs. ""Get in touch with your insurer if you believe your home is experiencing subsidence and they'll be on hand with the best expertise and the best technology."" Car and house insurance faces price probe Consumer loyalty 'rip off' faces probe Insurers 'penalising' loyal customers Subsidence warning signs can include cracks suddenly emerging in properties, perhaps around doors and windows, and often appearing thicker than a 10p coin. The 10,000 claims between July and September were about four times the 2,500 claims seen during the previous quarter, when the total value was Â£14m. The ABI said the 357% increase in the value of claims was the highest quarterly jump since records started more than 25 years ago. There is no typical approach to subsidence repairs, as this depends on the building, the circumstances and the severity of individual cases, the ABI said. Extreme weather also prompted a surge in insurance claims earlier in 2018. The Beast from the East and Storm Emma caused widespread disruption in late February and March and led to property insurers paying out a record-breaking Â£194m in burst pipe claims in the first quarter of the year. Here are the ABI's tips for spotting the potential signs of subsidence, rather than just general wear and tear to buildings: Subsidence cracks usually appear very suddenly, rather than gradually. They are usually diagonal, and wider at the top than the bottom. They tend to be thicker than a 10p coin. They are often found around doors and windows. Subsidence may also cause dry wallpaper to rip or crinkle. Meanwhile, insurance giant Aviva has responded to a Competition and Markets Authority inquiry into so-called ""loyalty penalties"" by introducing a new type of ""subscription-style"" cover. AvivaPlus will be rolled out over the next few weeks and will have a renewal price guarantee to ensure existing customers are offered a price that matches or betters that quoted for an equivalent new customer. The CMA acted after receiving a super-complaint from Citizens Advice in September about long-term customers overpaying for key services such as household insurance, broadband and savings accounts.

New Caledonia tsunami alert lifted,"A tsunami warning in New Caledonia - triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Pacific - has now been lifted. There have been no reports of injuries or damage in the French overseas territory, officials say. Earlier, residents had been urged to go to shelters, following the 7.5 magnitude quake close to New Caledonia. New Caledonia - with a population of about 270,000 - is part of the Pacific's ""Ring of Fire"", where many earthquakes occur. The quake struck at a depth of 10km at 04:18 GMT, with its epicentre 168km (104 miles) east-south-east of Tadine, a town on one of New Caledonia's Loyalty Islands. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center,externalearlier said that some tsunami waves had been observed. It had said waves 1m to 3m (3.3ft to 9.8ft) above tide level were possible along the coasts of New Caledonia and Vanuatu, with waves of 0.3m to 1m above tide level for coasts of Fiji. New Zealand's ministry of civil defence and emergency management tweeted that there was no tsunami threat to the nation's coasts. The US Geological Survey (USGS) also recorded a series of aftershocks,external, two of them at 5.9 magnitude. New Caledonia profile The Ring of Fire refers to a string of volcanoes, earthquake sites and tectonic plates around the Pacific. It spreads across 40,000km (25,000 miles) from the southern tip of South America all the way to New Zealand. On Saturday,a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Alaska, causing people to run from buildings and briefly prompting a tsunami alert for coastal areas. In October,a tsunami struck Palu in Indonesiafollowing a 7.5 magnitude quake, killing more than 1,000 people.

Husband in podcast-famous mystery arrested,"Lynette Dawson's disappearance has been given wider attention by a popular podcast Australian police have arrested the husband of a Sydney woman whose disappearance in 1982 has been the subject of a popular crime podcast. Chris Dawson, 70, is to be charged with murdering Lynette Dawson, New South Wales (NSW) authorities said. Mr Dawson has denied killing Mrs Dawson, with whom he has two children. He has said that she abandoned the family for a religious group. A podcast, The Teacher's Pet, brought global attention to the case this year. Police arrested Mr Dawson in Queensland and said he would be extradited to NSW. Mrs Dawson's brother, Greg Simms, said he was ""ecstatic"" about the development. ""We've always been determined to find the truth and that's the reason why we've fought to keep Lyn's name alive,"" he told Nine News. Lynette Dawson, a mother of two, was last seen in 1982 Two separate inquests have recommended for murder charges to be laid against a ""known person"". However, prosecutors have previously said there was insufficient evidence to lay charges. No trace of Mrs Dawson has ever been found. A search of the family's former home in Sydneyearlier this year failed to turn up new evidence. Podcast-famous mystery dig draws a blank However, police said the arrest followed three years of renewed investigations. ""We are confident with the case,"" Supt Scott Cook told reporters on Wednesday. ""We won't give up on trying to identify the whereabouts of Lynette Dawson, but, from our perspective, it is not crucial to finalising the matter."" Chris Dawson was taken into custody on Wednesday An inquest in 2003 found that Mr Dawson, a former high school teacher and rugby league star, had engaged in sexual relationships with teenage students during his marriage. One 16-year-old girl moved in to the family home within days of Mrs Dawson's disappearance. The pair later married, but have since separated. Why 2018 is the year of the 'podcast boom' Are podcasts breaking through to the mainstream? Since May, more than 27 million people have listened to The Teacher's Pet podcast, which is produced by The Australian newspaper. It has highlighted the bungled handling of Mrs Dawson's case by police in the early years after her disappearance, prompting a recent apology from the state's police commissioner.

'Scrooge' school Christmas back on cards,"The school's RE teacher said the true meaning of Christmas had been buried under ""an avalanche of commercialisation"" A school that threatened to ban Christmas has been persuaded to reinstate it by ""thoughtful"" pupils. Lady Lumley's School in Pickering, North Yorkshire, previously told pupils it would ban all festive activities. RE teacher Chris Paul said ""an avalanche of commercialisation"" had robbed the season of its meaning. But after hundreds of emails and letters ""making a strong case"" for jingling the bells and bringing back the baubles, the school relented. Mrs Paul had challenged pupils to consider the true meaning of Christmas and come up with answers to persuade her to change her mind. Since throwing down the challenge, the school said it had received more than 500 emails and letters. Yorkshire breaking news: More stories for you Head teacher Richard Bramley said: ""Those students who really thought about the situation and challenged the decision appropriately created the change and brought back Christmas. ""I hope they and everyone else has a good Christmas."" Some parents criticised the school for going too far and ""stealing Christmas"" He said the challenge was to make students consider the way in which society celebrates Christmas and think about the social problems that arise around this time. ""Students were asked to challenge the status quo; to ask 'why should we do things just because we have always done them?' and... to question whether non-religious people should celebrate a religious festival?"" Boy, eight, creates Santa's grotto to help hospital that saved his brother Santa must be a man, Great Aycliffe councillors rule Oxfordshire school introduces Â£50 cap for teacher presents Previously Mrs Paul told pupils there would be ""no cards, no parties, no gifts and no Christmas tree"". ""Christmas is a day celebrating the birth of Jesus and should be a time of good will to all, yet it can be a very stressful, expensive, argumentative and lonely time,"" she said. However, she added: ""If the arguments are good enough, we might see fairy lights in Lady Lumley's once more.""

Tom Cruise gives lesson in TV settings,"McQuarrie (left) and Cruise worked together on the latest Mission Impossible film Something is keeping movie star Tom Cruise up at night: motion smoothing. In an impassioned video posted to Twitter on Tuesday, the Mission Impossible star warned that a default setting on many high-end televisions ""makes most movies look like they were shot on high-speed video instead of film"". Taking a break from filming the new Top Gun film, he appeared alongside director Christopher McQuarrie, who pleads with viewers to do a quick internet search and find out how to change the correct settings. âIf you own a modern high-definition television,"" he said, ""thereâs a good chance youâre not watching movies the way the filmmakers intended, and the ability for you to do so is not simple to access."" Motion smoothing, or interpolation, is a technique that artificially adds additional frames to the moving image in order to prevent blurring - most effective when watching sport. But many in the film industry hate it, however, as it can degrade the image quality of the original film, and alter colouring. ""It takes the cinematic look out of any image and makes it look like soap opera shot on a cheap video camera,â wrote American director Reed Morano,who started a petition calling for TV makers to turn the setting off,external. ""It is unbelievable that this is a default setting on all HDTVs because essentially what it is doing, is taking the artistic intention away from filmmakers.â She suggested manufacturers could work with broadcasters to detect when sports coverage was being watched, and change the TV settings accordingly. In the video posted on Tuesday, Mr Cruise added: âFilmmakers are working with manufacturers to change the way video interpolation is activated on your television, giving you easier access and greater choice on when to use this feature.â Mr McQuarrie, who directed the most recent Mission Impossible film, said in the meantime people should search âTurn off motion smoothing [your TV brand here]â.

Windrush: 'Home Office ignored warnings',"The Empire Windrush arrived at Tilbury Docks, Essex, on 22 June 1948 Home Office processes led to wrongful detentions and deportations of members of the Windrush generation, says a National Audit Office report. The department failed to heed warnings of unfair consequences for children of Commonwealth citizens, living and working in the UK, says the NAO. ""It failed to protect their rights to live, work and access services,"" says NAO head Sir Amyas Morse. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has apologised. But the official spending watchdog says the Home Office has still not established the full scale of the scandal. Windrush: Home Office criticised after deportees not contacted Windrush: Formal apology for 18 people Anger as 'Windrush generation' face deportation threat An estimated 500,000 people now living in the UK who arrived between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries have been labelled the Windrush generation, a reference to a ship which brought workers to the UK in 1948. They were granted indefinite leave to remain in 1971 but thousands were children travelling on their parents' passports, without their own documents. Changes to immigration law in 2012 meant those without documents were asked for evidence to continue working, access services or even to remain in the UK. Some were held in detention or removed despite living in the country for decades, resulting in a furious backlash over their treatment. The scandal prompted criticism of ""hostile environment"" measures introduced to tackle illegal immigration, now referred to by the government under the heading ""compliant environment"". The people affected include not only the Windrush arrivals from the Caribbean - but people who arrived from other parts of the Commonwealth during the same period. Born to parents granted indefinite leave to remain, many never applied for their own travel documents and after decades living, working and being educated in the UK, believed they were British citizens. The Home Office did not keep a record of those granted leave to remain or issue any paperwork confirming it and in 2010, landing cards belonging to Windrush migrants were destroyed by the Home Office. Sir Amyas Morse, head of the National Audit Office, said: ""The treatment of people who had a legitimate right to remain in the UK raises grave questions about how the Home Office discharged its duty of care towards people who were made vulnerable because of lack of documentation. ""It failed to protect their rights to live, work and access services in the UK, and many have suffered distress and material loss as a result. This was both predictable and forewarned. ""The department is taking steps to put things right for the Caribbean community but it has shown a surprising lack of urgency to identify other groups that may have been affected."" The report says the Home Office: was aware of ""credible information"" about possible problems up to four years ago failed to sufficiently consider the risk of unfair consequences of the ""hostile environment"" policy ignored a 2016 recommendation to ""cleanse"" a database of individuals wrongly flagged as being in the UK illegally still does not know how many members of the Windrush generation have been wrongly affected by policies to target illegal migrants is showing ""a lack of curiosity"" about the effect on people who are not of Caribbean heritage Many of the new arrivals were children The NAO found the Home Office had made some attempts to identify the numbers affected but has not established the full extent of the problems. The report says, that so far, the department has: reviewed the cases of 11,800 individuals from the Caribbean identified 164 people removed or detained who might have been resident in the UK before 1973 apologised to 18 people in whose cases it is likely to have acted wrongfully has no plans to review 160,000 files relating to non-Caribbean Commonwealth nationals A Home Office spokesman said the Home Secretary Sajid Javid has issued a profound apology to the Windrush generation and is ""absolutely determined to right the wrongs of the past"". The spokesman added: ""As the NAO's report acknowledges, our taskforce has taken thousands of phone calls and helped over 2,400 people of any nationality prove their status in the UK. ""The majority of those helped by the taskforce are of Caribbean origin, but we have always been clear that it accepts applications under the Windrush scheme from people of any nationality who arrived in the UK before 31 December 1988 and are settled here."" An independent ""lessons learned"" review has been set up and details of a compensation scheme for those affected will be outlined in the new year, said the spokesman. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott called the report ""damning"" and urged ministers to ""finally take charge of this shambles, start treating all the Windrush generation fairly and legally and end the hostile environment, otherwise this scandal will only continue, and more injustices and scandals will inevitably follow."" Yvette Cooper, chairwoman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, added: ""To have only apologised in 18 cases when clearly many more people may have been wrongfully detained or removed is far too sluggish a response to government failings which have had such a devastating impact on families' lives.""

"iPhone artist Prodger wins Turner PrizeCharlotte Prodger wins the ÃÂ£25,000 art award for a highly personal film shot entirely on her phone.Entertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Turner prize winner Charlotte Prodger: 'I wouldn't be in this room without public funding' A highly personal film shot by artist Charlotte Prodger on her iPhone, which recalls her experiences of coming out as gay in rural Scotland, has won her the prestigious Â£25,000 Turner Prize. The Glasgow-based artist, known for exploring queer identity, won the annual art award for two of her videos. One of those, titled Bridgit, was filmed entirely on her phone and features her reading from her diaries. Prodger said she was ""quite overwhelmed"" and ""very touched"" to win. ""The stories that I'm telling, although they're mine and they're personal, are stories that a lot of people - I guess queer people - have experienced,"" she told BBC News. This video can not be played iPhones, identity and independence: Why Charlotte Prodger won the Turner Prize The award caps a good year for the 44-year-old, who has also been chosen to represent Scotland at the 2019 Venice Biennale. The judges said they ""admired the painterly quality of Bridgit and the attention it paid to art history"". Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson, who chaired the jury, said the winning artwork ""seems to make a lot of points for a younger generation"". He said: ""It deals with gender as unfixed, as something fluid, as something not always conforming to society's norms."" Charlotte Prodger's film Bridgit captures many of the themes of contemporary life. In her thoughtful, poetic meditation, she explores identity, gender, nationhood and how our subjective views can change. All of which is encapsulated in one film, shot rough and ready in fragments on an iPhone. It would have been impossible to make when the Turner Prize was first awarded in 1984. But it's now within the grasp of anybody with a smartphone and a story to tell. Bridgit is named after the Neolithic deity, while the other video in Prodger's winning exhibition is titled Stoneymollan Trail and traces a history of recent video formats and the artist's personal history. For the first time in the prize's history, all four artists were nominated for films, and the shortlist was also regarded as the most political ever. That political theme continued at the award ceremony itself, where Tate director Maria Balshaw used her speech to bemoan the pressures on students and schools that have led to a ""steady decline in the number of students who are enrolling for arts subjects"". She told the audience: ""It is not good enough - not good enough for young people, and not good enough for the future that we should wish for, for this country and the world"". Prodger worked on her film Bridgit over the course of a year The number of students taking GCSEs in subjects covering arts, design, media and performance have declined by around a quarter over the past five years. In her acceptance speech, Prodger also spoke in support of arts education and funding. ""I wouldn't be in this room were it not for the public funding that I received from Scotland for free higher education, and then later in the form of artist bursaries and grants to support not only the production of work but also living costs,"" she said. Turner Prize tries to make sense of our mad world Balshaw also talked about the recent arrest of artists in Cuba including Tania Bruguera, whocreated Tate Modern's current Turbine Hall commission. She said they were ""detained by Cuban authorities,externalwhile defending their right to creative freedom"". The crowd cheered as she added: ""Our thoughts are with Tania and her fellow artists in Cuba"". The artist, who was arrested on Monday,shared the speech on her Facebook page,externalon a post titled The World is Watching. Bruguera tried to protest against a decree she fears will increase censorship of Cuban culture The prize's other nominees includedForensic Architecture, a collective of architects, film-makers, software developers, journalists, lawyers and scientists whose investigations and reconstructions have provided decisive evidence in cases in countries including Germany, Greece, Israel and Guatemala. Then there wasLuke Willis Thompson, who is inspired by stop-and-search policies and killings. His films include one made with Diamond Reynolds, who used Facebook to broadcast the aftermath of the fatal shooting of her partner, Philando Castile, by a police officer in 2016. The shortlist was completed byNaeem Mohaiemen, whose films use turbulent periods in world history to examine the legacies of colonialism, national identity, left-wing politics and migration.

"Tom Cruise gives lesson in TV settingsThe Top Gun star took a moment out to warn of the curse of ""motion smoothing"" on your television.TechnologyComments","McQuarrie (left) and Cruise worked together on the latest Mission Impossible film Something is keeping movie star Tom Cruise up at night: motion smoothing. In an impassioned video posted to Twitter on Tuesday, the Mission Impossible star warned that a default setting on many high-end televisions ""makes most movies look like they were shot on high-speed video instead of film"". Taking a break from filming the new Top Gun film, he appeared alongside director Christopher McQuarrie, who pleads with viewers to do a quick internet search and find out how to change the correct settings. âIf you own a modern high-definition television,"" he said, ""thereâs a good chance youâre not watching movies the way the filmmakers intended, and the ability for you to do so is not simple to access."" Motion smoothing, or interpolation, is a technique that artificially adds additional frames to the moving image in order to prevent blurring - most effective when watching sport. But many in the film industry hate it, however, as it can degrade the image quality of the original film, and alter colouring. ""It takes the cinematic look out of any image and makes it look like soap opera shot on a cheap video camera,â wrote American director Reed Morano,who started a petition calling for TV makers to turn the setting off,external. ""It is unbelievable that this is a default setting on all HDTVs because essentially what it is doing, is taking the artistic intention away from filmmakers.â She suggested manufacturers could work with broadcasters to detect when sports coverage was being watched, and change the TV settings accordingly. In the video posted on Tuesday, Mr Cruise added: âFilmmakers are working with manufacturers to change the way video interpolation is activated on your television, giving you easier access and greater choice on when to use this feature.â Mr McQuarrie, who directed the most recent Mission Impossible film, said in the meantime people should search âTurn off motion smoothing [your TV brand here]â.

Tsunami alert after New Caledonia quake,"A tsunami warning in New Caledonia - triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Pacific - has now been lifted. There have been no reports of injuries or damage in the French overseas territory, officials say. Earlier, residents had been urged to go to shelters, following the 7.5 magnitude quake close to New Caledonia. New Caledonia - with a population of about 270,000 - is part of the Pacific's ""Ring of Fire"", where many earthquakes occur. The quake struck at a depth of 10km at 04:18 GMT, with its epicentre 168km (104 miles) east-south-east of Tadine, a town on one of New Caledonia's Loyalty Islands. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center,externalearlier said that some tsunami waves had been observed. It had said waves 1m to 3m (3.3ft to 9.8ft) above tide level were possible along the coasts of New Caledonia and Vanuatu, with waves of 0.3m to 1m above tide level for coasts of Fiji. New Zealand's ministry of civil defence and emergency management tweeted that there was no tsunami threat to the nation's coasts. The US Geological Survey (USGS) also recorded a series of aftershocks,external, two of them at 5.9 magnitude. New Caledonia profile The Ring of Fire refers to a string of volcanoes, earthquake sites and tectonic plates around the Pacific. It spreads across 40,000km (25,000 miles) from the southern tip of South America all the way to New Zealand. On Saturday,a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck Alaska, causing people to run from buildings and briefly prompting a tsunami alert for coastal areas. In October,a tsunami struck Palu in Indonesiafollowing a 7.5 magnitude quake, killing more than 1,000 people.

UAE spy charge man 'held in ankle cuffs',"This video can not be played Matthew Hedges tells the Today programme that standing in ankle cuffs was ""mentally exhausting"" The British academic jailed for spying in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has told how he endured ""psychological torture"". Matthew Hedges, 31, said he was forced to stand ""all day"" in ankle cuffs, suffered panic attacks and had suicidal thoughts. Mr Hedges, who denies being a spy, told the BBC he only confessed to being a captain in MI6 to stop the ""torture"". He said the UAE asked him to act as a double agent in the UK Foreign Office. Mr Hedges had denied spying and said he had been researching his PhD, but was jailed for life last month. The UAE government said the Durham academic was ""100% a spy"", but pardoned him on 26 November. The leader of MI6 has said he is""perplexed"" about the UAE's reasons for jailing Mr Hedges.

The PhD student told John Humphrys on Radio 4's Today programme that being in a cell had been ""lonely and isolating"". He was given a ""cocktail"" of medication to treat his depression and anxiety, he said, and deprived of natural light. ""I wasn't allowed to do anything to distract myself. My mental health was deteriorating,"" he said. ""I was handcuffed and blindfolded. I had to stand all day in ankle cuffs."" Visits to the bathroom were accompanied by four guards, he said. Daniela Tejada helped secure her husband's release Mr Hedges said standing in ankle cuffs was ""mentally exhausting"", but that adrenaline would kick in and help him cope. Shortly before his arrest he was due to have counselling to deal with anxiety and depression. ""I could not manage my thoughts throughout the incarceration,"" he said. Mr Hedges also said he regularly had panic attacks and some nights he dreamt of hanging himself in his cell. He said he was only able to speak to his wife Daniela Tejada - who had been campaigning for his release - once a week. Matthew Hedges has always maintained his innocence and said he had been researching his PhD During hours of interrogations he said the psychological pressure was so great he confessed. ""I panicked and told them I was a captain in MI6. I told them what they wanted to hear."" He also spoke of how he felt when he was sentenced to life in prison. ""It was total shock, I wasn't able to process it. I couldn't say goodbye to Danni."" British Academic pardoned by UAE Who is the man at the centre of the spy row? Hedges jailed for life on UAE spy charge Ms Tejada said academics would now have to think twice before doing research in the UAE. She said: ""At the heart of it it's about drawing red lines. I think the biggest issue is naturally the fact that there is no academic freedom in the UAE but also the fact that the red lines aren't clearly drawn. ""So it's sort of every man on their own. Each academic will have a different experience, to assess how safe it is to do research."" Durham University said it had a second PhD student in the UAE but they would not be required to return to the UK.

No jail time sought for Trump ex-aide Flynn,"Michael Flynn has admitted one count of lying to the FBI The special counsel investigating alleged Russian collusion in the 2016 US election will not be pursuing a jail sentence for former national security adviser Michael Flynn. Mr Flynn has admitted lying to the FBI. But in a memo, Robert Mueller said Mr Flynn had provided ""substantial"" details about links between the Trump election team and Russian officials. The heavily redacted memo hints at future revelations in a criminal probe that could trouble Donald Trump. President Trump has called the investigation a witch hunt and denies there was any collusion between his team and Russian officials to try to secure his election victory. Five big things Mueller is looking at Trump Russia: The saga in 250 words The sentencing memo released on Tuesday advising that Mr Flynn should not be imprisoned could have further implications in the ongoing investigation, should other senior members of Mr Trump's team be called upon to co-operate with additional statements. Mr Flynn is due to be sentenced in the US District Court for the District of Columbia on 18 December. Mr Mueller's office released the memo as guidance to the judge,externalwho will sentence Mr Flynn, the only member of the Trump administration so far to plead guilty as a result of the collusion investigation. Michael Flynn: Former US national security adviser Trump Russia affair: Key questions answered Mr Flynn has pleaded guilty to one count of making materially false statements to the FBI. He admitted that he discussed lifting US sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to Washington before Mr Trump took office, and that he lied to the US vice-president about that conversation. It says Mr Flynn has been interviewed 19 times, providing assistance in multiple investigations. This included giving information on co-ordination between the Russian government and the Trump campaign. Robert Mueller's investigation has been described as a witch hunt by the president Consequently, it says: ""A sentence at the low end of the guideline range - including a sentence that does not impose a term of incarceration - is appropriate and warranted."" It points to Mr Flynn's ""exemplary"" military and public service and that he ""deserves credit for accepting responsibility in a timely fashion and substantially assisting the government"". It had been thought details of Russian collusion might be included in the memo but the document says that, due to the ""sensitive information about ongoing investigations"", certain aspects have been sealed. An addendum to the memo on Mr Flynn's assistance,externalis heavily redacted. But it does say Mr Flynn provided ""first-hand information about the content and context of interactions between the transition team and Russian government officials"" - clearly part of the ongoing investigation. And then there is this intriguing element. In one section there is the simple sentence ""the defendant has provided substantial assistance in a criminal investigation"" but everything below it is blacked out. Analysis by BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher Michael Flynn may end up not spending a day in prison for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials during the Trump presidential transition. Part of the reason is because of his clean record prior to this offence. The other part could cause Donald Trump and those close to him sleepless nights in the days ahead. In an addendum to the sentencing memo, Robert Mueller details the help Mr Flynn provided to his investigation in exchange for a lenient sentence. Some of it is old news. The former national security advisor told Mr Mueller ""first-hand"" about his communications with Russians after Mr Trump's election - and similar communications by others in the transition team. Buried beneath thick black lines below this ""useful information"" is an entire section on further help Mr Flynn provided to Mr Mueller's collusion investigation. Even the subhead appears to be redacted. Then there's a mysterious ""criminal investigation"" to which Mr Flynn provided ""substantial assistance"". That portion of the memo, without a few introductory words, is entirely redacted. Who is being investigated? And what type of criminal wrongdoing is suspected? The Flynn document raises as many questions as it answers - and points toward explosive revelations to come. He had been a fervent supporter of Mr Trump during the election campaign and was appointed Mr Trump's national security adviser even though former President Barack Obama had warned against the appointment. It was a short tenure, ending in February 2017 after just 23 days, his departure forced by the revelation he had lied to Vice-President Mike Pence about the discussion with then-Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak. Further allegations then arose over a failure to disclose payments from Russian and Turkish lobbyists that he was given for speeches and consulting work. The retired US Army three-star lieutenant-general had earlier led the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) but was fired, on the surface for comments about Islamist extremism, although insiders also pointed to his unpopular overhaul of the agency. Yes, although not on charges related to collusion with Russia. Mr Trump's former deputy campaign manager,Rick Gates, has admitted conspiracy and lying to investigators. Former campaign chairman Paul Manaforthas been convicted for fraud, bank fraud and failing to disclose bank accounts. He has a plea bargain deal buthas been accused of breaching it by lying to the FBI. Ex-Trump lawyerMichael Cohen has admitted he lied about a Trump property deal in Russiaduring the 2016 election.

Rats and pigeons 'replace iconic species',"Children feed pigeons in Kathmandu The modification of land for farming and building cities is favouring the same species everywhere, according to a new study. Animals like rats and pigeons are taking over from less common ones, which can survive only in certain habitats, say scientists. Researchers looked at 20,000 animals and plants in 81 countries. They found that species occupying a large area tend to increase in places where humans use the land. However, fauna and flora that occupies a small area is lost. ""We show around the world that when humans modify habitats, these unique species are consistently lost and are replaced by species that are found everywhere, such as pigeons in cities and rats in farmland,"" said Dr Tim Newbold, a research fellow at University College London. Rats, mice, sparrows and pigeons are examples of species with wide ranges that do well when natural habitats are replaced with farmland and cities, he said. However, the ""narrow-ranged losers"" include animals and plants which may have great cultural value, such as rhinos and tigers. The way humans use land is benefitting the same plants and animals Co-researcher, Prof Andy Purvis of the Natural History Museum, London, compared the changes in biodiversity to what is happening on the British high street. ""As small, independent retailers are going out of business, large chains dominate,"" he said. ""It makes all towns look the same, and it's less easy to tell where you are. Likewise, people are affecting nature everywhere they go, and everywhere there are localised species which are struggling to make a living."" The findings are important for conservation efforts. Plants and animals that live only on small areas of land are already at higher risk of extinction than species which have adapted to live all over the world. Previous research has shown that animals and plants occupying small areas also provide distinct and important roles within the web of life, and may be vital for our food security.

iPhone artist Prodger wins Turner Prize,"This video can not be played Turner prize winner Charlotte Prodger: 'I wouldn't be in this room without public funding' A highly personal film shot by artist Charlotte Prodger on her iPhone, which recalls her experiences of coming out as gay in rural Scotland, has won her the prestigious Â£25,000 Turner Prize. The Glasgow-based artist, known for exploring queer identity, won the annual art award for two of her videos. One of those, titled Bridgit, was filmed entirely on her phone and features her reading from her diaries. Prodger said she was ""quite overwhelmed"" and ""very touched"" to win. ""The stories that I'm telling, although they're mine and they're personal, are stories that a lot of people - I guess queer people - have experienced,"" she told BBC News. This video can not be played iPhones, identity and independence: Why Charlotte Prodger won the Turner Prize The award caps a good year for the 44-year-old, who has also been chosen to represent Scotland at the 2019 Venice Biennale. The judges said they ""admired the painterly quality of Bridgit and the attention it paid to art history"". Tate Britain director Alex Farquharson, who chaired the jury, said the winning artwork ""seems to make a lot of points for a younger generation"". He said: ""It deals with gender as unfixed, as something fluid, as something not always conforming to society's norms."" Charlotte Prodger's film Bridgit captures many of the themes of contemporary life. In her thoughtful, poetic meditation, she explores identity, gender, nationhood and how our subjective views can change. All of which is encapsulated in one film, shot rough and ready in fragments on an iPhone. It would have been impossible to make when the Turner Prize was first awarded in 1984. But it's now within the grasp of anybody with a smartphone and a story to tell. Bridgit is named after the Neolithic deity, while the other video in Prodger's winning exhibition is titled Stoneymollan Trail and traces a history of recent video formats and the artist's personal history. For the first time in the prize's history, all four artists were nominated for films, and the shortlist was also regarded as the most political ever. That political theme continued at the award ceremony itself, where Tate director Maria Balshaw used her speech to bemoan the pressures on students and schools that have led to a ""steady decline in the number of students who are enrolling for arts subjects"". She told the audience: ""It is not good enough - not good enough for young people, and not good enough for the future that we should wish for, for this country and the world"". Prodger worked on her film Bridgit over the course of a year The number of students taking GCSEs in subjects covering arts, design, media and performance have declined by around a quarter over the past five years. In her acceptance speech, Prodger also spoke in support of arts education and funding. ""I wouldn't be in this room were it not for the public funding that I received from Scotland for free higher education, and then later in the form of artist bursaries and grants to support not only the production of work but also living costs,"" she said. Turner Prize tries to make sense of our mad world Balshaw also talked about the recent arrest of artists in Cuba including Tania Bruguera, whocreated Tate Modern's current Turbine Hall commission. She said they were ""detained by Cuban authorities,externalwhile defending their right to creative freedom"". The crowd cheered as she added: ""Our thoughts are with Tania and her fellow artists in Cuba"". The artist, who was arrested on Monday,shared the speech on her Facebook page,externalon a post titled The World is Watching. Bruguera tried to protest against a decree she fears will increase censorship of Cuban culture The prize's other nominees includedForensic Architecture, a collective of architects, film-makers, software developers, journalists, lawyers and scientists whose investigations and reconstructions have provided decisive evidence in cases in countries including Germany, Greece, Israel and Guatemala. Then there wasLuke Willis Thompson, who is inspired by stop-and-search policies and killings. His films include one made with Diamond Reynolds, who used Facebook to broadcast the aftermath of the fatal shooting of her partner, Philando Castile, by a police officer in 2016. The shortlist was completed byNaeem Mohaiemen, whose films use turbulent periods in world history to examine the legacies of colonialism, national identity, left-wing politics and migration. Prodger was presented with her prize by author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at a ceremony at the Tate Britain gallery in London.

Ash tree populations 'could stay viable',"An epidemic of ash dieback is devastating forests Scientists say there is hope that some ash forests will be able to survive a devastating tree disease. Surveys around Europe reveal mortality rates from ash dieback as high as 70% in woodlands and 85% in plantations. A previousstudy found almost all ash trees could be wiped out. The disease has swept across Europe over the past 20 years, causing widespread damage to woodlands. In many cases the fungus will eventually kill infected plants. ""Although the numbers seem grim, the percentage of trees that are still alive is encouraging from a long-term perspective,"" said Prof Richard Buggs, of Royal Botanic Gardens Kew and Queen Mary University of London. ""If this survival is due to heritable resistance, then conservation policies targeting breeding programs or natural selection may allow ash populations to flourish once again."" Common ash is found across Europe The researchers pulled together surveys of ash dieback across Europe, including England, Ukraine, Scandinavia and the Baltic States. They found that even in forests that had been exposed to the disease for 20 years, not all trees were lost. ""Although we may witness terrible devastation of ash woodlands in Europe, our grandchildren may see viable ash populations,"" said the researchers. There is typically a delay of 10 years from the disease entering the country to the widespread death of ash trees. This means that in the UK, the full extent of ash dieback will not become clear until 2022. The study is published in the journalPlants, People, Planet,external. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

"'We're homeless, how will Santa find us?'","This video can not be played 'We eat on our beds and that's what they hate' More than 130,000 children across Great Britain will spend Christmas in temporary accommodation, official figures suggest. One in every 103 under-18s is officially homeless, a 59% rise in five years, housing charity Shelter said. One mother-of-three said her children were preparing for Christmas in a one-room bed and breakfast for the second year running. Councils said a lack of housing had left them ""struggling to cope"". Using government statistics, Shelter said the number of children in temporary accommodation in England had increased 62% in five years and 36% in Scotland. The charity estimated 1,524 children in Wales were in temporary housing, based on figures for the overall number of households. It said some B&Bs were ""not places for children"" because of people reporting problems with rats, children having to share beds with family members and having to ""play in dirty public corridors"". Carly Stutter's children are facing another Christmas in bed and breakfast Carly Stutter's three children have still not opened some of the presents they got for Christmas last year. She says they are so short of space in their B&B single room she had to leave a lot of their possessions in a friend's shed. Miss Stutter, 30, from Croydon, has been living in hostels and B&Bs for more than two years with daughters Paris, 11, and Morgan, 10, and son Archie, six. ""It's going to be a shambles spending another Christmas like this,"" she said. ""Morgan and Archie ask how Santa is going to find us because we've been moving and 'how is he going to get in because we're only in one room'. ""I tell them he still comes to people even if they're only in one room."" The bedrooms of London's most disadvantaged children Single mothers 'hit hard by homelessness' Parental leave: The good, the bad and the unexpected The girls share a bed but Morgan prefers to sleep on the floor on a blanket so she has some space. Miss Stutter shares a bed with Archie and said she turns everything off and lies on the bed in the dark after about 20:30 GMT so the children can sleep. They left their privately-rented home after the landlord put up the rent from Â£1,200 to Â£1,500 a month, which Miss Stutter could not afford. The family moved to a series of B&Bs but this meant they had to give up their pet dog, 11-year-old Devious. He has been re-homed. Miss Stutter described one property as ""infested with rats"". ""If I didn't have the kids, God knows what I'd do,"" Miss Stutter said. ""The kids keep me going, they keep me strong. But enough is enough now."" Croydon Council said it had started several initiatives to increase local housing supply, including flats for vulnerable rough sleepers and buying more than 150 family homes for households in temporary accommodation. In England the number of children in temporary accommodation is at its highest for 11 years. There were 123,130 children without a permanent home in March 2018, up from 76,040 at the start of 2013. The last time it was higher was 2007, when there were 125,430. From sleeping on the bus to having a home Single mothers 'hit hard by homelessness' Greg Beales, director of campaigns at Shelter, said: ""The increasing number of children hidden away in hostels and B&Bs is enough to make anyone's heart sink. These are not places for children. We hear about cold, damp - even rats. ""Young children are sharing beds with multiple family members, trying to play in dirty public corridors, and having to leave their block in the middle of the night to use the bathroom."" London boroughs had the highest proportions of children in temporary accommodation. Westminster City Council, which had the highest rate, put the problem down to high rents and higher house prices. Councillor Andrew Smith said: ""We are building 1,850 affordable homes by 2023 and just last week we launched a new Housing Solution Service for families, which will focus on prevention and providing expert advice before people reach crisis point. ""By engaging early we're confident we can help more people, cutting out the unimaginable pain and stress that people go through when they lose their home."" A spokesman for the Local Government Association (LGA) said: ""Funding pressures are combining with a lack of affordable housing and rents continuing to rise above household incomes to leave many councils struggling to cope. ""Homelessness continues to rise and the people caught up in this crisis can't afford for us to wait,"" He said the increasing use of temporary accommodation was ""financially unsustainable"" for councils as well as ""hugely disruptive"" for families. The LGA wants councils to be allowed to keep all the money from housing they sell under right to buy laws so they can can invest in building more homes. Minister for homelessness Heather Wheeler said:  ""No family should be left without a roof over their head, especially during the winter months, and we are working to ensure all children have a safe place to stay. ""Councils have a duty to provide temporary accommodation for families with nowhere to go. ""We're providing more than Â£1.2bn to tackle all forms of homelessness, including amongst children, and introduced the Homelessness Reduction Act to ensure people at risk get help quicker. ""But we know we have more to do to tackle homelessness, and we will.""

Takeda gets nod for Â£46bn Shire takeover,"Japanese drugs giant Takeda's Â£46bn ($59bn) takeover of Irish pharmaceuticals firm Shire has been approved by both sets of shareholders. The acquisition, the largest by a Japanese company, propels Takeda into the world's top 10 list of biggest pharmaceutical companies. Shire shareholders met in Dublin to approve the deal. Takeda investors gave the green light earlier in the day. Some Takeda investors objected over fears it will increase the firm's debt. The votes to approve the takeover follow a long-running battle in which Takeda made multiple offers for Shire. On Tuesday, Kazuhisa Takeda, a member of the firm's founding family, spoke out against the deal over concerns with the level of debt it would add to Takeda. Takeda plans to finance the takeover via the issue of new shares in exchange for Shire stock, bank loans and bonds. The takeover is part of Takeda's strategy to become a global pharmaceutical company. The firm wanted to buy Shire to strengthen its cancer, stomach and brain drug portfolios. But one of its potentially lucrative treatments will have to be sold off at the direction of European regulators over competition concerns. ""We are delighted that our shareholders have given their strong support to our acquisition of Shire,"" said Takeda chief executive Christophe Weber after the investor vote in Osaka.

Three defeats for May in Commons Brexit fight,"This video can not be played The moment the voting figures were announced and the government was told to disclose its legal advice over Brexit. Theresa May has suffered three Brexit defeats in the Commons as she set out to sell her EU deal to sceptical MPs. Ministers have agreed to publish the government's full legal advice on the deal after MPs found them in contempt of Parliament for issuing a summary. And MPs backed calls for the Commons to have a direct say in what happens if the PM's deal is rejected next Tuesday. Mrs May said MPs had a duty to deliver on the 2016 Brexit vote and the deal on offer was an ""honourable compromise"". She was addressing the Commons at the start of a five-day debate on her proposed agreement on the terms of the UK's withdrawal and future relations with the EU. The agreement has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by the UK Parliament if it is to come into force. MPs will decide whether to reject or accept it on Tuesday 11 December. Mrs May said Brexit divisions had become ""corrosive"" to UK politics and the public believed the issue had ""gone on long enough"" and must be resolved.

Ministers were found to be in contempt of Parliament - a very serious telling off - and the government had a hat trick of defeats - the first time since the 1970s that's happened. As you'd expect too, MP after MP after MP rose after Theresa May's remarks to slam her deal as Tory divisions were played out on the green benches, with harsh words exchanged. But in this topsy-turvy world, the overall outcome of the day for Mrs May's big test a week tonight might have been not all bad... Read Laura's full blog The attorney general said his full advice to ministers should remain confidential By 311 votes to 293, the Commons supported a motion demanding full disclosure of the legal advice given to cabinet before the Brexit deal was agreed. The move was backed by six opposition parties, including Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party which has a parliamentary pact with the Conservatives. It came after Attorney General Geoffrey Coxpublished a summary of the advice on Mondayand answered MPs questions for three hours - but argued that full publication would not be in the national interest. See how your MP voted on the contempt motion Kuenssberg: Parliament is 'taking back control' Parliament Live: MPs debate Brexit deal BBC drops plans for Brexit TV debate Mark D'Arcy: What contempt challenge means Labour had accused ministers of ""wilfully refusing to comply"" with a binding Commons vote last month demanding they provided the attorney general's full and final advice. After Labour demanded the advice should be released ahead of next Tuesday's key vote on Mrs May's deal, Commons Speaker John Bercow said it was ""unimaginable"" this would not happen. In response, Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom said she would ""respond"" on Wednesday, but would ask the Commons Privileges Committee to consider the constitutional repercussions. This video can not be played BBC political correspondent Leila Nathoo explains how things unfolded An attempt by ministers to refer the whole issue, including the government's conduct, to the committee of MPs was earlier defeated by four votes. The privileges committee will now decide which ministers should be held accountable and what sanction to apply, with options ranging from a reprimand to the more unlikely scenario of a minister being suspended from the Commons. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the result left the government ""on the ropes"", adding: ""Theresa May's majority has evaporated, and the credibility of her deal is evaporating with it."" The prime minister suffered a further setback on Tuesday as MPs backed, by 321 votes to 299, changes to the parliamentary process should the Commons vote down her deal next week. If that happens, the government has 21 days in which to return to the House and set out what it plans to do next.

But Tory Dominic Grieve's motion means that instead of MPs being confined to merely taking note of what the government tells them, the Commons would be able to exert more influence by voting on what they wanted the government to do as well. Tuesday's vote, in which 26 Tory MPs rebelled, could potentially tilt the balance of power between government and Parliament if, as expected, MPs push for a ""Plan B"" alternative to Mrs May's deal and also seek to prevent any chance of a no-deal exit. Mr Grieve, who has expressed support for another Brexit referendum, told Channel 4 News he was not seeking to ""guarantee a particular outcome"" if Mrs May's deal went down. But he said it would ""allow the UK time to consider its options"", including potentially re-starting negotiations with the EU or giving the public the final say. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""Worth taking a moment to reflect on how we got here."" As she sought the backing of the Commons for her Brexit deal, the prime minister said she was confident the UK would enjoy a ""better future"" outside the European Union. She said the ""honourable compromise"" on offer was ""not the one-way street"" many had portrayed it to be and that the EU had made it clear that the agreement would not be improved on. ""I never said this deal was perfect, it was never going to be. That is the nature of a negotiation,"" she said. ""We should not let the search for a perfect Brexit prevent a good Brexit... I promise you today that this is the very best deal for the British people and I ask you to back it in the best interest of our constituents and our country."" But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was a bad deal for the UK and Labour would seek a vote of no confidence in Mrs May if she could not get it through Parliament. ""This House will make its decision next Tuesday,"" he said. ""I hope and expect this House will reject that deal. ""At that point, the government has lost the confidence of the House. Either they have to get a better deal from the EU or give way to those who will."" This video can not be played Not everyone agreed with Boris Johnson's analysis of the Brexit deal... Nigel Dodds, the leader of the DUP in Westminster, said the agreement ""falls short"" of delivering Brexit ""as one United Kingdom"" and would mean entering ""a twilight world where the EU is given unprecedented powers over the UK"". ""We would have to rely on the goodwill of others to ever leave this arrangement,"" he said. ""So... the UK's future as a strong and independent global trading nation standing together is in real and imminent jeopardy - an outcome that doesn't honour the referendum or take back control of our laws, our money and our borders."" Ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson dismissed the deal as a ""paint and plaster pseudo-Brexit"" and said its supporters would be ""turning their backs"" on the 17.4 million Leave voters. ""If we try to cheat them now, as I fear we are, they will spot it and will never forgive us,"" he said. The leader of the SNP in Westminster, Ian Blackford, said beneath the ""theatre"" of the past few months was the ""cold, hard truth"" that this deal was ""a moment of self-harm in our history"". He said it was ""difficult"" and ""a real sorrow"" to even respond to a motion that could see the UK leave the EU - an institution that he called the ""greatest peace project in our lifetime"". ""It is not too late to turn back. Fundamentally, there is no option that is going to be better for our economy, jobs, and for our communities than staying in the European Union. ""And it is the height of irresponsibility of any government to bring forward a proposition that is going to make its people poorer."" However, in closing the debate shortly after 01:00 GMT on Wednesday, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay argued the deal would bring ""real changes which will improve the livelihoods of people up and down the country"". ""This deal is a choice between the certainty of continued co-operation or the potentially damaging fracture of no deal, or indeed the instability of a second referendum vote,"" he said. ""Rejecting this deal would create even more uncertainty at a time when we owe it to our constituents to show clarity and conviction.""

Embattled ministers fight for Brexit deal,"This video can not be played Liam Fox warns MPs 'may try to steal Brexit' There is a risk MPs could ""steal Brexit from the British people"" if Theresa May's proposed deal is rejected, a senior cabinet minister has warned. Liam Fox said there was ""natural Remain majority"" in Parliament and any attempt to overturn the 2016 referendum vote would be a ""democratic affront"". It came after MPs voted to exert more influence should the PM's deal fall. Ministers will again battle to win over MPs to Theresa May's withdrawal deal after three government defeats. Security will be the focus of the second of five days of debate in the Commons, where Tuesday's marathon session extended into the early hours. Ahead of Prime Minister's Questions at noon, the governmentpublished its Brexit legal advice,external- a move which came after MPs voted to find the government in contempt of Parliament for ignoring a Commons vote demanding publication. Parliament Live: Rolling updates Could Brexit defeats peel off some rebels? What happens if MPs reject Brexit deal? BBC drops plans for Brexit TV debate Law officer says UK can cancel Brexit The PM's deal has been endorsed by EU leaders but must also be backed by the UK Parliament if it is to come into force. MPs will decide whether to reject or accept it next Tuesday, 11 December. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March, 2019. Ministers say that if MPs reject their deal they increase the chances of the UK leaving without a deal, or not leaving the EU at all. Ministers will plough on with attempts to win over MPs on Wednesday, with eight hours of debate on the security and immigration aspects of the withdrawal agreement. Meanwhile, Mrs May is expected to continue trying to convince small groups of her MPs to back the plan in private meetings. This video can not be played The moment the government lost a key vote - and was told to disclose its legal advice on Brexit Mrs May will face Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn at prime minister's questions, at noon, before the Brexit debate gets under way. Senior Brexiteers in the cabinet have warned that the UK may not leave the EU if Mrs May's deal is voted down. International Trade Secretary Liam Fox suggested the PM's deal was the only way of guaranteeing the UK leaves the EU, as scheduled, on 29 March 2019. ""When you are in prison and someone offers you a key, you take it,"" he told a committee of MPs. While a no-deal exit would be ""disorderly"", he suggested the UK being kept in the EU against the will of the British people would be even more damaging. ""I think that there is a real danger that the House of Commons which has a natural remain majority may attempt to steal Brexit from British people which would be a democratic affront."" Environment Secretary Michael Gove said the deal on the table was in the best interests of the country. ""Everyone has to think at this momentous moment - do we want to ensure that Brexit gets over the line? Do we want to deliver on the verdict of the 17.4 million people who voted to leave the European Union because if we don't back the prime minister, we risk there being no Brexit and that I think would be a fatal blow to faith in democracy."" But a former Conservative chief whip has said he expects the PM to lose the vote. Mark Harper, who backed Remain in the referendumtold the Daily Telegraph he would vote against the withdrawal agreement,external, and predicted the deal would be rejected by 80 of his party colleagues. He urged the prime minister to renegotiate the deal, insisting the current plan would leave the UK worse off. First, the government lost a bid to have the legal advice issue dealt with separately by the Privileges Committee of MPs. In a second defeat, ministers were found in contempt of parliament and forced to concede they would have to publish that advice in full, having previously argued this would break convention and was not in the national interest. This video can not be played BBC political correspondent Leila Nathoo explains how things unfolded Most significantly, the third defeat was over changes to the parliamentary process in the event that the Commons votes down Mrs May's deal. Instead of being confined to merely ""taking note"" of what the government tells them, MPs would also be able to exert more influence by voting on what they want the government to do next. This could potentially see Parliament wrest control of the Brexit process from ministers if, as expected, MPs push for a ""Plan B"" alternative to Mrs May's deal and seek to prevent any chance of Britain leaving the EU without a deal in place. Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve, who brought the motion, told Channel 4 News it would ""allow the UK time to consider its options"", including re-starting negotiations with the EU or giving the public the final say. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said: ""The Commons is now very likely to defeat the government again next week on the Brexit deal, at which point the country must be given a 'People's Vote', and asked to choose between the deal or remaining in the EU."" By BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg Former Remain rebels now have a possible route to get what they want if the PM's plan is rejected, as there is a possible - I emphasise the possible - way to get a vote with a majority for a Norway-style agreement or, less likely, a push for another referendum. That won't go unnoticed by Brexiteers too, who may feel (some of them at least) that Mrs May's deal might be their best bet in that case, rather than risk that softer, squidgier Brexit. It's possible therefore that Tuesday's shenanigans have made it less likely that the prime minister will face a terrible defeat next week because a few wobbly rebels on both sides might come in line.

MPs Brexit debate,"MPs continued debating the government's Brexit deal, ahead of vote next Tuesday Thursday's debate focused on the economic impact of the agreement Commons business began with questions to Brexit ministers House of Lords also debated the Brexit deal this afternoon Sophie Morris, Ryan Brown and Robbie Hawkins The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Brexit officially happened on 31 January but the UK is now in a transition period until the end of 2020. Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. Members of Parliament (MPs) will vote next week on the Brexit deal that Prime Minister Theresa May has negotiated. Sir Graham Brady ""would welcome"" a delay in the Brexit vote if it would help resolve MPs' concerns. House of CommonsParliament That's it for our coverage today, as MPs complete their third day of debate on the withdrawal agreement. Tory MP Sir Hugo Swire is now introducing his adjournment debate on the illegal trade in seahorses in the UK. MPs are due to continue their debate on the Brexit deal on Monday afternoon. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament International Trade Secretary Liam Fox says the ""status quo has never been on offer"" as the EU ""wants an ever closer union"". ""We have to find a compromise that makes this workable,"" he says, adding: ""the withdrawal agreement achieves just that, and is the only deal on the table"". DUP MP Ian Paisley intervenes to says the ""gallows are being built"" for the deal ahead of Tuesday's planned vote - and asks if there have been discussions about delaying it. Liam Fox replies says ministers will ""continue to make the case"" for the deal, but adds: ""the government will want to talk to members, of course it will want to look to ways to give a reassurance"". He says ""I understand why MPs have concerns about the backstop, but it is clear that it is there to be a temporary measure"". Liam Fox says Labour is ""playing politics at a time of great national decision-making"", and their Brexit policy is ""ill-researched and delusional"". He says that by agreeing to hold to the referendum, Parliament ""sub-contracted its sovereignty"" to voters, and MPs must now ""live up to our side of the bargain"".  Allow Twitter content?

Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Winding up the debate for Labour, shadow international trade minister Barry Gardiner says the government has ""tried to exclude Parliament from the process at all stages"". ""This is a deal that members on all sides now believe is not in the best interest of the country,"" he says. Mr Gardiner says the UK will be ""much poorer than we otherwise would be"" under the government's agreement. He calls on Liam Fox to be ""yet more flexible still"" on the next steps for Brexit, and ""recall his own words"" given to a Sunday newspaper in 2012. Back then, he says, Mr Fox called for the UK to renegotiate a ""new relationship"" with the EU, based on ""an economic partnership involving a customs union and the single market in goods and services"". ""The secretary of state may not like it, but it sounds an awful lot like Labour party policy to me"", he adds. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Like other MPs today, the DUP's Jim Shannon picks up on the proposed 'backstop' plan for the Irish border in the government's deal. He says there is ""no legal form for leaving this international treaty without consent"", adding that this is ""not acceptable"". He says the people of Northern Ireland must stand up for themselves and he has ""a mistrust for the government at this time"". ""The government have voted for Northern Ireland to become a voiceless victim of the UK,"" he concludes. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Next up this evening is Labour MP Karen Lee - who was a Remainer in 2016 but her constituency of Lincoln voted to leave. She ""sincerely believes"" there is a Brexit deal that will benefit her constituents, she says. ""But this deal will not protect jobs, workplace rights or environmental standards, and it will inhibit business by failing to ensure frictionless trade"", she adds. ""We can renegotiate with the EU - or better still, hold a general election"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Vicky Ford - who used to be member of the European Parliament and voted Remain - says MPs need to respect the vote to leave. ""A second referendum would be even more divisive and no more decisive,"" she adds. Ms Ford says leaving the EU with no deal poses ""a huge risk"" and the withdrawal agreement helps real businesses remain secure and offers time to develop a future framework. She calls Labour's plan of ""a close relationship with the single market without being in it"" a ""fantasy land"". Ms Ford says the backstop plan is not a ""practical risk"", as remaining in the arrangement permanently ""is not in the EU's interest"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Andrew Bowie says many of his colleagues on the Conservative benches are still ""struggling to come to a conclusion"" on which way they will vote. He adds that he voted to leave the EU ""and supports the deal"". Mr Bowie says he backs the agreement ""as it is the best for business, his constituents and Scotland"". ""I believe this deal is better than what we have now,"" he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Dame Louise Ellman says the deal provides no certainty and there is no guarantee that a better one could be negotiated. Leaving without a deal on the other hand is not an option, she adds. The only other option is that MPs go back to the people and tell them the truth that ""we cannot leave the club and expect to keep all the benefits"". ""That is mission impossible"", she says. ""It is time for a people's vote"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Tory MP Lee Rowley says ""we are arguing over commas in this deal, when whole paragraphs of it do not work"", and for this reason he will not be backing the deal. ""I did not come to this place to make people poorer,"" he says. ""I cannot go back to my constituents and say this deal gives them Brexit - it does not"". He says he disagrees with the deal as it is ""a failure of nerve and ambition"", and calls for it to be stopped. Mr Rowley calls on the government ""to move the UK out of its shadow"" and ""get Brexit back on track"". Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Tanmanjeet Singh Dhesi says the Brexitlegal advicepublished this week shows Northern Ireland ""has been sold out"". The Brexit process has been ""blurred, botched and bungled from the very start"", he adds. Mr Singh Dhesi says the prime minister is ""not up to the task"" and ""has created division and discord"". The Conservatives must ""stand aside"" to allow a general election, he concludes. House of LordsParliament The debate on the government's Brexit deal has ended - and business in the House of Lords for today comes to an end. Peers will resume the debate on Monday. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of LordsParliament Wrapping up the Lords debate, Tory peer Lord Horam says the referendum result was ""a wake up call"". He says the withdrawal agreement is ""surprisingly good in the circumstances"", but Brexit is not the answer to the ""fundamental social problems"" that triggered the vote to leave. He does not expect the agreement to win Parliament's approval, he says, warning that if the decision is to be returned to the people the Remain side must do better. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate Conservative MP Maggie Throup says she will be supporting the government's Brexit deal next week ""if it stays the same"". She says another referendum would be ""undemocratic"". She calls for MPs to ""end the political games, and reflect on what the consequences of rejecting this deal will be"". ""This deal is in the public interest,"" she says. Brexit Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Giles Watling, who voted Remain, says he was re-elected in his leave-voting constituency because his party pledged to ""deliver on their wishes"". The government's Brexit deal ""does tick so many of the boxes"", he says - but he adds that he still has ""serious concerns"" about the backstop. ""What has been the point of the last two years of uncertainty and pain"" he asks, if the UK is ""still under the dominion the European Court of Justice"". ""Best endeavours"" to negotiate a future relationship deal are ""not cast iron"", he concludes. Â© 2025 BBC.

Boohoo 'broke advertising rules'The BBC's Watchdog Live finds the fast-fashion retailer broke advertising standards rules.Business,"Boohoo, the fast fashion retailer, broke Advertising Standards Authority rules with ""misleading"" promotions. The BBC's investigative programme, Watchdog Live, recorded promotions on its website that did not end after the countdown clock reached zero. Time-limited sales put pressure on consumers to buy quickly. Keeping the clock running means the time limit - and the pressure - were false. Boohoo said it was never its intention to mislead. The company said customer demand drove it to extend certain offers. Between August and November 2018, Watchdog Live recorded 14 sales advertised on Boohoo's site with a countdown clock. But after the clocks on the sale reached zero, they were reset and the offers continued. This included a Black Friday offer for 30% off ""absolutely everything"" that urged customers: ""Hurry - ends soon."" In reality, the promotion did not ending anytime soon and when the clock reached zero, it simply started again. In these cases, Watchdog Live found the clocks were misleading as the promotions were not genuinely time-limited. The ASA has previously ruled against companies found to be advertising misleading time-limited sales. It told Watchdog Live that Boohoo was breaking rules on sales promotions that it had investigated and ruled against in the past. ""The use of a countdown clock is problematic if it misleadingly implies the offer is time-limited when that is not the case,"" said the ASA, which will work with Boohoo to bring its advertising into line. A Boohoo spokesperson said ""customer demand"" led it to extending offers on a ""small number"" of time-limited promotions. ""It is never our intention to mislead customers and we take full note of the BBC Watchdog's inquiry. We are looking into our processes to ensure that further diligence is exercised in relation to future promotions of this nature,"" she said. Mary Creagh, the MP who chairs the House of Commons environmental audit committee, said psychological sales tricks such as ticking clocks helped fuel over-consumption and encouraged a throwaway society. ""Our inquiry has already uncovered a number of serious concerns about the 'fast fashion' business model and sadly it comes as no surprise that Boohoo are one of the worst offenders,"" she added. The full report on Boohoo breaking advertising rules can be seen on Watchdog Live on Wednesday 5 December at 8pm on BBC One.

VTech tablet flaw gave hackers an openingFirm alerts public to flaw that could have given hackers a way to spy on and chat to children.Technology,"VTech allows parents to determine which sites their children can visit with the tablet Child gadget-maker VTech's website is promoting a security fix for its flagship tablet, following an investigation by BBC Watchdog Live. The Storio Max - which is called the InnoTab Max in the UK - suffers a software flaw that could allow hackers to remotely take control of the device and snoop on its users. VTech was alerted to the vulnerability months ago by a UK cyber-security firm. The Chinese company issued a fix but some parents have yet to install it. The notice at the top of its homepage and the broadcast of the BBC programme should ensure the issue gets more prominence. It had previously relied on pop-up alerts that appeared on the devices themselves to prompt owners into action. VTech said it was also contacting retailers that are selling affected units. The issue has come to light nearly three years after the firm wascriticised for its handling of a separate cyber-security incidentthat exposed millions of its child customers' account details. Vtech markets the Max tablets to children aged between three and nine years old. ""This was a controlled and targeted 'ethical hack' by... a sophisticated cyber-firm that was in possession of a detailed knowledge of hacking techniques and InnoTab/Storio Max's firmware,"" said VTech in a statement about the latest incident. ""We are not aware of any actual attempt to exploit the vulnerability and we consider the prospects of this happening to be remote. ""However, the safety of children is our top priority and we are constantly looking to improve the security of our devices."" Vtech's Max tablets are designed to allow parents to restrict their children to websites that they have personally approved. VTech markets the tablets as being suitable for children as young as three But earlier this year, researchers at London-based SureCloud discovered a flaw in the firm's software that they said made it vulnerable to attack if one or more of the pre-vetted sites were compromised. VTech fined $650,000 over data breach VTech 'is responsible' for kids' data says watchdog Parents urged to boycott VTech toys ""To find the vulnerability in the first place wasn't easy,"" Luke Potter, the firm's cyber-security practice director told BBC News. ""But to actually exploit it once you know it's there is reasonably simple."" The flaw means that malicious code can be remotely triggered to run on the devices from afar. Mr Potter said this could involve making use of ""off-the-shelf"" malware available from criminal markets or running customised code. ""Remote access can be gained without the child even knowing,"" he explained. ""So effectively being able to monitor the child, listen to them, talk to them, have full access and control of the device. ""For example, we demonstrated viewing things through the webcam."" Mr Potter said that after his firm informed VTech of the problem it was quick to issue a software fix in May. VTech boasts about its safety credentials on its website, saying that '""through rigorous testing, we maintain strict control and supervision over the quality of our products"". SecureCloud said the problem was in VTech's software and not the underlying Android system It told Watchdog Live: ""We thank SureCloud for bringing this vulnerability... to our attention. We took immediate action in early summer to resolve the issue and pushed out a firmware upgrade to all affected InnoTab/Storio Max devices in Europe."" The company added that it had recently sent an email to European owners who had not performed the upgrade to urge them to do so. But until BBC Watchdog Live got involved, VTech had not specifically warned customers about the security vulnerability or the risks it posed. An ""upgrade reminder"" on its website,externalis now more explicit and provides an illustrated step-by-step guide to applying the fix. However, Mr Potter said the issue might have been picked up at an earlier stage had the tablets been subject to more thorough checks before going on sale.

US diplomats return to Somalia,"Security has improved in Mogadishu although al-Shabab remains a threat The US has established its first diplomatic presence in Somalia for nearly 30 years. The state department said the ""historic event"" reflected the progress the east African nation had made. Ambassador Donald Yamamoto is heading the embassy in Mogadishu. Previously it had been based in Nairobi, Kenya. The US closed its embassy in Somalia in January 1991 amid fighting between rebels and the government and had to airlift out its ambassador and staff. Commenting on the latest move, state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement: ""This historic event reflects Somalia's progress in recent years and is another step forward in formalising US diplomatic engagement in Mogadishu since recognising the Federal Government of Somalia in 2013."" She added: ""Our return demonstrates the United States' commitment to further advance stability, democracy and economic development that are in the interest of both nations."" Security has improved in Mogadishu recently, although al-Shabab rebels remain a threat. Al-Shabab was forced out of the capital in August 2011 following an offensive spearheaded by African Union troops. But it still has a strong presence in regions around the capital. US President Donald Trump expanded operations against al-Shabab in March 2017 and the US military has conducted more than two dozen air strikes, including drone strikes, in Somalia this year, Traditionally, US presidents have been wary of intervening in Somalia since 18 special forces soldiers died fighting militias in Mogadishu in 1993, a battle dramatised in the film Black Hawk Down. Last month,the US announced it was cutting 700 counter-terrorism troops from Africaover the next few years, although its activities in Somalia will remain largely the same.

VTech tablet flaw gave hackers an opening,"VTech allows parents to determine which sites their children can visit with the tablet Child gadget-maker VTech's website is promoting a security fix for its flagship tablet, following an investigation by BBC Watchdog Live. The Storio Max - which is called the InnoTab Max in the UK - suffers a software flaw that could allow hackers to remotely take control of the device and snoop on its users. VTech was alerted to the vulnerability months ago by a UK cyber-security firm. The Chinese company issued a fix but some parents have yet to install it. The notice at the top of its homepage and the broadcast of the BBC programme should ensure the issue gets more prominence. It had previously relied on pop-up alerts that appeared on the devices themselves to prompt owners into action. VTech said it was also contacting retailers that are selling affected units. The issue has come to light nearly three years after the firm wascriticised for its handling of a separate cyber-security incidentthat exposed millions of its child customers' account details. Vtech markets the Max tablets to children aged between three and nine years old. ""This was a controlled and targeted 'ethical hack' by... a sophisticated cyber-firm that was in possession of a detailed knowledge of hacking techniques and InnoTab/Storio Max's firmware,"" said VTech in a statement about the latest incident. ""We are not aware of any actual attempt to exploit the vulnerability and we consider the prospects of this happening to be remote. ""However, the safety of children is our top priority and we are constantly looking to improve the security of our devices."" Vtech's Max tablets are designed to allow parents to restrict their children to websites that they have personally approved. VTech markets the tablets as being suitable for children as young as three But earlier this year, researchers at London-based SureCloud discovered a flaw in the firm's software that they said made it vulnerable to attack if one or more of the pre-vetted sites were compromised. VTech fined $650,000 over data breach VTech 'is responsible' for kids' data says watchdog Parents urged to boycott VTech toys ""To find the vulnerability in the first place wasn't easy,"" Luke Potter, the firm's cyber-security practice director told BBC News. ""But to actually exploit it once you know it's there is reasonably simple."" The flaw means that malicious code can be remotely triggered to run on the devices from afar. Mr Potter said this could involve making use of ""off-the-shelf"" malware available from criminal markets or running customised code. ""Remote access can be gained without the child even knowing,"" he explained. ""So effectively being able to monitor the child, listen to them, talk to them, have full access and control of the device. ""For example, we demonstrated viewing things through the webcam."" Mr Potter said that after his firm informed VTech of the problem it was quick to issue a software fix in May. VTech boasts about its safety credentials on its website, saying that '""through rigorous testing, we maintain strict control and supervision over the quality of our products"". SecureCloud said the problem was in VTech's software and not the underlying Android system It told Watchdog Live: ""We thank SureCloud for bringing this vulnerability... to our attention. We took immediate action in early summer to resolve the issue and pushed out a firmware upgrade to all affected InnoTab/Storio Max devices in Europe."" The company added that it had recently sent an email to European owners who had not performed the upgrade to urge them to do so. But until BBC Watchdog Live got involved, VTech had not specifically warned customers about the security vulnerability or the risks it posed. An ""upgrade reminder"" on its website,externalis now more explicit and provides an illustrated step-by-step guide to applying the fix. However, Mr Potter said the issue might have been picked up at an earlier stage had the tablets been subject to more thorough checks before going on sale. ""Any cyber-security firm that is following a best-practice approach to testing these devices... would be likely to have spotted this issue,"" he said.

Chanel sheds exotic skins in luxury first,"Chanel has become the first luxury fashion house in the world to stop using exotic animal skins, like snake, crocodile, lizard and stingray. The company's head of fashion, Bruno Pavlovsky, said it had become harder to source such pelts ethically. He also included fur in the list, of which Chanel uses little. Although Chanel's designer Karl Lagerfeld insisted the move was made independently, animals rights groups hailed the decision.

Mr Lagerfeld and Mr Pavlovsky spoke to industry publication Women's Wear Daily,externalabout the decision. ""We did it because it's in the air, but it's not an air people imposed to us,"" Mr Lagerfeld said, although he noted ""there was not much fur"" in Chanel's work to begin with. The secret supplier to the world's top brands Why Iâll keep selling fur despite the hate Python skin bags were reportedly taken down from the Chanel site on Tuesday, but Mr Pavlovsky said it would take a while for existing products to leave their shops.

BBC drops plans for Brexit TV debate,"Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn could debate the Brexit withdrawal agreement on TV this Sunday The BBC has dropped plans to hold a Brexit debate between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, saying it ""could not reach an agreement"" on its proposal. Both it and ITV offered to air a debate between the leaders on Sunday - two days before Parliament votes on Brexit. But Labour had said the BBC's proposed format was a ""mish-mash, with a lopsided panel of other politicians and public figures"" taking part. No 10 said Labour's objections were ""false and flimsy"". The BBC had wanted to include ""a range of voices"" in the programme, including members of other political parties, as well as a head-to-head between the leaders. The Downing Street spokesman said: ""We remain committed to holding a debate and will continue to press for a format that ensures a range of voices are heard alongside a substantial head to head."" Clash over who screens Brexit TV debate Ministers facing Brexit 'contempt' claims Laura Kuenssberg: Parliament 'taking back control' Several other parties had said they should be included in the debate -including the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and Greens. ITV says ""invitations remain open"" to both leaders to hold a debate on the channel this Sunday. The news about the BBC debate came as MPs geared up to begin five days of debate in Parliament over the Brexit withdrawal agreement. The BBC said last Thursday that the prime minister had accepted its offer to take part in a debate on Sunday night and it was waiting to hear from the Labour Party. Mr Corbyn then told ITV's This Morning that he preferred ITV's offer - partly because it would not clash with the final of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! on the same evening. On Saturday, the BBC released a further statement, saying its proposal included both a head-to-head debate and ""an opportunity to hear from a wider range of voices"". And in a statement on Monday night, ITV said ""invitations remained open"" to both leaders for its straight head-to-head debate - it confirmed this was still the case after the BBC said it was pulling out. In a statement on Tuesday, the BBC said its proposed format had included: A head-to-head debate between the leaders A discussion between eight panellists with a wide range of views on Brexit - including other politicians A further head-to-head debate Closing statements from each leader ""We have been clear throughout the whole of this process that, as well as a substantive head-to-head debate, any programme we broadcast would need to include other voices, including other political parties, to reflect the wide range of views the public and parliamentarians hold about Brexit,"" it said. ""We believe ours was a fair and appropriate format for those taking part and, crucially, for our audiences around the country, and it is a shame we will not be able to bring them this programme."" Earlier on Tuesday, Labour criticised Mrs May and her team for choosing their ""preferred broadcaster"" for the debate. The party's spokesman said she ""running away from the scrutiny"" of a head-to-head with Mr Corbyn by accepting the format over ITV's. But a Downing Street spokesman in turn accused Mr Corbyn of ""running scared of proper scrutiny"". ""The prime minister issued the original challenge to Jeremy Corbyn for a head-to-head debate, and despite her flexibility on timing and format, Jeremy Corbyn and Labour have done nothing but raise false and flimsy objections to the BBC's proposal.""
