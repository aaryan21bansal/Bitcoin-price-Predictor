Highlands nurse denied return to UK after holiday,"Ali Abunejmeh and his eight-year-old son Sebastien were on holiday visiting family in Jordan A Highlands nurse and his son have been trapped in Turkey for four weeks after an airline declined to accept his evidence of UK residency. Ali Abunejmeh, originally from Jordan, has lived in the UK for 15 years and has settled status. His residence card had expired, but the dad-of-three said the Home Office told him he could show alternative proof. He said he had spent Â£2,000 on food and accommodation and had missed shifts at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness. He and his eight-year-old son Sebastien were on holiday visiting family in Jordan and the West Bank. The latest headlines from Scotland,external More stories from the Highlands and Islands,external On 5 August the pair, who live in Nairn, were due to fly back to the UK via Antalya Airport in Turkey. Without an in-date residence card, Mr Abunejmeh used the Home Office's online'View and Prove' service,externalto show his settled status at the airport. But Turkish Airlines declined to accept this and would not allow them on the flight. The airline told BBC Scotland it was investigating the incident. The Home Office said non-European nationals must show airlines a valid UK residence card to prove their settled status. Its guidance also states that airlines ""may accept"" proof via View and Prove, if someone does not have a card. Mr Abunejmeh said: ""I hold a permanent residence in the UK and settlement status. The card that I have is expired. ""I was advised by the Home Office before travelling that I can show the carrier airline when travelling the status of my residency. ""The advice was that I would be able to prove my settlement status via the app I have. ""I tried to explain this to Turkish Airlines but they refused to let me board."" Mr Abunejmeh's settled status means he has the right to live, work and remain indefinitely in the UK free of immigration control. His wife is a Czech national and their three children all have British passports. However, his wife and two of the children were waiting for renewed passports and so did not travel with him. Mr Abunejmeh told BBC Scotland he had received little assistance from the Home Office or the airline after being turned away. He said: ""Me and my son were really stressed. We were told to call the British Embassy to find out what to do next. ""My son got really upset because he could not understand why he was not allowed on the flight."" Mr Abunejmeh has since applied for access to the UK as a close family member of a European national with UK immigration status. The process can take up to seven weeks. Families tell of agony over passport delays He is also waiting on a renewed biometric residence card. He said: ""I have spent almost Â£2,000 on accommodation and food so far, not mentioning that my son Sebastien should now be back in school. ""As a nurse with a contract, I have been booked for shifts and I have no way of knowing when I am going to be back. ""My son has a British passport but at the moment, my wife cannot fly out to Turkey to bring him back home. ""With me not working and my wife as a teacher on supply contract only, neither of us has got a regular income and it is causing us considerable financial difficulties."" A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Any non-EEA nationals granted settled status must carry their biometric residence card when travelling abroad and this should be in date. We will be in touch with Mr Abunejmeh.""

Nicola Sturgeon holding talks over council strikes,"Workers in Glasgow began emptying overflowing street bins after the first wave of strikes ended on Thursday morning Nicola Sturgeon is meeting unions and council leaders over the pay dispute that brought strikes across Scotland. The first minister is holding talks in Edinburgh on Thursday night as council workers seek an improved pay offer. Ms Sturgeon is meeting council leaders in St Andrew's House followed by talks with union representatives. Unions launched industrial action on 18 August. The Scottish government has not said what Ms Sturgeon plans to propose to try to end the dispute. Councillor Shona Morrison, president of local government body Cosla, told BBC Scotland: ""We are still in very active discussions at the moment and really keen to find a solution as soon as we can."" Earlier union sources said the talks were positive and that the discussion is moving in the right direction. The meeting comes as bin collections around Scotland resumed on Thursday after a first wave of strikes. When are the next bin strikes planned? Government 'cannot offer' more money to end strikes The view from both sides of the bin strike boundary There will be further strikes in 19 councils areas from 6-13 September. The walkout ended on Tuesday in Edinburgh and on Thursday in 13 other areas, including Glasgow and Aberdeen. Glasgow City Council warned residents there would be a ""significant delay"" to rubbish collections because of the extensive backlog. City of Edinburgh Council announced further changes to its collection schedule as the clear-up continued, urging residents to help by storing extra waste for a ""little longer"". This is the first time Nicola Sturgeon has become directly involved in this dispute between councils and their workforce. Her deputy John Swinney has taken the lead for the Scottish government until now. The first minister has been criticised by the Conservatives and others for taking a hands-off approach while rubbish was piling up in Edinburgh during the festivals. With further, and more widespread, disruption to bin collections planned and hundreds of schools and nurseries facing closure next week, Ms Sturgeon has decided to try and broker a compromise. It is not clear what carrots or sticks she might bring to her discussions with councils and trade unions but the Scottish government has previously insisted no more money is available. Edinburgh council leader Cammy Day said: ""Our crews have been working hard to catch up on collections and making every effort to collect significant volumes of litter across the city. ""The clear up is progressing well and we can already see the benefits of having the crews back out on the street keeping the city clean."" Public Health Scotland had warned of a human health risk from overflowing waste and advised councils to decontaminate areas where bins overflowed. Further strikes in many local authority areas are planned for next week On Monday Unite, the GMB and Unisonrejected an increased pay offer. The unions had been seeking an agreement from Cosla similar to the one made to council workers in England - which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay increase. Bin strikes around the country began after they rejected an initial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. The action escalated last week when refuse workers at a further 20 local authorities walked out despite a revised 5% offer. The second wave of strikes is due to begin on 6 September, with hundreds of schools and nurseries also scheduled to close. Refuse workers in Scotland want Cosla to match the offer made to their counterparts in England Cosla's offer of a Â£1,925 pay uplift matched the offer to council workers in England - but only part of this payment would be consolidated into staff salaries. The rest would be given as one-off cost-of-living payments. Unions said this meant lower-paid staff would not benefit as much as those on higher wages. The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay increase for staff. It has also offered a further Â£200m over two years to provide a cost-of-living payment to workers earning below Â£39,000. Deputy First Minister John Swinney has said there is no more money available to fund further pay increases as the government's finances are ""finite"". ""I have managed to find one-off sums of money to ensure that people on low incomes are able to get a Â£2,000 increase in their salary now. But the government cannot offer any more money,"" he said. Cosla said it was disappointed that unions had turned down an offer that was at the ""absolute extremes"" of affordability. Resources spokesperson Katie Hagmann said: ""We have done everything we possibly can to get to this stage and this offer - which is still on the table - is as good as it gets.""

OnlyFans pays owner $500m after spike in users,"Adult content subscription platform OnlyFans paid its owner $500m (Â£433m) in 18 months, accounts show. Leonid Radvinsky was paid $284m (Â£246m) in dividends in 2021 and another $233m (Â£201m) since November. Meanwhile, OnlyFans' two million content creators made nearly $4bn (Â£3.47bn) in 2021, the company has revealed. The platform, which is known for hosting adult content, saw a spike in users during the pandemic. It reported pre-tax profits of $433m last year, up from $61m in 2020. However, OnlyFans has faced criticism for not doing enough to prevent under-age individuals selling explicit content. The company said it was continually improving its approach to safety and content moderation. 'I'm using OnlyFans as a second job to pay bills' Under the skin of OnlyFans Founded in 2016, OnlyFans has 220 million users and more than two million creators worldwide. In 2021 it saw a 128% increase in the number of fans using the platform compared to the previous year, and a 34% rise in the number of creators. Overall, creator earnings were more than double what they were the previous year. OnlyFans takes a 20% commission on all payments made to its content creators. Chief executive Amrapali Gan said: ""We are empowering creators to monetise their content and have real control over it."" ""We will continue to invest in the creator economy by enhancing safety, developing original OFTV [the firm's free streaming platform] content, and continuing to grow our community of creators and fans,"" she added. Amrapali Gan took over as chief executive in December The site offers a platform for musicians, fitness trainers and celebrities to charge their followers for exclusive tips and visual content. But it is best known for allowing content creators, including porn stars and sex workers, to charge for sexually explicit photographs and videos. Last year the company announced that all sexually explicit content would be blocked from the platform, following pressure from banking partners. But following a backlash from its users, OnlyFans suspended the policy change a week later. In 2021, a BBC News investigationfound children had used fake IDs to set up accounts on the site. Following the report, the children's commissioner for England said OnlyFans needed to do more to stop under-age individuals selling explicit images on the platform. In response to the investigation, OnlyFans said it had closed the accounts and flagged and refunded all active subscriptions.

Chinese city of 21m locked down over Covid cases,"There are plans in place to test the city's entire population Chengdu has become the latest Chinese city to be locked down as Beijing continues to pursue its controversial ""zero-Covid"" policy. Around 21 million people have been ordered to stay indoors, with just one person per household allowed out for essential shopping. On Thursday, the city recorded 157 new infections, including 51 asymptomatic. China's Covid policies require cities to enter strict lockdowns - even if just a handful of cases are reported. However, Beijing's drive to ensure ""zero Covid"" has been accused of stifling economic growth, and has prompted rare public dissent from citizens. Chengdu's residents, asked to stay at home from 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Thursday, will all be tested over the coming days, but it was not clear when restrictions would be lifted. In the meantime, people have been banned from entering or leaving Chengdu, the capital of the south-west Sichuan province, with only residents able to show evidence of a negative Covid test allowed out to buy necessities. State media also reports that the start of schools' autumn term has been postponed and flights have been grounded. Health authorities labelled the situation ""extremely complex and severe"" and blamed the outbreak on mass gatherings during warm weather at a pair of swimming and entertainment venues.

The country has deployed a range of city-specific Covid prevention measures after the initial wave of the virus hit Wuhan in 2019. China is the world's last major economy attempting to entirely stamp out Covid outbreaks, claiming this is necessary to prevent wider surges of the virus which could overwhelm hospitals. The country has officially recorded fewer than 15,000 deaths since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Forest set new record for transfer-window signings,"Michy Batshuayi has won 45 caps for Belgium, scoring 25 goals Nottingham Forest have broken the British record for most signings in a single transfer window after an unprecedented summer of deals. The newly promoted Premier League side signed three players on Thursday to take their total to 21. The signed centre-back Willy Boly from Wolves, defender Loic Bade from Rennes and winger Josh Bowler from Blackpool. However, Forest's hopes of bringing in 28-year-old Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi from Chelsea fell through. All your Forest news and fan views in one place Batshuayi, who joined the Blues in 2016 and has had five loan spells at other clubs, is out of contract at the end of the season. Nevertheless, Forest have surpassed the previous British record of 19 signings, held jointly by Dundee United in the summer of 2000 and Livingston in 2001, according to football websiteTransfermarkt.,external The English record was previously held by Crystal Palace in the summer of 2013, with 17 signings. The Eagles added another five players to their squad in the winter transfer window to take their total for that season to 22. Manager Steve Cooper needed to strengthen the squad, having lost several key players from the side that won the Championship play-off final. Five left on free transfers, while first-choice goalkeeper Brice Samba joined Lens after rejecting a new contract. Djed Spence, James Garner, Philip Zinckernagel, Max Lowe and Keinan Davis - who were all at the City Ground on loan - have either returned to their parent clubs or joined other sides. Forest have spent big on several players including attacking midfielder Morgan Gibbs-White from Wolves for Â£25m, striker Taiwo Awoniyi from FC Union Berlin and defender Neco Williams from Liverpool for Â£18m apiece, and forward Emmanuel Dennis from Watford for Â£13m. They have also brought in midfielder Orel Mangala and centre-back Moussa Niakhate from Bundesliga clubs Stuttgart and Mainz respectively, along with right-back Giulian Biancone and central midfielder Remo Freuler. Forest have remarkably brought in three left-backs - Renan Lodi on loan from Atletico Madrid, plus Omar Richards from Bayern Munich and Harry Toffolo from Huddersfield. They also signed central midfielder Lewis O'Brien from the Championship side. Three free transfers were made - Jesse Lingard, Cheikhou Kouyate and Wayne Hennessey - while goalkeeper Dean Henderson arrived on loan from Manchester United. Brandon Aguilera and Hwang Ui-jo were also signed permanently but immediately sent on loan, to LD Alajuelense and Olympiakos respectively. On Thursday's transfer deadline day, Ivory Coast defender Boly was Forest's 19th signing. The left-footed centre-back, who can play in a back three or four, has signed a two-year deal. Boly, 31,failed to turn up for Wolves' game against Newcastle on Sunday,despite being included in the matchday squad, as he pushed for the move to the City Ground. ""I'm very excited to have a new adventure with this club,"" said Boly. ""I spoke to Morgan Gibbs-White [former team-mate at Wolves] before I came and I'd seen the spirit of the team and he said I'd love it because it is a big club - the fans and everyone wants to go in the same direction. ""I watched the game against Tottenham and the spirit of the team really impressed me. I was listening to the fans in that game and they were unbelievable."" All the latest updates, deals & reaction from deadline day Round-up of all the deadline day signings Transfer deadline day: 'He took all the training balls home' - when players want to leave Willy Boly scored nine goals in 147 games for Wolves Boly spent four years at Wolves, making 147 appearances in all competitions. Forest, who are playing in the Premier League for the first time in 23 years, have taken four points from their first five games, but were thrashed6-0 at Manchester Cityon Wednesday. The result means they have conceded 11 goals overall and Cooper clearly wanted further defensive reinforcements. Boly will be available for Forest's game against fellow promoted side Bournemouth on Saturday (15:00 BST). The record-setting 20th signing was Bowler, in a deal believed to be worth about Â£4m. The 23-year-old, who has scored two goals in seven Championship games this season, has immediately been sent on a season-long loan to Greek side Olympiakos. Bowler signed for Blackpool in June 2021 and scored seven league goals. Arrival number 21 was Rennes defender Bade on loan, with an option for a permanent deal. So, after a complete rebuild of the squad, just how will Cooper and his side fare? ""Forest will be fine that is for sure. They have done fantastic business. Sometimes you can buy too many players but Forest have brought in the right players,"" said former Crystal Palace striker Clinton Morrison. Jamie Carragher said strengthening in the market ""does not guarantee anything"" but there will be a ""real fear for other clubs"". The former Liverpool and England defender added: ""Forest are bringing players off the bench who cost Â£40m - they have real strength in depth and it will be a big worry for teams who expect promoted teams to go down. ""I think Forest will be seriously scaring people."" And ex-Forest striker Robert Earnshaw said: ""They needed to build a squad that represents them in the Premier League.

CCTV released of fleeing gunman in Olivia shooting,"This video can not be played Watch: CCTV shows gunman fleeing after Olivia Pratt-Korbel shooting CCTV footage of the gunman fleeing after the fatal shooting of Olivia Pratt-Korbel has been released. Merseyside Police revealed the shooter used two guns in the attack that killed the nine-year-old. Olivia was hit in the chest as her mother Cheryl Korbel tried to stop the gunman from entering their home in Dovecot, Liverpool, on 22 August. Ms Korbel was also injured, as was convicted drug dealer Joseph Nee, who was the intended target of the attack. Speaking as the footage was released, Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen warned those who were ""shielding"" the culprit that officers would do ""everything legitimately possible"" to bring them to justice. ""It is beyond comprehension how anyone can protect a person who is responsible for killing a nine-year-old little girl,"" he added. Olivia died after being shot as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door of her home In a press conference earlier, Det Ch Supt Kameen issued a direct plea to those who may have been asked to hide or dispose of the guns. ""I understand you may be frightened of contacting us, but I want you to do the right thing for Olivia and tell us where they are right now,"" he said. ""If you are hiding the guns and you have no intention of telling us, then I place you in the same category as the vile man responsible for the [killing]. ""And we will hunt you too."" He said the gunman was wearing a black padded jacket, a black balaclava with a peak and black gloves, and he was described as about 5ft 7in (1.7m), with a slim build. ""This is the man we are hunting for - we need to know where he went that night or did you see him in the area?"" he said. ""This man is toxic. ""He is toxic to our communities and if you are protecting him, he is toxic to you and your family."" Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen said the investigation had made ""significant progress"" He said the video had been released because people may recognise what the gunman was wearing when he ""callously ran away from Olivia's house"". ""This footage shows the gunman running along Finch Lane away from Kingsheath Avenue,"" he added. ""You then see him turn right into Berryford Road and go out of sight. ""We know he is climbing into and through people's gardens to avoid being seen."" Public must share pivotal Olivia details - police PC scooped up Olivia and ran, inquest told Police arrest 32 in Liverpool organised crime crackdown Det Ch Supt Kameen said police were also releasing footage of a man who was in the area at the time of the shooting who they wanted to trace. ""I'm interested in speaking to him as he may have information that is important to the inquiry by virtue of the fact he was in the area at the right time,"" he said. Police have asked a man who was in the area at the time of the shooting to get in touch Ten days on from Olivia's death, a collection of flowers, balloons and messages have continued to grow near the scene. Earlier, Ms Korbel, who is still receiving treatment for her injuries, and other family members visited the site to read the tributes left in the schoolgirl's memory. Duringthe opening of Olivia's inqueston Tuesday, Liverpool Senior Coroner Andre Rebello said armed response officers found her with a gunshot wound to her chest. He said a police officer had ""scooped"" up Olivia and ran with her to try to save her life, pressing his hand on her wound as she was taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in the back of a police car. However, despite the efforts of medical teams, she was pronounced dead at about 23:25 BST. A post-mortem examination found the cause of her death was a gunshot wound to the chest. Adjourning the inquest to 4 January, the coroner released Olivia's body to her family for burial. A 36-year-old man from Huyton and a 33-year-old from Dovecot were arrested on suspicion of murder and two counts of attempted murder in relation to Olivia's death in the days after the shooting andhave since been released on bail.

Rev Peter Smith said more people had since attended the church of the Holy Spirit, Dovecot, to pray for Olivia. He added that the people of Liverpool ""will never get over this"". Meanwhile floral tributes continue to build in Kingsheath Avenue, where Olivia was shot. Olivia's mother was injured as she tried to the shut the door, but the attacker fired more shots at the man he had pursued. Police appealed for further information about a black Audi Q3 that was seen leaving Kingsheath Avenue, Dovecot, after the shooting on 22 August. The vehicle is believed to be the same car used to take intended target Joseph Nee, 35, to hospital. Rev Peter Smith said the feeling in the community was one of ""devastation, shock and horror"" Rev Smith toldBBC North West Tonightthat the people of Liverpool ""will never get over this and would never forget this"". ""But, people will get on with their daily lives and are just trying to get back to normal, whatever normal is in the wake of something as horrific as this,"" he said.

Turnbull hosted BBC Breakfast for 15 years, in both London and later Salford, and also fronted Songs of Praise and game show Think Tank. His family said: ""Bill will be remembered by many as a remarkable broadcaster who brought warmth and humour into people's homes"". In 2018, he announced he had beendiagnosed with prostate cancer. Obituary: Beloved BBC Breakfast host In pictures: A look back at Bill Turnbull's life After leaving the BBC in 2016, he joined Classic FM, and continued presenting shows on the network until recently. His family added: ""Following a challenging and committed fight against prostate cancer, Bill passed away peacefully at his home in Suffolk surrounded by his family on Wednesday, 31 August.""

She said meeting him was ""life-changing"" - he was her first partner on Strictly - and ""he made TV magical, he told me what it was about"", she said, adding he would help critique her appearances on Breakfast.

BBC Radio 4's Today programme presenter Nick Robinson described Turnbull as ""a very, very dear friend and an extraordinary broadcaster.""

In recent years, Turnbull guest presented episodes of The One Show andreunited with Reidfor several editions of ITV's Good Morning Britain. After his cancer diagnosis was made public,he fronted a documentaryfor Channel 4 called Bill Turnbull: Staying Alive, in which he explored the use of cannabis oil for medicinal purposes. Prostate Cancer UK said that after Turnbull announced he had the illness in March 2018, their specialist nurses experienced their ""busiest day on record"" and they saw a huge rise in web traffic of men looking for information and support. In November 2017, Turnbull took part in a celebrity edition of The Great British Bake Off - which was in aid of a charity, Stand Up to Cancer. He found out about his prostate cancer during filming. He said inspiring men to get tested for the illness by publicly revealing his own diagnosis was the ""one useful thing"" he had done in his life, admitting he was ""cross with myself"" for the pride he had felt at not visiting a GP in four years. It's the most common cancer in men in the UK - an ageing population means more men are developing and dying from the disease 40,000 new cases are diagnosed and around 11,000 men die from it each year It can develop slowly over years and many men have no symptoms Noticeable symptoms include needing to urinate more often and weak flow There is no single test for prostate cancer - a blood test, biopsies and physical examinations are all used This video can not be played We explain what warning signs to look out for Memories of BBC presenter Bill Turnbull.

"Go nuclear, go large with Sizewell C, says PM","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Go nuclear, and go large and go with Sizewell C."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged Â£700m for a new nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coast, with a call to ""go nuclear and go large and go with Sizewell C"". In a speech at Sizewell, he said he was ""confident"" the plant would go ahead. The project, which is being developed by French energy company EDF, is estimated to cost about Â£20bn overall. Critics have argued Sizewell C will be hugely expensive and take years to build. The governmentgave the go-ahead for the plant in Julywith negotiations on raising funds continuing. It is not expected to begin generating electricity until the 2030s. ""We need to pull our national finger out and get on with Sizewell C,"" the outgoing PM said. ""That's why we're putting Â£700m into the deal, just part of the Â£1.7bn of government funding available for developing a large-scale nuclear project to final investment stage in this parliament. ""In the course of the next few weeks I am absolutely confident that it will get over the line."" PM backs nuclear power plant funding How much nuclear power does the UK use? What is Sizewell C? Mr Johnson said the war in Ukraine, which has pushed up gas prices, had demonstrated the need for new nuclear generation capacity in the UK. In his final major policy speech before he leaves office, he argued the reluctance of previous governments to back nuclear energy had helped drive up bills. The PM described the problem as ""myopia"", adding: ""It is called short-termism. It is a chronic case of politicians not being able to see beyond the political cycle."" ""Let's think about the future, let's think about our kids and our grandchildren, about the next generation,"" he said. ""And so I say to you, with the prophetic candour and clarity of one who is about to hand over the torch of office, I say go nuclear and go large and go with Sizewell C."" Tom Greatrex, head of the Nuclear Industry Association, called the announcement an ""important step toward cutting gas, cutting bills and creating stable, secure well-paid jobs for people up and down the country"". However, former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said that Sizewell C was ""massively costly, achingly slow, and carries huge unnecessary risks"". She added that the ""enormous upfront cost"" would be passed on to consumers. The Stop Sizewell campaign group said: ""When every penny matters, it's totally wrong to shackle the next prime minister and billions in taxpayers' money to this damaging project, whose ballooning cost, lengthy construction, failure-prone technology and long term water supply are so uncertain."" The group urged Mr Johnson's successor to review the project and focus on ""cheaper, quicker renewables and insulation"". Labour said the government had an ""appalling legacy"" on clean power, accusing it of blocking onshore wind and delaying the expansion of solar and nuclear power. Mr Johnson's speech was made against the backdrop of an energy crisis which looks set to worsen over the winter, with household bills soaring. The war in Ukraine has pushed up the price of gas and renewed concerns about energy security. The crisis is likely to dominate the agenda for whoever succeeds Mr Johnson as PM. Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss - who pollsters have tipped to win the contest -hinted on Wednesday she would look at providing further supportto businesses and households. She also ruled out energy rationing - unlike rival Rishi Sunak, who said it should not be taken off the table. Today's speech from Boris Johnson would have been significant had he been able to announce the deal to build a new nuclear power station had been sealed. But he can't, and the Â£700m he is pledging is considered to be too small a sum to guarantee the participation of private investors and EDF. So why do it? The Â£700m comes from a Â£1.7bn fund for nuclear already agreed by the cabinet - so he can't be accused of entering into new financial arrangements which would bind the hands of his successor. Whether the project goes ahead will be up to the new occupant of No 10. But he was issuing a statement of intent - and making it more difficult, should his successor wish, to back out. While his speech largely blamed Labour for ""myopia"" on energy, it seemed to contain a coded message to the next PM not to put new domestic projects on hold while dealing with the short term, but severe, challenge of soaring bills. Both candidates are committed to new nuclear. But if they are tempted to delay, Boris Johnson can make it clear that is one thing that he can't be blamed for. The Sizewell C project is expected to generate about 7% of the UK's electricity needs and operate for 60 years. It would be built next to the existing Sizewell B, which is still generating electricity, and Sizewell A, which has been decommissioned. EDF has said the plant could generate 3.2 gigawatts of electricity, enough for about six million homes. Go nuclear, go large and go with Sizewell C - Johnson.

House price growth at 10% despite squeezed budgets,"UK house prices rose by 10% in the year to August, the Nationwide has said, despite pressure on buyers' budgets. The market still has greater demand from buyers than homes for sale, leading to a double-digit annual rise for the 10th consecutive month. The mortgage lender said the typical property price had risen by Â£50,000 in the past two years to Â£273,751. However, the Nationwide said there were signs the market was cooling, as both energy costs and mortgage rates rise. The annual growth in house prices did slow slightly last month, down from 11% in July, but the market remains tough for first-time buyers. ""Fast-rising rents are not offering any relief and could keep some buyers in the hunt for a home for longer than they would like,"" said Myron Jobson, senior personal finance analyst at Interactive Investor, ""Even though the housing market is slowing, it is nowhere near a crash. Strong demand for homes far outstripping available housing inventory means the housing market remains a difficult one for wannabe homeowners and those looking to climb up the property ladder."" How will a recession hit the UK housing market? Over-50s turn to house-shares to beat rising rents The Nationwide is predicting that an increase in energy costs and rising mortgage interest rates will add to the pressure on household budgets in the coming months. It suggested that the least energy efficient property could typically see bills surge by Â£2,700 a year, or Â£225 a month. ""There are signs that the housing market is losing some momentum,"" said Robert Gardner, Nationwide's chief economist. ""We expect the market to slow further as pressure on household budgets intensifies in the coming quarters, with inflation set remain in double digits into next year. ""Moreover, the Bank of England is widely expected to continue raising interest rates, which will also exert a cooling impact on the market if this feeds through to mortgage rates, which have already increased noticeably in recent months.""

Pound in biggest monthly fall since 2016The last time the pound fell so much against the dollar was in the aftermath of the UK's Brexit vote.BusinessComments,"Worries over the prospects for the UK economy led the pound to slide by about 5% against the US dollar in August. The last time the pound fell so much against the dollar was in October 2016, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Sterling sank again on Thursday morning, dipping below $1.16 on the currency markets. Analysts said the fall reflects the darkening outlook for the economy, with consumers and businesses facing rising prices and soaring energy bills. The Bank of England has predicted the UK will fall into recession towards the end of this year. The weak pound means Brits travelling overseas will find their spending money will not stretch as far. UK economy shrinks as outlook on recession darkens Bank's recession warning matters to everyone ""Our economic prospects are not looking particularly good compared to the rest of the world,"" said Laura Lambie, senior investment director at Investec. Ms Lambie said that recession fears were weighing on markets, with the investment bank Goldman Sachs warning this week that the UK could remain in recession until 2024. A recession is defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods. August was also the worst month for the pound against the euro since the middle of last year. UK government bonds - or debt - had their worst month for decades. Investors, worried about the riskiness of lending to the government, demanded higher returns for doing so, making it more expensive for the country to borrow money. In August, the yields, or the effective interest rate you would get, on some of those bonds have jumped the most since 1994. Colin Ellis from ratings agency Moody's told the BBC's Today programme the jump in yields needed to be put in context. ""Energy bills are very very high, and set to go up again. which means inflation is going to be high and that the Bank of England is raising interest rates in response. ""Those expectations for higher interest rates are part of what's driving these moves in the bond market at the moment."" However, he said: ""We still have a stable outlook on our UK government rating so we see the risk as broadly balanced. We're not very concerned but of course a lot will depend on the policies that the next government chooses to put into place."" Fears have grown over the prospects for the UK economy after figures showed it shrank between April and June, with businesses and households feeling the impact of rising prices. Those concerns were fuelled on Thursday, with a new study suggesting the manufacturing sector shrank in August for the first time since May 2020. Separately, a report by the Resolution Foundation think tank said typical household disposable incomes are on course to fall by 10%, or Â£3,000, over this year and next, which is called the ""the deepest living standards squeeze in a century"". The cost-of-living crisis is set to be the biggest challenge facing the new Prime Minister. Both Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have come under pressure to outline how they would support households if they succeed in getting the keys to Number 10. ''Grim forecasts about poverty spreading across the UK this winter highlight the deepening woes for the UK economy"", said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The Bank of England raised interest rates to 1.75% in August, while forecasting that the UK economy would fall into recession this year. But Ms Streeter predicts that the Bank of England might be forced to slow down rate rises in the coming months, given the cost of living crisis. The pound's weakness is also a result of a strong dollar, analysts said. The dollar is performing strongly due to US interest rate rises and because investors see it as a safer bet. Last week, the head of the country's central bank, the Federal Reserve,indicated it would push ahead with further interest rate risesas it seeks to control inflation. ""The dollar has been exceptionally strong,"" Ms Lambie said. ""Also, the issues that we've had in Europe around energy do not have the same impact as the US, and I think economists are fairly agreed that the US will be the last to go into recession if they do go into recession at all, perhaps following the UK and Europe.

"Chinese city of 21m locked down over Covid casesThe country is sticking to a ""zero Covid"" policy, requiring lockdowns over a handful of cases.China","There are plans in place to test the city's entire population Chengdu has become the latest Chinese city to be locked down as Beijing continues to pursue its controversial ""zero-Covid"" policy. Around 21 million people have been ordered to stay indoors, with just one person per household allowed out for essential shopping. On Thursday, the city recorded 157 new infections, including 51 asymptomatic. China's Covid policies require cities to enter strict lockdowns - even if just a handful of cases are reported. However, Beijing's drive to ensure ""zero Covid"" has been accused of stifling economic growth, and has prompted rare public dissent from citizens. Chengdu's residents, asked to stay at home from 18:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on Thursday, will all be tested over the coming days, but it was not clear when restrictions would be lifted. In the meantime, people have been banned from entering or leaving Chengdu, the capital of the south-west Sichuan province, with only residents able to show evidence of a negative Covid test allowed out to buy necessities. State media also reports that the start of schools' autumn term has been postponed and flights have been grounded. Health authorities labelled the situation ""extremely complex and severe"" and blamed the outbreak on mass gatherings during warm weather at a pair of swimming and entertainment venues.

Pound in biggest monthly fall since 2016,"Worries over the prospects for the UK economy led the pound to slide by about 5% against the US dollar in August. The last time the pound fell so much against the dollar was in October 2016, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Sterling sank again on Thursday morning, dipping below $1.16 on the currency markets. Analysts said the fall reflects the darkening outlook for the economy, with consumers and businesses facing rising prices and soaring energy bills. The Bank of England has predicted the UK will fall into recession towards the end of this year. The weak pound means Brits travelling overseas will find their spending money will not stretch as far. UK economy shrinks as outlook on recession darkens Bank's recession warning matters to everyone ""Our economic prospects are not looking particularly good compared to the rest of the world,"" said Laura Lambie, senior investment director at Investec. Ms Lambie said that recession fears were weighing on markets, with the investment bank Goldman Sachs warning this week that the UK could remain in recession until 2024. A recession is defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods. August was also the worst month for the pound against the euro since the middle of last year. UK government bonds - or debt - had their worst month for decades. Investors, worried about the riskiness of lending to the government, demanded higher returns for doing so, making it more expensive for the country to borrow money. In August, the yields, or the effective interest rate you would get, on some of those bonds have jumped the most since 1994. Colin Ellis from ratings agency Moody's told the BBC's Today programme the jump in yields needed to be put in context. ""Energy bills are very very high, and set to go up again. which means inflation is going to be high and that the Bank of England is raising interest rates in response. ""Those expectations for higher interest rates are part of what's driving these moves in the bond market at the moment."" However, he said: ""We still have a stable outlook on our UK government rating so we see the risk as broadly balanced. We're not very concerned but of course a lot will depend on the policies that the next government chooses to put into place."" Fears have grown over the prospects for the UK economy after figures showed it shrank between April and June, with businesses and households feeling the impact of rising prices. Those concerns were fuelled on Thursday, with a new study suggesting the manufacturing sector shrank in August for the first time since May 2020. Separately, a report by the Resolution Foundation think tank said typical household disposable incomes are on course to fall by 10%, or Â£3,000, over this year and next, which is called the ""the deepest living standards squeeze in a century"". The cost-of-living crisis is set to be the biggest challenge facing the new Prime Minister. Both Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have come under pressure to outline how they would support households if they succeed in getting the keys to Number 10. ''Grim forecasts about poverty spreading across the UK this winter highlight the deepening woes for the UK economy"", said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The Bank of England raised interest rates to 1.75% in August, while forecasting that the UK economy would fall into recession this year. But Ms Streeter predicts that the Bank of England might be forced to slow down rate rises in the coming months, given the cost of living crisis. The pound's weakness is also a result of a strong dollar, analysts said. The dollar is performing strongly due to US interest rate rises and because investors see it as a safer bet. Last week, the head of the country's central bank, the Federal Reserve,indicated it would push ahead with further interest rate risesas it seeks to control inflation. ""The dollar has been exceptionally strong,"" Ms Lambie said. ""Also, the issues that we've had in Europe around energy do not have the same impact as the US, and I think economists are fairly agreed that the US will be the last to go into recession if they do go into recession at all, perhaps following the UK and Europe. ""So on both sides, from the sterling side and from the dollar side, that's really what has weakened sterling and strengthened the dollar.""

"Charities launch urgent Pakistan flooding appealMore than 1,100 people have been killed and many injured as roads, crops and homes are washed away.","Anurgent appeal,externalis being launched by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) to help millions of people affected by devastating floods in Pakistan. Fifteen UK charities, including the British Red Cross and Oxfam, are asking the public for donations to protect lives as waters carry on rising. At least 1,136 people have been killed in Pakistan since June by what the UN is calling a ""monsoon on steroids"". People are surviving without clean water, food and shelter, the DEC says. The UK government has pledged Â£10m in funding for international aid agencies to help provide water, sanitation and shelter, and to protect women and girls. The money will also help families repair their homes and maintain their livelihoods. The government has said it will also match pound-for-pound the first Â£5m raised by the DEC appeal. British Pakistanis trying to help homeland UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who is competing alongside Rishi Sunak to become the next prime minister, said the UK stood with Pakistan and would do all it could to get life-saving aid to the most vulnerable. Since the start of the rainy season in June, Pakistan has been hit with extreme monsoon rainfall - more than twice the monthly average. Now, more than a third of the country is completely submerged by the heaviest recorded rainfall in a decade, Pakistan's climate change minister has said. The floods have also submerged vital infrastructure and farmland, killing livestock and destroying two million acres of crops, threatening future harvests. About 33 million people have been affected, with one million homes destroyed, the UN has estimated. Your device may not support this visualisation Experts said the situation was likely to get worse as heavy rains continue over areas already inundated. The DEC is urging everyone to donate whatever they can spare to help relief efforts. Its chief executive Saleh Saeed said: ""The scale of these floods has caused a shocking level of destruction - crops have been swept away and livestock killed across huge swathes of the country, which means hunger will follow."" He acknowledged the appeal came at a difficult time for many Britons as they struggle with the cost-of-living crisis but urged everyone to give whatever they could. A separate appeal has been launched by the UNto raise Â£138m to help Pakistan. The chief executive of the human rights body, Antonio Guterres, said the country was facing ""a monsoon on steroids"", and asked for funding to help those suffering in the ""climate crisis hotspot"". In a video message, Mr Guterres said: ""Let's stop sleepwalking towards the destruction of our planet by climate change. Today, it's Pakistan. Tomorrow, it could be your country."" The committee brings together 15 leading UK aid charities to provide and deliver aid to ensure successful appeals The charities include Oxfam, Save the Children UK, Age International, British Red Cross, Cafod, Christian Aid and Islamic Relief Its website,externalprovides more details of its current appeals Pakistan floods: Images show huge scale of devastation One-third of Pakistan is under water - minister Pakistan floods are monsoon on steroids - UN Israel and Hamas reach Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, sources tell BBC UK's Chagos handover on hold to allow Trump to consider the deal Why the small drop in inflation matters to you The new Lockerbie drama provoking fierce criticism from victims' families What happens if TikTok is banned?

Here are some of the highlights...  The Scottish football live text is still going socheck that outif you'd like. Bye. OK we're going to call it a night here we think. Let's just find out tomorrow if Denis Zakaria or Marcos Alonso have got their moves to or from Chelsea. I'll leave you with a link to some of our top stories today... Nottingham Forest Now they have finally stopped buying players, we can confirm Nottingham Forest have broken the British record for most signings in a window. They brought in 21 signings this summer following their promotion to the Premier League. That surpasses the previous British record, held jointly by Livingston in summer 2001 and Dundee United in 2000 (19 signings, according to football websiteTransfermarkt,external). Alistair MagowanBBC Sport Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's arrival at Chelsea for Â£10m takes the club's spending to about Â£270m during the summer window under the new owners. That is a club record and verging on a record outlay for any club after Real Madrid spent about Â£272m in 2019. Thomas Tuchel will be happy the window is now closed, he knows what he has for the next few months and he can try to improve them on the training pitch as they try to recover from a patchy start to the season. No word yet whether Denis Zakaria will be joining on loan from Juventus. I'm just going to get a raspberry drink from my fizzy drink machine like the mature grown-up I am. Hopefully nobody announces anything in the next two minutes. Chelsea left-back Marcos Alonso was meant to go in the opposite direction to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but no mention of him in either club's statement. Chelsea Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly said: ""Pierre-Emerick is an elite striker with a proven track record in the Premier League and his arrival strengthens our squad, giving us new attacking options. ""We are thrilled to have Pierre-Emerick on board with us in the new era at Chelsea and weâre really looking forward to working with him."" Dare I say a rare bit of good business from Barcelona? They signed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for free in February and he scored plenty of goals for them last season. This summer they upgraded to Robert Lewandowski and now they have made a Â£10m profit on Aubameyang. Chelsea Chelsea may not have revealed the fee for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang... but Barcelona have. It's Â£10.3m (12m euros). A Barca statement read: ""FC Barcelona publicly expresses its gratitude to Aubameyang for his professionalism, commitment, dedication and ever-present positive and warm approach regarding every aspect involving the club. ""We wish him the best of fortune and every success in the future. Your smile radiated happiness both on and off the pitch, thank you. Barca will always be your home."" Chelsea New Chelsea striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang said: ""Iâm really happy. Itâs an honour to be part of this team and I canât wait to start. I have some unfinished business with the Premier League so itâs good to be back and really exciting."" Chelsea sign Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Barcelona Chelsea Chelsea have finally confirmed the signing of Barcelona striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for an undisclosed fee. The 33-year-old, who only joined Barca in February from Arsenal, has signed a two-year deal at Stamford Bridge. HERE WE GO. Rangers are due just over Â£1m from the sale of Billy Gilmour to Brighton. They sold him to the London side in 2017. Brighton sign Chelsea's Billy Gilmour for Â£7.5m Brighton & Hove Albion It's confirmed now. Brighton have completed the permanent signing of Chelsea and Scotland midfielder Billy Gilmour for an initial fee of Â£7.5m, which could rise to Â£10m. The 21-year-old was on loan at Norwich last season. Simon StoneBBC Sport reporter Billy Gilmour's move from Chelsea to Brighton was completed before the deadline but we're waiting for the official announcement. The fee is Â£7.5m, rising to Â£10m. Leeds sign Wilfried Gnonto from Zurich Leeds United This one went under our radar a bit. Leeds have signed Italy striker Wilfried Gnonto for an undisclosed fee from FC Zurich. The 18-year-old became Italy's youngest ever international scorer earlier this year. Former England women's player Siobhan Chamberlain:""A signing to watch out for has got to be Fabio Carvalho at Liverpool. As a Fulham fan, he was brilliant for us last season and the response he gave his team to win those three points against Newcastle was absolutely phenomenal - it was a great finish. ""He has just turned 20 - to be able to score such an important goal to win his team three points shows his character and his ability so he is a player that has gone under the radar, potentially."" Simon StoneBBC Sport reporter [Â£1.9bn spent] this is the financial power of the Premier League. We are into a new TV cycle. A lot of the overseas deals are six-year deals, including the one with NBC in America, which is massive. This is giving the Premier League clubs a massive advantage over all their counterparts at every level in Europe. If we are being honest, this is why the big European clubs are all really scared of the Premier League and why the Super League got pushed. Apologies, it's two Chelsea deals we're waiting for, not one - Denis Zakaria and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. Some news on the Chelsea Twitter feed... But it's to tell us Kenedy has joined Real Valldolid on a permanent deal, ending a seven-year stay at Stamford Bridge. Â© 2025 BBC.

He said inspiring men to get tested for the illness by publicly revealing his own diagnosis was the ""one useful thing"" he had done in his life, admitting he was ""cross with myself"" for the pride he had felt at not visiting a GP in four years. It's the most common cancer in men in the UK - an ageing population means more men are developing and dying from the disease 40,000 new cases are diagnosed and around 11,000 men die from it each year It can develop slowly over years and many men have no symptoms Noticeable symptoms include needing to urinate more often and weak flow There is no single test for prostate cancer - a blood test, biopsies and physical examinations are all used This video can not be played We explain what warning signs to look out for Memories of BBC presenter Bill Turnbull.

""It was a great comfort to Bill that so many more men are now testing earlier for this disease,"" they said, calling him a ""wonderful husband and father to his three children"" and a devoted Wycombe Wanderers fan and ""an ever-aspiring beekeeper"". Turnbull was a favourite with viewers on BBC Breakfast thanks to his gentle presenting style, which was well suited to early morning broadcasting. During his time on the show, he worked alongside Sian Williams, Susanna Reid, Kate Silverton, Natasha Kaplinsky and Louise Minchin. His former colleagues Naga Munchetty and Charlie Stayt, who were presenting Thursday's programme, paid an emotional tribute just after the news was announced. Turnbull presented BBC Breakfast for 15 years, and later moved to radio station Classic FM Munchetty said: ""As a team we are in shock this morning. He cared so much about this programme and the audience. I did my first ever shift with him on Breakfast."" ""His energy was amazing. He came into this programme and threw everything at it. He was funny; he was a brilliant journalist. He loved this programme and he loved serving you, the audience,"" she said. Stayt added that Turnbull ""didn't take himself too seriously"". The programme's editor Richard Frediani confirmed on Thursday that Friday's Breakfast would be ""a celebration of Bill's life on and off-screen"".

She said meeting him was ""life-changing"" - he was her first partner on Strictly - and ""he made TV magical, he told me what it was about"", she said, adding he would help critique her appearances on Breakfast.

""There was a warmth to his broadcasting which people who watch Breakfast television every day knew,"" he said. ""But perhaps what they forgot was what a bloody good journalist he was. This was a man who'd been a correspondent in Washington, who travelled 30 countries. He'd been in Moscow, he'd covered wars, he'd reported on the troubles in Northern Ireland."" He added: ""And that combination of a razor-sharp intellect, wit, humour and humanity, came out every day when he was on Breakfast. It came out every day when he was a reporter on this programme. And listeners to Classic FM will have heard him present beautifully as well his love of music."" Robinson also recalled how Turnbull and his wife [Sarah] had met on the Today programme, where they had worked. Broadcaster and writer Monty Don called Turnbull ""a thoroughly decent, good man"",adding,external: ""We shared an enthusiasm for bees and were both patrons of Bees for Development charity."" Prior to working on Breakfast, Turnbull also worked as a reporter on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC News 24, as the news channel was then known. In recent years, Turnbull guest presented episodes of The One Show andreunited with Reidfor several editions of ITV's Good Morning Britain. After his cancer diagnosis was made public,he fronted a documentaryfor Channel 4 called Bill Turnbull: Staying Alive, in which he explored the use of cannabis oil for medicinal purposes. Prostate Cancer UK said that after Turnbull announced he had the illness in March 2018, their specialist nurses experienced their ""busiest day on record"" and they saw a huge rise in web traffic of men looking for information and support. In November 2017, Turnbull took part in a celebrity edition of The Great British Bake Off - which was in aid of a charity, Stand Up to Cancer. He found out about his prostate cancer during filming. He said inspiring men to get tested for the illness by publicly revealing his own diagnosis was the ""one useful thing"" he had done in his life, admitting he was ""cross with myself"" for the pride he had felt at not visiting a GP in four years. It's the most common cancer in men in the UK - an ageing population means more men are developing and dying from the disease 40,000 new cases are diagnosed and around 11,000 men die from it each year It can develop slowly over years and many men have no symptoms Noticeable symptoms include needing to urinate more often and weak flow There is no single test for prostate cancer - a blood test, biopsies and physical examinations are all used This video can not be played We explain what warning signs to look out for Memories of BBC presenter Bill Turnbull.

"Go nuclear, go large, go with Sizewell C, says PM","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Go nuclear, and go large and go with Sizewell C."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged Â£700m for a new nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coast, with a call to ""go nuclear and go large and go with Sizewell C"". In a speech at Sizewell, he said he was ""confident"" the plant would go ahead. The project, which is being developed by French energy company EDF, is estimated to cost about Â£20bn overall. Critics have argued Sizewell C will be hugely expensive and take years to build. The governmentgave the go-ahead for the plant in Julywith negotiations on raising funds continuing. It is not expected to begin generating electricity until the 2030s. ""We need to pull our national finger out and get on with Sizewell C,"" the outgoing PM said. ""That's why we're putting Â£700m into the deal, just part of the Â£1.7bn of government funding available for developing a large-scale nuclear project to final investment stage in this parliament. ""In the course of the next few weeks I am absolutely confident that it will get over the line."" PM backs nuclear power plant funding How much nuclear power does the UK use? What is Sizewell C? Mr Johnson said the war in Ukraine, which has pushed up gas prices, had demonstrated the need for new nuclear generation capacity in the UK. In his final major policy speech before he leaves office, he argued the reluctance of previous governments to back nuclear energy had helped drive up bills. The PM described the problem as ""myopia"", adding: ""It is called short-termism. It is a chronic case of politicians not being able to see beyond the political cycle."" ""Let's think about the future, let's think about our kids and our grandchildren, about the next generation,"" he said. ""And so I say to you, with the prophetic candour and clarity of one who is about to hand over the torch of office, I say go nuclear and go large and go with Sizewell C."" Tom Greatrex, head of the Nuclear Industry Association, called the announcement an ""important step toward cutting gas, cutting bills and creating stable, secure well-paid jobs for people up and down the country"". However, former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said that Sizewell C was ""massively costly, achingly slow, and carries huge unnecessary risks"". She added that the ""enormous upfront cost"" would be passed on to consumers. The Stop Sizewell campaign group said: ""When every penny matters, it's totally wrong to shackle the next prime minister and billions in taxpayers' money to this damaging project, whose ballooning cost, lengthy construction, failure-prone technology and long term water supply are so uncertain."" The group urged Mr Johnson's successor to review the project and focus on ""cheaper, quicker renewables and insulation"". Labour said the government had an ""appalling legacy"" on clean power, accusing it of blocking onshore wind and delaying the expansion of solar and nuclear power. Mr Johnson's speech was made against the backdrop of an energy crisis which looks set to worsen over the winter, with household bills soaring. The war in Ukraine has pushed up the price of gas and renewed concerns about energy security. The crisis is likely to dominate the agenda for whoever succeeds Mr Johnson as PM. Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss - who pollsters have tipped to win the contest -hinted on Wednesday she would look at providing further supportto businesses and households. She also ruled out energy rationing - unlike rival Rishi Sunak, who said it should not be taken off the table. Today's speech from Boris Johnson would have been significant had he been able to announce the deal to build a new nuclear power station had been sealed. But he can't, and the Â£700m he is pledging is considered to be too small a sum to guarantee the participation of private investors and EDF. So why do it? The Â£700m comes from a Â£1.7bn fund for nuclear already agreed by the cabinet - so he can't be accused of entering into new financial arrangements which would bind the hands of his successor. Whether the project goes ahead will be up to the new occupant of No 10. But he was issuing a statement of intent - and making it more difficult, should his successor wish, to back out. While his speech largely blamed Labour for ""myopia"" on energy, it seemed to contain a coded message to the next PM not to put new domestic projects on hold while dealing with the short term, but severe, challenge of soaring bills. Both candidates are committed to new nuclear. But if they are tempted to delay, Boris Johnson can make it clear that is one thing that he can't be blamed for. The Sizewell C project is expected to generate about 7% of the UK's electricity needs and operate for 60 years. It would be built next to the existing Sizewell B, which is still generating electricity, and Sizewell A, which has been decommissioned. EDF has said the plant could generate 3.2 gigawatts of electricity, enough for about six million homes. Go nuclear, go large and go with Sizewell C - Johnson.

Charities launch urgent Pakistan flooding appeal,"Anurgent appeal,externalis being launched by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) to help millions of people affected by devastating floods in Pakistan. Fifteen UK charities, including the British Red Cross and Oxfam, are asking the public for donations to protect lives as waters carry on rising. At least 1,136 people have been killed in Pakistan since June by what the UN is calling a ""monsoon on steroids"". People are surviving without clean water, food and shelter, the DEC says. The UK government has pledged Â£10m in funding for international aid agencies to help provide water, sanitation and shelter, and to protect women and girls. The money will also help families repair their homes and maintain their livelihoods. The government has said it will also match pound-for-pound the first Â£5m raised by the DEC appeal. British Pakistanis trying to help homeland UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, who is competing alongside Rishi Sunak to become the next prime minister, said the UK stood with Pakistan and would do all it could to get life-saving aid to the most vulnerable. Since the start of the rainy season in June, Pakistan has been hit with extreme monsoon rainfall - more than twice the monthly average. Now, more than a third of the country is completely submerged by the heaviest recorded rainfall in a decade, Pakistan's climate change minister has said. The floods have also submerged vital infrastructure and farmland, killing livestock and destroying two million acres of crops, threatening future harvests. About 33 million people have been affected, with one million homes destroyed, the UN has estimated. Your device may not support this visualisation Experts said the situation was likely to get worse as heavy rains continue over areas already inundated. The DEC is urging everyone to donate whatever they can spare to help relief efforts. Its chief executive Saleh Saeed said: ""The scale of these floods has caused a shocking level of destruction - crops have been swept away and livestock killed across huge swathes of the country, which means hunger will follow."" He acknowledged the appeal came at a difficult time for many Britons as they struggle with the cost-of-living crisis but urged everyone to give whatever they could. A separate appeal has been launched by the UNto raise Â£138m to help Pakistan. The chief executive of the human rights body, Antonio Guterres, said the country was facing ""a monsoon on steroids"", and asked for funding to help those suffering in the ""climate crisis hotspot"". In a video message, Mr Guterres said: ""Let's stop sleepwalking towards the destruction of our planet by climate change. Today, it's Pakistan. Tomorrow, it could be your country."" The committee brings together 15 leading UK aid charities to provide and deliver aid to ensure successful appeals The charities include Oxfam, Save the Children UK, Age International, British Red Cross, Cafod, Christian Aid and Islamic Relief Its website,externalprovides more details of its current appeals Pakistan floods: Images show huge scale of devastation One-third of Pakistan is under water - minister Pakistan floods are monsoon on steroids - UN Israel and Hamas reach Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal, sources tell BBC UK's Chagos handover on hold to allow Trump to consider the deal Why the small drop in inflation matters to you The new Lockerbie drama provoking fierce criticism from victims' families What happens if TikTok is banned?

Breaking|Breaking newsOlivia police release footage of fleeing gunman,"This video can not be played Watch: CCTV shows gunman fleeing after Olivia Pratt-Korbel shooting CCTV footage of the gunman fleeing after the fatal shooting of Olivia Pratt-Korbel has been released. Merseyside Police revealed the shooter used two guns in the attack that killed the nine-year-old. Olivia was hit in the chest as her mother Cheryl Korbel tried to stop the gunman from entering their home in Dovecot, Liverpool, on 22 August. Ms Korbel was also injured, as was convicted drug dealer Joseph Nee, who was the intended target of the attack. Speaking as the footage was released, Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen warned those who were ""shielding"" the culprit that officers would do ""everything legitimately possible"" to bring them to justice. ""It is beyond comprehension how anyone can protect a person who is responsible for killing a nine-year-old little girl,"" he added. Olivia died after being shot as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door of her home In a press conference earlier, Det Ch Supt Kameen issued a direct plea to those who may have been asked to hide or dispose of the guns. ""I understand you may be frightened of contacting us, but I want you to do the right thing for Olivia and tell us where they are right now,"" he said. ""If you are hiding the guns and you have no intention of telling us, then I place you in the same category as the vile man responsible for the [killing]. ""And we will hunt you too."" He said the gunman was wearing a black padded jacket, a black balaclava with a peak and black gloves, and he was described as about 5ft 7in (1.7m), with a slim build. ""This is the man we are hunting for - we need to know where he went that night or did you see him in the area?"" he said. ""This man is toxic. ""He is toxic to our communities and if you are protecting him, he is toxic to you and your family."" Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen said the investigation had made ""significant progress"" He said the video had been released because people may recognise what the gunman was wearing when he ""callously ran away from Olivia's house"". ""This footage shows the gunman running along Finch Lane away from Kingsheath Avenue,"" he added. ""You then see him turn right into Berryford Road and go out of sight. ""We know he is climbing into and through people's gardens to avoid being seen."" Public must share pivotal Olivia details - police PC scooped up Olivia and ran, inquest told Police arrest 32 in Liverpool organised crime crackdown Det Ch Supt Kameen said police were also releasing footage of a man who was in the area at the time of the shooting who they wanted to trace. ""I'm interested in speaking to him as he may have information that is important to the inquiry by virtue of the fact he was in the area at the right time,"" he said. Police have asked a man who was in the area at the time of the shooting to get in touch Ten days on from Olivia's death, a collection of flowers, balloons and messages have continued to grow near the scene. Earlier, Ms Korbel, who is still receiving treatment for her injuries, and other family members visited the site to read the tributes left in the schoolgirl's memory. Duringthe opening of Olivia's inqueston Tuesday, Liverpool Senior Coroner Andre Rebello said armed response officers found her with a gunshot wound to her chest. He said a police officer had ""scooped"" up Olivia and ran with her to try to save her life, pressing his hand on her wound as she was taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in the back of a police car. However, despite the efforts of medical teams, she was pronounced dead at about 23:25 BST. A post-mortem examination found the cause of her death was a gunshot wound to the chest. Adjourning the inquest to 4 January, the coroner released Olivia's body to her family for burial.

"Breaking|Breaking newsOlivia police release footage of fleeing gunmanTwo guns were used in the shooting which killed nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel, police sayLiverpool","This video can not be played Watch: CCTV shows gunman fleeing after Olivia Pratt-Korbel shooting CCTV footage of the gunman fleeing after the fatal shooting of Olivia Pratt-Korbel has been released. Merseyside Police revealed the shooter used two guns in the attack that killed the nine-year-old. Olivia was hit in the chest as her mother Cheryl Korbel tried to stop the gunman from entering their home in Dovecot, Liverpool, on 22 August. Ms Korbel was also injured, as was convicted drug dealer Joseph Nee, who was the intended target of the attack. Speaking as the footage was released, Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen warned those who were ""shielding"" the culprit that officers would do ""everything legitimately possible"" to bring them to justice. ""It is beyond comprehension how anyone can protect a person who is responsible for killing a nine-year-old little girl,"" he added. Olivia died after being shot as her mother struggled with a gunman at the door of her home In a press conference earlier, Det Ch Supt Kameen issued a direct plea to those who may have been asked to hide or dispose of the guns. ""I understand you may be frightened of contacting us, but I want you to do the right thing for Olivia and tell us where they are right now,"" he said. ""If you are hiding the guns and you have no intention of telling us, then I place you in the same category as the vile man responsible for the [killing]. ""And we will hunt you too."" He said the gunman was wearing a black padded jacket, a black balaclava with a peak and black gloves, and he was described as about 5ft 7in (1.7m), with a slim build. ""This is the man we are hunting for - we need to know where he went that night or did you see him in the area?"" he said. ""This man is toxic. ""He is toxic to our communities and if you are protecting him, he is toxic to you and your family."" Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen said the investigation had made ""significant progress"" He said the video had been released because people may recognise what the gunman was wearing when he ""callously ran away from Olivia's house"". ""This footage shows the gunman running along Finch Lane away from Kingsheath Avenue,"" he added. ""You then see him turn right into Berryford Road and go out of sight. ""We know he is climbing into and through people's gardens to avoid being seen."" Public must share pivotal Olivia details - police PC scooped up Olivia and ran, inquest told Police arrest 32 in Liverpool organised crime crackdown Det Ch Supt Kameen said police were also releasing footage of a man who was in the area at the time of the shooting who they wanted to trace. ""I'm interested in speaking to him as he may have information that is important to the inquiry by virtue of the fact he was in the area at the right time,"" he said. Police have asked a man who was in the area at the time of the shooting to get in touch Ten days on from Olivia's death, a collection of flowers, balloons and messages have continued to grow near the scene. Earlier, Ms Korbel, who is still receiving treatment for her injuries, and other family members visited the site to read the tributes left in the schoolgirl's memory. Duringthe opening of Olivia's inqueston Tuesday, Liverpool Senior Coroner Andre Rebello said armed response officers found her with a gunshot wound to her chest. He said a police officer had ""scooped"" up Olivia and ran with her to try to save her life, pressing his hand on her wound as she was taken to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in the back of a police car. However, despite the efforts of medical teams, she was pronounced dead at about 23:25 BST. A post-mortem examination found the cause of her death was a gunshot wound to the chest.

Energy boss's plan to stave off bills crisis,"This video can not be played Ovo's Stephen Fitzpatrick says help with bills is needed now or the poorest households will be cold and hungry The boss of the UK's third largest energy supplier has proposed a plan for the government to subsidise soaring gas and electricity bills. Ovo Energy founder Stephen Fitzpatrick said under the scheme the poorest households would get the most support. Higher earners would see the amount of help taper off as they used more energy. The government said it was preparing to deliver any extra support as soon as a new prime minister is in place. Mr Fitzpatrick said action was needed now before the winter, otherwise the poorest households would be cold and hungry. A typical household gas and electricity bill will rise by 80% to Â£3,549 a year from October, the regulator Ofgem announced on Friday. Mr Fitzpatrick, the founder and chief executive of Ovo, which has 4.5 million customers,has published a 10-point plan,externalto address the crisis. A key proposal in the plan is to allow energy firms to borrow from a government-backed fund, and then use the money to subsidise bills. A similar proposal byScottish Power to freeze energy billsfor all at their current level was dismissed by the Treasury for giving the same relief to richer and poorer households. Under Mr Fitzpatrick's plan, everyone would get some assistance, but higher earners would see the amount of money received reduce, the more energy they used. This is a similar way to how the tax system works, with a tax-free allowance and increased levels of taxation for those on higher incomes. Short-term plans Bring forward the Â£400 energy rebate Increase funding for debt advisory charities Set up a fuel Poverty Task Force to identify households most at risk Medium-term plans Abolish the prepayment meter ""penalty"", which sees prepayment customers paying more than those on direct debit Subsidise bills though a Tariff Deficit Fund, which would be repaid over several years Abolish the standing charge that customers pay Mobilise a national effort to insulate UK homes Long-term plans Establish a single strategic buyer for all the UK's energy needs. Bring back the Department of Energy and Climate Change Introduce a carbon tax Mr Fitzpatrick is also urging the government to bring forward existing support measures. Currently all households will see Â£400 knocked off bills over a six-month period starting from October, with households on qualifying benefits getting an additional Â£650. Mr Fitzpatrick argues those payments should be made in full before Christmas. He said the higher charges faced by pre-payment customers amounted to a poverty penalty and should be abolished. Mr Fitzpatrick also advocates abolishing the standing charge - which customers pay regardless of their energy use. Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss - who pollsters have tipped to win the contest -hinted on Wednesday she would look at providing further supportto businesses and households. She also ruled out energy rationing - unlike rival Rishi Sunak, who said it should not be taken off the table. Separately, the Resolution Foundation has published a report which says typical household disposable incomes are on course to fall by 10%, or Â£3,000, over this year and next - ""the deepest living standards squeeze in a century"". The think tank also said the number of people living in absolute poverty was set to rise by three million to 14 million people in 2023-24. Absolute poverty is when household income is below the level necessary to meet basic living standards in terms of food, housing and healthcare costs. A review by the UCL Institute of Health Equity (IHE) has suggested,externalgrowing up in cold homes will have ""dangerous consequences"" for many children now and into adulthood. IHE director Professor Michael Marmot warned thousands of extra deaths could occur and the health and development of up to 10 million children could be affected directly or indirectly. Mr Fitzpatrick said helping low income families with energy bills ""has to be the first order of business"" for the new Conservative leader. He said: ""If we don't use every available moment over the next 12 weeks to solve this, we are going to see a winter like never before with people going hungry and going cold and the NHS being overwhelmed by the health impacts of the energy crisis."" A spokesperson for the Department for Health said: ""As the public would rightly expect, we are working closely with the NHS to ensure we are ready for extra pressures this winter, including providing an extra Â£79m last year to significantly expand our mental health services, enabling more children and young people to get help."" Mr Fitzpatrick said there was ""almost nothing that we can do right now that's going to be in time for 1 October when prices go up"". However, there were lots of short, medium and long-term changes to the energy system that would make it work better for customers, he said. ""It is incredibly important that we have a plan that will get us through the winter no matter what. We can't wait for the cold weather to come to try to figure out what we're going to do about it."" Mr Fitzpatrick also wants to create a ""national obsession"" with energy efficiency including a medium term plan to insulate the UK's energy-leaky homes. Longer term, he suggests the UK should establish a single strategic buyer for all the UK's energy needs. He argued this would mean the UK could secure its energy on a multi-year basis rather than individual companies buying their energy three to six months in advance. ""Over the past 10 years, the free market approach has worked to deliver affordable energy for the UK but we should accept that the next 10 years are going to look very different,"" he said. ""We are entering into an era of global competition to secure energy supplies and we need to think strategically, long term and at a national level."" A spokesperson for the Department for Business said: ""Officials are making the appropriate preparations in order to ensure that any additional support or commitments on cost of living can be delivered as quickly as possible when the new prime minister is in place.""

Nicola Sturgeon to hold talks over council strikes,"Workers in Glasgow began emptying overflowing street bins after the first wave of strikes ended on Thursday morning Nicola Sturgeon is meeting unions and council leaders over the pay dispute that brought strikes across Scotland. The first minister is holding talks in Edinburgh on Thursday night as council workers seek an improved pay offer. Ms Sturgeon is meeting council leaders in St Andrew's House followed by talks with union representatives. Unions launched industrial action on 18 August. The Scottish government has not said what Ms Sturgeon plans to propose to try to end the dispute. Councillor Shona Morrison, president of local government body Cosla, told BBC Scotland: ""We are still in very active discussions at the moment and really keen to find a solution as soon as we can."" Earlier union sources said the talks were positive and that the discussion is moving in the right direction. The meeting comes as bin collections around Scotland resumed on Thursday after a first wave of strikes. When are the next bin strikes planned? Government 'cannot offer' more money to end strikes The view from both sides of the bin strike boundary There will be further strikes in 19 councils areas from 6-13 September. The walkout ended on Tuesday in Edinburgh and on Thursday in 13 other areas, including Glasgow and Aberdeen. Glasgow City Council warned residents there would be a ""significant delay"" to rubbish collections because of the extensive backlog. City of Edinburgh Council announced further changes to its collection schedule as the clear-up continued, urging residents to help by storing extra waste for a ""little longer"". This is the first time Nicola Sturgeon has become directly involved in this dispute between councils and their workforce. Her deputy John Swinney has taken the lead for the Scottish government until now. The first minister has been criticised by the Conservatives and others for taking a hands-off approach while rubbish was piling up in Edinburgh during the festivals. With further, and more widespread, disruption to bin collections planned and hundreds of schools and nurseries facing closure next week, Ms Sturgeon has decided to try and broker a compromise. It is not clear what carrots or sticks she might bring to her discussions with councils and trade unions but the Scottish government has previously insisted no more money is available. Edinburgh council leader Cammy Day said: ""Our crews have been working hard to catch up on collections and making every effort to collect significant volumes of litter across the city. ""The clear up is progressing well and we can already see the benefits of having the crews back out on the street keeping the city clean."" Public Health Scotland had warned of a human health risk from overflowing waste and advised councils to decontaminate areas where bins overflowed. Further strikes in many local authority areas are planned for next week On Monday Unite, the GMB and Unisonrejected an increased pay offer. The unions had been seeking an agreement from Cosla similar to the one made to council workers in England - which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay increase. Bin strikes around the country began after they rejected an initial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. The action escalated last week when refuse workers at a further 20 local authorities walked out despite a revised 5% offer. The second wave of strikes is due to begin on 6 September, with hundreds of schools and nurseries also scheduled to close. Refuse workers in Scotland want Cosla to match the offer made to their counterparts in England Cosla's offer of a Â£1,925 pay uplift matched the offer to council workers in England - but only part of this payment would be consolidated into staff salaries. The rest would be given as one-off cost-of-living payments. Unions said this meant lower-paid staff would not benefit as much as those on higher wages. The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay increase for staff. It has also offered a further Â£200m over two years to provide a cost-of-living payment to workers earning below Â£39,000. Deputy First Minister John Swinney has said there is no more money available to fund further pay increases as the government's finances are ""finite"". ""I have managed to find one-off sums of money to ensure that people on low incomes are able to get a Â£2,000 increase in their salary now. But the government cannot offer any more money,"" he said. Cosla said it was disappointed that unions had turned down an offer that was at the ""absolute extremes"" of affordability. Resources spokesperson Katie Hagmann said: ""We have done everything we possibly can to get to this stage and this offer - which is still on the table - is as good as it gets.""

PM confident Sizewell nuclear plant will go ahead,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Go nuclear, and go large and go with Sizewell C."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has pledged Â£700m for a new nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coast, with a call to ""go nuclear and go large and go with Sizewell C"". In a speech at Sizewell, he said he was ""confident"" the plant would go ahead. The project, which is being developed by French energy company EDF, is estimated to cost about Â£20bn overall. Critics have argued Sizewell C will be hugely expensive and take years to build. The governmentgave the go-ahead for the plant in Julywith negotiations on raising funds continuing. It is not expected to begin generating electricity until the 2030s. ""We need to pull our national finger out and get on with Sizewell C,"" the outgoing PM said. ""That's why we're putting Â£700m into the deal, just part of the Â£1.7bn of government funding available for developing a large-scale nuclear project to final investment stage in this parliament. ""In the course of the next few weeks I am absolutely confident that it will get over the line."" PM backs nuclear power plant funding How much nuclear power does the UK use? What is Sizewell C? Mr Johnson said the war in Ukraine, which has pushed up gas prices, had demonstrated the need for new nuclear generation capacity in the UK. In his final major policy speech before he leaves office, he argued the reluctance of previous governments to back nuclear energy had helped drive up bills. The PM described the problem as ""myopia"", adding: ""It is called short-termism. It is a chronic case of politicians not being able to see beyond the political cycle."" ""Let's think about the future, let's think about our kids and our grandchildren, about the next generation,"" he said. ""And so I say to you, with the prophetic candour and clarity of one who is about to hand over the torch of office, I say go nuclear and go large and go with Sizewell C."" Tom Greatrex, head of the Nuclear Industry Association, called the announcement an ""important step toward cutting gas, cutting bills and creating stable, secure well-paid jobs for people up and down the country"". However, former Green Party leader Caroline Lucas said that Sizewell C was ""massively costly, achingly slow, and carries huge unnecessary risks"". She added that the ""enormous upfront cost"" would be passed on to consumers. The Stop Sizewell campaign group said: ""When every penny matters, it's totally wrong to shackle the next prime minister and billions in taxpayers' money to this damaging project, whose ballooning cost, lengthy construction, failure-prone technology and long term water supply are so uncertain."" The group urged Mr Johnson's successor to review the project and focus on ""cheaper, quicker renewables and insulation"". Labour said the government had an ""appalling legacy"" on clean power, accusing it of blocking onshore wind and delaying the expansion of solar and nuclear power. Mr Johnson's speech was made against the backdrop of an energy crisis which looks set to worsen over the winter, with household bills soaring. The war in Ukraine has pushed up the price of gas and renewed concerns about energy security. The crisis is likely to dominate the agenda for whoever succeeds Mr Johnson as PM. Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss - who pollsters have tipped to win the contest -hinted on Wednesday she would look at providing further supportto businesses and households. She also ruled out energy rationing - unlike rival Rishi Sunak, who said it should not be taken off the table. Today's speech from Boris Johnson would have been significant had he been able to announce the deal to build a new nuclear power station had been sealed. But he can't, and the Â£700m he is pledging is considered to be too small a sum to guarantee the participation of private investors and EDF. So why do it? The Â£700m comes from a Â£1.7bn fund for nuclear already agreed by the cabinet - so he can't be accused of entering into new financial arrangements which would bind the hands of his successor. Whether the project goes ahead will be up to the new occupant of No 10. But he was issuing a statement of intent - and making it more difficult, should his successor wish, to back out. While his speech largely blamed Labour for ""myopia"" on energy, it seemed to contain a coded message to the next PM not to put new domestic projects on hold while dealing with the short term, but severe, challenge of soaring bills. Both candidates are committed to new nuclear. But if they are tempted to delay, Boris Johnson can make it clear that is one thing that he can't be blamed for. The Sizewell C project is expected to generate about 7% of the UK's electricity needs and operate for 60 years.

Broadcaster Bill Turnbull dies aged 66The presenter hosted BBC Breakfast for 15 years and more recently hosted programmes on Classic FM.,"This video can not be played Memories of broadcaster Bill Turnbull, who has died at the age of 66 Broadcaster Bill Turnbull has died at the age of 66, his representatives have confirmed. Turnbull hosted BBC Breakfast for 15 years, in both London and later Salford, and also fronted Songs of Praise and game show Think Tank. His family said: ""Bill will be remembered by many as a remarkable broadcaster who brought warmth and humour into people's homes"". In 2018, he announced he had beendiagnosed with prostate cancer. Obituary: Beloved BBC Breakfast host In pictures: A look back at Bill Turnbull's life After leaving the BBC in 2016, he joined Classic FM, and continued presenting shows on the network until recently. His family added: ""Following a challenging and committed fight against prostate cancer, Bill passed away peacefully at his home in Suffolk surrounded by his family on Wednesday, 31 August."" They said he received his diagnosis in 2017, and praised his ""outstanding medical care"" from the Royal Marsden and Ipswich Hospitals, St Elizabeth Hospice and his GP. Turnbull pictured in 2010 with BBC Breakfast co-hosts (L-R) Sian Williams, Susanna Reid and Charlie Stayt ""He was resolutely positive and was hugely buoyed by the support he received from friends, colleagues and messages from people wishing him luck. ""It was a great comfort to Bill that so many more men are now testing earlier for this disease,"" they said, calling him a ""wonderful husband and father to his three children"" and a devoted Wycombe Wanderers fan and ""an ever-aspiring beekeeper"". Turnbull was a favourite with viewers on BBC Breakfast thanks to his gentle presenting style, which was well suited to early morning broadcasting. During his time on the show, he worked alongside Sian Williams, Susanna Reid, Kate Silverton, Natasha Kaplinsky and Louise Minchin. His former colleagues Naga Munchetty and Charlie Stayt, who were presenting Thursday's programme, paid an emotional tribute just after the news was announced. Turnbull presented BBC Breakfast for 15 years, and later moved to radio station Classic FM Munchetty said: ""As a team we are in shock this morning. He cared so much about this programme and the audience. I did my first ever shift with him on Breakfast."" ""His energy was amazing. He came into this programme and threw everything at it. He was funny; he was a brilliant journalist. He loved this programme and he loved serving you, the audience,"" she said. Stayt added that Turnbull ""didn't take himself too seriously"". The programme's editor Richard Frediani confirmed on Thursday that Friday's Breakfast would be ""a celebration of Bill's life on and off-screen"". He noted: ""Bill Turnbull loved our viewers and our viewers loved him."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Seriously it nearly came to blows, although that was more me than him."" He added: ""And there was a moment where I actually wore a sweater made from dog hair with a bow on the front. It was alright but it was very, very warm and I just couldn't get the stuff off me for weeks afterwards."" Williams told the BBC he ""mentored a lot of young journalists and a lot of people in the industry... and that was very important to him"", adding he had ""very high standards"". She spoke of their relationship, saying: ""We never bickered... in 30 years of friendship"", and said she would remember them ""laughing so much we couldn't really keep control of our faces... and then we realised we were on television - we laughed a lot"".

And we had some cracking arguments about how you should pronounce words like 'poor'. We all loved him."" Channel 5 news presenterDan Walker said,externalit had been ""an honour"" to replace Turnbull on the Breakfast sofa, saying: ""He was full of brilliant advice and it was clear just how loved he was by his colleagues and the audience,"" while Breakfast presenter Jon Kaycalled Turnbull,external""an absolute gent"". Karen Hardy paid an emotional tribute to her former Strictly dance partner Turnbull appeared as a contestant on an early series of Strictly Come Dancing, finishing in sixth place with his partner Karen Hardy. Hardy, who was in New Zealand, cried as she paid tribute to her friend, calling Turnbull ""such a gentleman, such a mentor"". She said meeting him was ""life-changing"" - he was her first partner on Strictly - and ""he made TV magical, he told me what it was about"", she said, adding he would help critique her appearances on Breakfast. ""If he wasn't on it, I knew he'd be watching..."" she said, adding he would text her with tips including how to sit and speak clearly for the cameras. Turnbull met the Queen and Prince Philip in 2015 at an awards reception at Buckingham Palace BBC Director-General Tim Davie called Turnbull ""a much-loved and respected broadcaster and journalist - not just by viewers but by all those lucky enough to have worked with him"". ""He always struck the right tone, no matter what the story. Warm, wise, professional and caring, he will be much missed by us all,"" he said. Culture SecretaryNadine Dorries described,external""an incredibly sad loss of a broadcasting legend"", praising his ""special charm and wit"" and his tireless work to raise awareness about prostate cancer. BBC Radio 4's Today programme presenter Nick Robinson described Turnbull as ""a very, very dear friend and an extraordinary broadcaster."" ""There was a warmth to his broadcasting which people who watch Breakfast television every day knew,"" he said. ""But perhaps what they forgot was what a bloody good journalist he was. This was a man who'd been a correspondent in Washington, who travelled 30 countries. He'd been in Moscow, he'd covered wars, he'd reported on the troubles in Northern Ireland."" He added: ""And that combination of a razor-sharp intellect, wit, humour and humanity, came out every day when he was on Breakfast. It came out every day when he was a reporter on this programme. And listeners to Classic FM will have heard him present beautifully as well his love of music."" Robinson also recalled how Turnbull and his wife [Sarah] had met on the Today programme, where they had worked. Broadcaster and writer Monty Don called Turnbull ""a thoroughly decent, good man"",adding,external: ""We shared an enthusiasm for bees and were both patrons of Bees for Development charity."" Prior to working on Breakfast, Turnbull also worked as a reporter on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC News 24, as the news channel was then known. In recent years, Turnbull guest presented episodes of The One Show andreunited with Reidfor several editions of ITV's Good Morning Britain. After his cancer diagnosis was made public,he fronted a documentaryfor Channel 4 called Bill Turnbull: Staying Alive, in which he explored the use of cannabis oil for medicinal purposes. Prostate Cancer UK said that after Turnbull announced he had the illness in March 2018, their specialist nurses experienced their ""busiest day on record"" and they saw a huge rise in web traffic of men looking for information and support. In November 2017, Turnbull took part in a celebrity edition of The Great British Bake Off - which was in aid of a charity, Stand Up to Cancer. He found out about his prostate cancer during filming. He said inspiring men to get tested for the illness by publicly revealing his own diagnosis was the ""one useful thing"" he had done in his life, admitting he was ""cross with myself"" for the pride he had felt at not visiting a GP in four years. It's the most common cancer in men in the UK - an ageing population means more men are developing and dying from the disease 40,000 new cases are diagnosed and around 11,000 men die from it each year It can develop slowly over years and many men have no symptoms Noticeable symptoms include needing to urinate more often and weak flow There is no single test for prostate cancer - a blood test, biopsies and physical examinations are all used This video can not be played We explain what warning signs to look out for Memories of BBC presenter Bill Turnbull.

"Highlands nurse denied return to UK after holidayDespite living in the UK for 15 years, Ali Abunejmeh was not allowed to board his flight home.","Ali Abunejmeh and his eight-year-old son Sebastien were on holiday visiting family in Jordan A Highlands nurse and his son have been trapped in Turkey for four weeks after an airline declined to accept his evidence of UK residency. Ali Abunejmeh, originally from Jordan, has lived in the UK for 15 years and has settled status. His residence card had expired, but the dad-of-three said the Home Office told him he could show alternative proof. He said he had spent Â£2,000 on food and accommodation and had missed shifts at Raigmore Hospital, Inverness. He and his eight-year-old son Sebastien were on holiday visiting family in Jordan and the West Bank. The latest headlines from Scotland,external More stories from the Highlands and Islands,external On 5 August the pair, who live in Nairn, were due to fly back to the UK via Antalya Airport in Turkey. Without an in-date residence card, Mr Abunejmeh used the Home Office's online'View and Prove' service,externalto show his settled status at the airport. But Turkish Airlines declined to accept this and would not allow them on the flight. The airline told BBC Scotland it was investigating the incident. The Home Office said non-European nationals must show airlines a valid UK residence card to prove their settled status. Its guidance also states that airlines ""may accept"" proof via View and Prove, if someone does not have a card. Mr Abunejmeh said: ""I hold a permanent residence in the UK and settlement status. The card that I have is expired. ""I was advised by the Home Office before travelling that I can show the carrier airline when travelling the status of my residency. ""The advice was that I would be able to prove my settlement status via the app I have. ""I tried to explain this to Turkish Airlines but they refused to let me board."" Mr Abunejmeh's settled status means he has the right to live, work and remain indefinitely in the UK free of immigration control. His wife is a Czech national and their three children all have British passports. However, his wife and two of the children were waiting for renewed passports and so did not travel with him. Mr Abunejmeh told BBC Scotland he had received little assistance from the Home Office or the airline after being turned away. He said: ""Me and my son were really stressed. We were told to call the British Embassy to find out what to do next. ""My son got really upset because he could not understand why he was not allowed on the flight."" Mr Abunejmeh has since applied for access to the UK as a close family member of a European national with UK immigration status. The process can take up to seven weeks. Families tell of agony over passport delays He is also waiting on a renewed biometric residence card. He said: ""I have spent almost Â£2,000 on accommodation and food so far, not mentioning that my son Sebastien should now be back in school. ""As a nurse with a contract, I have been booked for shifts and I have no way of knowing when I am going to be back. ""My son has a British passport but at the moment, my wife cannot fly out to Turkey to bring him back home. ""With me not working and my wife as a teacher on supply contract only, neither of us has got a regular income and it is causing us considerable financial difficulties."" A Home Office spokesperson said: ""Any non-EEA nationals granted settled status must carry their biometric residence card when travelling abroad and this should be in date. We will be in touch with Mr Abunejmeh.""

Pound in biggest monthly fall since 2016The last time the pound fell so much against the dollar was in the aftermath of the UK's Brexit vote.,"Worries over the prospects for the UK economy led the pound to slide by about 5% against the US dollar in August. The last time the pound fell so much against the dollar was in October 2016, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote. Sterling sank again on Thursday morning, dipping below $1.16 on the currency markets. Analysts said the fall reflects the darkening outlook for the economy, with consumers and businesses facing rising prices and soaring energy bills. The Bank of England has predicted the UK will fall into recession towards the end of this year. The weak pound means Brits travelling overseas will find their spending money will not stretch as far. UK economy shrinks as outlook on recession darkens Bank's recession warning matters to everyone ""Our economic prospects are not looking particularly good compared to the rest of the world,"" said Laura Lambie, senior investment director at Investec. Ms Lambie said that recession fears were weighing on markets, with the investment bank Goldman Sachs warning this week that the UK could remain in recession until 2024. A recession is defined as the economy getting smaller for two consecutive three-month periods. August was also the worst month for the pound against the euro since the middle of last year. UK government bonds - or debt - had their worst month for decades. Investors, worried about the riskiness of lending to the government, demanded higher returns for doing so, making it more expensive for the country to borrow money. In August, the yields, or the effective interest rate you would get, on some of those bonds have jumped the most since 1994. Colin Ellis from ratings agency Moody's told the BBC's Today programme the jump in yields needed to be put in context. ""Energy bills are very very high, and set to go up again. which means inflation is going to be high and that the Bank of England is raising interest rates in response. ""Those expectations for higher interest rates are part of what's driving these moves in the bond market at the moment."" However, he said: ""We still have a stable outlook on our UK government rating so we see the risk as broadly balanced. We're not very concerned but of course a lot will depend on the policies that the next government chooses to put into place."" Fears have grown over the prospects for the UK economy after figures showed it shrank between April and June, with businesses and households feeling the impact of rising prices. Those concerns were fuelled on Thursday, with a new study suggesting the manufacturing sector shrank in August for the first time since May 2020. Separately, a report by the Resolution Foundation think tank said typical household disposable incomes are on course to fall by 10%, or Â£3,000, over this year and next, which is called the ""the deepest living standards squeeze in a century"". The cost-of-living crisis is set to be the biggest challenge facing the new Prime Minister. Both Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have come under pressure to outline how they would support households if they succeed in getting the keys to Number 10. ''Grim forecasts about poverty spreading across the UK this winter highlight the deepening woes for the UK economy"", said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. The Bank of England raised interest rates to 1.75% in August, while forecasting that the UK economy would fall into recession this year. But Ms Streeter predicts that the Bank of England might be forced to slow down rate rises in the coming months, given the cost of living crisis. The pound's weakness is also a result of a strong dollar, analysts said. The dollar is performing strongly due to US interest rate rises and because investors see it as a safer bet. Last week, the head of the country's central bank, the Federal Reserve,indicated it would push ahead with further interest rate risesas it seeks to control inflation. ""The dollar has been exceptionally strong,"" Ms Lambie said. ""Also, the issues that we've had in Europe around energy do not have the same impact as the US, and I think economists are fairly agreed that the US will be the last to go into recession if they do go into recession at all, perhaps following the UK and Europe. ""So on both sides, from the sterling side and from the dollar side, that's really what has weakened sterling and strengthened the dollar.""

"âIf the police wonât do their job, weâll do it for themâ","Mums Leanna, Lisa, Jade and Toni have protested outside their local police station Children as young as 11 have been subjected to brutal attacks by teenagers in a Lancashire town - with the assaults filmed and shared on social media. Victims' mothers say police aren't doing enough to stop the group and have taken matters into their own hands. The mother of one girl said she was told her daughter could have been one blow away from losing her life. Lancashire Police say they take assault and anti-social behaviour seriously. The BBC spoke to eight sets of parents in Chorley whose children were violently assaulted. The parents believe the police have not responded fast enough, and say that's why they feel compelled to share their footage further - and have asked us to show it. They also want to illustrate the seriousness of the attacks. It's thought the same group of teenagers was responsible for all the incidents. The videos show children being dragged to the ground - squealing and crying out as they try to shield their heads from kicks and punches. Voices of others can be heard, off-camera, egging-on the attackers. This video can not be played Moments from the attacks on Leanna's daughter, Toni's son and Jade's daughter Filming such violence and humiliation, and then sharing it online, has become known by the term ""patterning"" - with the aim of embarrassing victims even further by forwarding the videos across the web. A BBC News investigation has spent months talking to people in England and Wales about their experiences of reporting crime - victims who say they have been left in despair, forced to do their own detective work, and waited too long for police help. Lisa's daughter - 14-year-old Bethany - was set upon by a group of girls and was viciously beaten. She managed to call her mother during the attack in April last year. ""I got a phone call - with her absolutely screaming 'Mum, please. They've got me. They've got my hair. My hair is falling out. Now they've stomped all over me.' ""I could hear what the girls were saying. 'Kick her again. Kick her again. She's down, kick her again.'"" The violence was also being filmed and would soon be posted on social media. ""They punched her numerous times and stamped on her head. They all took turns. They pretended to let her up, but then hit her back to the ground and did it again,"" says Lisa. ""The doctor actually said that one more stamp to the head would have most likely taken her life."" Lisa says the police were called as the assault was happening. ""We rang 999 while she was on the phone. We begged them. Nobody appeared. The [police] never arrived for 48 hours."" Lisa says despite calling 999, there was ""no urgency whatsoever"" despite officers being aware of the group having caused trouble across the town. It took weeks, she says, for Bethany's attackers to be arrested. Two of the girls involved have now written a letter of apology after being given a conditional caution. Although Lisa believes it's not a case of officers failing to care. ""I got the impression the police believed it was pointless - that nothing will come of it."" Lancashire Police told us: ""When people call us in an emergency, we will always be there to answer the phone and to send officers as soon as we can where there is an ongoing threat or risk."" ""These girls feel vulnerable. They're scared. It's all over social media,"" says Leanna Another mum, Leanna, recalls the moment her 11-year-old daughter, Indie, came home after being attacked in a park. ""She walked through the door, her face was swollen. She had a burst lip and her hair was falling out. I've never in my life seen her that scared and upset,"" Leanna says they headed straight to the Chorley Police Station to report what had happened. At the front desk, she says she asked to see an officer - but was told there was no-one available to see her. ""I was gobsmacked, in disbelief really,"" she says - explaining how it took officers four days to take a statement. Two of those in the attack would later receive a voluntary caution. ""The police are the ones supposed to be protecting the children. They're supposed to be there to take the worries away and say, 'Don't worry, they're not going to do it again.'"" In a statement, Lancashire Police said: ""When there is no ongoing risk or threat, or crime in action, we will arrange to visit people at a time convenient to them so we can investigate and solve crime and deliver the best outcomes for all."" But Leanna believes the police's response to these types of crimes needs to change. ""These girls feel vulnerable. They're scared. It's all over social media."" Another 11-year-old, Ellissia, was attacked on the same day as Leanna's daughter, in a subway at the same park, by the same group. ""They're just brutal. It's horrific watching [the video],"" says Ellissia's mum Jade. ""I feel like she's just a baby. And that's your baby on that floor. I'm just so angry with them."" Stills from the videos of the attacks on Toni's son and Jade's daughter After ringing the police, Jade says it took two weeks for an officer to visit the family. She says she was told police would only arrest the attackers if her daughter's injuries were more severe - like brain damage. Two of those involved in the attack received a voluntary caution, which Jade says is completely unacceptable considering the violence used. ""You expect the police to do everything to make sure that you get justice for your child - and when they don't, you feel like you've been let down and there's nothing you can do about it."" Jade says the group of teenagers has been allowed to run riot for too long. ""They're not only attacking 11-year-old kids, they're attacking members of the public, bars, pubs, people's businesses."" ""If [the police] had reigned it in then, none of this would have happened."" Lancashire Police say they are proud of their ""proactive approach to policing"" in Chorley and elsewhere. ""We regularly run operations aimed at tackling anti-social behaviour as part of our aim to deliver an outstanding service to the public and build confidence."" If you've been affected by the issues raised in this report, details of organisations offering information and support for bullying are available viaBBC Action Line. Each mum we spoke to described not just the physical, but also the mental scars left on their children after the attacks. Jade believes Ellissia has lost confidence, but tries to ""put on a little show to stay above water for everybody else"". Leanna says Indie is resilient but fearful. Lisa says Bethany didn't leave the house for a year and has now been diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). She should be going out locally and making memories - says Lisa - but instead she travels to other towns with her friends to avoid her attackers. In a statement, Lancashire Police said: ""We recognise the impact that these incidents have had on the victims and their families, and we have done a huge amount to both support them and to keep them updated."" ""If there is any police looking out the window, this is my daughter's face after she was stamped on so many times,"" shouts Lisa Outside Chorley Police Station last month, parents gathered to show their frustration and anger - each mum holding a large photo of their child. ""If there is any police looking out the window, this is my daughter's face after she was stamped on so many times,"" shouts Lisa in front of the gathered crowd - her photo showing Bethany's red, swollen face. ""If I had done that to my child,"" she says, ""I, rightfully, would have been taken right away."" Another mum - Toni - is there. Her son suffered one of the worst attacks. He was beaten to the ground by a group of boys. ""[The gang] punched him, kicked him, headbutted him. He could have come home a lot worse. He could have not come home [at all]."" Toni says she has repeatedly asked police for updates but, four months on, is still waiting for an outcome. Lancashire Police say they are still investigating the assault on Toni's son. The force says all calls in relation to all the incidents in this article have been ""dealt with appropriately"". ""We have identified and arrested offenders and they have been dealt with in line with national guidance on dealing with juveniles."" Burglary, robbery and theft victims denied justice Woman tracks down her own stolen car before police British policing has lost its way, says report Some parents, says Toni, are keen to enact their own form of justice against the teenagers. ""I'm glad they haven't done. But something has got to give before a family is going to end up ruined. ""Is somebody going to end up dead? Whether it be one of our children or one of their children. ""Then are they going to wake up and do something about it? It's too little too late by then as far as I'm concerned."" Meanwhile dozens of parents are being proactive - patrolling the park where the children were attacked. ""Look what we're having to resort to,"" says Leanna as she patrols the park with other mums ""I can't believe it's come to this, but I understand why it has, because our children aren't being protected,"" says Lisa. ""I've got to make sure that if my daughter's down here that I've got to do the police's job. I've got to make sure she's OK."" The mothers claim police foot patrols are non-existent - and say when they've called 999 nothing has happened. ""What good has it done us?"" says Leanna. ""Look what we're having to resort to. We entrust the police to be there to protect our children. And because they can't do that, we're going to have to do it.""

Liz Truss rules out new taxes if elected PM,"This video can not be played WATCH: Liz Truss confirms no new taxes if she becomes PM Tory leadership hopeful Liz Truss has ruled out introducing new taxes if she becomes the UK's next prime minister. She also ruled out energy rationing - unlike her rival Rishi Sunak, who said it should not be taken off the table. The pair were speaking at the final hustings of the leadership contest,with the winner announced next week. Later, the foreign secretary hinted she would look at providing further support to businesses and households with soaring energy costs. Economic questions have dominated the race in recent weeks, amid rising inflation and soaring energy costs for households and firms. Both candidates have come under pressure to spell out what they would do to help with energy if they replace Boris Johnson in Downing Street. Truss 'plans to tackle rising bills with tax cuts' Tory leadership candidates compared: Truss v Sunak Queen to stay at Balmoral to appoint new PM Ms Truss, tipped by pollsters as the favourite in the contest, has said she would reverse April's National Insurance rise and temporarily ditch energy levies to help people cope with increased costs. She has not given details of any further help for households, but said her chancellor would look to ""address the issue of household support"" in an emergency Budget she would reportedly hold next month. Speaking at the hustings in London, the last and twelfth of the contest, she said she would ""absolutely be looking to act on business energy costs"". Asked if she could pledge not to introduce new taxes if she wins power, she replied: ""Yes, no new taxes."" Sunak supporter and former cabinet minister Michael Gove said he was ""not opposed"" to lower taxes but argued that the people most in need of help would not benefit from tax cuts. Asked if he would support Ms Truss's Budget if she were to become prime minister, Mr Gove told the BBC's Today programme he would look at the measures but that his ""natural instinct"" was to support a Conservative prime minister. In a Sun newspaper article,,externalMs Truss gave a hint that she would provide support beyond tax cuts pledging to ""deliver immediate support to ensure people are not facing unaffordable fuel bills"". She promised to be ""robust"" but added: ""It isn't right to announce my entire plan before I have even won the leadership and got my feet under the table."" During the debate, Ms Truss ruled out any new windfall tax on energy firm profits - something demanded by opposition parties to pay for support to help households with bills. Asked whether he would do the same, Mr Sunak - whointroduced such a taxas chancellor in May - did not say whether he would extend it. But he said it had been ""absolutely the right thing"" to introduce a windfall tax when he did, saying firms had made billions in profits due to the effect on energy markets of the war in Ukraine. Asked if he would rule out energy rationing, he replied: ""We shouldn't rule anything out, because the challenges that we face with this crisis are significant."" This video can not be played I am glad I introduced windfall tax, says Rishi Sunak Ms Truss also said she would take action to boost the UK's domestic energy supplies, saying ""short-term decisions"" had left the UK ""dependent on the global energy price"". She also said she would conduct a ""full review of our tax system"" - including business rates paid by firms and the tax burden on families. Liz Truss has said she would ""put money in people's pockets"" by reversing the National Insurance rise and moving the cost of ""green levies"" from energy bills to general taxation. But she has been less specific about any additional help above and beyond what the government has already announced for the autumn. The official line from her campaign is that she has ruled nothing out and will consider the options only if and when she gets to No 10, something she repeats in an article in the Sun today. When her supporters have been approached to flesh out her thinking, they have not all been steering in the same direction. Some are primarily advocating a big rise in Universal Credit, others want 'targeted' assistance to go much higher up the income scale. Whether via a Budget or a smaller ""fiscal event"", if she wins, she would have to announce her cost-of-living measures before the party conference season gets under way at the end of September. So we may not have too long to wait until we know more - although for many struggling with their bills, it will be an anxious wait. Also at the London hustings: Ms Truss said the ""experiment"" in all-lane runningsmart motorways- which use the hard shoulder as a live traffic lane - ""hasn't worked"" and she would get rid of them where they are not working She also said she was ""prepared to look at"" introducing advisory speed limits on motorways Mr Sunak defended his plan to introduce Â£10 fines for missed GP appointments, saying it was required to ""change the culture in this country so that's not acceptable"" He also suggested Britons should overcome their ""aversion to flat-pack housing"" as a potential solution to deliver more homes Mr Johnson's successor will be announced on Monday, and he or she will then take over as the new occupant in Downing Street the next day. In a break with tradition, the winner willtravel to Balmoral Castlein Scotland to be appointed by the Queen. She has been suffering from mobility issues and it is understood the change was made to prevent the need for any last-minute rearrangements.

Canada will look into Begum spy claims - Trudeau,"This video can not be played Shamima Begum speaks of her regret at joining ISIS: 'It kills me inside' Canada says it will ""follow up"" claims that one of its spies smuggled three UK schoolgirls into Syria in 2015. ABBC investigation revealed Shamima Begum,who fled the UK and joined the Islamic State group with two friends, was smuggled by a Canadian agent. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he will ""look at"" the accusations to ensure rules were followed. But he defended the intelligence services, who he said keep the country safe ""in a very dangerous world"". ""The fight against terrorism requires our intelligence services to continue to be flexible and to be creative in their approaches,"" Mr Trudeau told reporters at a news conference on Wednesday. ""But every step of the way, they are bound by strict rules by principles and values that Canadians hold dear, including around the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and we expect that those rules be followed. ""I know there are questions about certain incidents or operations of the past and we will ensure to follow up on this,"" he pledged. Ms Begum is now held in a detention camp in north-east Syria. Her citizenship was taken away in 2019 after she was discovered at a refugee camp following the collapse of the so-called IS caliphate. Tasnime Akunjee, the lawyer for the Begum family, is challenging the removal of Ms Begum's citizenship and said ""one of the main arguments"" will be that the home secretary did not consider that she was a victim of trafficking. Can you be stripped of your British citizenship? He said it was ""shocking"" that a Canadian intelligence asset was a key part of the smuggling operation - ""someone who is supposed to be an ally, protecting our people, rather than trafficking British children into a war zone"". Ms Begum was 15 when she and two other east London schoolgirls - Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-old Amira Abase - travelled to Syria to join the IS group in 2015. The girls met Mohammed Al Rasheed, who would facilitate their journey from Istanbul into IS-controlled Syria. A senior intelligence officer, at an agency which is part of the global coalition against IS, has confirmed to the BBC that Rasheed was providing information to Canadian intelligence while smuggling people to IS. The BBC has obtained a dossier on Rasheed that contains information gathered by foreign law enforcement and intelligence, as well as material recovered from his hard drives, which provide extraordinary detail about how he operated. He told authorities that he had gathered information on the people he helped into Syria because he was passing it to the Canadian embassy in Jordan. Rasheed, who was arrested in Turkey within days of smuggling Ms Begum to IS, told authorities he had shared a photo of the passport the British schoolgirl was using. The Metropolitan Police were searching for her, although by the time Canada received her passport details, Ms Begum was already in Syria. A Canadian Security Intelligence Service spokesman told the BBC he could not ""publicly comment on or confirm or deny the specifics of CSIS investigations, operational interests, methodologies or activities"". Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said he could not ""comment on intelligence matters"", but added that ""at the moment"" he did not recognise ""what's being reported"". Ms Sultana is believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on the then IS held city of Raqqa. The whereabouts of Ms Abase are unknown.

Review into city's NHS maternity failings launchesFamilies are urged to take part in the review being conducted by influential midwife Donna Ockenden.,"Donna Ockenden said the review needed to be comprehensive A review into failings at a city's NHS maternity units has launched, with a call for affected families to come forward. The review, led by midwife Donna Ockenden, will examinehow dozens of babies died or were injured at the Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) trust. Ms Ockenden previously led an inquiry into the UK's biggest maternity scandalat Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust. NUH said it welcomed the review. Ms Ockenden said: ""The ultimate aim of this independent review is to make sure the performance at the trust's maternity service improves as quickly as possible and in a way that means those improvements are sustained. ""As with the Shrewsbury review, this review will assess if cases of concern were adequately investigated by the trust at the time, if the lessons for learning were the appropriate ones and whether the lessons were indeed learned and acted upon."" She added she had already met with some of the families and said their accounts were ""absolutely harrowing"". Ms Ockenden said the review was also working hard to reach all communities in the Nottingham area and emphasised it was interested in all experiences, not just the most traumatic where babies had died or been injured. Nottingham maternity crisis: What are families calling for? Are families' voices finally being heard? Parents fear babies still at risk at Nottingham hospitals In a statement, Ms Ockenden's team - which consists of about 60 practising NHS maternity experts from across the country - said it was of ""paramount importance"" the review was comprehensive, leaving no voices unheard. ""In order to achieve this, it is essential that Donna and the review teamare in contact with as many families and current and former staff in maternity services as possible,external,"" the statement said. Ms Ockenden said she expected the review would take about 18 months but she planned to share ""learning points"" with the trust during that time. Families, who have called for an independent inquiry for years, have welcomed its launch. Sarah Hawkins and her husband Jack have campaigned for years for an investigation Jack and Sarah Hawkins, whose daughter Harriet was stillborn at NUH in 2016 after a series of failings, said the start of the new investigation was a landmark moment. They urged families to take part in the review. Mrs Hawkins said: ""It's an incredible feeling because for so long we've been fighting. ""We feel a massive sense of relief. ""We understand our daughter is dead but there will be people out there with healthy babies who have had failures in their care and we would ask them to come forwards and share their concerns. ""We need to do this, a team effort to get Nottinghamshire safe again for mothers."" Jack Hawkins said he welcomed the review he had called for Mr Hawkins added: ""It's an independent review, it's what's been needed for a long time and we  welcome it. We are just so pleased."" The couple, who previously worked for the trust, were one of a number of families who lobbied former health secretary Sajid Javid. NHS England appointed Ms Ockenden to lead a review in Nottingham in May 2022, following her previous work investigating the deaths of more than 200 babies at Shrewsbury and Telford. A review was already under way in Nottingham but critics said its remit was too narrow andit was not independent enough. The Nottingham trust was established in 2006 when the management of the Nottingham City Hospital and the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) merged to form one organisation. Figures obtained by the BBC have found that, between 2005-6 and 2020-21, there were a total of 207 claims against the hospital's maternity services, including 36 for cerebral palsy, 26 for stillbirths and 24 for brain damage. The total amount awarded in damages for that period was more than Â£110m. In December 2020, the trust's maternity serviceswere rated inadequatewith the Care Quality Commission (CQC) finding ""several serious concerns"". Michelle Rhodes, chief nurse at NUH, said: ""We are deeply sorry for the unimaginable distress that has been caused due to failings in our maternity services. ""We know that an apology will never be enough and we owe it to those who have been failed, those we're caring for today and to our staff to deliver a better maternity service for our communities. ""We welcome Donna Ockenden and her team to Nottingham and will work with them to achieve this."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Donna Ockenden has brought a wealth of experience, particularly following her work on the review of Shrewsbury and Telford maternity services - and the department looks forward to seeing her recommendations for urgent improvements. ""We will continue to take all the steps necessary to ensure no families have to go through this pain again.""

Here are some of the highlights...  The Scottish football live text is still going socheck that outif you'd like. Bye. OK we're going to call it a night here we think. Let's just find out tomorrow if Denis Zakaria or Marcos Alonso have got their moves to or from Chelsea. I'll leave you with a link to some of our top stories today... Nottingham Forest Now they have finally stopped buying players, we can confirm Nottingham Forest have broken the British record for most signings in a window. They brought in 21 signings this summer following their promotion to the Premier League. That surpasses the previous British record, held jointly by Livingston in summer 2001 and Dundee United in 2000 (19 signings, according to football websiteTransfermarkt,external). Alistair MagowanBBC Sport Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's arrival at Chelsea for Â£10m takes the club's spending to about Â£270m during the summer window under the new owners. That is a club record and verging on a record outlay for any club after Real Madrid spent about Â£272m in 2019. Thomas Tuchel will be happy the window is now closed, he knows what he has for the next few months and he can try to improve them on the training pitch as they try to recover from a patchy start to the season. No word yet whether Denis Zakaria will be joining on loan from Juventus. I'm just going to get a raspberry drink from my fizzy drink machine like the mature grown-up I am. Hopefully nobody announces anything in the next two minutes. Chelsea left-back Marcos Alonso was meant to go in the opposite direction to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but no mention of him in either club's statement. Chelsea Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly said: ""Pierre-Emerick is an elite striker with a proven track record in the Premier League and his arrival strengthens our squad, giving us new attacking options. ""We are thrilled to have Pierre-Emerick on board with us in the new era at Chelsea and weâre really looking forward to working with him."" Dare I say a rare bit of good business from Barcelona? They signed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for free in February and he scored plenty of goals for them last season. This summer they upgraded to Robert Lewandowski and now they have made a Â£10m profit on Aubameyang. Chelsea Chelsea may not have revealed the fee for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang... but Barcelona have. It's Â£10.3m (12m euros). A Barca statement read: ""FC Barcelona publicly expresses its gratitude to Aubameyang for his professionalism, commitment, dedication and ever-present positive and warm approach regarding every aspect involving the club. ""We wish him the best of fortune and every success in the future. Your smile radiated happiness both on and off the pitch, thank you. Barca will always be your home."" Chelsea New Chelsea striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang said: ""Iâm really happy. Itâs an honour to be part of this team and I canât wait to start. I have some unfinished business with the Premier League so itâs good to be back and really exciting.""

Let's just find out tomorrow if Denis Zakaria or Marcos Alonso have got their moves to or from Chelsea. I'll leave you with a link to some of our top stories today... Nottingham Forest Now they have finally stopped buying players, we can confirm Nottingham Forest have broken the British record for most signings in a window. They brought in 21 signings this summer following their promotion to the Premier League. That surpasses the previous British record, held jointly by Livingston in summer 2001 and Dundee United in 2000 (19 signings, according to football websiteTransfermarkt,external). Alistair MagowanBBC Sport Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's arrival at Chelsea for Â£10m takes the club's spending to about Â£270m during the summer window under the new owners. That is a club record and verging on a record outlay for any club after Real Madrid spent about Â£272m in 2019. Thomas Tuchel will be happy the window is now closed, he knows what he has for the next few months and he can try to improve them on the training pitch as they try to recover from a patchy start to the season. No word yet whether Denis Zakaria will be joining on loan from Juventus. I'm just going to get a raspberry drink from my fizzy drink machine like the mature grown-up I am. Hopefully nobody announces anything in the next two minutes. Chelsea left-back Marcos Alonso was meant to go in the opposite direction to Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, but no mention of him in either club's statement. Chelsea Chelsea chairman Todd Boehly said: ""Pierre-Emerick is an elite striker with a proven track record in the Premier League and his arrival strengthens our squad, giving us new attacking options. ""We are thrilled to have Pierre-Emerick on board with us in the new era at Chelsea and weâre really looking forward to working with him."" Dare I say a rare bit of good business from Barcelona? They signed Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang for free in February and he scored plenty of goals for them last season. This summer they upgraded to Robert Lewandowski and now they have made a Â£10m profit on Aubameyang. Chelsea Chelsea may not have revealed the fee for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang... but Barcelona have. It's Â£10.3m (12m euros). A Barca statement read: ""FC Barcelona publicly expresses its gratitude to Aubameyang for his professionalism, commitment, dedication and ever-present positive and warm approach regarding every aspect involving the club. ""We wish him the best of fortune and every success in the future. Your smile radiated happiness both on and off the pitch, thank you. Barca will always be your home."" Chelsea New Chelsea striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang said: ""Iâm really happy. Itâs an honour to be part of this team and I canât wait to start. I have some unfinished business with the Premier League so itâs good to be back and really exciting.""

Who are the Uyghurs?,"The Uyghurs are the largest minority ethnic group in China's north-western province of Xinjiang China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly-Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Human rights groups believe China has detained more than one million Uyghurs against their will over the past few years in a large network of what the state calls ""re-education camps"", and sentenced hundreds of thousands to prison terms. A series of police files obtained by the BBC in 2022 has revealed details of China's use of these camps and described the routine use of armed officers and the existence of a shoot-to-kill policy for those trying to escape. The US is among several countries to have previously accused China of committing genocide in Xinjiang. The leading human rights groups Amnesty and Human Rights Watch have published reports accusing China of crimes against humanity. China denies all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. The Chinese government - speaking after details of the Xinjiang Police Files were published - said the peace and prosperity brought to Xinjiang as a result of its anti-terrorism measures were the best response to ""all sorts of lies"". Satellite images show rapid construction of camps in Xinjiang, like this one near Dabancheng There are about 12 million Uyghurs, mostly Muslim, living in Xinjiang, which is officially known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). The Uyghurs speak their own language, which is similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. They make up less than half of the Xinjiang population. Recent decades have seen a mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) into Xinjiang, allegedly orchestrated by the state to dilute the minority population there. China has also been accused oftargeting Muslim religious figuresand banning religious practices in the region, as well as destroying mosques and tombs. Uyghur activists say they fear that the group's culture is under threat of erasure. More on this story Imams targeted in China's Xinjiang crackdown Uighur camp detainees allege systematic rape The cost of speaking up against China China 'has created dystopian hellscape in Xinjiang' China's 'tainted' cotton Xinjiang lies in the north-west of China and is the country's largest region. Like Tibet, it is autonomous, meaning - in theory - it has some powers of self-governance. But in practice, both regions are subjected to major restrictions by the central government. Xinjiang is a mostly desert region and produces about a fifth of the world's cotton. Human rights groups have voiced concerns that much of that cotton export is picked by forced labour, and in 2021 some Western brands removed Xinjiang cotton from their supply chains, leading to a backlash against the brands from Chinese celebrities and netizens. In December 2020, research seen by the BBC showed that up to half a million people were being forced to pick cotton in Xinjiang. There is evidence that new factories have been built within the grounds of the re-education camps. The region is also rich in oil and natural gas and because of its proximity to Central Asia and Europe is seen by Beijing as an important trade link. In the early 20th Century, the Uyghurs briefly declared independence for the region but it was brought under the complete control of China's new Communist government in 1949. Uyghur women pick cotton in Xinjiang. Rights groups have voiced concerns about forced labour in the region Several countries, including the US, UK, Canada and the Netherlands, have accused China of committing genocide - defined byinternational convention,externalas the ""intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group"". The declarations follow reports that, as well as interning Uyghurs in camps,China has been forcibly mass sterilising Uyghur womento suppress the population, separating children from their families, and attempting to break the cultural traditions of the group. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, has saidChina is committing ""genocide and crimes against humanity"". The UK parliament declared in April 2021 that China was committing a genocide in Xinjiang. A UN human rights committee in 2018 said it had credible reports that China was holding up to a million people in ""counter-extremism centres"" in Xinjiang. TheAustralian Strategic Policy Institute,externalfound evidence in 2020 of more than 380 of these ""re-education camps"" in Xinjiang, an increase of 40% on previous estimates. Analysis of data contained in the latest police documents, called theXinjiang Police Files, showed that almost 23,000 residents - or more than 12% of the adult population of one county - were in a camp or prison in the years 2017 and 2018. If applied to Xinjiang as a whole, the figures would mean the detention of more than 1.2 million Uyghur and other Turkic minority adults. The UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the files contained ""shocking details of China's human rights violations"". This video can not be played In 2018, the BBC found all reporting was tightly controlled Earlier, leaked documents known as the China Cables made clear that the camps were intended to be run as high security prisons, with strict discipline and punishments. People who have managed to escape the camps have reported physical, mental and sexual torture. Women have spoken of mass rape and sexual abuse. Anti-Han and separatist sentiment rose in Xinjiang from the 1990s, sometimes flaring into violence. In 2009 about 200 people died in clashes in Xinjiang, which the Chinese blamed on Uyghurs who wanted their own state. But in recent years a massive security crackdown has crushed dissent. Xinjiang is now covered by a pervasive network of surveillance, including police, checkpoints, and cameras that scan everything from number plates to individual faces. According to Human Rights Watch, police are also using a mobile app to monitor people's behaviour, such as how much electricity they are using and how often they use their front door. Since 2017, when President Xi Jinping issued an order saying all religions in China should be Chinese in orientation, there have been further crackdowns. Campaigners say China is trying to eradicate Uyghur culture. The Xinjiang Police Files, which all date from before 2019, shed further light on Uyghurs being punished for alleged crimes that took place years ago. Many appear to have been targeted for their mobile phone use, for listening to ""illegal lectures"" or not using their phones enough, which is regarded as a sign the user is trying to evade digital surveillance. This video can not be played China's ambassador: ""There is no such concentration camp in Xinjiang"" China denies all allegations of human rights abuses in Xinjiang. In response to the Xinjiang Police Files, China's foreign ministry spokesman told the BBC that the documents were ""the latest example of anti-China voices trying to smear China"". He said Xinjiang enjoyed stability and prosperity and residents were living happy, fulfilled lives. China says the crackdown in Xinjiang is necessary to prevent terrorism and root out Islamist extremism and the camps are an effective tool for re-educating inmates in its fight against terrorism. It insists that Uyghur militants are waging a violent campaign for an independent state by plotting bombings, sabotage and civic unrest, but it is accused of exaggerating the threat in order to justify repression of the Uyghurs. China has dismissed claims it is trying to reduce the Uyghur population through mass sterilisations as ""baseless"", and says allegations of forced labour are ""completely fabricated"".

Kyrgios complains of fan smoking marijuana in win,"Nick Kyrgios was beaten by Novak Djokovic in the 2022 Wimbledon final US Open 2022 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:29 August-11 September Coverage: Daily radio commentaries across BBC Sounds and the BBC Sport website and app, with selected live text commentaries and match reports on the website and app Nick Kyrgios put in a characteristically vocal performance, including complaining to the umpire that a fan was smoking marijuana, en route to the US Open third round. The Wimbledon runner-up repeatedly berated his box as he beat France's Benjamin Bonzi 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 4-6 6-4. The Australian swore several times and was given a warning in the third set. World number one and defending champion Daniil Medvedev also won as he beat Arthur Rinderknech 6-2 7-5 6-3. His next opponent will be Wu Yibing, who earned a 6-7 (3-7) 7-6 (7-4) 4-6 6-4 6-4 win over Nuno Borges of Portugal to become the first Chinese man to reach the third round at the US Open. Earlier in the day, Norway's fifth seed Casper Ruud beat Tim van Rijthoven. The 23-year-old won 6-7 (4-7) 6-4 6-4 6-4 to reach round three for the second time and will face American 29th seed Tommy Paul. Follow live coverage of day three of the US Open Murray reaches third round Third seed Sakkari out of US Open Kyrgios will play American world number 87 JJ Wolf in the next round. ""I'm just happy to get through,"" said Kyrgios. ""It's been a stressful time. Me and my team have big expectations. Every tournament I play I'm expected to play amazing tennis every time. ""I'd rather have that pressure and expectation to go far. I feel like I'm playing some of the best tennis of my life."" Kyrgios got off to a flying start, breaking world number 50 Bonzi's serve in the first game, but was broken himself three games later and began occasionally shouting and cursing at his team between points as has become his trademark. An entertaining tie-break twice left Bonzi flat on his face on the floor as Kyrgios finished with a flourish, winning five points in a row to take it 7-3. In the second set Kyrgios, who isfacing legal actionfrom a fan he said was ""drunk out of her mind"" at Wimbledon, said a member of the New York crowd was smoking marijuana. The 27-year-old swore when explaining that to the umpire and added that it could harm players who suffered from asthma, as he does. ""People don't know I'm a heavy asthmatic,"" said Kyrgios after the match. ""When I'm running side to side, I'm struggling to breathe, [it's] probably not something I want to be breathing in between points."" As play resumed, the umpire asked spectators to ""refrain from smoking around the court"". Despite his complaints, Kyrgios continued to play a high level of tennis, hitting lines and showing complete control of his drop shots to take set point on Bonzi's serve. After he was broken to go 5-4 down in the third set, Kyrgios swore at his team at the change of ends, saying ""go home if you're not going to support me"" and received a warning for unsportsmanlike conduct as a result before losing the set. He complained about fans leaving the stadium during play, before being broken in the third set but levelled things again in the next game. The Australian faced three break points at 4-4, but saved them all and then broke himself as Bonzi found the net, roaring to the New York sky in celebration at his victory. Elsewhere in the men's draw, American John Isner withdrew with injury from his second-round match, meaning Danish 28th seed Holger Rune advances and will play the winner of Thursday's match between Britain's Cameron Norrie and Portugal's Joao Sousa.

Bin collections resume after first wave of strikes,"Workers in Glasgow began emptying overflowing street bins after the first wave of strikes ended on Thursday morning Nicola Sturgeon is meeting unions and council leaders over the pay dispute that brought strikes across Scotland. The first minister is holding talks in Edinburgh on Thursday night as council workers seek an improved pay offer. Ms Sturgeon is meeting council leaders in St Andrew's House followed by talks with union representatives. Unions launched industrial action on 18 August. The Scottish government has not said what Ms Sturgeon plans to propose to try to end the dispute. Councillor Shona Morrison, president of local government body Cosla, told BBC Scotland: ""We are still in very active discussions at the moment and really keen to find a solution as soon as we can."" Earlier union sources said the talks were positive and that the discussion is moving in the right direction. The meeting comes as bin collections around Scotland resumed on Thursday after a first wave of strikes. When are the next bin strikes planned? Government 'cannot offer' more money to end strikes The view from both sides of the bin strike boundary There will be further strikes in 19 councils areas from 6-13 September. The walkout ended on Tuesday in Edinburgh and on Thursday in 13 other areas, including Glasgow and Aberdeen. Glasgow City Council warned residents there would be a ""significant delay"" to rubbish collections because of the extensive backlog. City of Edinburgh Council announced further changes to its collection schedule as the clear-up continued, urging residents to help by storing extra waste for a ""little longer"". This is the first time Nicola Sturgeon has become directly involved in this dispute between councils and their workforce. Her deputy John Swinney has taken the lead for the Scottish government until now. The first minister has been criticised by the Conservatives and others for taking a hands-off approach while rubbish was piling up in Edinburgh during the festivals. With further, and more widespread, disruption to bin collections planned and hundreds of schools and nurseries facing closure next week, Ms Sturgeon has decided to try and broker a compromise. It is not clear what carrots or sticks she might bring to her discussions with councils and trade unions but the Scottish government has previously insisted no more money is available. Edinburgh council leader Cammy Day said: ""Our crews have been working hard to catch up on collections and making every effort to collect significant volumes of litter across the city. ""The clear up is progressing well and we can already see the benefits of having the crews back out on the street keeping the city clean."" Public Health Scotland had warned of a human health risk from overflowing waste and advised councils to decontaminate areas where bins overflowed. Further strikes in many local authority areas are planned for next week On Monday Unite, the GMB and Unisonrejected an increased pay offer. The unions had been seeking an agreement from Cosla similar to the one made to council workers in England - which included a Â£1,925 flat rate pay increase. Bin strikes around the country began after they rejected an initial pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase. The action escalated last week when refuse workers at a further 20 local authorities walked out despite a revised 5% offer. The second wave of strikes is due to begin on 6 September, with hundreds of schools and nurseries also scheduled to close. Refuse workers in Scotland want Cosla to match the offer made to their counterparts in England Cosla's offer of a Â£1,925 pay uplift matched the offer to council workers in England - but only part of this payment would be consolidated into staff salaries. The rest would be given as one-off cost-of-living payments. Unions said this meant lower-paid staff would not benefit as much as those on higher wages. The Scottish government has given an additional Â£140m to councils to help fund a pay increase for staff. It has also offered a further Â£200m over two years to provide a cost-of-living payment to workers earning below Â£39,000. Deputy First Minister John Swinney has said there is no more money available to fund further pay increases as the government's finances are ""finite"". ""I have managed to find one-off sums of money to ensure that people on low incomes are able to get a Â£2,000 increase in their salary now. But the government cannot offer any more money,"" he said. Cosla said it was disappointed that unions had turned down an offer that was at the ""absolute extremes"" of affordability. Resources spokesperson Katie Hagmann said: ""We have done everything we possibly can to get to this stage and this offer - which is still on the table - is as good as it gets.""

Review into city's NHS maternity failings launches,"Donna Ockenden said the review needed to be comprehensive A review into failings at a city's NHS maternity units has launched, with a call for affected families to come forward. The review, led by midwife Donna Ockenden, will examinehow dozens of babies died or were injured at the Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) trust. Ms Ockenden previously led an inquiry into the UK's biggest maternity scandalat Shrewsbury and Telford NHS Trust. NUH said it welcomed the review. Ms Ockenden said: ""The ultimate aim of this independent review is to make sure the performance at the trust's maternity service improves as quickly as possible and in a way that means those improvements are sustained. ""As with the Shrewsbury review, this review will assess if cases of concern were adequately investigated by the trust at the time, if the lessons for learning were the appropriate ones and whether the lessons were indeed learned and acted upon."" She added she had already met with some of the families and said their accounts were ""absolutely harrowing"". Ms Ockenden said the review was also working hard to reach all communities in the Nottingham area and emphasised it was interested in all experiences, not just the most traumatic where babies had died or been injured. Nottingham maternity crisis: What are families calling for? Are families' voices finally being heard? Parents fear babies still at risk at Nottingham hospitals In a statement, Ms Ockenden's team - which consists of about 60 practising NHS maternity experts from across the country - said it was of ""paramount importance"" the review was comprehensive, leaving no voices unheard. ""In order to achieve this, it is essential that Donna and the review teamare in contact with as many families and current and former staff in maternity services as possible,external,"" the statement said. Ms Ockenden said she expected the review would take about 18 months but she planned to share ""learning points"" with the trust during that time. Families, who have called for an independent inquiry for years, have welcomed its launch. Sarah Hawkins and her husband Jack have campaigned for years for an investigation Jack and Sarah Hawkins, whose daughter Harriet was stillborn at NUH in 2016 after a series of failings, said the start of the new investigation was a landmark moment. They urged families to take part in the review. Mrs Hawkins said: ""It's an incredible feeling because for so long we've been fighting. ""We feel a massive sense of relief. ""We understand our daughter is dead but there will be people out there with healthy babies who have had failures in their care and we would ask them to come forwards and share their concerns. ""We need to do this, a team effort to get Nottinghamshire safe again for mothers."" Jack Hawkins said he welcomed the review he had called for Mr Hawkins added: ""It's an independent review, it's what's been needed for a long time and we  welcome it. We are just so pleased."" The couple, who previously worked for the trust, were one of a number of families who lobbied former health secretary Sajid Javid. NHS England appointed Ms Ockenden to lead a review in Nottingham in May 2022, following her previous work investigating the deaths of more than 200 babies at Shrewsbury and Telford. A review was already under way in Nottingham but critics said its remit was too narrow andit was not independent enough. The Nottingham trust was established in 2006 when the management of the Nottingham City Hospital and the Queen's Medical Centre (QMC) merged to form one organisation. Figures obtained by the BBC have found that, between 2005-6 and 2020-21, there were a total of 207 claims against the hospital's maternity services, including 36 for cerebral palsy, 26 for stillbirths and 24 for brain damage. The total amount awarded in damages for that period was more than Â£110m. In December 2020, the trust's maternity serviceswere rated inadequatewith the Care Quality Commission (CQC) finding ""several serious concerns"".

Energy chief's plan to stave off bills crisis,"This video can not be played Ovo's Stephen Fitzpatrick says help with bills is needed now or the poorest households will be cold and hungry The boss of the UK's third largest energy supplier has proposed a plan for the government to subsidise soaring gas and electricity bills. Ovo Energy founder Stephen Fitzpatrick said under the scheme the poorest households would get the most support. Higher earners would see the amount of help taper off as they used more energy. The government said it was preparing to deliver any extra support as soon as a new prime minister is in place. Mr Fitzpatrick said action was needed now before the winter, otherwise the poorest households would be cold and hungry. A typical household gas and electricity bill will rise by 80% to Â£3,549 a year from October, the regulator Ofgem announced on Friday. Mr Fitzpatrick, the founder and chief executive of Ovo, which has 4.5 million customers,has published a 10-point plan,externalto address the crisis. A key proposal in the plan is to allow energy firms to borrow from a government-backed fund, and then use the money to subsidise bills. A similar proposal byScottish Power to freeze energy billsfor all at their current level was dismissed by the Treasury for giving the same relief to richer and poorer households. Under Mr Fitzpatrick's plan, everyone would get some assistance, but higher earners would see the amount of money received reduce, the more energy they used. This is a similar way to how the tax system works, with a tax-free allowance and increased levels of taxation for those on higher incomes. Short-term plans Bring forward the Â£400 energy rebate Increase funding for debt advisory charities Set up a fuel Poverty Task Force to identify households most at risk Medium-term plans Abolish the prepayment meter ""penalty"", which sees prepayment customers paying more than those on direct debit Subsidise bills though a Tariff Deficit Fund, which would be repaid over several years Abolish the standing charge that customers pay Mobilise a national effort to insulate UK homes Long-term plans Establish a single strategic buyer for all the UK's energy needs. Bring back the Department of Energy and Climate Change Introduce a carbon tax Mr Fitzpatrick is also urging the government to bring forward existing support measures. Currently all households will see Â£400 knocked off bills over a six-month period starting from October, with households on qualifying benefits getting an additional Â£650. Mr Fitzpatrick argues those payments should be made in full before Christmas. He said the higher charges faced by pre-payment customers amounted to a poverty penalty and should be abolished. Mr Fitzpatrick also advocates abolishing the standing charge - which customers pay regardless of their energy use. Tory leadership candidate Liz Truss - who pollsters have tipped to win the contest -hinted on Wednesday she would look at providing further supportto businesses and households. She also ruled out energy rationing - unlike rival Rishi Sunak, who said it should not be taken off the table. Separately, the Resolution Foundation has published a report which says typical household disposable incomes are on course to fall by 10%, or Â£3,000, over this year and next - ""the deepest living standards squeeze in a century"". The think tank also said the number of people living in absolute poverty was set to rise by three million to 14 million people in 2023-24. Absolute poverty is when household income is below the level necessary to meet basic living standards in terms of food, housing and healthcare costs. A review by the UCL Institute of Health Equity (IHE) has suggested,externalgrowing up in cold homes will have ""dangerous consequences"" for many children now and into adulthood. IHE director Professor Michael Marmot warned thousands of extra deaths could occur and the health and development of up to 10 million children could be affected directly or indirectly. Mr Fitzpatrick said helping low income families with energy bills ""has to be the first order of business"" for the new Conservative leader. He said: ""If we don't use every available moment over the next 12 weeks to solve this, we are going to see a winter like never before with people going hungry and going cold and the NHS being overwhelmed by the health impacts of the energy crisis."" A spokesperson for the Department for Health said: ""As the public would rightly expect, we are working closely with the NHS to ensure we are ready for extra pressures this winter, including providing an extra Â£79m last year to significantly expand our mental health services, enabling more children and young people to get help."" Mr Fitzpatrick said there was ""almost nothing that we can do right now that's going to be in time for 1 October when prices go up"". However, there were lots of short, medium and long-term changes to the energy system that would make it work better for customers, he said. ""It is incredibly important that we have a plan that will get us through the winter no matter what. We can't wait for the cold weather to come to try to figure out what we're going to do about it."" Mr Fitzpatrick also wants to create a ""national obsession"" with energy efficiency including a medium term plan to insulate the UK's energy-leaky homes. Longer term, he suggests the UK should establish a single strategic buyer for all the UK's energy needs. He argued this would mean the UK could secure its energy on a multi-year basis rather than individual companies buying their energy three to six months in advance. ""Over the past 10 years, the free market approach has worked to deliver affordable energy for the UK but we should accept that the next 10 years are going to look very different,"" he said. ""We are entering into an era of global competition to secure energy supplies and we need to think strategically, long term and at a national level."" A spokesperson for the Department for Business said: ""Officials are making the appropriate preparations in order to ensure that any additional support or commitments on cost of living can be delivered as quickly as possible when the new prime minister is in place.""

What a Pizza Hut ad says about Gorbachev - and RussiaThe former Soviet leader's appearance in a 1998 pizza advert played on his conflicted reputation.,"This video can not be played Watch: 1998 BBC report on Gorbachev Pizza Hut advert A man and a child walk through an almost empty Red Square in Moscow, umbrella in hand, snow on the ground. It looks extremely cold - a good day to be inside eating lunch with your family. As dramatic music plays, the advert cuts to close-up shots of the pair - a troubled-looking man in a black overcoat and cap, and his smiling granddaughter. Within seconds they reach their destination: a Pizza Hut restaurant located directly in Red Square - the central plaza where so much of Soviet and Russian history is reflected. But why, 24 years on, is this advert being shared as an era-defining artefact? Because the man in the black overcoat - the man, in effect, selling American pizza - is Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union. The advert begins in a cold-looking Red Square, which was closed off for the shoot Gorbachev himself was unsure about whether or not he should do the advert - with his wife, Raisa, even more uncomfortable with the idea. On the one hand, he needed the money and a hefty fee was on offer. He is said to have used it to fund the Gorbachev Foundation - a think tank which he founded. On the other hand, appearing in an advert for a huge American corporation was sure to further damage his already poor reputation inside Russia. ""It was on, then it was off, it was on, then it was off,"" Katie Bistrian - an American who represented Gorbachev in negotiations - tells the BBC. ""Either [the uncertainty] was the way Russians negotiated - or it really was a sign of the turmoil of whether it was right for him or not."" Eventually, Gorbachev agreed - though with conditions. He would not be filmed eating pizza (that was left to his granddaughter), and he would have final sign-off on the script. And, says Ms Bistrian, he would only wear his own hat, despite the fact that a body-double had already been filmed wearing a different one. ""He puts on his own hat and says 'how does this hat look on me?' I said 'oh it looks lovely'. He said 'exactly, I'll wear this hat!"" At the end of the advert, Gorbachev smiles and waves at the crowd as they chant his name The advert - filmed in 1997, and released the following year - neatly reflects the complexities of Russian society a few years after the fall of the Soviet Union. ""[If you are] trying to contextualise Moscow of the 1990s - [the advert] is a one minute lesson,"" Dr Yuval Weber, a Russia expert who uses the advert as a teaching tool, tells the BBC. The American pizza chain's presence in Moscow - the first branch opened in 1990 - was a symbol of the growing economic ties between the West and Russia. But, as becomes clear in the advert, the reforms which Gorbachev began were not universally popular. His leadership saw an opening up of the Soviet economy and brought a degree of democracy to the autocratic country. But he was unable to prevent the union's slow collapse, and many Russians blame him for the years of economic and social turmoil that followed. In the advert, a middle-aged man (played by Richard Marner, whose roles include Col Kurt von Strohm in the British sitcom 'Allo 'Allo) notices the former leader and exclaims: ""It's Gorbachev!"" before complaining: ""Because of him, we have economic confusion."" But a younger man replies: ""Because of him, we have opportunity!"" - suggesting a generation more open to the economic liberalisation of the 1990s. The conversation continues: ""instability"", ""freedom"", ""chaos"", and ""hope"", all offered as examples of what Gorbachev brought to Russia. For Dr Weber, who works at the Bush School of Government at Texas A&M University, the dialogue reflects the realities of Russian society at the time. ""You have the middle-aged guy - clearly things didn't work out for him in the last 10 years or so... He talks about instability - the larger sense is that what Gorbachev represents is the absence of stability,"" he says. ""At the same time we have the younger guy - he's young enough and agile enough to take advantage of whatever opportunities came from the transition of one economic system to another."" The Soviet leader who helped end the Cold War In pictures: The life of Mikhail Gorbachev The disagreement between the two men is halted with an interjection from an elderly woman - perhaps the grandmother - who has her own reason to thank Gorbachev. ""Thanks to him, we have... Pizza Hut,"" she says. No-one can argue with that, and after a second's thought the middle-aged man, previously unhappy with Russia's economic chaos, stands up, raises his pizza slice in the air and exclaims: ""Hail to Gorbachev!"" It is quite a turnaround. Soon, the whole restaurant joins in. Gorbachev smiles and waves while his granddaughter rubs her hands. Using Gorbachev as a source of conflict - and pizza as the unifier - was the idea of the advert's creators. ""We were looking for some way to use Gorbachev... as a source of controversy, and let the pizza bring people together. At least they could agree that he had brought them pizza, and that was a good thing,"" one of the writers, Tom Derbyshire,told Newshour on the BBC World Service. The family in the restaurant eventually get to their feet and chant Gorbachev's name The advert was aired internationally but was never shown in Russia, where it was ridiculed by the press. In the West, the film has gained a sort of cult status, reappearing every few years on social media as people rediscover the strange contradiction of the former Soviet leader selling American pizzas. Gorbachev will be remembered in many ways - revered in the West for his part in ending the Cold War, but widely disliked in Russia for the economic and social turmoil brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Almost 25 years on, this short film reflects both sides of that legacy. And what happened to Pizza Hut in Russia? Nearly a quarter of a century after the advert was filmed, the brand pulled out of the country - a response to the invasion of Ukraine.

What a Pizza Hut ad says about Gorbachev - and Russia,"This video can not be played Watch: 1998 BBC report on Gorbachev Pizza Hut advert A man and a child walk through an almost empty Red Square in Moscow, umbrella in hand, snow on the ground. It looks extremely cold - a good day to be inside eating lunch with your family. As dramatic music plays, the advert cuts to close-up shots of the pair - a troubled-looking man in a black overcoat and cap, and his smiling granddaughter. Within seconds they reach their destination: a Pizza Hut restaurant located directly in Red Square - the central plaza where so much of Soviet and Russian history is reflected. But why, 24 years on, is this advert being shared as an era-defining artefact? Because the man in the black overcoat - the man, in effect, selling American pizza - is Mikhail Gorbachev, the last leader of the Soviet Union. The advert begins in a cold-looking Red Square, which was closed off for the shoot Gorbachev himself was unsure about whether or not he should do the advert - with his wife, Raisa, even more uncomfortable with the idea. On the one hand, he needed the money and a hefty fee was on offer. He is said to have used it to fund the Gorbachev Foundation - a think tank which he founded. On the other hand, appearing in an advert for a huge American corporation was sure to further damage his already poor reputation inside Russia. ""It was on, then it was off, it was on, then it was off,"" Katie Bistrian - an American who represented Gorbachev in negotiations - tells the BBC. ""Either [the uncertainty] was the way Russians negotiated - or it really was a sign of the turmoil of whether it was right for him or not."" Eventually, Gorbachev agreed - though with conditions. He would not be filmed eating pizza (that was left to his granddaughter), and he would have final sign-off on the script. And, says Ms Bistrian, he would only wear his own hat, despite the fact that a body-double had already been filmed wearing a different one. ""He puts on his own hat and says 'how does this hat look on me?' I said 'oh it looks lovely'. He said 'exactly, I'll wear this hat!"" At the end of the advert, Gorbachev smiles and waves at the crowd as they chant his name The advert - filmed in 1997, and released the following year - neatly reflects the complexities of Russian society a few years after the fall of the Soviet Union. ""[If you are] trying to contextualise Moscow of the 1990s - [the advert] is a one minute lesson,"" Dr Yuval Weber, a Russia expert who uses the advert as a teaching tool, tells the BBC. The American pizza chain's presence in Moscow - the first branch opened in 1990 - was a symbol of the growing economic ties between the West and Russia. But, as becomes clear in the advert, the reforms which Gorbachev began were not universally popular. His leadership saw an opening up of the Soviet economy and brought a degree of democracy to the autocratic country. But he was unable to prevent the union's slow collapse, and many Russians blame him for the years of economic and social turmoil that followed. In the advert, a middle-aged man (played by Richard Marner, whose roles include Col Kurt von Strohm in the British sitcom 'Allo 'Allo) notices the former leader and exclaims: ""It's Gorbachev!"" before complaining: ""Because of him, we have economic confusion."" But a younger man replies: ""Because of him, we have opportunity!"" - suggesting a generation more open to the economic liberalisation of the 1990s. The conversation continues: ""instability"", ""freedom"", ""chaos"", and ""hope"", all offered as examples of what Gorbachev brought to Russia. For Dr Weber, who works at the Bush School of Government at Texas A&M University, the dialogue reflects the realities of Russian society at the time. ""You have the middle-aged guy - clearly things didn't work out for him in the last 10 years or so... He talks about instability - the larger sense is that what Gorbachev represents is the absence of stability,"" he says. ""At the same time we have the younger guy - he's young enough and agile enough to take advantage of whatever opportunities came from the transition of one economic system to another."" The Soviet leader who helped end the Cold War In pictures: The life of Mikhail Gorbachev The disagreement between the two men is halted with an interjection from an elderly woman - perhaps the grandmother - who has her own reason to thank Gorbachev. ""Thanks to him, we have... Pizza Hut,"" she says. No-one can argue with that, and after a second's thought the middle-aged man, previously unhappy with Russia's economic chaos, stands up, raises his pizza slice in the air and exclaims: ""Hail to Gorbachev!"" It is quite a turnaround. Soon, the whole restaurant joins in. Gorbachev smiles and waves while his granddaughter rubs her hands. Using Gorbachev as a source of conflict - and pizza as the unifier - was the idea of the advert's creators. ""We were looking for some way to use Gorbachev... as a source of controversy, and let the pizza bring people together. At least they could agree that he had brought them pizza, and that was a good thing,"" one of the writers, Tom Derbyshire,told Newshour on the BBC World Service. The family in the restaurant eventually get to their feet and chant Gorbachev's name The advert was aired internationally but was never shown in Russia, where it was ridiculed by the press. In the West, the film has gained a sort of cult status, reappearing every few years on social media as people rediscover the strange contradiction of the former Soviet leader selling American pizzas. Gorbachev will be remembered in many ways - revered in the West for his part in ending the Cold War, but widely disliked in Russia for the economic and social turmoil brought about by the collapse of the Soviet Union. Almost 25 years on, this short film reflects both sides of that legacy. And what happened to Pizza Hut in Russia? Nearly a quarter of a century after the advert was filmed, the brand pulled out of the country - a response to the invasion of Ukraine. Last Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev dies at 91 Duetting with Gorbachev.
