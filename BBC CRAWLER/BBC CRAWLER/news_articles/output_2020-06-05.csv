William reveals he is secret helpline volunteer,"This video can not be played Prince William revealed he was answering messages during a video call with volunteers in May The Duke of Cambridge has revealed he has been anonymously volunteering on a crisis helpline during lockdown. He has been volunteering at Shout 85258, which offers support via text message to people in personal crisis. Prince William said he had been answering messages after being trained by the mental health charity. Last month he told fellow volunteers in a video call: ""I'm going to share a little secret with you guys, but I'm actually on the platform volunteering."" Those texting the round-the-clock service would not know they are talking to a member of the Royal Family - like Shout's 2,000 volunteers, William would use a pseudonym on the platform. Kensington Palace announced the prince's involvement to mark Volunteers Week, which ends on Sunday. A new photograph of the duke with Prince George and Princess Charlotte volunteering on the Sandringham Estate, taken by the Duchess of Cambridge, has also been released. The Queen has praised the work of volunteers in a special message, saying: ""As Volunteers' Week draws to a close, it is inspiring to reflect on the many thousands of people, who through their acts of generosity and kindness, have achieved so much for the greater good. ""I have been following with interest how men and women from around the world, including my own family, have been helping and recognising the vital role of the volunteer. ""I send my best wishes to all those who give themselves so freely and selflessly in the service of others."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Cambridges and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex helped to launch Shout 85258 last year - investing Â£3m in the service via their Royal Foundation. In a little over a year since then, more than 300,000 text conversations have been had on the service. Around 65% of those texting are aged under 25, the charity said, with many messengers seeking mental health support. By BBC journalist and Shout volunteer Tony Smith Training as a crisis volunteer at Shout puts William in the frontline of services for young people in distress - and it's a tough role. CVs, as they're known, undertake special training to support those in crisis. On the Shout platform they'll encounter, and be tasked with helping, those in very real distress. Some texters are experiencing depression or panic attacks, others are self-harming. A large proportion say they feel suicidal. The job of the CV is to lead that texter to a cool, calm place where they may begin to establish solutions. Sometimes they'll just need to build resilience, with support from friends or family. In others, they'll be guided toward charities or NHS mental health support. It's not unusual for a texter to be about to take his or her own life. This can lead to what Shout call an 'Active Rescue' - the CV will continue gently talking to the texter while the emergency services are called in by a supervisor. Whether it be talking someone down from a bridge, or persuading them to put away that bottle of pills, these conversations can be gruelling and rewarding in equal measure. The fact that the second in line to the throne is now routinely helping people in such desperate situations is hugely significant - it gives Prince William a unique perspective on what young people in crisis may be going through. Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess of Wessex and the Duchess of Gloucester have been calling people who are self-isolating or vulnerable, as part of the Royal Voluntary Service's NHS Volunteer Responders scheme. The Countess of Wessex has also been privately volunteering to support efforts in local communities, including once a week with Mealforce and Helpforce, helping to provide daily meals for NHS workers across London. More than 750,000 peoplesigned up to be part of the scheme's ""volunteer army"" after it launched in April, but some laterexpressed frustration at not having been used. William fears NHS staff's struggle with 'hero' tag Kate launches virus portraits photography project Royal Family thanks world's nurses in video calls Last week, the Duchess of Cambridge thanked others who had signed up to help the scheme, calling them ""the backbone of our country"". She and Prince William marked Volunteers Week by holding video calls with those helping charities in England and Wales. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and volunteers at Conscious Youth during a video call Among them were those working at Conscious Youth, which helps young people from mainly black and other ethnic minority backgrounds in West Yorkshire. During the call, Prince William joked about home-schooling his six-year-old son Prince George, saying: ""I struggle with Year 2 maths."" The royal couple also spoke to a group of neighbours in mid-Wales who have been offering help with shopping, cooking and deliveries during lockdown. The prince told the 120 volunteers they had offered ""a lifeline"" to people in their community.

"Biden: Trump 'despicable' for invoking George FloydMr Trump said the slain African American man was ""looking down"" and ""saying this is a great day"".US & Canada","This video can not be played Trump: 'Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying this is a great thing thatâs happening' US President Donald Trump has been condemned by his Democratic challenger Joe Biden for invoking George Floyd's name as he touted US jobs figures. Mr Trump said Mr Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis, is ""looking down"" and ""saying this is a great day"". Mr Biden, who has nowformally clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, said the remark was ""despicable"". Mr Trump spoke while celebrating a surprise US jobs rebound. In his speech, the president called for ""equal justice under the law"". DC mayor names plaza 'Black Lives Matter' Mr Floyd, who was unarmed and in handcuffs, died on 25 May after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The officer involved was charged with murder and three colleagues stand accused of aiding and abetting. The death triggered protests against racial discrimination across the US and world. On Friday, Minneapolis banned the police neck restraint seen in the video of Mr Floyd's death, and California pledged to follow suit. Speaking in the White House Rose Garden on Friday, Mr Trump said: ""Equal justice under the law must mean that every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement regardless of race, colour, gender or creed. ""They have to receive fair treatment from law enforcement. They have to receive it. This video can not be played ""It doesn't matter which skin colour you have"" ""We all saw what happened last week. We can't let that happen. ""Hopefully George is looking down and saying this is a great thing that's happening for our country. A great day for him. It's a great day for everybody."" Mr Trump, a Republican, added: ""This is a great, great day in terms of equality."" The president's critics said he was crassly suggesting Mr Floyd would be posthumously celebrating positive jobs figures. Mr Trump's defenders said the context of his comments make clear he was referring to his call for equal treatment of all Americans by police. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? The Democratic presidential candidate hit back during a campaign speech in Dover, Delaware. He said: ""George Floyd's last words, 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe' echoed all across this nation and quite frankly around the world. This video can not be played ""Fifty plus years later we're still dealing with the same thing"" ""For the president to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd I frankly think is despicable."" Mr Biden, a former US vice-president, has been sharpening his attacks on Mr Trump as the 3 November White House election looms. While campaigning in his home state of Delaware on Thursday night, he said Mr Trump brings out the ""worst"" of some Americans and ""there are probably anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of the people out there, they're just not very good people"". On Friday, Mr Biden secured the 1,991 delegates he needed to be chosen as nominee at the Democratic party's national convention, US media reported. This happened after presidential primaries in seven states and the District of Columbia. ""I am going to spend every day between now and 3 November fighting to earn the votes of Americans all across this great country,"" Mr Biden said. The latest US monthly jobs report on Friday showed employers added 2.5 million jobs, defying economists' predictions of further decline. For black workers, however, the unemployment rate crept upwards from 16.7% to 16.8%. The losses from the coronavirus pandemic have hit minority and low-wage workers hardest. The Hispanic unemployment rate declined in April from 18.5% to 17.2%. And it fell among white workers to 12.4% from 13.8%. The two-block long mural reading ""Black Lives Matter"" was painted overnight outside the White House The Minneapolis City Council and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights on Friday agreed to ban police neck restraints and chokeholds. The new policy, which will be enforceable in court, requires any officer regardless of rank to verbally and physically intervene if they witness a colleague using such unauthorised force. This video can not be played ""I remember George Floyd as me"" California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom said on Friday he would move to end state police training in the use of the ""carotid restraint"". San Diego Police Department banned the technique this week in response to the nationwide uproar over events in Minneapolis. Officials in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles have all previously taken steps to ban or limit the use of chokeholds by members of their police departments. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church.

Want to sell a home? Make the garden look nice,"Sellers are being told to show off gardens of any size Landlords and owners putting their homes on the market are being told to show off gardens in marketing photos as house-hunters search for space. Pictures of the kitchen had previously been considered key to attracting the attention of browsers. Lockdown has changed the priorities of buyers and renters, many of whom have been working from home, research by property portal Rightmove suggests. Flats are the big losers, as indoor and outdoor space becomes a bigger draw. Rightmove said that a studio flat was the most sought-after property type among renters in January, but by May - after the coronavirus lockdown - it had dropped out of the top five. A two-bedroom house is now the biggest attraction. Flats have also dropped out of the top five wanted list among buyers, calculated from the number of enquiries per property of each type. Many people would usually have been priced out of larger homes with big gardens, but indications suggest they are willing to accept a longer commute in order to cast the net wider for an affordable property. The property market was effectively shut down for weeks owing to the coronavirus pandemic. Since the easing of restrictions in England in mid-May, property portals and estate agents have reported a surge in interest. Some believethe rebound will be short-livedowing to inevitable economic pain which will follow the outbreak. At present, interest in property is high in some areas. Lockdown break-ups, job losses and urgent relocations are thought to have led toa surge in the rental sector. This is dependent on the area. Coastal towns, and some urban areas have seen significantly higher rental demand, topped by a 51% increase compared with last year in Wolverhampton, Rightmove data shows. However, London and the commuter belt of south-east England have seen demand fall, with the biggest drop of nearly 14% compared with last year seen in Croydon. Property sales plunged during lockdown, but at the same time renters and buyers appear to have reassessed what they want in a home. Estate agent Savills, which deals with high-end property, has noted higher interest in countryside living. Now the Rightmove research for the BBC, based on the website's data and a survey of 4,000 potential movers, has suggested 49% of renters and 39% of buyers have changed what they are looking for as a response to living in lockdown. Among buyers, four and six bedroom houses have become more sought-after. Mortgage payment holiday extended for further three months House prices see largest monthly fall for 11 years, says Nationwide As half of those asked wanted to work from home with only occasional trips to work, a third of movers wanted a better domestic workspace. Good internet and a spare room are now higher up on wish-lists, but commuting times and transport links are less important, the survey found. The most-viewed property on Rightmove during lockdown has no problem with space The good Spring weather seems to have made one of the biggest impacts on intentions. ""Both buyers and renters are craving a home with its own outside space rather than a flat,"" said Miles Shipside, Rightmove's housing market analyst. Searches by buyers for homes with gardens on Rightmove were up 42% in May compared with the same month a year ago, and increased by 84% over the same period among renters. ""Usually home-movers tell us the kitchen photographs are the most important when they're looking at a property advert, but now agents should consider giving greater prominence to pictures of gardens and outdoor spaces to attract the attention of prospective renters and buyers,"" Mr Shipside said. He said sellers should consider painting the fence and clearing out the shed to make a property more attractive and landlords should ensure a communal garden has been included in any rental listing. The demand for outdoor space has been seen before, but could fizzle out as sellers with gardens raise their asking prices accordingly.

Full school opening 'may cause virus second wave',"Sending all children back to school - and freeing parents to go back to work - could trigger a second wave of coronavirus, warn researchers. UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine team said testing and tracing contacts of those with the virus might help prevent this. But the current test and trace system would need to be more effective. The study,externalis the first to assess the extent of contact tracing that will be needed to prevent a second wave. It used computer models to see how the virus might spread as pupils returned to the classroom and their parents were freed from childcare and able return to work or other activities. The academics investigated the impact of the ""phased return"" strategy in England. They analysed what happens when Reception, Year 1 and Year Six go back at the start of June; followed by all primary school pupils in July; secondary pupils in Year 10 and 12 having some contact in July and all secondary schools going back in September. The study showed the combined effect on pupils and parents would be enough to cause a second wave without an effective test and trace programme. This would happen around December 2020 and would be twice as big as the first peak, unless the government took other actions such as re-imposing lockdown. SCHOOLS:When will children be returning? EXERCISE:What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? How test and trace works: People with symptoms of cough, fever or loss of sense of smell or taste are tested If they are positive for coronavirus, they isolate for seven days and their household does so for 14 days They have to tell the NHS everyone they have come into close contact with These contacts must also spend 14 days in quarantine The success of the scheme is dependent on how well the testing and the contact tracing goes. The model suggested a second wave would be prevented if: 51% of people were being tested and 40% of their contacts traced Or if 43% of people were being tested and 80% of their contacts traced Modelling is not a crystal ball and there is always uncertainty around any predictions. However, researchers are concerned England is not achieving those figures. About 1,700 people are testing positive every day in hospitals, care homes and the wider community, while figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest there are 5,600 new infections a day in the community alone - and one Public Health England reportsuggests 17,000 infections per day,external. There is still no official data on the number of contacts being traced, buta report by the Times (paywall) suggests it is less than 40%,external. ""Our concern from the data at the moment is test-trace-isolate is not reaching the coverage we think is the minimum,"" Prof Chris Bonell, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. ""There is clearly a risk of a second pandemic waveâ¦ I'm worried. The R [rate of virus spread] is a bit below one [the point at which the number of new cases starts to take off again], but the incidence is high so it's precarious."" This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, from UCL, said it would have been better to wait until test and trace was fully up and running before lifting lockdown. ""Cases are not coming down as much as we wanted. I would caution against reopening schools when we are doing a lot of other interventions and we don't know the impact of them. ""Everything depends on control of transmission, there is the threat of a second pandemic wave."" Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Warwick have also published modelling on the impact of reopening schools. It looked only at the impact of children mixing, not the society-wide effect of schools opening. It found that halving the size of classes or focusing on getting younger children into school was less likely to push the R number above 1, the point at which the number of new cases starts to take off again. Secondary schools were deemed more risky, as older children come into contact with more people. ""If we reopen all schools it could push R above 1 in some regions,"" Dr Ed Hill said. But he added: ""Decisions surrounding reopening of schools are a difficult trade-off between the epidemiological consequences and the needs of the children in terms of educational development.""

"Biden: Trump 'despicable' for invoking George FloydMr Trump said the slain African American man was ""looking down"" and ""saying this is a great day"".","This video can not be played Trump: 'Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying this is a great thing thatâs happening' US President Donald Trump has been condemned by his Democratic challenger Joe Biden for invoking George Floyd's name as he touted US jobs figures. Mr Trump said Mr Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis, is ""looking down"" and ""saying this is a great day"". Mr Biden, who has nowformally clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, said the remark was ""despicable"". Mr Trump spoke while celebrating a surprise US jobs rebound. In his speech, the president called for ""equal justice under the law"". DC mayor names plaza 'Black Lives Matter' Mr Floyd, who was unarmed and in handcuffs, died on 25 May after a policeman knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The officer involved was charged with murder and three colleagues stand accused of aiding and abetting. The death triggered protests against racial discrimination across the US and world. On Friday, Minneapolis banned the police neck restraint seen in the video of Mr Floyd's death, and California pledged to follow suit. Speaking in the White House Rose Garden on Friday, Mr Trump said: ""Equal justice under the law must mean that every American receives equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement regardless of race, colour, gender or creed. ""They have to receive fair treatment from law enforcement. They have to receive it. This video can not be played ""It doesn't matter which skin colour you have"" ""We all saw what happened last week. We can't let that happen. ""Hopefully George is looking down and saying this is a great thing that's happening for our country. A great day for him. It's a great day for everybody."" Mr Trump, a Republican, added: ""This is a great, great day in terms of equality."" The president's critics said he was crassly suggesting Mr Floyd would be posthumously celebrating positive jobs figures. Mr Trump's defenders said the context of his comments make clear he was referring to his call for equal treatment of all Americans by police. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? The Democratic presidential candidate hit back during a campaign speech in Dover, Delaware. He said: ""George Floyd's last words, 'I can't breathe, I can't breathe' echoed all across this nation and quite frankly around the world. This video can not be played ""Fifty plus years later we're still dealing with the same thing"" ""For the president to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd I frankly think is despicable."" Mr Biden, a former US vice-president, has been sharpening his attacks on Mr Trump as the 3 November White House election looms. While campaigning in his home state of Delaware on Thursday night, he said Mr Trump brings out the ""worst"" of some Americans and ""there are probably anywhere from 10 to 15 percent of the people out there, they're just not very good people"". On Friday, Mr Biden secured the 1,991 delegates he needed to be chosen as nominee at the Democratic party's national convention, US media reported. This happened after presidential primaries in seven states and the District of Columbia. ""I am going to spend every day between now and 3 November fighting to earn the votes of Americans all across this great country,"" Mr Biden said. The latest US monthly jobs report on Friday showed employers added 2.5 million jobs, defying economists' predictions of further decline. For black workers, however, the unemployment rate crept upwards from 16.7% to 16.8%. The losses from the coronavirus pandemic have hit minority and low-wage workers hardest. The Hispanic unemployment rate declined in April from 18.5% to 17.2%. And it fell among white workers to 12.4% from 13.8%. The two-block long mural reading ""Black Lives Matter"" was painted overnight outside the White House The Minneapolis City Council and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights on Friday agreed to ban police neck restraints and chokeholds. The new policy, which will be enforceable in court, requires any officer regardless of rank to verbally and physically intervene if they witness a colleague using such unauthorised force. This video can not be played ""I remember George Floyd as me"" California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom said on Friday he would move to end state police training in the use of the ""carotid restraint"". San Diego Police Department banned the technique this week in response to the nationwide uproar over events in Minneapolis. Officials in New York, San Francisco, Chicago and Los Angeles have all previously taken steps to ban or limit the use of chokeholds by members of their police departments. 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church.

The 'unscrupulous' firms targeting key workers,"""Unscrupulous"" firms are promising NHS workers big savings through tax dodging schemes that could leave them out of pocket. The firms, which operate at the fringes of the law, target key workers drafted in to help with the coronavirus crisis, a BBC Money Box investigation found. Social media adverts push workers toward some umbrella companies that take a hefty cut of their salaries. In return, these companies hide a portion of their pay from the taxman. But Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has said signing up with these firms, which it described as ""unscrupulous"", could leave key workers facing large, unexpected tax bills. One advert on Twitter says: ""If you've been drafted in to reinforce the NHS response to the #coronavirus pandemic, we want to assist you."" When operating legitimately, working through an umbrella company can make it easier to take on jobs for multiple employers at once. The worker has their salary paid to the umbrella company, which then pays tax, National Insurance and other deductions on their behalf. After taking a fee, the umbrella company will then pay the worker what is left. But one company told Money Box that it was possible to save thousands of pounds a year legally by hiding a large chunk of a worker's salary from the taxman. Posing as a healthcare worker on a salary of Â£145 a day, our reporter was told by Dark Blue Professional, a UK-registered umbrella company, that they could take home 78% of their salary, which is more than they would have made through a standard umbrella company. Kay from Dark Blue Professional explained how the scheme works: ""You receive one payment which is a PAYE [pay as you earn] salary payment, that's taxed and you receive a payslip - and the residual balance is then paid as an investment payment."" ""You receive your second amount into your accountâ¦and because it's done that way there is no tax liability on the second proportion,"" she told us. As a result, a healthcare worker earning Â£725 per week would be able to pocket Â£60 more than if they used a standard umbrella company. 'I may lose it all, but there's no help for me' Gambling loophole 'must be shut down' But what Kay did not say is that Dark Blue Professional would take Â£80 a week in fees, four times the industry standard, and that the government would be cheated out of up to half the tax that it should have received. Kay insisted the scheme is tax compliant. But similar types of scheme have been challenged by HMRC in the past, which has left thousands of workers withcrippling tax bills. Some even faced losing their homes, leaving their finances in tatters. Responding to the findings of Money Box investigation, Judith Freedman - professor of taxation law and policy at Oxford University - said: ""There's a strong likelihood that HMRC will challenge them [the schemes] successfully. ""Not only could the individual taxpayers be left with a big tax bill and a lot of hassle, but they have already paid relatively large fees to the promoters, so they are much worse off than they would have been doing things in a straightforward way,"" she said. ""It is distressing that people are trying to sell these schemes withâ¦minimal explanation of the risks. Everything possible needs to be done to stop the firms doing this before ordinary taxpayers get caught up in it."" Money Box also spoke to a broker from Contracting Scout, which actively targets key workers with adverts on Twitter and LinkedIn. ""Tim"", from Contracting Scout, offered to sign us up with an umbrella company also offering 78% take home pay. He explained that the umbrella companies he works with ""are taking advantage of a few tax loopholes"" and admitted that ""the government doesn't like it"". ""They [the government] do try and legislate against it, but legislation is extremely slow, so once the new legislation moves in there's a hundred different umbrellas that pop up next week with a different type of payment structure which doesn't get captivated by the law. ""So the goal posts are always moving and the providers are always trying to cater to that,"" he said. Neither of the two companies responded to the findings of our investigation. An HMRC spokesperson told Money Box ""it is shocking that unscrupulous promoters of tax avoidance schemes are targeting returning NHS workers during this difficult time. HMRC published [advice] on 30 March warning returning workers about this very issue. ""Our advice has always been to steer well clear of such schemes, and to report them to us in confidence for investigation"".

Two-metre rule 'must be relaxed for musicians',"The government is being urged to ease social distancing for musicians, so more of them can get back performing and recording. Musicians' Union leader Horace Trubridge told the BBC they could play ""side by side"" to lessen the risk of spreading coronavirus. The 2m rule was ""overkill"" at a ""bleak"" time for his members, he added. The government said it welcomed ""creative and innovative"" ideas to help the UK's ""brilliant"" musicians. Coronavirus means theatres, pubs, clubs and other indoor music venues will be closed for the foreseeable future, while promoters have cancelled all the UK's main festivals. How could Brexit affect music festivals? Could social distancing of less than two metres work? Writers 'face weird boom time' after crisis The Labour-affiliated Musicians' Union is in talks with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport over ""enhanced busking"" - allowing spectators in outdoor spaces to make contactless payments for individual and group performances. ""They seem to be keen on that,"" Mr Trubridge said, adding that councils could ""relax their bylaws"" to help ""get live music back into the public's consciousness"". He argued it was difficult to see a way of easing social distancing for audiences to make theatres and venues viable during the pandemic, but that this was not the case for performers. ""There's no finesse about the 2m rule at the moment,"" Mr Trubridge said. ""If you're in a line rather than looking at each other, then it seems to be overkill."" Parks could become venues for ""enhanced busking"", the Musicians' Union says The World Health Organisation recommends a distance of 1m between people from different households, but the UK is sticking to the 2m rule. Mr Trubridge said this distance was particularly unnecessary for string instrumentalists, as opposed to singers, as they could wear masks. Many musicians had been earning Â£20,000 a year or less even before coronavirus, and some were missing out on furlough payments and loans, he said, adding: ""I can't see anything really significant happening this year to help them out of this hole."" This video can not be played Abbey Road Studios re-opens after 10 weeks of closure A Department for Culture, Media and Sport spokesperson said: ""These are challenging times for the UK's world-class music industry, and we are providing unprecedented support through substantial financial measures such as the Self-Employed Income Support and Bounce Back loan schemes.""

MP admits 'barbecue' lockdown breach,"Mr Seely said he talked to the journalist for about 35 minutes ""at a sensible distance"". A Conservative MP has admitted he failed to follow lockdown guidance when he reportedly attended a barbecue. Isle of Wight MP Bob Seely went to an evening gathering at a journalist's home in Seaview on 22 May, according to theGuardian newspaper.,external Mr Seely said he and his girlfriend met the man for a work-related discussion and ate ""half a sausage"", but did not enter the house or have a drink. The local Green Party said ""islanders will rightly be furious"". Mr Seely apologised, saying he should have left when he saw others were there. Green Party spokesperson Vix Lowthion said islanders would be ""furious"" Calling for the MP to consider standing down, Green Party spokesperson Vix Lowthion said: ""Thousands of his constituents have not seen their own grandchildren, parents and friends. ""Islanders will rightly be furious to read that our MP broke lockdown rules through going to a BBQ with journalists at their second home on the island on bank holiday weekend."" At the time people could only meet one other person from another household at a distance in a public place. Mr Seely, who is leading efforts to promote the trial of theCovid-19 contact-tracing appon the island, said the journalist had wanted to discuss the project with him. In a statement, he said: ""When I arrived, I saw another couple of people there, which I was not expecting. I thought about leaving, but felt that was perhaps over-reacting. ""I apologise because, on balance, I called this wrong. It would have been better to have spoken to this person without any others nearby."" The MP said he talked to the journalist for about 35 minutes ""at a sensible distance"". He added his girlfriend had accompanied him because it was ""after normal working hours"". Asked later on Isle of Wight Radio whether the event was a barbecue, he replied: ""I think I probably had half a sausage... but did not treat it as a social event because I was there for work."" The Home Office said it would not comment on an individual and reiterated current guidance was ""for everyone"". The Cabinet Office has not yet responded to a BBC request for comment.

WHO changes its advice on face masks,"The WHO had previously said there was not enough evidence to say that healthy people should wear masks The World Health Organization (WHO) has changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible to help stop the spread of coronavirus. The global body said new information showed they could provide ""a barrier for potentially infectious droplets"". Some countries already recommend or mandate face coverings in public. The WHO had previously argued there was not enough evidence to say that healthy people should wear masks. However, WHO director-general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that ""in light of evolving evidence, the WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments"". The new rules for face coverings in England explained The mystery of asymptomatic 'silent spreaders' Tracking the global outbreak The organisation had always advised that medical face masks should be worn by people who are sick and by those caring for them. Globally, there have been 6.7 million confirmed coronavirus cases and nearly 400,000 deaths since the outbreak began late last year,according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University,external. The organisation saidits new guidance,externalhad been prompted by studies over recent weeks. Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO's technical lead expert on Covid-19, told Reuters news agency the recommendation was for people to wear a ""fabric mask - that is, a non-medical mask"". Fabric masks should consist of ""at least three layers of different material"" in order to be effective, the WHO says. However, those aged over-60 and with underlying health risks should wear medical masks in areas where there is community transmission. At the same time, the WHO stressed that face masks were just one of a range of tools that could be used to reduce the risk of transmission - and that they should not give people a false sense of protection. ""Masks on their own will not protect you from Covid-19,"" Dr Tedros said. This is a big shift in the WHO's guidance on when the public should cover their faces. For months, the organisation's experts stuck to the line that masks would encourage a false sense of security and would deprive medical professionals of badly needed protective equipment. Those arguments have not gone away but at the same time the WHO acknowledges that new evidence has emerged on the risks of transmission. It points to recent research that people can be highly infectious in the few days before they show symptoms and that some people catch the virus but never show symptoms at all,as I reported last weekend. So where distancing is not possible, such as on public transport and in locations as varied as shops and refugee camps, it is suggested that faces are covered with homemade masks to avoid passing on the infection. Over 60s with underlying health conditions should go further, the WHO said, and wear medical-grade masks to give themselves better protection.

GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic VACCINE:Stalled programmes 'putting children's lives at risk' In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro threatened to pull the country out of the WHO unless it ceased to be a ""partisan political organisation"". The leader, who had initially dismissed the virus as a ""little flu"", has been critical of the lockdown policies recommended by the agency to tackle the spread of the disease. Last week,US President Donald Trump said he would end ties with the WHO, saying it had failed to hold China - where the outbreak begun - to account over coronavirus. In the UK, the government announced on Friday that hospital visitors and outpatients would be required to wear face coverings, and that hospital staff would have to wear medical masks, even if they were not in a clinical setting. The guidance will come into force on 15 June, as more businesses open up and more pupils return to school. Also on Fridaythe UK became the second country to record more than 40,000coronavirus-related deaths, after the US.

Prince William reveals he is a helpline counsellor,"This video can not be played Prince William revealed he was answering messages during a video call with volunteers in May The Duke of Cambridge has revealed he has been anonymously volunteering on a crisis helpline during lockdown. He has been volunteering at Shout 85258, which offers support via text message to people in personal crisis. Prince William said he had been answering messages after being trained by the mental health charity. Last month he told fellow volunteers in a video call: ""I'm going to share a little secret with you guys, but I'm actually on the platform volunteering."" Those texting the round-the-clock service would not know they are talking to a member of the Royal Family - like Shout's 2,000 volunteers, William would use a pseudonym on the platform. Kensington Palace announced the prince's involvement to mark Volunteers Week, which ends on Sunday. A new photograph of the duke with Prince George and Princess Charlotte volunteering on the Sandringham Estate, taken by the Duchess of Cambridge, has also been released. The Queen has praised the work of volunteers in a special message, saying: ""As Volunteers' Week draws to a close, it is inspiring to reflect on the many thousands of people, who through their acts of generosity and kindness, have achieved so much for the greater good. ""I have been following with interest how men and women from around the world, including my own family, have been helping and recognising the vital role of the volunteer. ""I send my best wishes to all those who give themselves so freely and selflessly in the service of others."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Cambridges and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex helped to launch Shout 85258 last year - investing Â£3m in the service via their Royal Foundation. In a little over a year since then, more than 300,000 text conversations have been had on the service. Around 65% of those texting are aged under 25, the charity said, with many messengers seeking mental health support. By BBC journalist and Shout volunteer Tony Smith Training as a crisis volunteer at Shout puts William in the frontline of services for young people in distress - and it's a tough role. CVs, as they're known, undertake special training to support those in crisis. On the Shout platform they'll encounter, and be tasked with helping, those in very real distress. Some texters are experiencing depression or panic attacks, others are self-harming. A large proportion say they feel suicidal. The job of the CV is to lead that texter to a cool, calm place where they may begin to establish solutions. Sometimes they'll just need to build resilience, with support from friends or family. In others, they'll be guided toward charities or NHS mental health support. It's not unusual for a texter to be about to take his or her own life. This can lead to what Shout call an 'Active Rescue' - the CV will continue gently talking to the texter while the emergency services are called in by a supervisor. Whether it be talking someone down from a bridge, or persuading them to put away that bottle of pills, these conversations can be gruelling and rewarding in equal measure. The fact that the second in line to the throne is now routinely helping people in such desperate situations is hugely significant - it gives Prince William a unique perspective on what young people in crisis may be going through. Meanwhile, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess of Wessex and the Duchess of Gloucester have been calling people who are self-isolating or vulnerable, as part of the Royal Voluntary Service's NHS Volunteer Responders scheme. The Countess of Wessex has also been privately volunteering to support efforts in local communities, including once a week with Mealforce and Helpforce, helping to provide daily meals for NHS workers across London. More than 750,000 peoplesigned up to be part of the scheme's ""volunteer army"" after it launched in April, but some laterexpressed frustration at not having been used. William fears NHS staff's struggle with 'hero' tag Kate launches virus portraits photography project Royal Family thanks world's nurses in video calls Last week, the Duchess of Cambridge thanked others who had signed up to help the scheme, calling them ""the backbone of our country"". She and Prince William marked Volunteers Week by holding video calls with those helping charities in England and Wales. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and volunteers at Conscious Youth during a video call Among them were those working at Conscious Youth, which helps young people from mainly black and other ethnic minority backgrounds in West Yorkshire. During the call, Prince William joked about home-schooling his six-year-old son Prince George, saying: ""I struggle with Year 2 maths."" The royal couple also spoke to a group of neighbours in mid-Wales who have been offering help with shopping, cooking and deliveries during lockdown. The prince told the 120 volunteers they had offered ""a lifeline"" to people in their community.

Coronavirus ban on evicting renters extended,"Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has announced a two-month extension to the government's ban on evicting renters amid the Covid-19 pandemic. New evictions in England and Wales of tenants in both social and privately-rented accommodation will be suspended until 23 August. ""No-one will be evicted from their home this summer due to coronavirus,"" Mr Jenrick tweeted. But housing charity Shelter said the announcement was ""only a stop-gap"". Allow Twitter content?

The extension will run from 25 June, the end of the the three-month period originally announcedas part of emergency coronavirus legislation in March. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said it would benefit ""millions of renters"". Government support for renters during the pandemic was ""unprecedented"", Mr Jenrick said. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""The government has reset the clock on the evictions ban, buying the families who were only weeks away from losing their homes a vital stay of execution. But she said: ""The ban hasn't stopped people who've lost their jobs during this pandemic from racking up rent arrears. Even if they have a plan to pay them back, these debts will throw struggling renters straight back into the firing line of an automatic eviction as soon as the ban does lift.â¯â¯ ""It's critical that Robert Jenrick uses this extension wisely to change the law and properly protect renters,"" she added. Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""Simply extending the pause of repossession is a sticking plaster not a cure. People who have fallen behind on rent arrears and those who have been furloughed or lost their jobs will need the security of proper reform to the rules governing evictions. ""We look forward to working with the government in the coming weeks on changes to make sure they keep their promise, that no renter should lose their home because of coronavirus."" Renters struggle most with pandemic costs, report says Lockdown break-ups and job changes boost rentals Recent research by the District Councils Networksuggests more than 486,242 households are spending more than half of their income on private rented housing, which could be at risk when the evictions ban is lifted. The network, which represents 187 local authorities in England, says single parents with children, young people and households on low incomes are particularly in danger of being tipped ""over the edge"" into homelessness. It called for a permanent boost to housing benefits for those in private rented homes and more funding for councils to fight homelessness, build homes and create jobs. The MHCLG said it was working on new rules ""to ensure vulnerable renters can be protected appropriately"" when the halt on evictions ended. But the National Residential Landlords Association called for the government ""to set out its plans for the market at the end of this one-time extension."" Chief executive Ben Beadle said: ""A failure to do so will cause serious damage to the private rented sector as a whole."" He added: ""It will ultimately be tenants who suffer as they will find it increasingly difficult to find affordable housing if landlords do not have the confidence that they will get their properties back swiftly in legitimate circumstances.""

Police brutality videos during protests shock US,"This video can not be played The man approached police in Buffalo before being pushed backwards Several videos of police brutality have emerged during protests over the death of African American George Floyd. In Buffalo two officers were suspended after they were seen shoving an elderly white man to the ground. Meanwhile Indianapolis police are investigating the actions of officers after they were seen beating and firing pepper rounds at a black woman. The reports come hours after a memorial for Floyd in Minneapolis, the city where he died at the hands of police. His killing, also captured on video, has caused outrage and sparked a wave of protests against racial discrimination and police treatment of African Americans in cities across the US and the world. The vast majority of demonstrations over the past eight days have been peaceful but some have descended into violence and rioting, with curfews imposed in a number of cities. This video can not be played NY Governor Andrew Cuomo: 'You see that video and it disturbs your basic sense of decency' At one protest, security forces in Washington DC fired pepper balls and smoke bombs to disperse demonstrators outside the White House, allowing President Donald Trump to walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. In response to this on Thursday, civil rights group the America Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit, accusing the president, the attorney general and others of violating the constitutional rights of protesters. ""When the nation's top law enforcement officer becomes complicit in the tactics of an autocrat, it chills protected speech for all of us,"" said ACLU official Scott Michelman, quoted by Reuters. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? In a separate development, police in Arizona released details of the killing of another African American, Dion Johnson, in Phoenix on 25 May, the same day as Floyd. Mr Johnson was shot dead by state troopers after being found ""passed out in the driver's seat"" of a car which was partially blocking traffic, a police statement said. ""During the trooper's contact with the suspect, there was a struggle and the trooper fired his service weapon striking the suspect,"" police said. The statement was only released after Mr Johnson's family was offeredaudio of the police dispatch,externaland transportation department video of the incident. The Buffalo video shows a 75-year-old man approach police officers enforcing a curfew. They then move forward, pushing him back and causing him to fall over and hit his head. As he lies on the ground, blood is seen pouring from his ear. The man was taken away in an ambulance and was later found to have suffered a severe head injury. An initial statement from Buffalo Police Department said the man had ""tripped"" and fallen during a ""skirmish involving protesters"", compounding outrage at the incident on social media. Police spokesman Jeff Rinaldo later attributed the statement to officers not directly involved in the incident, adding that when the video had emerged the two policemen who pushed the demonstrator had been suspended without pay. In Indianapolis,the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department is investigating,externalafter a video was widely shared on social media showing officers beating a woman with batons and shooting her with pepper rounds, the Indianapolis Star newspaper reported.

On Thursday New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo defended police, saying they were not beating citizens ""for no reason"", and if they did ""it's wrong"". City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the authorities were ""doing everything from a perspective of restraint"". This video can not be played The USA's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality But both men have since condemned the incidents which emerged overnight. In a tweet,Mr Cuomo described the Buffalo incident as ""wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful"",external. ""Police officers must enforce - NOT ABUSE - the law,"" he said. MeanwhileMayor de Blasio said he had complained to the city police department,externalafter seeing the video of the arrest of the delivery worker. The incidents happened as police enforced curfews in dozens of cities across the US after a wave of protests sparked by George Floyd's death. Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis. This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting A video showed him being arrested and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally, with rallies on Wednesday in Australia, France, the Netherlands andin the UK, where thousands gathered in central London. A rally in the Australian city of Sydney has been refused permission by a court, amid fears of coronavirus health risks. Thousands had been expected to attend. Floyd's death follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. For many, the outrage over Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination. This video can not be played Rev Al Sharpton eulogy: 'Get your knee off our neck' Protests over the death continued in dozens of cities on Thursday despite widespread curfews. They followed a memorial service attended by hundreds, who stood in  silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the amount of time Floyd was alleged to have been on the ground under the control of police in Minneapolis. A lawyer for George Floyd told the service a ""pandemic of racism"" had led to his death. Giving the eulogy, civil rights activist the Reverend Al Sharpton said it was time to stand up and say ""get your knee off our necks"". 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support. An athlete, friend and father - who was George Floyd?

Trade deal still possible with EU - Hancock,"This video can not be played Brexit: Barnier on UK approach to EU trade talks A trade deal with the EU based on the UK's ""very reasonable"" demands is still possible, cabinet minister Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary was speaking after the two sides admitted little progress had been made in the latest round. He said he ""very much"" hoped a no-deal outcome to the talks could be avoided if the two sides worked together. He was speaking after EU negotiator Michel Barnier accused the UK of ""backtracking"" on its commitments. The French official said differences remain in four key areas - fisheries, competition rules, governance and police cooperation. Guidelines for these issues were included in thepolitical declaration,,externalagreed by the UK and EU last year, which set out objectives for a future relationship. Analyis: What are the sticking points in the trade talks? Bank boss tells lenders to be ready for no-deal Brexit risk David Frost on EU policy position in UK trade talks Speaking in Brussels, Mr Barnier said: ""My responsibility is to speak to truth and, to tell the truth, this week there have been no significant areas of progress."" Matt Hancock said he hoped 'no deal' could be avoided He added: ""In all areas, the UK continues to backtrack under commitments undertaken in the political declaration, including on fisheries. We cannot and will not accept this backtracking on the political declaration."" This week's discussions - held online - were seen as the last chance to make progress ahead of a summit between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, expected to take place later this month. The UK has until the end of June to ask forthe ""transition period""- during which the country stays in the single market and customs union - to be extended into next year. But Mr Johnson has ruled this out. Mr Barnier said: ""We have always been open to the possibility of an extension of one or two years - as is possible under the exit agreement. And our door remains open."" Asked about the prospect of a no-deal exit from EU rules at the UK's daily coronavirus briefing, Matt Hancock said: ""I very much hope that we avoid that because our position is very reasonable ""It's that any agreement we reach must reflect the fact that the UK is an independent sovereign state. ""And we're working very hard and will accelerate the work to make progress in talks by the end of the year so that we can put into place the vision that has already been agreed between the UK and the EU which is based within the political declaration."" ""Plus Ã§a change,"" you could say. Round four of EU/UK trade negotiations after Brexit comes to an end. Cue yet another dismally downbeat assessment from the EU and the UK's chief negotiators. But I don't belong to the growing ""No deal is becoming the most likely outcome"" school of thought. On the contrary, both sides insisting loudly that their position will not waver (on all issues linked to national sovereignty for the UK; on all issues linked to the single market for the EU) is also a way of trying to reassure audiences back home that their interests will be protected, while privately considering what compromises they're prepared to make. Sift carefully through the rhetoric of EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Among his words of disappointment at the lack of progress, plus accusations that the UK is constantly ""backtracking"" on commitments, you'll find clear indications of wiggle-room in Brussels: a possible softening of EU demands on state aid rules and fishing quotas and an admission from Mr Barnier, that, if a deal were close this autumn, there would almost certainly be a ""dense"" period of last-minute negotiations. No compromise clues from the UK yet, though. It's not too late. But concessions will be needed from both sides for even a very narrow deal to be agreed by the UK-imposed deadline of the end of this year. A senior UK negotiating official told the BBC their side was prepared to accept some tariffs if they were needed to reach a deal with the EU. The UK was ""committed"" to sticking to the political declaration, but the document had been designed to set out only the ""parameters"" of discussions, they added, and was not a treaty. UK chief negotiator David Frost said: ""We continue to discuss the full range of issues, including the most difficult ones. Progress remains limited but our talks have been positive in tone. ""We are now at an important moment for these talks. We are close to reaching the limits of what we can achieve through the format of remote formal rounds."" UK officials told the BBC they would prefer to move to face-to-face talks but acknowledged that might not be possible just yet. The UK left the EU on 31 January. The transition period lasts until 31 December and keeps the UK bound to most EU rules. The sides currently have until then to reach a free trade deal, needed if they want to do business without tariffs, quotas or other barriers in future. Northern Ireland's first minister Arlene Foster said she was ""concerned"" about the current state of the talks. ""For both our sakes I hope that we get to a situation where we get a deal because that's what we need in Northern Ireland,"" she told Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast. ""We need to make sure that both sides understand that it is to both sides' benefit and that's something that I think the European Union often didn't get in the negotiations from 2016 onwards."" Businesses - hit by the coronavirus pandemic - have raised concerns over a possible ""cliff-edge"" break to the UK's remaining access to the EU single market at the end of the year with no replacement deal. The CBI business group called progress in the talks ""worryingly slow"", adding that this was causing ""deep concern to firms when resilience has rarely been more fragile"".

Police brutality videos during protests shock USCases emerge of police mistreatment amid unrest over the death of African American George Floyd.US & Canada,"This video can not be played The man approached police in Buffalo before being pushed backwards Several videos of police brutality have emerged during protests over the death of African American George Floyd. In Buffalo two officers were suspended after they were seen shoving an elderly white man to the ground. Meanwhile Indianapolis police are investigating the actions of officers after they were seen beating and firing pepper rounds at a black woman. The reports come hours after a memorial for Floyd in Minneapolis, the city where he died at the hands of police. His killing, also captured on video, has caused outrage and sparked a wave of protests against racial discrimination and police treatment of African Americans in cities across the US and the world. The vast majority of demonstrations over the past eight days have been peaceful but some have descended into violence and rioting, with curfews imposed in a number of cities. This video can not be played NY Governor Andrew Cuomo: 'You see that video and it disturbs your basic sense of decency' At one protest, security forces in Washington DC fired pepper balls and smoke bombs to disperse demonstrators outside the White House, allowing President Donald Trump to walk to a nearby church for a photo opportunity. In response to this on Thursday, civil rights group the America Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit, accusing the president, the attorney general and others of violating the constitutional rights of protesters. ""When the nation's top law enforcement officer becomes complicit in the tactics of an autocrat, it chills protected speech for all of us,"" said ACLU official Scott Michelman, quoted by Reuters. VIEWPOINT:Tipping point for racially divided nation WATCH:'This is why we are protesting' TIMELINE:Recent black deaths at hands of police BACKGROUND:Five pieces of context to understand the protests CRIME AND JUSTICE:How are African Americans treated? In a separate development, police in Arizona released details of the killing of another African American, Dion Johnson, in Phoenix on 25 May, the same day as Floyd. Mr Johnson was shot dead by state troopers after being found ""passed out in the driver's seat"" of a car which was partially blocking traffic, a police statement said. ""During the trooper's contact with the suspect, there was a struggle and the trooper fired his service weapon striking the suspect,"" police said. The statement was only released after Mr Johnson's family was offeredaudio of the police dispatch,externaland transportation department video of the incident. The Buffalo video shows a 75-year-old man approach police officers enforcing a curfew. They then move forward, pushing him back and causing him to fall over and hit his head. As he lies on the ground, blood is seen pouring from his ear. The man was taken away in an ambulance and was later found to have suffered a severe head injury. An initial statement from Buffalo Police Department said the man had ""tripped"" and fallen during a ""skirmish involving protesters"", compounding outrage at the incident on social media. Police spokesman Jeff Rinaldo later attributed the statement to officers not directly involved in the incident, adding that when the video had emerged the two policemen who pushed the demonstrator had been suspended without pay. In Indianapolis,the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department is investigating,externalafter a video was widely shared on social media showing officers beating a woman with batons and shooting her with pepper rounds, the Indianapolis Star newspaper reported.

On Thursday New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo defended police, saying they were not beating citizens ""for no reason"", and if they did ""it's wrong"". City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the authorities were ""doing everything from a perspective of restraint"". This video can not be played The USA's history of racial inequality has paved the way for modern day police brutality But both men have since condemned the incidents which emerged overnight. In a tweet,Mr Cuomo described the Buffalo incident as ""wholly unjustified and utterly disgraceful"",external. ""Police officers must enforce - NOT ABUSE - the law,"" he said. MeanwhileMayor de Blasio said he had complained to the city police department,externalafter seeing the video of the arrest of the delivery worker. The incidents happened as police enforced curfews in dozens of cities across the US after a wave of protests sparked by George Floyd's death. Floyd, 46, was stopped by police investigating the purchase of cigarettes with counterfeit money on 25 May in Minneapolis. This video can not be played 'I'm tired of being afraid': Why Americans are protesting A video showed him being arrested and a white police officer continuing to kneel on his neck for several minutes even after he pleaded that he could not breathe. Protests erupted and have continued since, across many US cities and also internationally, with rallies on Wednesday in Australia, France, the Netherlands andin the UK, where thousands gathered in central London. A rally in the Australian city of Sydney has been refused permission by a court, amid fears of coronavirus health risks. Thousands had been expected to attend. Floyd's death follows the high-profile cases of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; Eric Garner in New York; and others that have driven the Black Lives Matter movement in recent years. For many, the outrage over Floyd's death also reflects years of frustration over socio-economic inequality and discrimination. This video can not be played Rev Al Sharpton eulogy: 'Get your knee off our neck' Protests over the death continued in dozens of cities on Thursday despite widespread curfews. They followed a memorial service attended by hundreds, who stood in  silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the amount of time Floyd was alleged to have been on the ground under the control of police in Minneapolis. A lawyer for George Floyd told the service a ""pandemic of racism"" had led to his death. Giving the eulogy, civil rights activist the Reverend Al Sharpton said it was time to stand up and say ""get your knee off our necks"". 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support. An athlete, friend and father - who was George Floyd?

Job tips for 2020 graduates,"Scott Wilson-Laing's first job out of university was at a call centre. He now owns a distillery business Graduates face even tougher competition for jobs this summer because of the coronavirus pandemic. About 400,000 students finishing their degrees in 2020 have seen opportunities evaporate overnight. Twelve years ago, graduates faced similar anxiety when the global financial crisis threw much of the world into recession. Banks collapsed, businesses went under, and millions of people lost their jobs. But what can the Class of 2008 teach the Class of 2020? We asked three graduates from 2008 what advice they would give to their younger counterparts. Lindsay moved thousands of miles from Birmingham to Australia where she now works as an IT manager I think I'm one of the lucky ones from 2008. I studied law at Warwick University. I was finishing my legal practice course (LPC) when law firms started contacting people to defer their training contracts. My friends and I were all in the same boat. So when the phone rang, I already knew what they'd say. My training contract was deferred for two years, but luckily the firm offered me a job as a paralegal. The salary was about Â£6,000-a-year lower, but I was working in insolvency and litigation at the time so I was always busy. By the time I qualified in 2012, they were still making people redundant. There weren't any jobs in the area I wanted to go into, so I left my law firm and decided to see the world.  I ended up in Australia, where I've been working ever since, first in financial services and now in IT as a commercial manager. Lindsay Cash in 2008. She took a job as a paralegal when her training contract was deferred for two years People have challenged me about my longevity in a job. I've been asked: am I a flight risk? And I just say that my CV is a product of the financial crisis. I took roles that helped me to build skills that I would use in the future. I never sat waiting to be given something. And when you explain that, it resonates with people, especially the older generation. There's agreat speech by Steve Jobs,external(the co-founder of Apple) who said, ""You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backward."" When I look back I realise that things don't always work out. But you have to regroup and say: what do I need to do to move forward? Scott Wilson-Laing in 2008. He worked in many different jobs before setting up his own business I was 11 years old when I knew I wanted to become a pilot. I even thought about applying to the Royal Air Force straight after finishing A-levels. But my careers adviser told me a university degree would look better on the application form. I'd get paid more and be promoted more quickly. So I went to the University of Wales to study ancient history and archaeology. By the time I graduated in 2008, the opportunities were already drying up. The RAF recruitment office told me they weren't recruiting for certain roles like pilots. I couldn't even wait a year to apply again because I'd be too old. I was gutted. There weren't any graduate jobs left where I'm from in Sunderland. So I used a scattergun approach to apply for anything going. In the end I spent a year working at a call centre. After that, I worked at a lighthouse for six months and then a steel factory. For six years I worked my way up from the production line to sales and operations, before moving to an IT company. By then I'd spent a decade working for other people. I have a daughter who's 10 years old now. Little things like having to ask for a day's holiday just to see her school play made me rethink my career. So I used my experience to set up WL Distillery in County Durham last year. We crowdfunded our first batch of premium gin. Scott now makes hand sanitiser for local businesses during the lockdown And then the pandemic hit. The Chinese factory making some of our equipment was mothballed so we couldn't make gin. But we saw there was a massive hand sanitiser shortage, so we decided to use our ingredients to make small batches for the NHS, local schools and businesses. My advice to recent graduates is to stay as positive as you can and stop fixating on things that don't work out. I thought my life was mapped out: go to university, get a job, stay for life, and get a nice retirement package at the end with a watch. And that's not the world we live in anymore. So be open to opportunities that you may not have planned for. Working in a call centre was where I learned the right way to treat and talk to staff. It's amazing the skills you pick up in jobs that you don't even realise. Harriet now works for a digital consultancy I'm ashamed to say it now, but when I graduated in 2008 I thought people would throw opportunities at me. I knew there was a financial crisis going on, but I believed the market almost owed me a job. I had a history degree from Oxford University and was always a high achiever. I also lacked humility in a very big way. At the time I was gunning for graduate schemes at consumer goods giants like Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser. When I didn't get anywhere, I started applying to advertising agencies, and big retailers like Tesco. I think I filled in about 110 applications. I got about five interviews. Harriet Nicholson in 2008. She worked as a receptionist when she couldn't get on any graduate schemes After four months of trying and no job to show for it, I ended up moving back home to Southampton where I took a job as a medical receptionist. I felt embarrassed and had lost confidence. That job made me realise I wasn't as good as I thought I was. So many people I worked with could do my job better than me. After that I got an internship at Oxfam. This was instrumental because I made a lot of contacts and eventually did a masters degree in management. That got me on the career path I'm on now, which led to my current job at a digital consultancy. It's also where I met my husband! In retrospect, I held graduate schemes in really high esteem, which was actually a bit silly. For example, when I didn't succeed at Unilever, I simply gave up. I didn't think about looking for an entry-level job to get a foot in the door there. I'd say to recent graduates: don't be afraid to ask for help, and take advantage of the things you take for granted. Back in 2008, we were entering the job market as the early users of Facebook and Twitter, so we could educate companies on how to use those platforms. Businesses today are still trying to figure out TikTok, so don't underestimate the power of your digital knowledge. RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? SCHOOLS:When will children be returning?

Medical careers more popular,"Before his illness, Alex Brown sits patiently as hospital staff practise fitting a CPAP ventilator There has been a surge of interest in becoming a medic during this pandemic, despite the fact that those on the front line run a high risk of catching the virus. Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary writes about two colleagues who decided to become doctors later in life and were hit hard when they came down with Covid-19. This has been a time when the quiet men and women staffing the NHS and care homes have stepped out of the shadows and into the spotlight. They have served their country and cared for their communities, putting their lives at risk in the process. One million people answered the call to volunteer to help the NHS in this time of crisis. Thousandshave expressed interest in becoming a nurse,externaland many young people have contacted the Bradford Royal Infirmary to ask when our careers outreach sessions will resume. Becoming a doctor or a nurse or a health care worker has never seemed so important, and it doesn't matter how old you are or what you have been doing - it's rarely too late to follow your heart. Two of my colleagues, consultant geriatrician Prof Alex Brown and orthopaedic registrar Ken Linton came to medicine after careers in the military and banking - Alex served as an army captain in Northern Ireland and the Falklands, while Ken was a vice-president of Lehman Brothers investment bank until a few months before it collapsed in 2008. At 61 and 54 they were at higher risk than many of developing serious symptoms if they caught Covid-19, and sure enough they eventually become patients in their own hospital. Alex Brown in uniform: The comedy MASH drew him towards medicine For anyone who thinks that Covid is simply a flu-like illness I now point to Alex as an illustration of how it can bring a tough, stoical, ex-army man to his knees. Alex was aware of the risk he was taking, being older and male (and a bit overweight), but it didn't stop him. ""You've just got to get on and do what you've got to do,"" he says. He also knew that there was no rapid test that would enable us to instantly determine which patients had Covid-19 and which did not. So while we divided the hospital into a ""red"" infectious zone, and a ""green"" zone for non-Covid patients we were never going to get it 100% right. (I wrote 10 days agoabout Mark Winterbournewho tested positive after being admitted with what initially appeared to be gallstone problems.) And as Alex points out, ""The level of PPE that we wear is dependent upon what stocks are available."" When PPE was scarce, Alex Brown organised this delivery of masks Alex had only missed one day's work in his life, until he caught the virus. After testing positive, he then spent seven days in quarantine in his bedroom, but at this point instead of getting better, he got worse. During a walk in the garden he started shaking and sweating, and his temperature rose to 40C. Four days later his son, who had already recovered from Covid-19, drove him to A&E. Supplied with new medication Alex went home again, to be looked after by his wife, a GP. ""It was really hard, I haven't known anything like it. I've been in some of the toughest situations imaginable but nothing like this. You feel so vulnerable. I had terrible fevers and chills - for nights this went on, and my temperature was so high."" This hardened ex-soldier welled up as he told me this. ""I just couldn't really move - no energy and feeling so terrible. Even now, three weeks on, I can't really climb a flight of stairs without my pulse rate going up, and I want to work. I feel so bad being away from the wards, knowing I can't be there helping my colleagues."" Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio. Listen to the next episode of The NHS Front Lineon BBC Soundsorthe BBC World Service Or read the previous online diary entry:Why does Covid-19 make some healthy young people really sick? Check out all the diary entries on the BBC Radio 4 website Ken Linton did a PhD in engineering and computer science before going into banking, when he was headhunted by Lehman Brothers and transferred to Wall Street. He was making a fortune and had bought a 37ft boat and a small plane by the time things started to go wrong for the bank in early 2008, and his department was closed. A few months later the bank collapsed altogether and the economic crash began, but Ken came out of it largely unscathed. The New York Times described him in 2009 asliving ""a life of leisure"" and playing jazz trombone,external, though around this time he was also volunteering in New York hospitals. He contemplated becoming a chef, but instead - already in his mid-40s - he decided on medicine. As a lifelong asthmatic, Ken was worried when Covid-19 arrived in the UK this spring. Lots of his colleagues at Bradford Royal Infirmary were getting it, and he too eventually developed the symptoms on 8 May. ""I went to bed and I was too hot - and I was like really, really too hot. And then I woke up and was absolutely freezing. And then I started being sick,"" he says. ""I called up A&E and packed a bag for everything you need at hospital - a lot of people forget the essentials. The consultant took my vital signs and I was very short of breath. I had low potassium, and my oxygen saturation was terrible. So they got me up to the ward very quickly."" Soon he was on ""about 10 medications"" and oxygen. Ken Linton, already on the mend ""It's a horrendous disease because every day after that I had a new weird symptom. I hadcovid toes. My kidneys shut down on the Wednesday morning. I got a dermatological condition - the arteries that supply the skin get blocked. There's a new surprise every day. The day before I went home I got this viral rash on my wrist."" He was in hospital for 10 days. He's now been at home for a week, but like Alex Brown, he can only manage a flight of stairs with difficulty. And he too is desperate to get back to work - in his case, orthopaedic surgery. It would be natural for stories like this to make some people think twice about coming to work in a hospital, but the evidence suggests the opposite is happening. Alex, who is in charge of our trainee doctors and often runs weekend workshops for local comprehensive schools, thinks that the huge amount of exposure the NHS has received - not to mention the clapping for carers - will have ""opened up people's minds"" to the idea of medicine and nursing as a career. Ken, the former Lehman Brothers banker, points out that ""you can't take money with you when you die"" but that as a doctor ""you can make your mark - make a difference"". He has the evidence for it in letters from patients thanking him, and other hospital staff, for taking care of them when they needed it most.

"Coronavirus ban on evicting renters extendedNo-one will be evicted from their home this summer, Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick says.Business","Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick has announced a two-month extension to the government's ban on evicting renters amid the Covid-19 pandemic. New evictions in England and Wales of tenants in both social and privately-rented accommodation will be suspended until 23 August. ""No-one will be evicted from their home this summer due to coronavirus,"" Mr Jenrick tweeted. But housing charity Shelter said the announcement was ""only a stop-gap"". Allow Twitter content?

The extension will run from 25 June, the end of the the three-month period originally announcedas part of emergency coronavirus legislation in March. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said it would benefit ""millions of renters"". Government support for renters during the pandemic was ""unprecedented"", Mr Jenrick said. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""The government has reset the clock on the evictions ban, buying the families who were only weeks away from losing their homes a vital stay of execution. But she said: ""The ban hasn't stopped people who've lost their jobs during this pandemic from racking up rent arrears. Even if they have a plan to pay them back, these debts will throw struggling renters straight back into the firing line of an automatic eviction as soon as the ban does lift.â¯â¯ ""It's critical that Robert Jenrick uses this extension wisely to change the law and properly protect renters,"" she added. Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""Simply extending the pause of repossession is a sticking plaster not a cure. People who have fallen behind on rent arrears and those who have been furloughed or lost their jobs will need the security of proper reform to the rules governing evictions. ""We look forward to working with the government in the coming weeks on changes to make sure they keep their promise, that no renter should lose their home because of coronavirus."" Renters struggle most with pandemic costs, report says Lockdown break-ups and job changes boost rentals Recent research by the District Councils Networksuggests more than 486,242 households are spending more than half of their income on private rented housing, which could be at risk when the evictions ban is lifted. The network, which represents 187 local authorities in England, says single parents with children, young people and households on low incomes are particularly in danger of being tipped ""over the edge"" into homelessness. It called for a permanent boost to housing benefits for those in private rented homes and more funding for councils to fight homelessness, build homes and create jobs. The MHCLG said it was working on new rules ""to ensure vulnerable renters can be protected appropriately"" when the halt on evictions ended. But the National Residential Landlords Association called for the government ""to set out its plans for the market at the end of this one-time extension."" Chief executive Ben Beadle said: ""A failure to do so will cause serious damage to the private rented sector as a whole."" He added: ""It will ultimately be tenants who suffer as they will find it increasingly difficult to find affordable housing if landlords do not have the confidence that they will get their properties back swiftly in legitimate circumstances.""

Victoria's Secret UK arm goes into administrationThe lingerie retailer had already furloughed 785 of its employees in the UK amid the pandemic.Business,"Victoria's Secret fashion shows were cancelled in 2019 as they were branded as ""sexist"" and ""dated"" The UK arm of Victoria's Secret has fallen into administration, putting more than 800 jobs at risk. The chain, famous for its fashion shows, has 25 shops in the UK, all of which have been shut since the virus lockdown started in March. Administrator Deloitte said there would be no immediate redundancies as it tries to find a buyer for the chain. Rob Harding of Deloitte said it was ""yet another blow to the UK High Street"" amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But the chain had already been hit by changing consumer tastes and weakened spending. The UK arm made an operating loss of Â£170m in the year to February 2019,according to the most recent filings available.,external Last year, its annual fashion show was cancelled, withthe company blaming poor television ratings. The show launched in 1995 and was once a major pop culture event, drawing millions of viewers each year to watch its so-called ""angels"". In 2018 it saw its lowest ratings ever, drawing criticism that it was sexist, outdated and lacked diversity. The brand's parent company L Brands said it was important to ""evolve"" its marketing strategy at the time. The annual Victoria's Secret fashion show launched the careers of several supermodels The firm had already furloughed 785 workers in the UK before appointing administrators. Deloitte described the administration as ""light touch"", meaning the management are allowed to keep running the business. It will now attempt to find another buyer for its assets, or re-negotiate rents on its High Street stores in a bid to improve the firm's financial situation. All its UK shops will remain shut,  but none will, for the moment, be closed permanently. The administration process also excludes its online business, which will continue trading. Mr Harding added that this was a ""further example of the impact the Covid-19 pandemic is having on the entire retail industry."" ""The effect of the lockdowns, combined with broader challenges facing bricks and mortar retailers, has resulted in a funding requirement for this business, resulting in today's administration."" Several other High Street brands have been struggling in recent weeks due to lockdown measures introduced in March to stop the spread of the virus. Both fashion firms Cath KidstonandLaura Ashley, for example, have called in administrators since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. However, Victoria's Secret has arguably been eclipsed in recent years by brands such as Savage X Fenty, the lingerie line by singer, actress and businesswoman Rihanna, whose events showcase a range of body types. There was also a furious response to an interview in Vogue with then chief marketing officer Ed Razek. He suggested ""transsexual"" people should not be a part of the fashion show. He later left the company. Qing Wang, professor of marketing at Warwick Business School, said: ""If the UK arm of Victoria's Secret is to be saved, it needs a new start and a major overhaul of its brand and marketing strategy. ""It needs to be brought up to date to reflect the values of gender equality, sustainability, and diversity that appeal to today's shoppers and compete with the brands that have overtaken it. ""It has not kept pace with the strong values of millennials and post-millennials, who should now be the company's target customers,"" she added.

BA threatens legal action over quarantine plans,"Airlines across the world grounded aircraft after passenger numbers collapsed British Airways owner IAG is considering mounting a legal challenge to quarantine rules which are due to come into effect on Monday. The dramatic move marks another sign of a breakdown in relations between the airline and the UK government. IAG boss Willie Walsh told Sky News that airlines had not been consulted on the 14-day quarantine period for people arriving in the UK. He said he expected other airlines to also mount legal challenges. ""We think it's irrational, we think it's disproportionate and we are giving consideration to a legal challenge to this legislation, so we're reviewing that with the lawyers later on today,"" Mr Walsh told Sky News. ""I suspect there are other airlines who are doing so, because it's important to point out there was no consultation with the industry prior to enacting this legislation and we do believe it is an irrational piece of legislation."" BA refuses to meet Home Secretary over quarantine plans Coronavirus: What are the UK travel quarantine rules? Airlines and holiday firms have been arguing against a two-week quarantine period for anyone arriving in the UK that will be enforced from 8 June. Travellers to the UK will be required to isolate for 14 days or face a Â£1,000 fine. The government has said thatthe period is neededto ""keep the transmission rate down and prevent a devastating second wave'' of coronavirus. However, industry body Airlines UKhas said quarantine""would effectively kill off air travel"". The plans have caused friction between the government and British Airways. On Thursday the airlinerefused to attend a meeting with Home Secretary Priti Patelto discuss the quarantine rules. British Airways is under huge financial strain due to the pandemic, and has said it iscurrently burning through its cash reserves at a rate of around Â£1m per hour. Mr Walsh told Sky News that the Bank of England has loaned it Â£300m, which is the ""maximum amount"" available to it. ""We have done everything that is within our power to boost the cash balance of British Airways. We're exhausting every single opportunity we can,"" he said. BA has faced heavy criticism from some MPs over a plan to slash jobs while accessing the government's furlough scheme. The airline has been under fire for plans to cut 12,000 jobs and weaken terms and conditions for its remaining staff. It announced the redundancies just weeks after putting 30,000 workers on the job retention scheme which pays workers' wages. Home Secretary Priti Patel insists quarantine will help stop the virus' spread On Monday, a group of 200 travel companies wrote to Home Secretary Priti Patel asking for the plans to be scrapped. The letter said travel could be possible for people - without quarantine - between destinations ""deemed safe from coronavirus"". The so-called ""air bridges"" would allow visitors from countries where coronavirus infection rates are low into the UK, without having to self-isolate. It is understood that the government is working on a list of countries it is hoping to secure air bridge agreements with, which include all major European tourist destinations such as Portugal, Spain and France as well as Australia and Singapore. However, the government's official position is that the idea is ""under consideration"", and not established policy.

"BBC executive Davie named new director generalTim Davie, a former head of BBC Radio and BBC Studios, is to take over from Tony Hall.Entertainment & Arts","Davie is to become the 17th director general in the corporation's 98-year history Tim Davie, one of the BBC's most senior executives, has been named the broadcaster's new director general. Davie has been promoted from chief executive of BBC Studios, the commercial subsidiary that makes programmes and also sells them abroad. He became acting director general after the resignation of George Entwistle in 2012, and will now replace Tony Hall. His top priorities will include negotiating with the government about the future of the licence fee. The TV licence system will stay in place until at least 2027, but the government is due to review the funding level from 2022 onwards. In a statement, Davie said he was ""honoured"" to get the BBC's top job. ""This has been a critical time for the UK and these past few months have shown just how much the BBC matters to people,"" he said. ""Our mission has never been more relevant, important or necessary. I have a deep commitment to content of the highest quality and impartiality. ""Looking forward, we will need to accelerate change so that we serve all our audiences in this fast-moving world. ""Much great work has been done, but we will continue to reform, make clear choices and stay relevant. I am very confident we can do this because of the amazing teams of people that work at the BBC."" The BBC is yet to announce whether and how Strictly Come Dancing will go ahead this year Lord Hall described Davie as ""a fantastic leader"", adding: ""I wish him every success for the future. I know that the BBC is in safe hands."" Davie will be paid Â£525,000 a year - Â£75,000 more than Lord Hall, but Â£75,000 less than he was getting as head of BBC Studios. The BBC said the director general's salary had not increased since 2012, and this is the level that it would have reached had inflation been applied. It added Davie has ""agreed to take a salary stand-still"" and be paid Â£450,000 until August 2021, as ""all senior managers at the BBC are currently on a salary freeze"". One of Davie's other pressing tasks will be to help work out how to makethe Â£125m savings Lord Hall has said the BBC needs to find this year. BBC Three, featuring shows like Stacey Dooley's Glow Up, could return as a regular TV channel BBC chairman Sir David Clementi said ""the organisation faces significant challenges as well as opportunities"". He added: ""I am confident that Tim is the right person to lead the BBC as it continues to reform and change."" At BBC Studios, Davie has overseen the production of programmes like Blue Planet II, Doctor Who, Strictly Come Dancing and EastEnders for the BBC, as well as the sale of shows to more than 200 countries. Its revenues of Â£243m were ploughed back into the BBC in 2018/19. That commercial experience is likely to be called upon when he starts his new post in September. For example, Lord Hall recently raised the idea of turning BBC Four into a global subscription channel. The question ofwhether to bring back BBC Three as a regular TV channelis also up in the air. Tim Davie has landed one of the most privileged jobs in Britain and the global media, leading thousands of creative people at a remarkable moment in history. Aside from that, it's hell. The challenges are enormous - and those are just the ones we already know about. Tony Hall had the toughest job of any director general in BBC history. Davie will have an even tougher time. Those challenges include, in no particular order: A political negotiation over the future licence fee with a government that recently made several threats to the corporation A re-evaluation of the commercial model of the BBC, so that it can compete in a hyper-inflationary modern media landscape The irreversible flight of younger audiences to other platforms Maintaining outstanding programming, trust among a global audience, and standards of impartiality at a time when social media makes that infinitely harder Creating a BBC that truly represents Britain And that's just the inbox. Most DGs' legacies are defined by how they handle unforeseen crises, like famous presenters making prank calls, or the revelation that many women are being paid less than men for doing the same work, which is illegal. It is, obviously, an extraordinary opportunity, which has the considerable consolation that whatever comes after will be easier (and probably better paid). The BBC has many critics, but most people will wish Davie luck. He will need it.

coverage today - thank you for joining us. Hereâs a roundup of Friday's biggest coronavirus stories: Today's live page was brought to you by teams in Singapore, Sydney, Delhi and across the UK. They are: Owen Amos, Frances Mao, Saira Asher, Yvette Tan, Aparna Alluri, Andreas Illmer, Rebecca Seales, Sean Fanning, Ashitha Nagesh, Robert Corp, Ella Wills, Emma Harrison, Gavin Stamp, Lucy Webster, Matt Cannon, Kevin Ponniah, Vicky Baker, Victoria Bisset, Matthew Henry, Saj Chowdhury and Steven Sutcliffe The World Health Organization has changed its advice on
mask-wearing. It previously recommended that only health workers, people
with coronavirus and their caregivers should wear medical masks. So whatâs changed? The WHO says the revised recommendations are based on new research and that there is increasing evidence that coronavirus can be spread by people
before they have symptoms. It had previously said this was not known to be a significant cause for the spread of the disease. A mask on a mannequin in Germany, where many states made wearing them compulsory at the end of April Thousands of people took part in Tuesday's demonstration in Paris French police have banned protests that were due to place in front of the US Embassy on Saturday, citing coronavirus measures. Demonstrations have been taking place in the US and across the world since an unarmed African-American, George Floyd, died after a police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis. On Tuesday, 20,000 people joined a rally in Paris in memory of Adama Traore, a French black man who died in similar circumstances to Floyd in 2016. Campaigners have called for a new protest near the Eiffel Tower on Saturday instead. Meanwhile, Black Lives Matter protesters in Australia have said they will go ahead with plans to hold a demonstration in Sydney on Saturday,despite a court banning the gathering because of coronavirus. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News In the UK, healthcare staff caring for patients with Covid-19 already
wear surgical face masks, as well as other personal protective equipment
including gloves and aprons. Now all staff working in hospitals in England will be
expected to wear surgical masks â to reduce infections there, we are told, as
cases come down. Patients and visitors (who are permitted to enter) will have
to cover their faces too. Suddenly, face masks or coverings are becoming a feature of
many peopleâs daily lives â whether at work or on public transport or in shops,
where social distancing is a challenge. The change in advice is linked to research showing possible
transmission from infected people by coughing, talking and breathing. The guidance will come into force on 15 June, as more
businesses open up and more pupils return to school. But face coverings are still only one way of stopping the
spread of the virus. Regular hand washing and cleaning of surfaces is just as
important. While many people have turned to yoga as a form of exercise and stress relief during the pandemic, not everyone is as welcoming. The Greek Orthodox Church now says that the practice is ""absolutely incompatible"" with Christian faithand has no place ""in the life of Christians"". Greek media had been advising yoga for people stuck under quarantine. Online yoga classes become popular around the world as countries imposed lockdowns A new NHS app is being rolled out to help thousands of people who are most at risk from coronavirus to keep away from hospitals. It will allow cystic fibrosis patients to share information about their condition with their doctor, with the help of a bluetooth-enabled spirometer which measures lung capacity. A separate trial will give some who have both the condition and coronavirus devices which can help spot potentially dangerous dips in their blood oxygen levels. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: ""For patients and their families living with cystic fibrosis this is a landmark moment, offering people vital health help at home."" The devices should be rolled out to all 4,000 cystic fibrosis patients in England later this year, the NHS said. A Conservative MP in the UK has apologised after admitting he failed to
follow lockdown guidance by attending a barbecue. According to the Guardian newspaper, Isle
of Wight MP Bob Seely,went to an evening gathering at a journalist's home in Seaview on 22 May.,external Seely said he and his girlfriend met the man for a work-related
discussion and ate ""half a sausage"", but did not enter the house or
have a drink. At the time people could only meet one other person from another
household at a distance in a public place. Seely, who is leading efforts to promote the trial of theCovid-19 contact-tracing appon the island, said the
journalist wanted to discuss the project with him. In a statement,external, the MP said: ""When I arrived, I saw
another couple of people there, which I was not expecting. I thought about
leaving, but felt that was perhaps over-reacting. ""I apologise because, on balance, I called this wrong. It
would have better to have spoken to this person without any others nearby."" Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva In March, just as fresh snow had fallen across the alps, Switzerlandâs ski season came to an abrupt halt. Alpine hotels emptied overnight, cable cars and mountain railways stopped. No-one, not even the Swiss themselves, could enjoy a day on the slopes. The financial consequences for the alpine communities are huge, but now the resorts are opening again. The Swiss government's advice on maintaining a two-metre distance is still in place, so the mountain railways have a safety concept: staff and passengers should wear masks. The snow has long since melted, but the alpine resorts hope their offer of natural beauty and a clean environment may be just what European tourists want after three months of stress under lockdown. The Universal Studios theme park in Orlando, Florida, has opened its doors to visitors for the first time in almost three months. New safety guidelines have been put in place,external, including temperature checks before entry, mandatory face coverings and spacing between visitors on rides. The park was closed in mid-March due to the spread of coronavirus. It's not the first major theme park to begin reopening its doors: Shanghai Disneyland began operating again on 11 May, and Walt Disney World Resort in Florida will start a phased reopening of its attractions from 11 July. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The UK';s coronavirus death toll officially passed 40,000 today. International comparisons are difficult - the way coronavirus fatalities are recorded differs from country to country. In fact, there are actually two ways to measure it in the UK. The 40,000 figure refers to deaths following a positive test. If you look at death certificate mentions, which rely on the judgement of doctors, the UK was actually close to 50,000 deaths by the end of May. The UK has certainly been among the worst-affected countries. However, a number of our near neighbours - in particular Spain and Italy - have seen similar rates of fatalities if you look at deaths per head of population. The UK is certainly not an outlier. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Chinaâs culture and tourism ministry has issued a warning to people not to travel to Australia, which has raised a lot of eyebrows in China. âDue to the coronavirus epidemic, racial discrimination against Chinese and Asian people in Australia has increased significantly,âthe notice reads.,external It comes amid sharp tensions between China and Australia over the latter's calls for an inquiry into the origins of the virus. The announcement got thousands in China on Fridayusing the hashtag #DontGoToAustralia,external. But given that Australia has closed its borders to everyone except Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members, many are ridiculing the governmentâs message. Some tell the âmotherlandâ to ârest assuredâ that they will do their civic duty. âAustralia has long denied foreign entry,â one user says. âHow do I get there? Which Chinese citizens can enter Australia?â âItâs hard enough to get out of bed,â another says. A primary school in the Canadian province of Quebec became the site of an outbreak after one child
caught Covid-19, health officials say. Out
of a class of 11, nine children have since tested positive,external. The class was
small because the school has been operating at half capacity. Health officials confirm the school had taken preventative measures, such as
handwashing reminders and marking spaces
on the floor to encourage social distancing. Elementary schools opened across Quebec outside the city of Montreal on 11
May, despite the province being Canada's biggest coronavirus hotspot, with
52,398 total cases and 4,935 deaths currently recorded. Across the country, different provinces are reopening at different rates. On 1
June,British
Columbia opened all schools,externalon an optional, part-time basis. Ontario, the site of Canada's second-largest hotspot, has closed schools for
the remainder of the school year. But Premier Doug Ford announcedthe province would proceed to phase two,externalof reopening the economy, despite a slight rise
in the number of cases. Renowned theatre director Sam Mendes has suggested how British theatre can be saved from collapse. Writingin the Financial Times,external, he says live performances are in ""grave danger"" - but adds that the industry needs ""investment, not charity"". He then suggests that in the short term the government continues its job-retention scheme, while in the longer term,  theatres should benefit from tax relief schemes to help keep them afloat, as revenues plummet due to social distancing requirements. ""The performing arts need to be saved now,"" he writes. ""Not next week, or next month. If they die, an ecosystem this intricate and evolved cannot be rebuilt from scratch."" David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News The WHO specified that it was recommending cloth face coverings for most of the public This is a big shift in the WHOâs guidance on when the public
should cover their faces. For months, the organisationâs experts stuck to the line
that masks would encourage a false sense of security and would deprive medical
professionals of badly needed protective equipment. Those arguments have not gone away but at the same time the
WHO acknowledges that new evidence has emerged on the risks of transmission. It points to recent research that people can be highly
infectious in the few days before they show symptoms and that some people catch
the virus but never show symptoms at all, as I reportedlast weekend. So where distancing isnât possible, such as on public
transport and in locations as varied as shops and refugee camps, itâs suggested
that faces are covered with homemade masks to avoid passing on the infection. Over 60s with underlying health conditions
should go further, the WHO said, and wear medical-grade masks to give themselves
better protection. Just how do you stop large gatherings of people when the sun is shining and people fancy a trip to the seaside? Well, on the Dorset coast in the UK, pre-booked parking spaces, fines for illegal parking and beach marshals are all going to be introduced in order to prevent a repeat of last weekend's influx of visitors. Thousands have flocked to the Jurassic Coast and Bournemouth beaches since lockdown restrictions were eased. Current government guidelines state that households can drive any distance in England to parks and beaches. Three people were badly hurtjumping from the limestone arch at Durdle Door, while ahorrendous amount of litterwas also another unwelcome byproduct of the Jurassic Coast Unesco World Heritage site receiving a large number of visitors last week. Beach-goers had to abandon social distancing when rescue helicopters landed on Durdle Door Beach to pick up injured divers The latest figures from Italy show the daily death figures staying broadly flat - 85 on Friday, 88 the day before, according to the Civil Protection Agency. However, the number of new confirmed coronavirus cases jumped from 177 on Thursday to 518 on Friday, with 402 recorded in the northern region of Lombardy - the hardest-hit part of Italy in terms of deaths and cases. The total number of cases in Italy has now increased to 234,531, the sixth
highest tally behind those of the United States, Russia,
Spain, Britain and Brazil. The death toll now stands at 33,774. England and Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sanchohas been fined by the German football league (DFL) after breaching rules to restrict the spread of the coronavirus, while getting a haircut at home. The 20-year-old - who has been repeatedly linked with a
Â£100m transfer to Englandâs Premier League - and his Swiss team-mate Manuel
Akanji, were fined after a photo on social media showed neither the
players nor their hairdresser wearing personal protective equipment. A statement from the DFL read: ""The DFL
has fined Manuel Akanji and Jadon Sancho. ""The players from Borussia Dortmund had obviously
violated general hygiene and infection protection standards at home hairdressing
appointments."" Sancho, was one of a number ofBundesliga playersto make anti-racism statements during matches last weekend in response to the death of unarmed black man George Floyd at the hands of US police. We've already reported that from 15 June, people in England will be required to wear face coverings on public transport. There's a bit of controversy, because the British Medical Association (which represents doctors in the UK) says the rule should be extended so it's compulsory to wear masks in all public places where social distancing isn't possible. That is the new guidance from the World Health Organization, which has changed its stance on fabric face masks. But what are the rules right now in other countries? In theUS, legislation around masks is decided on a state-level - or even at a county-level in some cases.New Yorkstate, for example, requires people to wear masks in any public place where social distancing isn't possible. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends everyone wear masks when out in public. Things are a bit more straightforward inGermany, where mask-wearing has been mandatory on public transport and while shopping since 22 April. Francebrought in a rule on May 10, making face masks compulsory while out in public, ahead of the start of their lockdown easing a day later. And inIreland, while people are advised to wear masks while out in public, it isn't actually mandatory. Meanwhile, wearing masks in crowded places was far from uncommon in parts of Asia even before the coronavirus pandemic struck, especially if people were ill. This video can not be played Abbey Road Studios re-opens after 10 weeks of closure Music can be heard inside one of the world's most famous recording studios. Abbey Road Studios in London was forced to close as the UK entered lockdown 10 weeks ago but has now reopened - with musicians keeping 2m apart. The centre is intrinsically linked with The Beatles, who used it to record hits including Come Together and Here Comes The Sun. Our arts editor Will Gompertz went to listen to the first recording session since it reopened. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent As the UK passes the milestone of more than 40,000
deaths, questions will inevitably be asked. How did we get here? What more
could have been done? What mistakes were made? Health Secretary Matt Hancockâs response to the
total number of deaths today was to say that it redoubled his determination to tackle the
virus. That adds to the sense that ministers want the focus to be on addressing
the situation as it is now rather than get drawn into an extensive examination
of how itâs handled the outbreak so far. But the government will know that
eventually the calls for a public inquiry will almost certainly increase. Not
just for the purposes of accountability â important though that may be â but
also to ensure that, should any pandemic emerge again, the country
will be better prepared. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

"An athlete, friend and father - who was George Floyd?","Floyd's face on a mural in Berlin, Germany Before the image of George Floyd lying under the knee of a policeman set off shock, anger and protests across the US, the arch of his life crossed crests and troughs. There were highs, as when he, as a teenager in Houston, played American football for the 1992 Texas state champion runners-up Yates High School Lions. There were lows, as when he was arrested for robbery in 2007 and served five years in prison. But mostly, it would seem that Floyd, who was 46 when he died in Minneapolis on 25 May, 2020, was simply trying to live life as any other American, in search of betterment in the face of both personal and societal challenges. His death amid a public health crisis and economic calamity that has killed more than 100,000 Americans and left over 40 million unemployed has become the latest totem of the ills that plague the country in 2020. The last 30 minutes of George Floyd's life In pictures: Protests turn violent A native of Houston, Texas, Floyd grew up in the neighbourhood at the heart of the city's black community, the Third Ward, just to the south of the city centre. BeyoncÃ© grew up there, as did Bayou City's blues music scene. Drake, a Canadian rapper, paid homage to its musical vibrancy, and Floyd himself is thought to have'spit bars',externalas part of the hip-hop group in the 1990s in Houston. But poverty, racial division and economic inequalities mark its history, too, as with any American city. Marred by segregation in the 20th Century, the Third Ward Floyd left in recent years has seen gang violence and tensions over housing. ""Anytime I take somebody who's not from there, people actually are like 'man, oh my God, I've never seen poverty like this. ""It looks like a bomb went off, what happened?'"" Ronnie Lillard, a friend from the neighbourhood tells the BBC. ""People are still living in shot-gun shacks that were erected in the 1920s. The poverty is thorough... and being from that area, it's hard to escape,"" says Mr Lillard, a rapper who performs under the name Reconcile. Floyd was well known in the council estate housing project, Cuney Homes, he adds. ""Cuney Homes is known as 'The Bricks' and if you're from there they call you 'a brickboy'. He was a brickboy."" Growing up a gifted athlete standing at six feet six inches, friends who knew Floyd as a teenager described him as a ""gentle giant"" who shone on the field in two sports, basketball as well as American football. ""I was blown away, cause at 12 years old he was six-foot-two,"" Jonathan Veal, a childhood friend and former teammate, told local media. ""I had never seen anyone that tall before"". At John Yates High School, he wore number 88 in the tight end position for the football team, and was later recruited to play basketball at South Florida State College in Avon Park, Florida, where he was a student from 1993 to 1995, according to CNN. He returned to Texas for a school year at Texas A&M University, Kingsville, but did not complete his degree. Why do some protests turn violent? Why has a US city gone up in flames? His life then took a different turn, with a string of arrests for theft and drug possession culminating in an armed robbery charge in 2007, for which he was sentenced to five years in prison. He became involved in his local ministry, Resurrection Houston, after his release and was intent on making changes in himself and his neighbourhood, says Mr Lillard. ""While he was embracing his own life change, he was looking around at his community."" This video can not be played Minneapolis voices: âAs a black American I am terrifiedâ A video of Floyd decrying gun violence, believed to be filmed in 2017, has circulated on social media, in which he implored young people to ""come home"". His family told the Houston Chronicle he moved to Minnesota in 2018 after being encouraged by friends through a Christian work programme. Christopher Harris, a friend and former classmate, told US media Mr Floyd ""was looking to start over fresh, a new beginning"". ""He was happy with the change he was making,"" he added. The former athlete found work as a security guard at a local Salvation Army charity, and then took on jobs as a lorry driver and dance club bouncer at Conga Latin Bistro, where he was known as ""Big Floyd."" Like many Americans, however, he found himself laid off amid mass business closures resulting from the Covid-19 crisis. On the day of his arrest, he was said to have been attempting to buy cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. This video can not be played Eric Garner death inspires an unlikely police experiment Anger over Mr Floyd's death has spurred protests across the US, with some descending into chaos and violence. Over 1,600 people have been arrested in nearly two dozen cities, and the National Guard deployed in 15 states. Mr Lillard, who described his friend as a ""person of peace"", would have supported people's rights to be heard and for change, but would not have condoned the looting or the violence. ""He had a heart bent towards forgiveness, but he also was a man of the people, too,"" he said. ""Even before his death, he was aware that people were hurting."" ""I think this thing has grown into something more than George Floyd,"" he added, speaking of the protests. ""I think you're watching frustration that America has with America [itself]."" 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support.

US must confront its Original Sin to move forward,"Following the death of George Floyd while under arrest, protests have consumed America and onlookers have wondered how one of the most powerful countries in the world could descend into such chaos. Despite being defined by race, American society does not spend much time analysing the history of our racial divisions, and America prefers to believe in the inevitable progression towards racial equality. The election of Barack Obama in 2008 fed into this narrative of progress, but Donald Trump's presidential victory in 2016 was seen as a step backwards, coming after a campaign with a slogan that championed America's divisive past as a form of progress. Floyd's death now appears to be the tipping point for an exhausted, racially divided nation still in the throes of the coronavirus pandemic and the economic cost that followed. **WARNING: This article contains a racial slur** Floyd's cries of ""I can't breathe"" echoed the cries of Eric Garner, who was choked by police on a New York City sidewalk in 2014. Floyd's words reminded Americans of the oppressive past we work to forget regardless of whether it is six years ago, 60 years ago, the 1860s, or 1619 when some of the first slaves arrived in America. To a large extent, America's neglect of the past and belief in progress have left many Americans unaware of the severity and scope of our racial tensions, and as a result many Americans lack the words to articulate our current turmoil. Recently, I have used the word ethnocide meaning ""the destruction of culture while keeping the people"" to describe America's past and present racial tensions, and this language also helps articulate the uniqueness of America's race problem. 'I lost my best friend in a police shooting' Timeline of US police killings Three facts that help explain anger in the US In 1941, Raphael Lemkin, a Polish Jew and distinguished lawyer, immigrated to the United States as he fled the Nazis. While in America he implored the American government to stop the Nazis from killing his people, and as his words fell on deaf ears, he realized he needed to create a new word to describe the unique horror befalling his people. In 1944, Lemkin coined the words genocide and ethnocide. Lemkin intended for the words to be interchangeable but over time they diverged. Genocide became the destruction of a people and their culture, and this word radically changed the world for the better. Ethnocide became the destruction of culture while keeping the people, and has been ignored for decades. Recently, ethnocide has been used to describe the plight of indigenous people against colonisation, but regarding America, ethnocide also pertains to the transatlantic slave trade and the founding of the nation. From the beginning of the transatlantic slave trade, European colonisers destroyed the culture of African people, but kept their bodies in order to create the chattel slavery system that became the economic and social foundation of the United States. Colonisers prevented Africans from speaking their languages and practising their religions. Tribal and familial bonds were broken, and African people could no longer identify as Igbo, Yoruba, and Malian. Instead de-cultured names such as nigger, negro, coloured, and black were stamped upon African people. Additionally, Europeans identified themselves as white, and in the United States the one-drop rule was created to sustain that division. One drop of black or African blood meant that a person could not be white. In America, whiteness became a zero-sum identity that was maintained by systemic racial division. Interracial marriage was still illegal in much of America until the Loving vs Virginia decision in 1967. Behind the legacy of America's blackface Viewpoint: A 'true horror' story for black Americans Viewpoint: Why racial incidents are part of America Beyonceâs Homecoming salutes black culture From colonisation to the formation of the United States, America has created countless laws and policies to sustain the racial division between blacks and whites forged by ethnocide. These American norms, extending to housing, education, employment, healthcare, law enforcement and environmental protections including clean drinking water, have disproportionately harmed African Americans and other communities of colour in order to sustain racial division and white dominance. George Floyd's murder represents a continuation of the systemic criminalisation and oppression of black life in America that has always been the American norm dating back to Jim Crow, segregation (which means apartheid), and slavery. When the Confederacy, the collection of American slave-holding states in the South, seceded from the United States, they launched the Civil War to defend the immoral institution of slavery. After losing the Civil War, these states were readmitted back into the United States. To this day, many Americans, and especially America hate groups, still celebrate Confederate soldiers and politicians as heroes, and there are monuments and memorials dedicated to them across America. Despite the American South losing the Civil War in 1865, American President Andrew Johnson pardoned Confederate soldiers, and soon thereafter Confederate politicians won elected office in the newly-reunited America. The influence of former slave owners and Confederates contributed to erasing the rights that African Americans won in the 1860s including citizenship and the right to vote. The political campaign to remove African American rights was called the Redeemers movement, and it was led by former slave-owners and Confederates, who wanted to redeem the South by returning it to the norms of chattel slavery. The Redeemers and ""Make America Great Again"" derive from America's oppressive, ethnocidal school of thought. The Redeemers were also assisted by American terrorist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) that were made up of former Confederate soldiers. The KKK, and many other white supremacist groups, terrorised and lynched black Americans, and they also prevented them from voting to help ensure that Redeemer candidates won elected office. The terrorists became the government. Protesters attacked by police dogs during demonstrations against segregation in Alabama in 1963 By the start of the 20th Century, the Redeemers had succeeded in undoing the racial equality progress of the post-Civil War Reconstruction era, and now Jim Crow segregation became the norm of the American South. The Supreme Court's decision in Plessy vs Ferguson made ""separate but equal"" the new law of the land, and America again became a legal apartheid state. According to the Equal Justice Initiative's 2017 report Lynching in America,external, over 4,400 lynchings of African Americans occurred from 1877-1950. That is more than a lynching a week for 74 years. During Jim Crow, America could not legally deny black people their humanity, but they could deny them the services that are afforded to human beings. Black people were denied education, housing, employment, and were expected to ""know their place"" as a perpetually subjugated people. Large prisons were erected on former plantations; black people were arrested for minor crimes and given long prison sentences doing manual labour on the same land their ancestors were forced to work as enslaved people. As a result of Jim Crow, millions of African Americans fled the neo-slavery and terror of the South during the Great Migration, and racial tensions spread as other American cities did not welcome these domestic refugees. This is the same journey as the Underground Railroad, where prior to the Civil War enslaved African Americans escaped the South and sought refuge in Canada and the Northern parts of America. The civil rights movement of the 1960s effectively ended Jim Crow, and African Americans began reclaiming the rights, specifically voting rights and freedom of movement, they had previously won in the 1860s, but it is a long road to dismantle systemic and legalised racism and segregation. Obama's election in 2008 was a monumental event in American society, but it did not magically erase the systemic racism woven into America's social fabric and the 2012 killing of Trayvon Martin, 17, helped launch the Black Lives Matter movement to national attention. Trayvon was shot and killed by George Zimmerman as he walked home in his own neighbourhood because Zimmerman thought he looked suspicious. Martin was unarmed. Zimmerman pled self-defence and a jury found him not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter. Trayvon was one of countless African Americans killed by America's ethnocidal society that sanctions terror from both the government and civilians. The unjust killing of black people by the police and racist vigilantes remained the norm during Obama's presidency, but now the black community could record and document these crimes on video, and had a president who would defend them. Obama famously said: ""If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon."" The emergence of the Black Lives Matter movement and other protests under Obama occurred because black Americans were confident that the White House would listen to their cries of ""I can't breathe"" and make American society finally equitable and just. Under Trump those cries have fallen on deaf ears and tensions have escalated. America has much work to do to fix our racial tensions because our divisions and inequality are forged in our ethnocidal roots. We need to reform the policing of a nation nearly the size of a continent with over 300 million people, but we also need to make our education, healthcare, and housing systems, and every facet of our democracy more equitable. Additionally, truth and reconciliation commissions, a national apology, reparations, holding evildoers accountable, and other processes nations have used to heal after a genocide, the linguistic sibling of ethnocide, will help America change course and forge equality and justice. Should black Americans get slavery reparations? Should the term 'racist' be redefined? The awkward questions about slavery from US tourists Also, America has rarely criminalised white supremacist hate and terror and instead has spent centuries normalising white terrorist groups, celebrating them as heroes, and letting them decide if their actions are evil or not. This is why the Confederacy is still celebrated today. Europe did not allow fascists and Nazis to determine if their actions were good or not, but America has always given this luxury to racist slave-owners and their generational apologists and offspring. This must change. Rwanda, Germany, and South Africa have reckoned with their troubled past to make a better future, but America has long preferred to ignore the past, and proclaim the inevitability of progress. America today must define and confront the Original Sin of slavery, ethnocide, and the cultural destruction it has inflicted upon all Americans, past and present. Otherwise we will fail to make a better future, and will continue our regression. Barrett is a writer, journalist and filmmaker focusing on race, culture and politics Her ancestors enslaved mine.

"Brexit: UK backtracking on commitments, says Barnier","This video can not be played Brexit: Barnier on UK approach to EU trade talks A trade deal with the EU based on the UK's ""very reasonable"" demands is still possible, cabinet minister Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary was speaking after the two sides admitted little progress had been made in the latest round. He said he ""very much"" hoped a no-deal outcome to the talks could be avoided if the two sides worked together. He was speaking after EU negotiator Michel Barnier accused the UK of ""backtracking"" on its commitments. The French official said differences remain in four key areas - fisheries, competition rules, governance and police cooperation. Guidelines for these issues were included in thepolitical declaration,,externalagreed by the UK and EU last year, which set out objectives for a future relationship. Analyis: What are the sticking points in the trade talks? Bank boss tells lenders to be ready for no-deal Brexit risk David Frost on EU policy position in UK trade talks Speaking in Brussels, Mr Barnier said: ""My responsibility is to speak to truth and, to tell the truth, this week there have been no significant areas of progress."" Matt Hancock said he hoped 'no deal' could be avoided He added: ""In all areas, the UK continues to backtrack under commitments undertaken in the political declaration, including on fisheries. We cannot and will not accept this backtracking on the political declaration."" This week's discussions - held online - were seen as the last chance to make progress ahead of a summit between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, expected to take place later this month. The UK has until the end of June to ask forthe ""transition period""- during which the country stays in the single market and customs union - to be extended into next year. But Mr Johnson has ruled this out. Mr Barnier said: ""We have always been open to the possibility of an extension of one or two years - as is possible under the exit agreement. And our door remains open."" Asked about the prospect of a no-deal exit from EU rules at the UK's daily coronavirus briefing, Matt Hancock said: ""I very much hope that we avoid that because our position is very reasonable ""It's that any agreement we reach must reflect the fact that the UK is an independent sovereign state. ""And we're working very hard and will accelerate the work to make progress in talks by the end of the year so that we can put into place the vision that has already been agreed between the UK and the EU which is based within the political declaration."" ""Plus Ã§a change,"" you could say. Round four of EU/UK trade negotiations after Brexit comes to an end. Cue yet another dismally downbeat assessment from the EU and the UK's chief negotiators. But I don't belong to the growing ""No deal is becoming the most likely outcome"" school of thought. On the contrary, both sides insisting loudly that their position will not waver (on all issues linked to national sovereignty for the UK; on all issues linked to the single market for the EU) is also a way of trying to reassure audiences back home that their interests will be protected, while privately considering what compromises they're prepared to make. Sift carefully through the rhetoric of EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Among his words of disappointment at the lack of progress, plus accusations that the UK is constantly ""backtracking"" on commitments, you'll find clear indications of wiggle-room in Brussels: a possible softening of EU demands on state aid rules and fishing quotas and an admission from Mr Barnier, that, if a deal were close this autumn, there would almost certainly be a ""dense"" period of last-minute negotiations. No compromise clues from the UK yet, though. It's not too late. But concessions will be needed from both sides for even a very narrow deal to be agreed by the UK-imposed deadline of the end of this year. A senior UK negotiating official told the BBC their side was prepared to accept some tariffs if they were needed to reach a deal with the EU. The UK was ""committed"" to sticking to the political declaration, but the document had been designed to set out only the ""parameters"" of discussions, they added, and was not a treaty. UK chief negotiator David Frost said: ""We continue to discuss the full range of issues, including the most difficult ones. Progress remains limited but our talks have been positive in tone. ""We are now at an important moment for these talks. We are close to reaching the limits of what we can achieve through the format of remote formal rounds."" UK officials told the BBC they would prefer to move to face-to-face talks but acknowledged that might not be possible just yet. The UK left the EU on 31 January. The transition period lasts until 31 December and keeps the UK bound to most EU rules. The sides currently have until then to reach a free trade deal, needed if they want to do business without tariffs, quotas or other barriers in future. Northern Ireland's first minister Arlene Foster said she was ""concerned"" about the current state of the talks. ""For both our sakes I hope that we get to a situation where we get a deal because that's what we need in Northern Ireland,"" she told Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast. ""We need to make sure that both sides understand that it is to both sides' benefit and that's something that I think the European Union often didn't get in the negotiations from 2016 onwards."" Businesses - hit by the coronavirus pandemic - have raised concerns over a possible ""cliff-edge"" break to the UK's remaining access to the EU single market at the end of the year with no replacement deal. The CBI business group called progress in the talks ""worryingly slow"", adding that this was causing ""deep concern to firms when resilience has rarely been more fragile"".

Government under fire for cheap loans to big firms,"German chemicals company BASF borrowed more than Â£1bn The government has been criticised for handing out more than Â£16bn in cheap loans to well-known firms such as John Lewis and Tottenham Hotspur. Of that, Â£1bn was lent to a German chemicals giant, while the UK's biggest airlines have borrowed almost Â£2bn. But senior Labour MP Margaret Hodge has called the loans ""a flagrant abuse of public money"". In response, the Treasury said the loan scheme was helping to protect hundreds of thousands of jobs. The Bank of England's Corporate Covid Financing Facility (CCFF) was set up to help large firms with a big impact on the UK economy through the crisis. It is one of a number of schemes designed to lend money to businesses affected by the pandemic. The list of 53 firms that have used the facility includes some household names such as M&S, Asos and Nissan. Airlines Ryanair and EasyJet each borrowed Â£600m, while British Airways owner IAG and Wizz Air were lent Â£300m each. That has prompted complaints from environmental campaigners who say the money should have been lent with conditions attached. ""Airlines have been given exactly what the chancellor, the prime minister, economists and the public said they should not be given - billions in cheap and easy loans to keep them polluting, without any commitments to reduce their emissions or even keep their workers on the payroll,"" said Fiona Nicholls from Greenpeace. BA plans to make 12,000 staff redundant, Ryanair has said it will cut 3,000 jobs and 4,500 roles could be axed at EasyJet. The biggest single loan was handed to German company BASF, which is the world's largest chemicals producer, although it only employs around 850 people in the UK. ""We should see a lot more public benefit from all this public money,"" Ms Nicholls said. At Friday's Downing Street press conference, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I think it's very important that we hit our goal of net-zero emissions as a country."" ""But we also do need an airline industry as we come out of this, so that people can move about."" Dame Margaret said supporting businesses to protect jobs was the right thing to do. ""But I have huge doubts on whether splashing billions of pounds of government finance on large corporations represents good value for money for hard-working taxpayers,"" she said. She said a lot of companies that had accessed the scheme were based abroad or owned by billionaires. Others, she said, were ""shockingly"" due to hand out dividends this year. She called the scheme ""a blatant misuse of the public purse"", adding: ""The taxpayer has been taken for a ride."" A Treasury spokesman said: ""The Corporate Covid Financing Facility is a key part of [coronavirus] support, directly protecting hundreds of thousands of jobs, supporting some of our biggest companies' cashflows and enabling then to support their suppliers.""

Victoria's Secret UK arm goes into administration,"Victoria's Secret fashion shows were cancelled in 2019 as they were branded as ""sexist"" and ""dated"" The UK arm of Victoria's Secret has fallen into administration, putting more than 800 jobs at risk. The chain, famous for its fashion shows, has 25 shops in the UK, all of which have been shut since the virus lockdown started in March. Administrator Deloitte said there would be no immediate redundancies as it tries to find a buyer for the chain. Rob Harding of Deloitte said it was ""yet another blow to the UK High Street"" amid the Covid-19 pandemic. But the chain had already been hit by changing consumer tastes and weakened spending. The UK arm made an operating loss of Â£170m in the year to February 2019,according to the most recent filings available.,external Last year, its annual fashion show was cancelled, withthe company blaming poor television ratings. The show launched in 1995 and was once a major pop culture event, drawing millions of viewers each year to watch its so-called ""angels"". In 2018 it saw its lowest ratings ever, drawing criticism that it was sexist, outdated and lacked diversity. The brand's parent company L Brands said it was important to ""evolve"" its marketing strategy at the time. The annual Victoria's Secret fashion show launched the careers of several supermodels The firm had already furloughed 785 workers in the UK before appointing administrators. Deloitte described the administration as ""light touch"", meaning the management are allowed to keep running the business. It will now attempt to find another buyer for its assets, or re-negotiate rents on its High Street stores in a bid to improve the firm's financial situation. All its UK shops will remain shut,  but none will, for the moment, be closed permanently. The administration process also excludes its online business, which will continue trading. Mr Harding added that this was a ""further example of the impact the Covid-19 pandemic is having on the entire retail industry."" ""The effect of the lockdowns, combined with broader challenges facing bricks and mortar retailers, has resulted in a funding requirement for this business, resulting in today's administration."" Several other High Street brands have been struggling in recent weeks due to lockdown measures introduced in March to stop the spread of the virus. Both fashion firms Cath KidstonandLaura Ashley, for example, have called in administrators since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. However, Victoria's Secret has arguably been eclipsed in recent years by brands such as Savage X Fenty, the lingerie line by singer, actress and businesswoman Rihanna, whose events showcase a range of body types. There was also a furious response to an interview in Vogue with then chief marketing officer Ed Razek. He suggested ""transsexual"" people should not be a part of the fashion show. He later left the company. Qing Wang, professor of marketing at Warwick Business School, said: ""If the UK arm of Victoria's Secret is to be saved, it needs a new start and a major overhaul of its brand and marketing strategy. ""It needs to be brought up to date to reflect the values of gender equality, sustainability, and diversity that appeal to today's shoppers and compete with the brands that have overtaken it. ""It has not kept pace with the strong values of millennials and post-millennials, who should now be the company's target customers,"" she added.

The Sweet bassist Steve Priest dies aged 72,"Steve Priest (far right) with his bandmates Brian Connolly, Mick Tucker and Andy Scott in 1974 Steve Priest, the bassist and co-founder of glam rock band Sweet, has died at the age of 72. He was known for his playful humour and outrageous costumes when Sweet played hits like Blockbuster and Little Willy on Top of the Pops in the 1970s. Priest also sang the memorable lines ""there's a girl in the corner that no-one ignores, 'cos she thinks she's the passionate one,"" in Ballroom Blitz.

Following a few line-up changes and a false start on Parlophone Records, the band signed to RCA in 1971 and teamed up with songwriters Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, whose bubblegum melodies and power-pop riffs propelled them into the charts.

No return to 'business as usual' for dentists,"The British Dental Association (BDA) has warned there will be no return to ""business as usual"" for dentistry in England. Practices were told last week that they could reopen from Monday 8 June, if they put in place appropriate safety measures. But some dentists say it was not enough warning and they lack necessary kit. A poll of 2,053 practices in England suggests that just over a third (36%) plan to reopen on Monday. ""Anyone expecting dentistry to magically return on Monday will find only a skeleton service,"" says BDA chair Mick Armstrong. ""Those practices reopening now face fewer patients and higher costs and will struggle to meet demand."" The BDA poll identified a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) as one of the major challenges to reopening, with only one third of practices saying they had enough to provide face-to-face care. The BDA says there are about 10,000 dental practices in England. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area One practice told the BBC it has been asked to donate its previous stock of PPE and was struggling to find new supplies in time for Monday. ""We have a week to get it all, which simply isn't possible"", says Sophia Joseph, an NHS dentist practice manager based in Sheffield. ""Apart from actually finding the equipment, there are other problems. Costs of this equipment have gone up from Â£5 to Â£50 for boxes of simple masks,"" she says. Sophia Joseph says her practice has been putting in place social distancing measures, but won't open in time for Monday The BDA poll also found 60% of practices intend to reopen by the end of June. However, services are likely to be very limited at first. Ms Joseph believes that official guidance arrived too late for dentists to properly prepare. ""We now have one working day to implement this 62-page document. It won't be possible to open on Monday. We need to train our staff, as well as organising the procedures we need to follow."" Lucinda Beesley has been unable to find treatment after a crown fell out All routine dental care in England was suspended on 25 March, in order to help reduce the spread of coronavirus. Since then, patients with emergencies are meant to be referred to urgent dental care 'hubs' by their local dentist. More than 550 of these centres have been created to provide emergency treatment while meeting social distancing requirements. This video can not be played DIY dentistry: What is safe to do to your own teeth? Dental practices to reopen from 8 June Dentists facing 'critical shortage of kit' Dentists have 'nowhere to send patients' Despite this, some patients have been unable to find treatment. Lucinda Beesley, 40, from Hatfield in Hertfordshire, has been suffering after she lost a crown more than a week ago. ""I am in a lot of pain. I can't eat, I've been surviving on soup. I tried to fix it myself with a temporary kit, but that's made it worse"", she says. Even though she was given the numbers of two local dentists by NHS 111, Ms Beesley says that both practices told her that they don't intend to open on Monday. ""I've been told lots of different things, given numbers of different people"", she says. ""I am feeling desperate"". Going to the dentist is likely to be a very different experience once practices do reopen. Social distancing measures will mean practices are likely to treat far fewer people. The chief dental officer for England has asked dentists to consider a range of measures before reopening, including: Limiting use of waiting areas, with patients waiting outside if they arrive early Waiting rooms chairs spaced 2m apart Screening staff on a daily basis Installing physical barriers, such as a plastic shield, in reception areas One dentist told the BBC they would be asking patients to wait in their cars and send a text message when they arrived. A dental nurse will then collect them at the time of their appointment. Sara Hurley, chief dental officer for England, said: ""We'll continue to work with dentists, and support them to offer safe care, using latest guidance from PHE and government on PPE [personal protective equipment] and infection control.""

Weird weather: Can computers solve UK puzzle?A top climate scientist has called for more investment in climate computing.,"The Met Office recently announced an upgrade to its existing supercomputer (pictured). But even more money for computing would be welcome, says Prof Palmer A top climate scientist has called for more investment in climate computing to explain the UKâs recent topsy turvy weather. Prof Tim Palmer from Oxford University said there were still too many unknowns in climate forecasting. And in the month the SpaceX launch grabbed headlines, he said just one of the firm's billions could transform climate modelling. Short-term weather forecasting is generally very accurate. And long-term trends in rising temperatures arenât in doubt. But Prof Palmer says many puzzles remain unsolved: take the recent weird weather in the UK, with the wettest February on record followed by the sunniest Spring. Forecasters set for 'billion pound' supercomputer May was sunniest UK month on record Meteorologists were astounded by this unprecedented weather somersault â and especially by the amazing amountthat May sunshine exceeded the previous record. This yearâs figure was 13% higher than the previous record â thatâs like the winner of the 100 metres leaving opponents over 11 metres behind. Some place the blame on climate change, but the Met Office says, as yet, thereâs no strong evidence for that. Prof Palmer told BBC News: âIt would be really valuable for us to have more knowledge of how climate change is affecting weather patterns like this. âWas climate change implicated in the recent weird weather? We donât know.â The Met Office declared February 2020 as the wettest February on record He agrees that space observations have massively improved our understanding of the climate. But he complains: âIt is very frustrating to see space get quite so much attention when we canât be sure what will happen to the climate on Earth. âIf only we couldsecure one of their billions for computer modelling that would be a big help.â,external So what do we know so far about recent British weather weirdness? Well, hereâs whatâs clear: the strong jetstream to the south-west of England through the winter locked in place the succession of Atlantic storms that drenched the UK. The Met Office successfully predicted the wet winter in its seasonal forecast, but failed to predict the sudden leap to a dry spring when the jetstream was looped over the UK, holding the sunny weather in place. In a global climate chicken-and-egg debate thereâs the question of why the jetstream behaved this way. Some scientists believe itâs being affected by conditions in the Arctic, which is warming faster than anywhere on the planet, because of greenhouse gases. But this is disputed. Prof Palmer said the jetstream appeared to be influenced by a climate phenomenon known as the Indian dipole â an irregular oscillating current in the Indian Ocean. This was also blamed for the wildfires in Australia. But whatâs influencing the Indian dipole? Or is it completely natural? Scientists know ocean currents on the other side of the world can influence our weather â but did water round the Chagos Archipelago really prompt a âbarbecue springâ in grateful lockdown Britain? âThere are very strange things going on in the tropics,â Prof Palmer added. âThe question is, âis it natural?â andweâre not yet sure.â,external Scientists are now planning to re-run UK climate models over recent years and remove the heating element of CO2 emissions from the mathematical puzzle. That should offer a better understanding of British weather at least. Prof Palmer admits itâs surprising this exercise wasnât done sooner. But of all the uses of extra cash for climate research, he thinks the most useful spending on climate research might be to unlock the secret of clouds â one of the most intractable climate mysteries. If warmer weather leads to more low-level clouds, that will bounce out radiation and cool the Earth. If it leads to more high-level clouds, that will trap in heat. In fact, Prof Palmer said, one recent cloud modelling exercise suggested that if weâre unlucky, global temperatures may rise by 5C after CO2 levels are doubled â a level utterly inhospitable to humans. The conclusion was previously ruled out under different analysis. âWe need to understand these processes better,â he says. âNormally in science you learn about the system under study by doing laboratory experiments. With Earthâs climate, there is no lab experiment you can do. âThe climate model is the only tool we have to understand what future is in store for humanity as a result of climate change. âSpace observations tell us what is happening now, but climate models tell us about what will happen next year, next decade, next century.â Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

Brexit: 'No significant progress' in trade talks,"This video can not be played Brexit: Barnier on UK approach to EU trade talks A trade deal with the EU based on the UK's ""very reasonable"" demands is still possible, cabinet minister Matt Hancock has said. The health secretary was speaking after the two sides admitted little progress had been made in the latest round. He said he ""very much"" hoped a no-deal outcome to the talks could be avoided if the two sides worked together. He was speaking after EU negotiator Michel Barnier accused the UK of ""backtracking"" on its commitments. The French official said differences remain in four key areas - fisheries, competition rules, governance and police cooperation. Guidelines for these issues were included in thepolitical declaration,,externalagreed by the UK and EU last year, which set out objectives for a future relationship. Analyis: What are the sticking points in the trade talks? Bank boss tells lenders to be ready for no-deal Brexit risk David Frost on EU policy position in UK trade talks Speaking in Brussels, Mr Barnier said: ""My responsibility is to speak to truth and, to tell the truth, this week there have been no significant areas of progress."" Matt Hancock said he hoped 'no deal' could be avoided He added: ""In all areas, the UK continues to backtrack under commitments undertaken in the political declaration, including on fisheries. We cannot and will not accept this backtracking on the political declaration."" This week's discussions - held online - were seen as the last chance to make progress ahead of a summit between Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, expected to take place later this month. The UK has until the end of June to ask forthe ""transition period""- during which the country stays in the single market and customs union - to be extended into next year. But Mr Johnson has ruled this out. Mr Barnier said: ""We have always been open to the possibility of an extension of one or two years - as is possible under the exit agreement. And our door remains open."" Asked about the prospect of a no-deal exit from EU rules at the UK's daily coronavirus briefing, Matt Hancock said: ""I very much hope that we avoid that because our position is very reasonable ""It's that any agreement we reach must reflect the fact that the UK is an independent sovereign state. ""And we're working very hard and will accelerate the work to make progress in talks by the end of the year so that we can put into place the vision that has already been agreed between the UK and the EU which is based within the political declaration."" ""Plus Ã§a change,"" you could say. Round four of EU/UK trade negotiations after Brexit comes to an end. Cue yet another dismally downbeat assessment from the EU and the UK's chief negotiators. But I don't belong to the growing ""No deal is becoming the most likely outcome"" school of thought. On the contrary, both sides insisting loudly that their position will not waver (on all issues linked to national sovereignty for the UK; on all issues linked to the single market for the EU) is also a way of trying to reassure audiences back home that their interests will be protected, while privately considering what compromises they're prepared to make. Sift carefully through the rhetoric of EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Among his words of disappointment at the lack of progress, plus accusations that the UK is constantly ""backtracking"" on commitments, you'll find clear indications of wiggle-room in Brussels: a possible softening of EU demands on state aid rules and fishing quotas and an admission from Mr Barnier, that, if a deal were close this autumn, there would almost certainly be a ""dense"" period of last-minute negotiations. No compromise clues from the UK yet, though. It's not too late. But concessions will be needed from both sides for even a very narrow deal to be agreed by the UK-imposed deadline of the end of this year. A senior UK negotiating official told the BBC their side was prepared to accept some tariffs if they were needed to reach a deal with the EU. The UK was ""committed"" to sticking to the political declaration, but the document had been designed to set out only the ""parameters"" of discussions, they added, and was not a treaty. UK chief negotiator David Frost said: ""We continue to discuss the full range of issues, including the most difficult ones. Progress remains limited but our talks have been positive in tone. ""We are now at an important moment for these talks. We are close to reaching the limits of what we can achieve through the format of remote formal rounds."" UK officials told the BBC they would prefer to move to face-to-face talks but acknowledged that might not be possible just yet. The UK left the EU on 31 January. The transition period lasts until 31 December and keeps the UK bound to most EU rules. The sides currently have until then to reach a free trade deal, needed if they want to do business without tariffs, quotas or other barriers in future. Northern Ireland's first minister Arlene Foster said she was ""concerned"" about the current state of the talks. ""For both our sakes I hope that we get to a situation where we get a deal because that's what we need in Northern Ireland,"" she told Nick Robinson's Political Thinking podcast. ""We need to make sure that both sides understand that it is to both sides' benefit and that's something that I think the European Union often didn't get in the negotiations from 2016 onwards."" Businesses - hit by the coronavirus pandemic - have raised concerns over a possible ""cliff-edge"" break to the UK's remaining access to the EU single market at the end of the year with no replacement deal. The CBI business group called progress in the talks ""worryingly slow"", adding that this was causing ""deep concern to firms when resilience has rarely been more fragile"".

Weird weather: Can computers solve UK puzzle?,"The Met Office recently announced an upgrade to its existing supercomputer (pictured). But even more money for computing would be welcome, says Prof Palmer A top climate scientist has called for more investment in climate computing to explain the UKâs recent topsy turvy weather. Prof Tim Palmer from Oxford University said there were still too many unknowns in climate forecasting. And in the month the SpaceX launch grabbed headlines, he said just one of the firm's billions could transform climate modelling. Short-term weather forecasting is generally very accurate. And long-term trends in rising temperatures arenât in doubt. But Prof Palmer says many puzzles remain unsolved: take the recent weird weather in the UK, with the wettest February on record followed by the sunniest Spring. Forecasters set for 'billion pound' supercomputer May was sunniest UK month on record Meteorologists were astounded by this unprecedented weather somersault â and especially by the amazing amountthat May sunshine exceeded the previous record. This yearâs figure was 13% higher than the previous record â thatâs like the winner of the 100 metres leaving opponents over 11 metres behind. Some place the blame on climate change, but the Met Office says, as yet, thereâs no strong evidence for that. Prof Palmer told BBC News: âIt would be really valuable for us to have more knowledge of how climate change is affecting weather patterns like this. âWas climate change implicated in the recent weird weather? We donât know.â The Met Office declared February 2020 as the wettest February on record He agrees that space observations have massively improved our understanding of the climate. But he complains: âIt is very frustrating to see space get quite so much attention when we canât be sure what will happen to the climate on Earth. âIf only we couldsecure one of their billions for computer modelling that would be a big help.â,external So what do we know so far about recent British weather weirdness? Well, hereâs whatâs clear: the strong jetstream to the south-west of England through the winter locked in place the succession of Atlantic storms that drenched the UK. The Met Office successfully predicted the wet winter in its seasonal forecast, but failed to predict the sudden leap to a dry spring when the jetstream was looped over the UK, holding the sunny weather in place. In a global climate chicken-and-egg debate thereâs the question of why the jetstream behaved this way. Some scientists believe itâs being affected by conditions in the Arctic, which is warming faster than anywhere on the planet, because of greenhouse gases. But this is disputed. Prof Palmer said the jetstream appeared to be influenced by a climate phenomenon known as the Indian dipole â an irregular oscillating current in the Indian Ocean. This was also blamed for the wildfires in Australia. But whatâs influencing the Indian dipole? Or is it completely natural? Scientists know ocean currents on the other side of the world can influence our weather â but did water round the Chagos Archipelago really prompt a âbarbecue springâ in grateful lockdown Britain? âThere are very strange things going on in the tropics,â Prof Palmer added. âThe question is, âis it natural?â andweâre not yet sure.â,external Scientists are now planning to re-run UK climate models over recent years and remove the heating element of CO2 emissions from the mathematical puzzle. That should offer a better understanding of British weather at least. Prof Palmer admits itâs surprising this exercise wasnât done sooner. But of all the uses of extra cash for climate research, he thinks the most useful spending on climate research might be to unlock the secret of clouds â one of the most intractable climate mysteries. If warmer weather leads to more low-level clouds, that will bounce out radiation and cool the Earth. If it leads to more high-level clouds, that will trap in heat. In fact, Prof Palmer said, one recent cloud modelling exercise suggested that if weâre unlucky, global temperatures may rise by 5C after CO2 levels are doubled â a level utterly inhospitable to humans. The conclusion was previously ruled out under different analysis. âWe need to understand these processes better,â he says. âNormally in science you learn about the system under study by doing laboratory experiments. With Earthâs climate, there is no lab experiment you can do. âThe climate model is the only tool we have to understand what future is in store for humanity as a result of climate change. âSpace observations tell us what is happening now, but climate models tell us about what will happen next year, next decade, next century.â Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

AstraZeneca boosts potential vaccine supply to 2bn,"Drug company AstraZeneca is to start producing a potential vaccine for coronavirus, its boss has told the BBC. Trials of the drug are under way but Pascal Soriot said the firm must start making doses now so that it can meet demand if the vaccine proves effective. ""We are starting to manufacture this vaccine right now - and we have to have it ready to be used by the time we have the results,"" he said. AstraZeneca says it will be able supply two billion doses of the vaccine. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Soriot said manufacturing was beginning already because, ""we want to be as fast as possible"". ""Of course, with this decision comes a risk but it's a financial risk and that financial risk is the vaccine doesn't work,"" he added. ""Then all the materials, all the vaccines, we've manufactured will be wasted."" Drugs firm prepares to supply vaccine in September Virus vaccine 'could be ready by end of the year' The Bill Gates âmicrochipâ claim fact-checked He said AstraZeneca would not seek to make a profit from producing the drug during the pandemic. If it works, the company will be able to produce two billion doses after signing two new contracts on Thursday, one of which was with billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with scientists at Oxford University, has agreed to supply half of the doses to low and middle-income countries. One of the new partnerships is with the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines by volume. The other is a $750m (Â£595m) deal with two health organisations backed by Bill and Melinda Gates. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The two charities, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and GAVI vaccines alliance, will help find production facilities to produce and distribute 300 million doses of the vaccine. Delivery is expected to start by the end of the year. Mr Soriot has said he expects to know by August if the AZD1222 vaccine is effective, while CEPI chief executive Richard Hatchett said there is still a possibility the vaccine may not work. AstraZeneca's licensing agreement with India's SII is to supply one billion doses for low and middle-income countries, with a commitment to provide 400 million before the end of 2020. Mr Soirot said the company was building a number of supply chains across the world ""to support global access at no profit during the pandemic and has so far secured manufacturing capacity for two billion doses of the vaccine"". ""Having a vaccine is one thing but you need to produce it at scale and I can tell you that It is not an easy thing to do,"" the pharmaceutical boss told Today. He has described the coronavirus pandemic as ""a global tragedy"" and ""a challenge for all of humanity"". AstraZeneca has already agreed to supply 300 million doses of the potential vaccine to the US and a further 100 million to the UK, with the first deliveries expected in September. Governments around the world have pledged billions of dollars for a Covid-19 vaccine and a number of pharmaceutical firms are in a race to develop and test potential drugs.

Outbreak exercise showed âclear gapâ in readiness,"The exercise in 2018 revealed concerns over protective gear and contract tracing An exercise simulating a coronavirus outbreak in Scotland, which was shared with a UK government advisory group, showed a ""clear gap"" in preparedness, the BBC has learned. A report into ""Exercise Iris"" revealed frontline staff ""unease"" over personal protective equipment and ""the need for substantive progress"". The exercise simulated an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The Scottish government says its findings were shared with attendees. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) is a coronavirus like SARS-Cov-2 but has different characteristics. Like the novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV causes a respiratory disease and key symptoms include fever and a cough. However, transmission rates are believed to be far lower and fatality rates are much higher. Pandemic exercise findings 'must be published' UK failed to stockpile crucial protective kit Contact tracer 'paid to watch Netflix' BBC News has learned an exercise was undertaken simulating an outbreak of the disease in 2018 and requested the findings under the Freedom of Information Act in April. The Scottish Government has nowpublished a report of its findings,external. The outcomes were shared with the expert committee that advises the UK government on pandemics, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) in June 2019. ""Exercise Iris"" was a tabletop exercise which took place at a hotel in Stirling on 12 March 2018 and involved health boards, Health Protection Scotland, the Scottish Ambulance Service and NHS 24, the telephone advice service. Exercise discussions revealed concerns around the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and underlined ""the need for substantive progress on PPE use within Scotland"", according to the report. ""Issues around PPE are not unique to a MERS-CoV outbreak"", it said. The report conclusions also note an ""unease"" amongst frontline staff over the lack of clarity on PPE availability, training and testing. ""This is a clear gap in Scotland's preparedness for MERS-CoV and other outbreaks and needs to be addressed as soon as possible."" The report also warns of the demands of contact tracing. One scenario in the exercise features ""escalating resource requirements for contact tracing and follow up"". As a result, health boards were asked to consider the impact of extensive contact tracing. ""It feels like a lost opportunity"", says Professor Devi Sridhar, chair of public health at Edinburgh University and a member of the Scottish Government COVID-19 Advisory Group. ""On the positive side it's good that these exercises were conducted, because it meant that they were thinking beyond flu, they were thinking about coronaviruses. ""But on the negative side it's surprising, it seems that SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) members were unaware or at least didn't discuss this exercise in their thinking in January or February, which would have been crucial in making steps to actually prepare for an eventual outbreak"". ""It's the whole purpose of these exercises, to learn from them"", she added. A report detailing the findings of an exercise simulating pandemic influenza called ""Exercise Cygnus"", which was run in England in October 2016, was also not published. PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? FACE MASKS:Should I be wearing one? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic The report into the MERS coronavirus exercise says Public Health England held a previous exercise in 2016 ""which identified a series of actions for improvement"". At two meetings, in June and December 2018, Nervtag asked for the report into the exercise to be circulated within the group. Minutes of a meeting from June 2019, when the report was shared, say ""most of the recommendations have now been implemented or are in the process of being implemented"" by Health Protection Scotland's resilience group. The Scottish government said the report was shared with all attendees. ""The output from this exercise has been considered in line with wider work on health protection preparedness carried out through the Scottish Health Protection Network"", it said. The Department for Health and Social Care said: ""As the public would expect, we regularly test our preparedness for emergencies - allowing us to rapidly respond to this unprecedented crisis.""

European Union 'wants borders open by end of June',"The World Health Organization changes its policy on face masks, advising they should be worn in public places The WHO had previously said there was not enough evidence to support this policy for healthy people UK coronavirus deaths pass 40,000, becoming only the second country after the US to reach the figure Health Secretary Matt Hancock says it is vital to avoid large protests over the death of George Floyd EU Commissioner for Home Affairs Ylva Johansson says states should reopen internal borders by end of June US unemployment rate improves defying predictions it would get worse Globally, there have been 6.6m cases since the outbreak began and 388,000 deaths Edited by Kevin Ponniah and Rob Corp Thatâs it for our live
coverage today - thank you for joining us. Hereâs a roundup of Friday's biggest coronavirus stories: Today's live page was brought to you by teams in Singapore, Sydney, Delhi and across the UK. They are: Owen Amos, Frances Mao, Saira Asher, Yvette Tan, Aparna Alluri, Andreas Illmer, Rebecca Seales, Sean Fanning, Ashitha Nagesh, Robert Corp, Ella Wills, Emma Harrison, Gavin Stamp, Lucy Webster, Matt Cannon, Kevin Ponniah, Vicky Baker, Victoria Bisset, Matthew Henry, Saj Chowdhury and Steven Sutcliffe The World Health Organization has changed its advice on
mask-wearing. It previously recommended that only health workers, people
with coronavirus and their caregivers should wear medical masks. So whatâs changed? The WHO says the revised recommendations are based on new research and that there is increasing evidence that coronavirus can be spread by people
before they have symptoms. It had previously said this was not known to be a significant cause for the spread of the disease. A mask on a mannequin in Germany, where many states made wearing them compulsory at the end of April Thousands of people took part in Tuesday's demonstration in Paris French police have banned protests that were due to place in front of the US Embassy on Saturday, citing coronavirus measures. Demonstrations have been taking place in the US and across the world since an unarmed African-American, George Floyd, died after a police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis. On Tuesday, 20,000 people joined a rally in Paris in memory of Adama Traore, a French black man who died in similar circumstances to Floyd in 2016. Campaigners have called for a new protest near the Eiffel Tower on Saturday instead. Meanwhile, Black Lives Matter protesters in Australia have said they will go ahead with plans to hold a demonstration in Sydney on Saturday,despite a court banning the gathering because of coronavirus. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News In the UK, healthcare staff caring for patients with Covid-19 already
wear surgical face masks, as well as other personal protective equipment
including gloves and aprons. Now all staff working in hospitals in England will be
expected to wear surgical masks â to reduce infections there, we are told, as
cases come down. Patients and visitors (who are permitted to enter) will have
to cover their faces too. Suddenly, face masks or coverings are becoming a feature of
many peopleâs daily lives â whether at work or on public transport or in shops,
where social distancing is a challenge. The change in advice is linked to research showing possible
transmission from infected people by coughing, talking and breathing. The guidance will come into force on 15 June, as more
businesses open up and more pupils return to school. But face coverings are still only one way of stopping the
spread of the virus. Regular hand washing and cleaning of surfaces is just as
important. While many people have turned to yoga as a form of exercise and stress relief during the pandemic, not everyone is as welcoming. The Greek Orthodox Church now says that the practice is ""absolutely incompatible"" with Christian faithand has no place ""in the life of Christians"". Greek media had been advising yoga for people stuck under quarantine. Online yoga classes become popular around the world as countries imposed lockdowns A new NHS app is being rolled out to help thousands of people who are most at risk from coronavirus to keep away from hospitals. It will allow cystic fibrosis patients to share information about their condition with their doctor, with the help of a bluetooth-enabled spirometer which measures lung capacity. A separate trial will give some who have both the condition and coronavirus devices which can help spot potentially dangerous dips in their blood oxygen levels. NHS chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said: ""For patients and their families living with cystic fibrosis this is a landmark moment, offering people vital health help at home."" The devices should be rolled out to all 4,000 cystic fibrosis patients in England later this year, the NHS said. A Conservative MP in the UK has apologised after admitting he failed to
follow lockdown guidance by attending a barbecue. According to the Guardian newspaper, Isle
of Wight MP Bob Seely,went to an evening gathering at a journalist's home in Seaview on 22 May.,external Seely said he and his girlfriend met the man for a work-related
discussion and ate ""half a sausage"", but did not enter the house or
have a drink. At the time people could only meet one other person from another
household at a distance in a public place. Seely, who is leading efforts to promote the trial of theCovid-19 contact-tracing appon the island, said the
journalist wanted to discuss the project with him. In a statement,external, the MP said: ""When I arrived, I saw
another couple of people there, which I was not expecting. I thought about
leaving, but felt that was perhaps over-reacting. ""I apologise because, on balance, I called this wrong. It
would have better to have spoken to this person without any others nearby."" Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva In March, just as fresh snow had fallen across the alps, Switzerlandâs ski season came to an abrupt halt. Alpine hotels emptied overnight, cable cars and mountain railways stopped. No-one, not even the Swiss themselves, could enjoy a day on the slopes. The financial consequences for the alpine communities are huge, but now the resorts are opening again. The Swiss government's advice on maintaining a two-metre distance is still in place, so the mountain railways have a safety concept: staff and passengers should wear masks. The snow has long since melted, but the alpine resorts hope their offer of natural beauty and a clean environment may be just what European tourists want after three months of stress under lockdown. The Universal Studios theme park in Orlando, Florida, has opened its doors to visitors for the first time in almost three months. New safety guidelines have been put in place,external, including temperature checks before entry, mandatory face coverings and spacing between visitors on rides. The park was closed in mid-March due to the spread of coronavirus. It's not the first major theme park to begin reopening its doors: Shanghai Disneyland began operating again on 11 May, and Walt Disney World Resort in Florida will start a phased reopening of its attractions from 11 July. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The UK';s coronavirus death toll officially passed 40,000 today. International comparisons are difficult - the way coronavirus fatalities are recorded differs from country to country. In fact, there are actually two ways to measure it in the UK. The 40,000 figure refers to deaths following a positive test. If you look at death certificate mentions, which rely on the judgement of doctors, the UK was actually close to 50,000 deaths by the end of May. The UK has certainly been among the worst-affected countries. However, a number of our near neighbours - in particular Spain and Italy - have seen similar rates of fatalities if you look at deaths per head of population. The UK is certainly not an outlier. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Chinaâs culture and tourism ministry has issued a warning to people not to travel to Australia, which has raised a lot of eyebrows in China. âDue to the coronavirus epidemic, racial discrimination against Chinese and Asian people in Australia has increased significantly,âthe notice reads.,external It comes amid sharp tensions between China and Australia over the latter's calls for an inquiry into the origins of the virus. The announcement got thousands in China on Fridayusing the hashtag #DontGoToAustralia,external. But given that Australia has closed its borders to everyone except Australian citizens, residents and immediate family members, many are ridiculing the governmentâs message. Some tell the âmotherlandâ to ârest assuredâ that they will do their civic duty. âAustralia has long denied foreign entry,â one user says. âHow do I get there? Which Chinese citizens can enter Australia?â âItâs hard enough to get out of bed,â another says. A primary school in the Canadian province of Quebec became the site of an outbreak after one child
caught Covid-19, health officials say. Out
of a class of 11, nine children have since tested positive,external. The class was
small because the school has been operating at half capacity. Health officials confirm the school had taken preventative measures, such as
handwashing reminders and marking spaces
on the floor to encourage social distancing. Elementary schools opened across Quebec outside the city of Montreal on 11
May, despite the province being Canada's biggest coronavirus hotspot, with
52,398 total cases and 4,935 deaths currently recorded. Across the country, different provinces are reopening at different rates. On 1
June,British
Columbia opened all schools,externalon an optional, part-time basis. Ontario, the site of Canada's second-largest hotspot, has closed schools for
the remainder of the school year. But Premier Doug Ford announcedthe province would proceed to phase two,externalof reopening the economy, despite a slight rise
in the number of cases. Renowned theatre director Sam Mendes has suggested how British theatre can be saved from collapse. Writingin the Financial Times,external, he says live performances are in ""grave danger"" - but adds that the industry needs ""investment, not charity"". He then suggests that in the short term the government continues its job-retention scheme, while in the longer term,  theatres should benefit from tax relief schemes to help keep them afloat, as revenues plummet due to social distancing requirements. ""The performing arts need to be saved now,"" he writes. ""Not next week, or next month. If they die, an ecosystem this intricate and evolved cannot be rebuilt from scratch."" David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News The WHO specified that it was recommending cloth face coverings for most of the public This is a big shift in the WHOâs guidance on when the public
should cover their faces. For months, the organisationâs experts stuck to the line
that masks would encourage a false sense of security and would deprive medical
professionals of badly needed protective equipment. Those arguments have not gone away but at the same time the
WHO acknowledges that new evidence has emerged on the risks of transmission. It points to recent research that people can be highly
infectious in the few days before they show symptoms and that some people catch
the virus but never show symptoms at all, as I reportedlast weekend. So where distancing isnât possible, such as on public
transport and in locations as varied as shops and refugee camps, itâs suggested
that faces are covered with homemade masks to avoid passing on the infection. Over 60s with underlying health conditions
should go further, the WHO said, and wear medical-grade masks to give themselves
better protection. Just how do you stop large gatherings of people when the sun is shining and people fancy a trip to the seaside? Well, on the Dorset coast in the UK, pre-booked parking spaces, fines for illegal parking and beach marshals are all going to be introduced in order to prevent a repeat of last weekend's influx of visitors. Thousands have flocked to the Jurassic Coast and Bournemouth beaches since lockdown restrictions were eased. Current government guidelines state that households can drive any distance in England to parks and beaches. Three people were badly hurtjumping from the limestone arch at Durdle Door, while ahorrendous amount of litterwas also another unwelcome byproduct of the Jurassic Coast Unesco World Heritage site receiving a large number of visitors last week. Beach-goers had to abandon social distancing when rescue helicopters landed on Durdle Door Beach to pick up injured divers The latest figures from Italy show the daily death figures staying broadly flat - 85 on Friday, 88 the day before, according to the Civil Protection Agency. However, the number of new confirmed coronavirus cases jumped from 177 on Thursday to 518 on Friday, with 402 recorded in the northern region of Lombardy - the hardest-hit part of Italy in terms of deaths and cases. The total number of cases in Italy has now increased to 234,531, the sixth
highest tally behind those of the United States, Russia,
Spain, Britain and Brazil. The death toll now stands at 33,774. England and Borussia Dortmund winger Jadon Sanchohas been fined by the German football league (DFL) after breaching rules to restrict the spread of the coronavirus, while getting a haircut at home. The 20-year-old - who has been repeatedly linked with a
Â£100m transfer to Englandâs Premier League - and his Swiss team-mate Manuel
Akanji, were fined after a photo on social media showed neither the
players nor their hairdresser wearing personal protective equipment. A statement from the DFL read: ""The DFL
has fined Manuel Akanji and Jadon Sancho. ""The players from Borussia Dortmund had obviously
violated general hygiene and infection protection standards at home hairdressing
appointments."" Sancho, was one of a number ofBundesliga playersto make anti-racism statements during matches last weekend in response to the death of unarmed black man George Floyd at the hands of US police. We've already reported that from 15 June, people in England will be required to wear face coverings on public transport. There's a bit of controversy, because the British Medical Association (which represents doctors in the UK) says the rule should be extended so it's compulsory to wear masks in all public places where social distancing isn't possible. That is the new guidance from the World Health Organization, which has changed its stance on fabric face masks. But what are the rules right now in other countries? In theUS, legislation around masks is decided on a state-level - or even at a county-level in some cases.New Yorkstate, for example, requires people to wear masks in any public place where social distancing isn't possible. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends everyone wear masks when out in public. Things are a bit more straightforward inGermany, where mask-wearing has been mandatory on public transport and while shopping since 22 April. Francebrought in a rule on May 10, making face masks compulsory while out in public, ahead of the start of their lockdown easing a day later. And inIreland, while people are advised to wear masks while out in public, it isn't actually mandatory. Meanwhile, wearing masks in crowded places was far from uncommon in parts of Asia even before the coronavirus pandemic struck, especially if people were ill. This video can not be played Abbey Road Studios re-opens after 10 weeks of closure Music can be heard inside one of the world's most famous recording studios. Abbey Road Studios in London was forced to close as the UK entered lockdown 10 weeks ago but has now reopened - with musicians keeping 2m apart. The centre is intrinsically linked with The Beatles, who used it to record hits including Come Together and Here Comes The Sun. Our arts editor Will Gompertz went to listen to the first recording session since it reopened. Jessica ParkerBBC political correspondent As the UK passes the milestone of more than 40,000
deaths, questions will inevitably be asked. How did we get here? What more
could have been done? What mistakes were made? Health Secretary Matt Hancockâs response to the
total number of deaths today was to say that it redoubled his determination to tackle the
virus. That adds to the sense that ministers want the focus to be on addressing
the situation as it is now rather than get drawn into an extensive examination
of how itâs handled the outbreak so far. But the government will know that
eventually the calls for a public inquiry will almost certainly increase. Not
just for the purposes of accountability â important though that may be â but
also to ensure that, should any pandemic emerge again, the country
will be better prepared. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
AstraZeneca boosts potential vaccine supply to 2bnThe drugs giant says it can double the production of a potential vaccine helped by backing from Bill Gates.,"Drug company AstraZeneca is to start producing a potential vaccine for coronavirus, its boss has told the BBC. Trials of the drug are under way but Pascal Soriot said the firm must start making doses now so that it can meet demand if the vaccine proves effective. ""We are starting to manufacture this vaccine right now - and we have to have it ready to be used by the time we have the results,"" he said. AstraZeneca says it will be able supply two billion doses of the vaccine. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Soriot said manufacturing was beginning already because, ""we want to be as fast as possible"". ""Of course, with this decision comes a risk but it's a financial risk and that financial risk is the vaccine doesn't work,"" he added. ""Then all the materials, all the vaccines, we've manufactured will be wasted."" Drugs firm prepares to supply vaccine in September Virus vaccine 'could be ready by end of the year' The Bill Gates âmicrochipâ claim fact-checked He said AstraZeneca would not seek to make a profit from producing the drug during the pandemic. If it works, the company will be able to produce two billion doses after signing two new contracts on Thursday, one of which was with billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with scientists at Oxford University, has agreed to supply half of the doses to low and middle-income countries. One of the new partnerships is with the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines by volume. The other is a $750m (Â£595m) deal with two health organisations backed by Bill and Melinda Gates. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The two charities, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and GAVI vaccines alliance, will help find production facilities to produce and distribute 300 million doses of the vaccine. Delivery is expected to start by the end of the year. Mr Soriot has said he expects to know by August if the AZD1222 vaccine is effective, while CEPI chief executive Richard Hatchett said there is still a possibility the vaccine may not work. AstraZeneca's licensing agreement with India's SII is to supply one billion doses for low and middle-income countries, with a commitment to provide 400 million before the end of 2020. Mr Soirot said the company was building a number of supply chains across the world ""to support global access at no profit during the pandemic and has so far secured manufacturing capacity for two billion doses of the vaccine"". ""Having a vaccine is one thing but you need to produce it at scale and I can tell you that It is not an easy thing to do,"" the pharmaceutical boss told Today. He has described the coronavirus pandemic as ""a global tragedy"" and ""a challenge for all of humanity"". AstraZeneca has already agreed to supply 300 million doses of the potential vaccine to the US and a further 100 million to the UK, with the first deliveries expected in September. Governments around the world have pledged billions of dollars for a Covid-19 vaccine and a number of pharmaceutical firms are in a race to develop and test potential drugs. ""A vaccine must be seen as a global public good - a people's vaccine, which a growing number of world leaders are calling for,"" United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said in a video message on Thursday.

Climate computing power 'needs more cash',"The Met Office recently announced an upgrade to its existing supercomputer (pictured). But even more money for computing would be welcome, says Prof Palmer A top climate scientist has called for more investment in climate computing to explain the UKâs recent topsy turvy weather. Prof Tim Palmer from Oxford University said there were still too many unknowns in climate forecasting. And in the month the SpaceX launch grabbed headlines, he said just one of the firm's billions could transform climate modelling. Short-term weather forecasting is generally very accurate. And long-term trends in rising temperatures arenât in doubt. But Prof Palmer says many puzzles remain unsolved: take the recent weird weather in the UK, with the wettest February on record followed by the sunniest Spring. Forecasters set for 'billion pound' supercomputer May was sunniest UK month on record Meteorologists were astounded by this unprecedented weather somersault â and especially by the amazing amountthat May sunshine exceeded the previous record. This yearâs figure was 13% higher than the previous record â thatâs like the winner of the 100 metres leaving opponents over 11 metres behind. Some place the blame on climate change, but the Met Office says, as yet, thereâs no strong evidence for that. Prof Palmer told BBC News: âIt would be really valuable for us to have more knowledge of how climate change is affecting weather patterns like this. âWas climate change implicated in the recent weird weather? We donât know.â The Met Office declared February 2020 as the wettest February on record He agrees that space observations have massively improved our understanding of the climate. But he complains: âIt is very frustrating to see space get quite so much attention when we canât be sure what will happen to the climate on Earth. âIf only we couldsecure one of their billions for computer modelling that would be a big help.â,external So what do we know so far about recent British weather weirdness? Well, hereâs whatâs clear: the strong jetstream to the south-west of England through the winter locked in place the succession of Atlantic storms that drenched the UK. The Met Office successfully predicted the wet winter in its seasonal forecast, but failed to predict the sudden leap to a dry spring when the jetstream was looped over the UK, holding the sunny weather in place. In a global climate chicken-and-egg debate thereâs the question of why the jetstream behaved this way. Some scientists believe itâs being affected by conditions in the Arctic, which is warming faster than anywhere on the planet, because of greenhouse gases. But this is disputed. Prof Palmer said the jetstream appeared to be influenced by a climate phenomenon known as the Indian dipole â an irregular oscillating current in the Indian Ocean. This was also blamed for the wildfires in Australia. But whatâs influencing the Indian dipole? Or is it completely natural? Scientists know ocean currents on the other side of the world can influence our weather â but did water round the Chagos Archipelago really prompt a âbarbecue springâ in grateful lockdown Britain? âThere are very strange things going on in the tropics,â Prof Palmer added. âThe question is, âis it natural?â andweâre not yet sure.â,external Scientists are now planning to re-run UK climate models over recent years and remove the heating element of CO2 emissions from the mathematical puzzle. That should offer a better understanding of British weather at least. Prof Palmer admits itâs surprising this exercise wasnât done sooner. But of all the uses of extra cash for climate research, he thinks the most useful spending on climate research might be to unlock the secret of clouds â one of the most intractable climate mysteries. If warmer weather leads to more low-level clouds, that will bounce out radiation and cool the Earth. If it leads to more high-level clouds, that will trap in heat. In fact, Prof Palmer said, one recent cloud modelling exercise suggested that if weâre unlucky, global temperatures may rise by 5C after CO2 levels are doubled â a level utterly inhospitable to humans. The conclusion was previously ruled out under different analysis. âWe need to understand these processes better,â he says. âNormally in science you learn about the system under study by doing laboratory experiments. With Earthâs climate, there is no lab experiment you can do. âThe climate model is the only tool we have to understand what future is in store for humanity as a result of climate change. âSpace observations tell us what is happening now, but climate models tell us about what will happen next year, next decade, next century.â Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

Retailer Gap posts near-$1bn loss due to coronavirus,"Clothing retailer Gap has reported a loss close to $1bn due to store closures because of the coronavirus pandemic. The company was $932m (Â£740m) in the red for the three months to May, compared with a profit of $227m in the same period last year. It comes as Gap wrote off the value of the goods it holds by more than a quarter of a billion dollars. The firm's shares were down by more than 8% in after-hours trade. With net sales falling 43% in the period, Gap's chief executive Sonia Syngal said they continued to reflect âmaterial declines in May as a result of closuresâ but added that online demand was improving. Fresh plea to help save Debenhams stores in Wales Big sales expected as clothes shops plan to reopen Retail sales crash in April as lockdown hits shops Retailers of non-essential goods, especially clothing, have been hit hard by restrictions aimed to help slow the spread of Covid-19. Shops have been shut across much of the world as retailers were forced to limit their businesses to online operations. San Francisco-based Gap, which operates almost 2,800 stores in North America, said that more than half of its company-operated stores in the US have now reopened. Separately, Gap is is being sued by America's largest shopping mall operator for refusing to pay rent for stores temporarily closed during the coronavirus pandemic. Simon Property Group said in a lawsuit filed this week that the clothing retailer owes three months of rent, totalling $65.9m. Gap has more than 390 stores at Indianapolis-based Simon's malls, including its namesake brand, Old Navy and Banana Republic. Simon Property Group temporarily closed all of its properties in March after major retailers at its malls, such as Gap, Macy's and Nodstrom's, shut their stores. Large retailers, including Gap and sports shoe seller Foot Locker, have said they wouldn't pay rent for stores that were forced to close due to the pandemic. Gap did not directly mention the lawsuit during Thursday's earnings conference call but chief financial officer Katrina O'Connell said ""We're just knee-deep in landlords today."" ""It's very hard to say how long it will take, but I do know that one of our primary objectives is to use this opportunity to partner with our landlords to come up with a better profitability for the company.""

Climate computing power 'needs more cash'A top climate scientist has called for more investment in climate computing.,"The Met Office recently announced an upgrade to its existing supercomputer (pictured). But even more money for computing would be welcome, says Prof Palmer A top climate scientist has called for more investment in climate computing to explain the UKâs recent topsy turvy weather. Prof Tim Palmer from Oxford University said there were still too many unknowns in climate forecasting. And in the month the SpaceX launch grabbed headlines, he said just one of the firm's billions could transform climate modelling. Short-term weather forecasting is generally very accurate. And long-term trends in rising temperatures arenât in doubt. But Prof Palmer says many puzzles remain unsolved: take the recent weird weather in the UK, with the wettest February on record followed by the sunniest Spring. Forecasters set for 'billion pound' supercomputer May was sunniest UK month on record Meteorologists were astounded by this unprecedented weather somersault â and especially by the amazing amountthat May sunshine exceeded the previous record. This yearâs figure was 13% higher than the previous record â thatâs like the winner of the 100 metres leaving opponents over 11 metres behind. Some place the blame on climate change, but the Met Office says, as yet, thereâs no strong evidence for that. Prof Palmer told BBC News: âIt would be really valuable for us to have more knowledge of how climate change is affecting weather patterns like this. âWas climate change implicated in the recent weird weather? We donât know.â The Met Office declared February 2020 as the wettest February on record He agrees that space observations have massively improved our understanding of the climate. But he complains: âIt is very frustrating to see space get quite so much attention when we canât be sure what will happen to the climate on Earth. âIf only we couldsecure one of their billions for computer modelling that would be a big help.â,external So what do we know so far about recent British weather weirdness? Well, hereâs whatâs clear: the strong jetstream to the south-west of England through the winter locked in place the succession of Atlantic storms that drenched the UK. The Met Office successfully predicted the wet winter in its seasonal forecast, but failed to predict the sudden leap to a dry spring when the jetstream was looped over the UK, holding the sunny weather in place. In a global climate chicken-and-egg debate thereâs the question of why the jetstream behaved this way. Some scientists believe itâs being affected by conditions in the Arctic, which is warming faster than anywhere on the planet, because of greenhouse gases. But this is disputed. Prof Palmer said the jetstream appeared to be influenced by a climate phenomenon known as the Indian dipole â an irregular oscillating current in the Indian Ocean. This was also blamed for the wildfires in Australia. But whatâs influencing the Indian dipole? Or is it completely natural? Scientists know ocean currents on the other side of the world can influence our weather â but did water round the Chagos Archipelago really prompt a âbarbecue springâ in grateful lockdown Britain? âThere are very strange things going on in the tropics,â Prof Palmer added. âThe question is, âis it natural?â andweâre not yet sure.â,external Scientists are now planning to re-run UK climate models over recent years and remove the heating element of CO2 emissions from the mathematical puzzle. That should offer a better understanding of British weather at least. Prof Palmer admits itâs surprising this exercise wasnât done sooner. But of all the uses of extra cash for climate research, he thinks the most useful spending on climate research might be to unlock the secret of clouds â one of the most intractable climate mysteries. If warmer weather leads to more low-level clouds, that will bounce out radiation and cool the Earth. If it leads to more high-level clouds, that will trap in heat. In fact, Prof Palmer said, one recent cloud modelling exercise suggested that if weâre unlucky, global temperatures may rise by 5C after CO2 levels are doubled â a level utterly inhospitable to humans. The conclusion was previously ruled out under different analysis. âWe need to understand these processes better,â he says. âNormally in science you learn about the system under study by doing laboratory experiments. With Earthâs climate, there is no lab experiment you can do. âThe climate model is the only tool we have to understand what future is in store for humanity as a result of climate change. âSpace observations tell us what is happening now, but climate models tell us about what will happen next year, next decade, next century.â Follow Rogeron Twitter.,external Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Winds to continue to whip up 'chaotic' fires as sheriff warns death toll could rise Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' The 20 child abuse inquiry proposals - what has happened so far?

"BBC to broadcast Royal Opera House reopeningThe venue's first concert since lockdown will take place on 13 June, conducted by Antonio Pappano.","The Covent Garden venue has been closed since 17 March The BBC is to broadcast the Royal Opera House's first post-lockdown performance across TV and radio later this month. The concert, which will take place without a live audience, is scheduled for 13 June, hosted by the venue's director of music Antonio Pappano. It will feature a dance premiere by Wayne McGregor, resident choreographer of the Royal Ballet, as well as music by Britten, Handel and Butterworth. Radio 3 will air the show on 15 June, with TV highlights later in the month. Like all cultural venues around the UK, the Opera House closed in March, when the government banned gatherings to stop the spread of coronavirus. Since then, the venue's income has dropped by 60%, chief executive Alex Beard told the BBC. ""With no box office income and limited reserves we, like theatres and performing arts organisations across the country, face unprecedented financial stress,"" he said. ""We need all our creativity and resolve to get through this, alongside a catalysing and vital investment from Government. Together we can ensure that a generation of talent is not lost to history, and the UK's creative sector can continue to play its full role in our cultural lives."" The venue's re-opening performance will also be free to watch on YouTube and Facebook, with subsequent concerts on 20 and 27 June available to view live and on demand for Â£4.99. The BBC's coverage was announced by director general Tony Hall as part of a raft of cultural commissions. Peter Capaldi will play Ludwig van Beethoven in a new Radio 3 drama marking the 250th anniversary of the German composer's birth, while BBC Four will present a ""major new series"" about his life. A performance of his opera Fidelio, filmed at the Royal Opera House before it closed its doors, will also be broadcast. The musical family of royal wedding cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason will feature in a new BBC One film, culminating in a lockdown concert from their home; while BBC Four will profile conductor Bernard Haitink to mark his 90th birthday earlier this year. This video can not be played Growing up in a very musical family And with the summer music season on hold, a number of performances will be made available on iPlayer from opera houses that have had to shut their doors during the lockdown. Among them will be The Barber of Seville from Glyndebourne, The Turn of the Screw and The Marriage of Figaro from Garsington, and a performance of Opera North's La Traviata filmed from backstage. Lord Hall said the BBC would also expand its Culture In Quarantine programme, with ""unique projects focused on museums and galleries"" and the release of archived concerts from the BBC's vaults. Meanwhile, BBC Children's will launch a major Shakespeare project in partnership with the Royal Shakespeare Company, with readings and lessons from actors including Niamh Cusack and Jamie Wilkes on the educational website BBC Bitesize. ""While the weeks ahead may see many forms of retail opening again, culture will effectively remain in quarantine for some time,""Lord Hall said in a blog post. ""Many theatres have had to face up to the fact they are unlikely to be able to produce new work until the second half of 2021. For some the consequences will be devastating.

"Outbreak exercise showed âclear gapâ in readinessA 2018 MERS outbreak exercise in Scotland revealed concerns over protective gear, the BBC learns.UK","The exercise in 2018 revealed concerns over protective gear and contract tracing An exercise simulating a coronavirus outbreak in Scotland, which was shared with a UK government advisory group, showed a ""clear gap"" in preparedness, the BBC has learned. A report into ""Exercise Iris"" revealed frontline staff ""unease"" over personal protective equipment and ""the need for substantive progress"". The exercise simulated an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. The Scottish government says its findings were shared with attendees. Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) is a coronavirus like SARS-Cov-2 but has different characteristics. Like the novel coronavirus, MERS-CoV causes a respiratory disease and key symptoms include fever and a cough. However, transmission rates are believed to be far lower and fatality rates are much higher. Pandemic exercise findings 'must be published' UK failed to stockpile crucial protective kit Contact tracer 'paid to watch Netflix' BBC News has learned an exercise was undertaken simulating an outbreak of the disease in 2018 and requested the findings under the Freedom of Information Act in April. The Scottish Government has nowpublished a report of its findings,external. The outcomes were shared with the expert committee that advises the UK government on pandemics, the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag) in June 2019. ""Exercise Iris"" was a tabletop exercise which took place at a hotel in Stirling on 12 March 2018 and involved health boards, Health Protection Scotland, the Scottish Ambulance Service and NHS 24, the telephone advice service. Exercise discussions revealed concerns around the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) and underlined ""the need for substantive progress on PPE use within Scotland"", according to the report. ""Issues around PPE are not unique to a MERS-CoV outbreak"", it said. The report conclusions also note an ""unease"" amongst frontline staff over the lack of clarity on PPE availability, training and testing. ""This is a clear gap in Scotland's preparedness for MERS-CoV and other outbreaks and needs to be addressed as soon as possible."" The report also warns of the demands of contact tracing. One scenario in the exercise features ""escalating resource requirements for contact tracing and follow up"". As a result, health boards were asked to consider the impact of extensive contact tracing. ""It feels like a lost opportunity"", says Professor Devi Sridhar, chair of public health at Edinburgh University and a member of the Scottish Government COVID-19 Advisory Group. ""On the positive side it's good that these exercises were conducted, because it meant that they were thinking beyond flu, they were thinking about coronaviruses. ""But on the negative side it's surprising, it seems that SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) members were unaware or at least didn't discuss this exercise in their thinking in January or February, which would have been crucial in making steps to actually prepare for an eventual outbreak"". ""It's the whole purpose of these exercises, to learn from them"", she added. A report detailing the findings of an exercise simulating pandemic influenza called ""Exercise Cygnus"", which was run in England in October 2016, was also not published. PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? FACE MASKS:Should I be wearing one? RISK AT WORK:How exposed is your job? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic The report into the MERS coronavirus exercise says Public Health England held a previous exercise in 2016 ""which identified a series of actions for improvement"". At two meetings, in June and December 2018, Nervtag asked for the report into the exercise to be circulated within the group. Minutes of a meeting from June 2019, when the report was shared, say ""most of the recommendations have now been implemented or are in the process of being implemented"" by Health Protection Scotland's resilience group. The Scottish government said the report was shared with all attendees. ""The output from this exercise has been considered in line with wider work on health protection preparedness carried out through the Scottish Health Protection Network"", it said. The Department for Health and Social Care said: ""As the public would expect, we regularly test our preparedness for emergencies - allowing us to rapidly respond to this unprecedented crisis.""

Another ex-top general rebukes Trump troops threat,"Gen Martin Dempsey joins current and former defence secretaries who have spoken out against the president Another senior former military officer has denounced President Donald Trump's threat to use troops to suppress ongoing protests in the US. The ex-Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman, Gen Martin Dempsey, told National Public Radio that Mr Trump's remarks were ""very troubling"" and ""dangerous"". Mr Trump's current and former defence secretaries have also spoken out. On Monday, the president threatened to deploy the military to ""quickly solve"" the unrest if states failed to act. Mainly peaceful protests have spread across the US since the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody last month. While demonstrations over Mr Floyd's death appear to be simmering down in the nation's capital, the White House's security perimeter has expanded in recent days. Police used batons and tear gas to clear protesters from nearby Lafayette Park on Monday, and have since erected high fences around the White House. This video can not be played ""I remember George Floyd as me"" ""The idea that the president would take charge of the situation using the military was troubling to me,"" Gen Dempsey said in rare public remarks on Thursday. ""The idea that the military would be called in to dominate and to suppress what, for the most part, were peaceful protests - admittedly, where some had opportunistically turned them violent - and that the military would somehow come in and calm that situation was very dangerous to me,"" he added. China takes a victory lap over US protests 'Pandemic of racism' led to George Floyd death Five pieces of context to understand the US protests Gen Dempsey served as America's most senior military officer under former US President Barack Obama from 2011-15. His criticism comes a day after former Marine Gen Jim Mattis, Mr Trump's former defence secretary, denounced the president,saying he deliberately stoked division. James Mattis was President Donald Trump's first defence secretary - but resigned in 2018 ""Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try,"" Mr Mattis wrote in the Atlantic magazine. ""Instead, he tries to divide us."" Mr Trump hit back via Twitter at the ""overrated general"". Earlier that day, Mr Trump's current Defence Secretary Mark Esper had also spoken up. This video can not be played Rev Al Sharpton eulogy: 'Get your knee off our neck' He said the use of active-duty forces to quash unrest across the nation would be unnecessary at this stage, in remarks that are known to have displeased the White House. Mr Trump said on Monday from the White House Rose Garden that he would act to disperse violent protesters. ""If a city or a state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,"" he said. While he spoke, authorities used force to disperse a mainly peaceful protest nearby so the president could walk to a historic church that was damaged by fire in the unrest and be photographed holding up a Bible. The justice department had ordered Lafayette Square, just outside the executive mansion, to be fenced off for Mr Trump's walkabout. By Thursday afternoon, that security zone was significantly expanded, with high fencing installed around the park area known as the Ellipse just south of the White House. Also on Thursday, a moderate Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski broke ranks to say she was unsure if she would support Mr Trump's bid for re-election. In what is being seen as the most outspoken criticism yet of the president from a senator in his own party, Ms Murkowski told the Washington Post: ""I thought Gen Mattis's words were true and honest and necessary and overdue."" Lisa Murkowski backed the criticism of the president Shortly afterwards Mr Trump tweeted that he would campaign to throw the Alaska senator out of office when she is up for re-election in 2022. He later tweeted a letter written by his former lawyer John Dowd, apparently addressed to Mr Mattis, that referred to peaceful protesters in Washington as ""terrorists"". He also denounced John Kelly, his former White House Chief of staff, after the retired general also backed Mr Mattis. Meanwhile, the New York Times has said it was wrong to publish an opinion column by Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton entitled, Send in the Troops. It comes after dozens of journalists at the newspaper criticised the decision to run the piece, tweeting it put ""Black @nytimes staffers in danger"". The Times initially defended its publication of Sen Cotton's column, which called for the military to be deployed against protesters - saying thatit wanted to provide readers with a range of opinions.,external But the paper later issued a statement saying ""a rushed editorial process led to the publication of an Op-Ed that did not meet our standards"".

HOW IT HAPPENED:The last moments of his life 25 May 2020 George Floyd dies after being arrested by police outside a shop in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Footage shows a white officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Mr Floydâs neck for several minutes while he is pinned to the floor. Mr Floyd is heard repeatedly saying ""I canât breathe"". He is pronounced dead later in hospital. 26 May Four officers involved in the arrest of George Floyd are fired. Protests begin as the video of the arrest is shared widely on social media. Hundreds of demonstrators take to the streets of Minneapolis and vandalise police cars and the police station with graffiti. 27 May Protests spread to other cities including Memphis and Los Angeles. In some places, like Portland, Oregon, protesters lie in the road, chanting ""I canât breathe"". Demonstrators again gather around the police station in Minneapolis where the officers involved in George Floydâs arrest were based and set fire to it. The building is evacuated and police retreat. 28 May President Trump blames the violence on a lack of leadership in Minneapolis and threatens to send in the National Guard in a tweet. Â He follows it up in a second tweet with a warning ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". The second tweet is hidden by Twitter for ""glorifying violence"". 29 May A CNN reporter, Omar Jimenez, is arrested while covering the Minneapolis protest. Mr Jimenez was reporting live when police officers handcuffed him. A few minutes later several of his colleagues are also arrested. They are all later released once they are confirmed to be members of the media. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, is charged with murder and manslaughter. The charges carry a combined maximum 35-year sentence. 31 May Violence spreads across the US on the sixth night of protests. A total of at least five people are reported killed in protests from Indianapolis to Chicago. More than 75 cities have seen protests. At least 4,400 people have been arrested. Â Curfews are imposed across the US to try to stem the unrest. 1 June President Trump threatens to send in the military to quell growing civil unrest. He says if cities and states fail to control the protests and ""defend their residents"" he will deploy the army and ""quickly solve the problem for them"". Mr Trump poses in front of a damaged church shortly after police used tear gas to disperse peaceful protesters nearby. 2 June Tens of thousands of protesters again take to the streets. One of the biggest protests is in George Floydâs hometown of Houston, Texas. Many defy curfews in several cities, but the demonstrations are largely peaceful. 4 June A memorial service for George Floyd is held in Minneapolis. Â Those gathered in tribute stand in silence for eight minutes, 46 seconds, the amount of time Mr Floyd is alleged to have been on the ground under arrest. Hundreds attended the service, which heard a eulogy from civil rights activist Rev Al Sharpton. 7 June As the US saw another weekend of protests, with tens of thousands marching in Washington DC, anti-racism demonstrations were held around the world. In Australia, there were major protests in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane that focused on the treatment of indigenous Australians. There were also demonstrations in France, Germany, Spain and the UK. In Bristol, protesters tore down the statue of a 17th century slave trader and threw it into the harbour. 9 June A funeral service for George Floyd is held in Houston, Mr Floydâs home town. Just over two weeks after his death in Minneapolis and worldwide anti-racism protests, about 500 guests invited by the Floyd family are in attendance at the Fountain of Praise Church. Â Many more gather outside to show their support.

China takes a victory lap over US protests,"Demonstrators outside of the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC The US mass protests are raising eyebrows around the world, but China is watching with particular interest. As anti-racism protests sweep across the US, Beijing has seized upon them to hit back at Washington for supporting last year's Hong Kong pro-democracy demonstrations. Chinese state media have given extensive coverage to the protests, highlighting the chaotic scenes and alleged police brutality in America to claim that China enjoys greater social stability. Speaking to an international audience, Chinese diplomats are attempting to portray Beijing as a responsible global leader, standing in solidarity with other countries in condemning the racial disparity and injustice in the US. China's state news agency Xinhua described the US civil unrest as ""Pelosi's beautiful landscape"" - a reference to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's comment last summer that the Hong Kong protests were ""a beautiful sight to behold"". State media Global Times' chief editor Hu Xijin wrote that American politicians now can ""enjoy this sight from their own windows"". Beijing has long condemned American politicians, including Ms Pelosi, for ""glorifying violence"" coming from the Hong Kong demonstrators, who are categorised by China as ""rioters showing signs of terrorism"". Protests paralysed Hong Kong for most of last year, prompting Beijing to impose a new national security law in the territory in May, only two weeks ahead of the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown. Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words The background you need on Hong Kong's protests Hong Kong's year in seven intense emotions Aynne Kokas, senior faculty fellow with the University of Virginia's Miller Center for Public Affairs, says that both the US and China are contending with a high level of domestic instability triggered by the global coronavirus pandemic and political events. Tens of thousands marched in Hong Kong in Janaury ""Now is a key moment through which China is able to leverage the lack of stability in the US, in order to more efficiently promote its own national security goals,"" she says. Chinese and Hong Kong officials have also called out the US for applying ""double standards"" in its response to civil unrest. Tens of thousands defy ban to mark Tiananmen in HK ""You know there are riots in the United States and we see how local governments reacted,"" said Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam. ""And then in Hong Kong, when we had similar riots, we saw what position they adopted then."" The officials' view is shared by many Chinese social media users, who dub America ""the double standard nation"". Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam Allegations of excessive use of police force during the US protests have been put under the spotlight by Chinese state media, to delegitimise Washington's position on upholding freedom and democracy. In one example, state broadcaster China Central Television reported on American journalists being pepper sprayed and a freelance photographer partially blinded by a rubber bullet while covering the protests. Chinese 'democracy tourists' see Iowa up close The year China got louder on social media An invisible battle between China and US How Hong Kong-China tensions spread to US Georgia State University Global Communication Assistant Professor Maria Repnikova says that the scale and intensity of Chinese state media coverage on the US protests is unprecedented. ""It's powerful, because they are not making it up,"" Prof Repnikova says, but she points out that Chinese state media have cherry-picked the more peaceful pictures of Hong Kong police and the most violent ones from the US. Journalists from across the US have reported being targeted by police at protests China itself has been heavily criticised for cracking down on press freedom, which is rarely mentioned by the government and state media. On Weibo, many see America's freedoms and democracy as at risk, as police fired tear gas at peaceful protesters and military was deployed to quell the protests. Ms Kokas says: ""Chinese state media don't have to craft a narrative, they can just talk about the objective events that have happen in Washington DC, that undermines the very principle of freedom of speech and freedom of assembly."" The US's rhetoric about the democratic rights of Hong Kong now seems ""very hollow""ï¼she adds, ""when military helicopters are flying over [Washington] DC"". The increasingly outspoken Chinese diplomats have seized the chance to spotlight the US's governing failure and promote Beijing as a more responsible global leader. Ms Kokas describes this as a continuation of the country's propaganda strategy on the Covid-19 pandemic - when America fails, China is here to help. Chinese diplomats on Twitter retweeted messages of UN and African Union officials, condemning racial discrimination and police brutality in the US. The Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying tweeted ""I can't breathe"", with a screencap of the US state department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus' previous criticism over Beijing's handling in Hong Kong. But another of Hua's messages denouncing anti-black racism backfired on Twitter, as she included ""all lives matter"", a phrase often used to undermine the ""black lives matter"" movement. Meanwhile, there are reports that African residents in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou have been discriminated against and forced into quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic. Beijing has not officially apologised for any mishandling, only stating that there were some ""misunderstandings"". One Weibo user expresses ""disappointment"", as the person sees ""some Chinese criticise others for racial discrimination, but when it comes to their own anti-black racism, they take it for granted"". China is also accused of detaining hundreds of thousands of Uighurs and other Muslim minorities in high-security prison camps in its far western Xinjiang region. There's no doubt  US protests have sparked heated discussion on Weibo - the topic is one of the most popular on the site this week. Related posts have earned more than 25 billion views. Many Weibo posts ""congratulate"" the US for the civil unrest and push back at its support for the Hong Kong demonstrations. One user writes: ""The US government has been inflaming violence around the world, now the American people have finally woken up. The US government deserves this!"" And Beijing and its state media spread the theory that Washington was fomenting the protests in Hong Kong, calling it a ""black hand"" behind the unrest. As US-China relations have soured due to the Hong Kong protests, trade conflicts and the pandemic, anti-America sentiment appears to be on the rise in China. Thousands of Weibo comments describe the US protests as ""karma"" for Washington. But some Chinese seem genuinely saddened by the situation. ""This is trampling on human rights! Democracy in the US came to an end at this exact moment,"" a Weibo user commented under a video showing the CNN reporter getting arrested, receiving thousands of likes. 'Unacceptable' attacks on reporters at Floyd protests Many on Weibo also voice support for the civil rights movement. ""Nothing much has changed after generations of fights. I hope this time will yield better results,"" a comment reads. Some Chinese also reflect on the weaknesses of their country. One Weibo user writes about being ""envious of the freedom of expression"" in the US, as anti-government protests are often forcefully cracked down in China. Some posts urge the state media to cover China's domestic police violence and injustice with the same level of dedication. But liberal voices are often met with harsh criticism. State-affiliated yet liberal leaning newspaper Beijing News published a commentary advocating for empathy and respect for the American people, but it was quickly slammed as taking a ""pro-America"" stance and received tens of thousands of negative comments on Weibo. Social media has always been an imperfect window to observe China's public opinion. Its echo chamber effect is exacerbated by the country's information censorship. Prof Repnikova says that the relatively liberal views may become even more marginalised on Chinese social media, as cyber nationalism, a combination of bottom-up sentiments and top-down propaganda tactic, is increasingly dominant on the sites. ""The more aggressive, nationalistic and vocal voices are taking over the space,"" she says.

"Madeleine McCann assumed dead - German prosecutorsA German man, 43, is being investigated on suspicion of murder over the British girlâs disappearance.UK","Madeleine McCann was three years old when she went missing in 2007 Madeleine McCann is ""assumed"" to be dead, say German prosecutors, who are investigating the disappearance of the British girl in 2007. A 43-year-old German man is being investigated on suspicion of murder, the public prosecutor added. The suspect, who has been named in German media as Christian B, is currently serving a prison sentence. He is believed to have been in the area where Madeleine, aged three, was last seen while on holiday in Portugal. The UK's Metropolitan Police said it had received more than 270 calls and emails since a new appeal for information was launched on Wednesday. Hans Christian Wolters, from the Braunschweig Public Prosecutor's Office in Germany, said in an update on Thursday: ""We are assuming that the girl is dead. ""With the suspect, we are talking about a sexual predator who has already been convicted of crimes against little girls and he's already serving a long sentence."" He said the suspect was regularly living in the Algarve between 1995 and 2007 and had jobs in the area, including in catering, but also committed burglaries in hotels and dealt drugs. The Madeleine McCann case: A timeline Madeleine McCann: False turns and a final breakthrough? In pictures: The search for Madeleine McCann More funds pledged for Madeleine McCann search The McCann family's spokesman said Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry, felt the new development was ""potentially very significant"". Clarence Mitchell, who has represented the family since Madeleine went missing, said that in 13 years he couldn't ""recall an instance when the police had been so specific about an individual. ""Of all the thousands of leads and potential suspects that have been mentioned in the past, there has never been something as clear cut as that from not just one, but three police forces"", he said. The Met Police, who are working with their German and Portuguese counterparts, said the case remained a ""missing persons"" investigation in the UK because it does not have ""definitive evidence"" as to whether Madeleine is alive or not. The man is linked to a house between Praia da Luz and Lagos, and another inland Police released pictures showing the interior of one house believed to be linked to the suspect The suspect has been described as white with short blond hair, and about 6ft (1.8m) tall with a slim build at the time. Police have also released photos of two vehicles - a VW camper van and a Jaguar car - which are believed to be linked to the man, as well as a house in Portugal. The day after Madeleine vanished in 2007, the suspect transferred the Jaguar to someone else's name. New suspect identified in Madeleine McCann case Madeleine went missing shortly before her fourth birthday from an apartment in Praia da Luz on the evening of 3 May 2007 while her parents were with friends at a nearby tapas bar. Her disappearance sparked a huge and costly police hunt across much of Europe - the most recent Metropolitan Police investigation, which began in 2011, has cost more than Â£11m. Det Ch Insp Mark Cranwell, who is in charge of the Met investigation - known as Operation Grange - said the suspect, then aged 30, frequented the Algarve between 1995 and 2007, staying for ""days upon end"" in his camper van and living a ""transient lifestyle"". He was in the Praia da Luz area where the McCann family was staying when she disappeared and received a phone call at 19:32, which ended at 20:02. Madeleine is believed to have disappeared between 21:10 and 22:00 that evening. Police have released details of the suspect's phone number (+351 912 730 680) and the number which dialled him (+351 916 510 683), and said any information about these numbers could be ""critical"". Det Ch Insp Cranwell said the caller was a ""key witness"" and should get in touch, while he also appealed to the public for details about the suspect. The Ocean Club in Praia da Luz where the McCann family were staying A camper van belonging to the suspect was seen around Praia da Luz in Portugal The suspect transferred the registration of this 1993 Jaguar XJR6 to someone else the day after Madeleine disappeared The joint appeal from the British, German and Portuguese police includes a Â£20,000 reward for information leading to the conviction of the person responsible for Madeleine's disappearance. Those with information can contact the Operation Grange incident room on 020 7321 9251. Det Ch Insp Cranwell said he wanted to thank members of the public who had already got in touch. ""We are pleased with the information coming in, and it will be assessed and prioritised,"" he said. ""We continue to urge anyone with information to come forward and speak with us."" Jim Gamble, who served as the senior child protection officer in the UK's first police investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, said it was the first time in 13 years ""when I actually dare to hope"". The ""circumstantial evidence"" that had been shared by the police made the new suspect a ""really significant person of interest"", he said. He said he believed the man ""came to light a number of years ago"" but was only being made public now because it was a ""painstaking"" process which began from ""a point of chaos"" after the initial investigation had been ""bungled"". Is this the breakthrough? Is this German prisoner the man who can unlock the mystery? It certainly has the feel of a significant development - police have used those very words. Evidence, according to detectives, places the man near the scene; the re-registering of his car the next day is undoubtedly suspicious. And his criminal record, disclosed by the German police, is a disturbing guide as to what his motivations might have been. But... there have been so many false trails in the case before - clues, sightings and suspects that led nowhere. Three years ago, during the last major police appeal, Scotland Yard said it was working on one final ""critical"" line of inquiry. Now, we're told there's another one. That may explain why Met detectives - who've been involved in the case for nine years - are being rather more cautious than their German counterparts. In a statement, the McCanns, from Rothley in Leicestershire, welcomed the appeal: ""We would like to thank the police forces involved for their continued efforts in the search for Madeleine. ""All we have ever wanted is to find her, uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice. ""We will never give up hope of finding Madeleine alive, but whatever the outcome may be, we need to know as we need to find peace."" A Downing Street spokesman said the latest developments appeared to be significant and No 10's thoughts were with the McCann family ""who have had to endure so much"". Police said the suspect was one of 600 people that detectives on the UK inquiry originally looked at, though he had not been a suspect. After a 10-year anniversary appeal in 2017, ""significant"" fresh information about him was provided. 3 May 2007:Alarm is raised after Madeleine is found to be missing September 2007: Kate and Gerry McCann are made ""arguidos"" - formal suspects - in their daughter's disappearance July 2008: Portuguese police halt their investigation and lift the ""arguido"" status of the McCanns and another man, Robert Murat May 2011:Prime Minister David Cameron asks the Metropolitan Policeto help investigate.

Retailer Gap posts near-Â£1bn loss due to coronavirusStores around the world have been forced to shut their doors due to the virus pandemic.Business,"Clothing retailer Gap has reported a loss close to $1bn due to store closures because of the coronavirus pandemic. The company was $932m (Â£740m) in the red for the three months to May, compared with a profit of $227m in the same period last year. It comes as Gap wrote off the value of the goods it holds by more than a quarter of a billion dollars. The firm's shares were down by more than 8% in after-hours trade. With net sales falling 43% in the period, Gap's chief executive Sonia Syngal said they continued to reflect âmaterial declines in May as a result of closuresâ but added that online demand was improving. Fresh plea to help save Debenhams stores in Wales Big sales expected as clothes shops plan to reopen Retail sales crash in April as lockdown hits shops Retailers of non-essential goods, especially clothing, have been hit hard by restrictions aimed to help slow the spread of Covid-19. Shops have been shut across much of the world as retailers were forced to limit their businesses to online operations. San Francisco-based Gap, which operates almost 2,800 stores in North America, said that more than half of its company-operated stores in the US have now reopened. Separately, Gap is is being sued by America's largest shopping mall operator for refusing to pay rent for stores temporarily closed during the coronavirus pandemic. Simon Property Group said in a lawsuit filed this week that the clothing retailer owes three months of rent, totalling $65.9m. Gap has more than 390 stores at Indianapolis-based Simon's malls, including its namesake brand, Old Navy and Banana Republic. Simon Property Group temporarily closed all of its properties in March after major retailers at its malls, such as Gap, Macy's and Nodstrom's, shut their stores. Large retailers, including Gap and sports shoe seller Foot Locker, have said they wouldn't pay rent for stores that were forced to close due to the pandemic. Gap did not directly mention the lawsuit during Thursday's earnings conference call but chief financial officer Katrina O'Connell said ""We're just knee-deep in landlords today."" ""It's very hard to say how long it will take, but I do know that one of our primary objectives is to use this opportunity to partner with our landlords to come up with a better profitability for the company.""
