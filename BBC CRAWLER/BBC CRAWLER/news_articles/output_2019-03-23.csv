Unprecedented images of baby heart in womb,"This video can not be played Watch how the foetus jumps around the inside the womb in MRI scan footage Researchers have produced unprecedented images of a baby's heart while it is still inside the womb. Pregnant women were scanned in an MRI machine and powerful computers built 3D models of the tiny beating hearts inside their unborn children. The team at King's College London and Guy's and St Thomas's says it will improve the care of babies with congenital heart disease. The researchers say their approach could easily be adopted by hospitals. Kirbi-Lea and Violet-Vienna Pettitt, now 11 months old Violet-Vienna developed life-threatening abnormalities in the blood vessels around her heart while she was still inside her mother. Problems were first detected when Kirbi-Lea Pettitt went for a routine ultrasound scan 20 weeks into her pregnancy. She then took part in the study to look at her baby's heart in vivid detail. It showed a narrowing of the main artery coming from the heart - the aorta - which would block the blood vessel after birth. Her daughter also had two holes in her heart. ""It was very scary, I was just shell-shocked really,"" Kirbi-Lea told the BBC. But it allowed doctors to plan how to save Violet-Vienna's life after she arrived in the world. ""I wasn't allowed to hold her, they had to take her straight away to put her on medication to keep her aorta open,"" said Kirbi-Lea. Her baby had heart surgery a week later, but after a tricky start is now a healthy 11-month-old. Kirbi-Lea said: ""She's doted on by everyone and she's just thriving - and it's all down to these specialists and this technology. ""It's amazing what they do, it's lifesaving."" BBC correspondent James Gallagher holds a 3D printed model of a baby's heart in the palm of his hand A series of 2D pictures of the heart are taken from different angles using an MRI machine. But the foetal heart is tiny, beats incredibly quickly, and the baby moves around inside the womb so the images of the heart look like a fuzzy blur. But then comes the really clever bit. Sophisticated computer software pieces the images together, adjusts for the beating of the heart and then builds an unprecedented 3D image of the heart. It gives doctors a clear view of the abnormality. This video can not be played See the 3D image of a foetal heart Congenital heart diseases affect up to eight in every 1,000 babies born in the UK. They can be caused by infections and some medicines, and can run in families. NHS: Congenital heart diseases,external Prof Reza Razavi, consultant paediatric cardiologist, wanted to improve the diagnosis of the birth defects after his daughter was born with one. ""We thought we were going to lose her, that was a strong motivator... we should be able to pick up the problem in the womb."" Prof Reza Razavi nearly lost his daughter to congenital heart disease. He describes the 3D images as ""beautiful"" and says they let doctors clearly see the problem and improve care. He told the BBC: ""We can have complete certainty and plan ahead what treatment is needed, what's the operation we need to do. ""It really helps the parents to have the right support to know what's going to happen. ""But it also really helps the babies because they get the right operation at the right time and have the best outcomes."" The study,published in the Lancet,external, shows the 3D imaging worked in 85 pregnant women, but has now been tested on more than 200 patients. Dr David Lloyd, a clinical research fellow at King's College London, said: ""Our hope is this approach will now become standard practice for the Evelina foetal cardiology team, who make a prenatal diagnosis in 400 babies each year. ""This will also improve the care of over 150 babies each year who deliver at St Thomas's Hospital with known congenital heart disease."" He says the technology would be easy to adopt if a hospital already has an MRI machine, because the only new equipment needed would be a computer with a decent graphics card. Pregnant woman having a routine ultrasound scan The research is part of theiFind project,externalto increase the number of health problems picked up during standard pregnancy scans. If they are diagnosed only after birth then vital time can be lost in trying to make a diagnosis. Another approach is to use four ultrasound probes at the same time - current scans use one - to get a more detailed picture.

Eitan commanded an eight-man team who flew to Argentina in 1960 and spirited Eichmann back to Israel to stand trial. He is seen as one of the fathers of Israel's intelligence services. Eichmann was one of the principal architects of the Holocaust, Nazi Germany's systematic extermination of six million Jewish people. He was found guilty and hanged in 1962. 'I prosecuted an architect of the Holocaust' Israel releases Eichmann plea papers Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Eitan ""one of the heroes of Israeli intelligence"" and said he was a ""close personal friend"". Israeli President Reuven Rivlin described him as ""a born fighter who stuck to his mission and to what he knew to be right"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He was injured fighting in Israel's war of independence in 1948. After his release from the army, he joined the domestic intelligence service Shin Bet where he thrived and was named head of central operations for Shin Bet and Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence service. Mossad was tipped off by a West German prosecutor that Adolf Eichmann was alive and hiding in Argentina. Adolf Eichmann stood trial in Israel for his role in the Holocaust Speaking to the BBC in 2011, Eitan described Eichmann as ""completely average""and laughed off his own hero status, describing himself as only ""half of James Bond"". In the 1980s however Eitan was revealed as the handler of Jonathan Pollard, a US analyst who gave thousands of top secret documents to Israel. The FBI issued an arrest warrant for Eitan after Pollard was exposed. Pollard spent 30 years in prison after his capture in 1985. Between 2006 and 2009, Eitan served in parliament for the centrist Gil Party, becoming minister for pensioner affairs. He died at Ichilov Hospital in Tel Aviv on Saturday.

Death threats for petition creator,"The petition had reached nearly 4.3 million signature by lunchtime on Saturday The woman who started the record-breaking anti-Brexit petition says she is ""shaking like a leaf"" after receiving three death threats by phone. Margaret Georgiadou, 77, began the Revoke Article 50 petition, which had topped four million signatures by Saturday morning. She said she was ""totally amazed"" it had become the most popular petition submitted to the Parliament website. But Mrs Georgiadou said the ""horrible"" phone calls left her scared and angry. The retired lecturer says she has also received abuse via her Facebook account. She said: ""I feel terrible, I feel angry with myself because I thought I was tougher than that. But I was scared."" ""I haven't even told my husband because he is very old and he would become hysterical."" Mrs Georgiadou said she created the petition to stop people ""moaning"" about how awful they thought Brexit was going to be. It has broken the record for the biggest petition on the Parliament's website, previously held by another Brexit-related petition from 2016. Allow Twitter content?

Mrs Georgiadou said she wanted to get as many people as possible to sign it - but she wasn't hoping for a government response. ""Democracy is ruled by society for society, not the majority for the majority,"" she said. ""I want it to prove it is no longer the will of the people. It was three years ago but the government has become infamous for changing their mind - so why can't the people? ""People should ask themselves, who is it that wants Brexit? It will help Putin, it will help Trumpâ¦ but will it help us? I doubt it,"" she continued.

Why bots probably aren't gaming the 'Cancel Brexit' petition Since the success of her petition, Mrs Georgiadou has faced criticism over posts she allegedly made on social media, using threatening language about the prime minister. She said she had no memory of the posts. She said:  ""It must have been a cut and paste job. The dates were all wrong."" ""My friends thought it was funny. They have made photos of me trying to hold up a rifle with my zimmer-frame... I don't own a zimmer-frame by the way - or a rifle.""

Man walks 200 miles to protest,"Members of Swansea 4 Europe bade farewell to Ed Sides (left) as his walk began on 6 March A man has walked 200 miles to join a march in London in favour of another EU referendum, engaging with Brexit supporters along the way. Ed Sides set off from Swansea two and a half weeks ago and has ""taken time to listen as much as talk"". Wales for Europe had booked out 30 coaches to transport protesters toSaturday's demonstration. But one Leave supporter said a fresh vote would just prolong the arguments for another three years. Others from across Wales made their own way to Hyde Park for the march. Ed Sides and his wife Rhiannon Barrar in Hyde Park following their arrival in London Mr Sides, who was joined by his wife Rhiannon Barrar for part of the journey, set out on foot from Swansea on 6 March. ""I set out on the walk to raise attention to our cause, but also to prove that just because you're passionate about something it doesn't mean you have to rubbish opposing opinions,"" he said. ""We need a kinder, more rational debate about Brexit, and everywhere I've stopped I've taken the time to listen as much as talk."" Hundreds of campaigners from Wales attended the march Welsh Government ministers Vaughan Gething and Eluned Morgan were among the many politicians joining the march in London. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but that date has now been put back to 12 April, as MPs try to find a way forward. Prime Minister Theresa May's exit deal, negotiated with the EU over two years hasbeen voted down twice in parliament, once by a record margin. MPs are now divided on what direction to take next - some want to leavewithout a deal, others want tonot leave at all, and some want another referendum. Tens of thousands on Brexit referendum march May 'hopes' UK will leave EU with a deal Brexit: What could happen next? In the 2016 referendum, Wales voted 52.5% to 47.5% in favour of leave, a slightly higher margin than the UK as a whole at 51.9% to 48.1%. But Peter Gilbey, director of the anti-Brexit campaign group Wales for Europe, believed the mood had shifted over the past three years. ""Those who were ardent Remainers are probably more so now, and likewise with Leavers, but equally those who were uncertain in 2016 are even more confused than ever,"" he said. ""The argument that a second referendum would be a betrayal of the people makes no sense; how can more information and more democracy equal less democracy?"" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button However, retired Swansea builder Fred Jones, who voted Leave, told BBC Wales he found arguments espoused by some Remainers patronising. ""I wouldn't say that I'm passionate one way or the other, but I am fed up of being told I voted Leave because I am in my nineties, or because I'm stupid and didn't know what I was voting for,"" he said. ""I knew full well that leaving was going to cause upheaval and hardship in the short term, but would eventually allow Britain to decide for ourselves what sort of country we want to be. ""But the main reason why I don't believe in another referendum is that it will solve nothing - we'll be having the same arguments in three years' time."" Organisers claim more than a million people took part in the March in London on Saturday Million joined Brexit protest, organisers say What happens now that a deal's been done?

Vote on PM's deal may not happen,"Theresa May has told MPs there might not be a third vote on her Brexit deal next week if there is insufficient support for it to pass. If it does not pass, the EU has set a deadline of 12 April for the UK to propose a new plan. Supporters of another EU referendum are due to march through central London later. Labour's Tom Watson will speak at the event, pledging to back May's deal if she agrees to hold a referendum on it. Meanwhile, an online petition calling for the UK to remain in the EU has attracted a record number of signatures. By 11:32 GMT, the total number of signatures calling for Article 50 to be revoked stood at 4,151,815 - beating the previous record reached by another Brexit-related petition in 2016. If Mrs May's deal is approved by MPs next week, the EU has agreed to extend the Brexit deadline until 22 May. If it is not - and no alternative plan is put forward - the UK is set to leave the EU on 12 April. In a letter to all MPs on Friday evening,Mrs May offered to talk to MPs over the coming days ""as Parliament prepares to take momentous decisions"". She said there were now four ""clear choices"". These were: Approving her deal next week - which relies on Commons Speaker John Bercow allowing her to put it to MPs to vote on again,which he has ruled will not be allowed unless ""substantial"" changes are made to it Asking for another extension before 12 April - which would mean the UK would have to take part in elections for the European Parliament Revoking Article 50 - cancelling Brexit - which Mrs May said would ""betray the result of the referendum"" Leaving with no deal Children's minister Nadhim Zahawi told the Today programme failing to support Mrs May's deal would lead to a ""meltdown in our politics, not just for the Conservative party but for all parties"". He said all the other alternatives would require MPs asking for a much longer extension, which Mrs May has said she is not prepared for. Ministers 'divided' on Brexit votes process Brexit's fate in British hands, says Tusk Brexit: What just happened? Why bots probably aren't gaming the 'Cancel Brexit' petition Indicating he would stand down if Mrs May's deal is not voted for, Mr Zahawi said he ""cannot justify"" going to his constituents and saying: ""We failed to deliver this and that now we are having to stay in the EU and go into European elections."" Mrs May also confirmed in her letter that the government would change the law to officially change the UK's departure date from the EU next week. Theresa May said asking for an extension was a matter ""of great personal regret"" Her letter came after the DUP - whose support will be crucial if the government is to win - indicated they still would not back her deal. Mrs May also referred to her televised address on Wednesday, in whichshe blamed the delay to Brexit on MPs. She acknowledged that ""a number of colleagues had raised concerns"" about her words and said it had not been her intention to make their ""difficult job... any more difficult"". Former Tory chief whip Andrew Mitchell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme ""there was a very strong feeling she'd made an error of judgement"" on this. This video can not be played Theresa May's televised address, blaming MPs for a delay, caused anger in Westminster But dismissing reports of growing pressure on Mrs May to quit, he said: ""To change prime minister would be a colossal error - it won't change the numbers [in the vote for Mrs May's deal]"". By Jonathan Blake, political correspondent Theresa May's admission that there may not be a third vote on her deal after all will focus minds on what an alternative plan might be. To avoid asking the EU for a longer extension and holding European parliament elections, the prime minister will need a new course of action. A series ofindicative votesin Parliament looks the most likely way to decide that - but there is no agreement on whether the government should lead that process or relinquish control to Parliament. And when and if a consensus in Parliament emerges, there is no guarantee it will automatically become government policy. It has taken two years for the government to formulate, negotiate and attempt to get a Brexit deal through Parliament. Finding an alternative which ministers, MPs and the EU are happy to embrace within the next two weeks will be a very tough task indeed. Meanwhile, campaigners say they expect hundreds of thousands of people to march through central London as part of the 'Put It To The People' demonstration. Speakers at a rally afterwards will include Labour's deputy leader, Tom Watson, Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, London Mayor Sadiq Khan and others. Mr Watson will say: ""I've come to the reluctant view that the only way to resolve this and have legitimacy in the eyes of the public is for the people themselves to sign it off."" James McGrory, the Director of the People's Vote campaign, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Politicians are unable to agree on a way forward so it seems to the People's Vote campaign that the only way forward it to put any Brexit deal - whether it's the government's deal or any alternative form of Brexit - put it to the people."" Ms Sturgeon said now was ""the moment of maximum opportunity""to avoid a no-deal Brexit. A petition on Parliament's website calling for Brexit to be cancelled by revoking Article 50 has attracted more than four million signatures. Lib Dem MP Layla Moran said the petition could ""give oxygen"" to the campaign for another Brexit referendum. Speaking in Brussels on Friday after the European Council agreed to delay the Brexit date, Mr Tusk said that until 12 April, ""anything is possible"" including a much longer delay or cancelling Brexit altogether. ""The fate of Brexit is in the hands of our British friends. As the EU, we are prepared for the worst, but hope for the best. As you know, hope dies last."" European Council President Donald Tusk, left, with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker According to thefinal summit conclusions,external, the UK is expected to ""indicate a way forward"" before 12 April, if MPs do not approve the withdrawal deal negotiated with the EU, which would then be considered by the European Council. The UK must decide by then whether it will take part in European Parliamentary elections from 23-26 May - if it does not, then a long delay would become ""impossible"", Mr Tusk said. Mrs May will need to table secondary legislation to remove the date March 29 from Brexit laws. 29 March:Current Brexit date in UK law 12 April:If MPs do not approve the withdrawal deal next week - ""all options will remain open"" until this date. The UK must propose a way forward before this date for consideration by EU leaders 22 May:If MPs do approve the deal next week, Brexit will be delayed until this date 23-26 May:European Parliamentary elections are held across member states EU leaders agree Brexit delay plan EU agrees Brexit breathing space for UK Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures Million year-old bubbles could solve ice age mystery 'Where do I go?'

Fall of Islamic State 'caliphate' announced,"This video can not be played Kurdish TV showed the SDF raising a yellow flag on top of buildings seized from IS in Baghuz The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) says the Islamic State group's five-year ""caliphate"" is over after the militants' defeat in Syria. SDF fighters have been raising victory flags in Baghuz, the last stronghold of the jihadist group. US President Donald Trump praised the ""liberation"" of Syria, but added: ""We will remain vigilant against [IS]."" The jihadists retain a presence in the region and are active in countries from Nigeria to the Philippines. After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Islamic State women defiant in face of lost caliphate Tales from inside the chaos left by IS At its height, IS controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of land stretching across Syria and Iraq. After five years of fierce battles, though, local forces backed by world powers left IS with all but a few hundred square metres near Syria's border with Iraq. On Saturday, the White House released a statement in which President Trump described IS's loss of territory as ""evidence of its false narrative"", adding: ""They have lost all prestige and power."" The SDF alliance began its final assault on IS at the start of March, with the remaining militants holed up in the village of Baghuz in eastern Syria. The alliance was forced to slow its offensive after it emerged that a large number of civilians were also there, sheltering in buildings, tents and tunnels. Thousands of women and children, foreign nationals among them, fled the fighting and severe shortages to make their way to SDF-run camps for displaced persons. Many IS fighters have also abandoned Baghuz, but those who stayed put up fierce resistance, deploying suicide bombers and car bombs. ""Syrian Democratic Forces declare total elimination of so-called caliphate,externaland 100% territorial defeat of Isis [the IS group],"" Mustafa Bali, the head of the SDF media office, tweeted on Saturday. This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? Confirming the victory, SDF General Mazloum Kobani said the forces would continue operations against IS sleeper cells, which he said were ""a great threat to our region and the whole world"". He called on the Syrian government, which has vowed to retake all of the country, to recognise autonomous areas under SDF control. The US envoy to the coalition to defeat IS, William Roebuck, said the news was a ""critical milestone"", but added that IS remains a threat ""in the region, to the United States and our allies"". This video can not be played IS 'remains a threat', US envoy warns French President Emmanuel Macron welcomed the SDF's announcement, saying a ""major danger for our country has been eliminated"". UK Prime Minister Theresa May also welcomed the news and vowed to do ""what is necessary"" to protect British people and others from the threat of IS. IS grew out of al-Qaeda in Iraq in the aftermath of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. It joined the rebellion against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2011. By 2014 it had seized swathes of land in both countries and proclaimed a ""caliphate"". IS once imposed its rule on almost eight million people, and generated billions of dollars from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping, using its territory as a platform to launch foreign attacks. The rise and fall of Islamic State Why is there a war in Syria? The fall of Baghuz is a major moment in the campaign against IS. The Iraqi government declared victory against the militants in 2017. But the group is far from defeated. US officials believe IS may have 15,000 to 20,000 armed adherents active in the region, many of them in sleeper cells, and that it will return to its insurgent roots while attempting to rebuild. Even as its defeat in Baghuz was imminent, IS released a defiant audio recording purportedly from its spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir, asserting that the caliphate was not finished. The location of the group's overall leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is not known. But he has avoided being captured or killed, despite having fewer places to hide.

"UVF flooding Belfast with drugs, court told","The PSNI's paramilitary crime taskforce carried out 14 searches on Friday Three men have been remanded in custody after being arrested during police raids targeting loyalist paramilitaries in east Belfast. Darren Baine, 29, and Mark Rainey, 39, both from Belfast, and County Down man Andrew Crawford, 27, are accused of supplying cocaine. They appeared at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Saturday. The court heard the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) has been ""flooding the streets of Belfast"" with drugs. The detective sergeant from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said that Mr Baine, of Cheviot Avenue, was part of a drug-dealing network and a criminal gang linked to the east Belfast UVF. The officer told the judge that the defendant played a key role in the drug-dealing operation. A defence solicitor applied for bail for Mr Baine, saying that others with a ""more serious role"", including ""a top player"", had already been released on police bail. When asked by the judge about his client's occupation, the solicitor said that Mr Baine did not work or receive benefits but has ""a small amount of savings"". The judge refused bail because of a ""real risk"" of more offences being committed. The solicitor said that Mr Baine would go to the High Court next week to apply for bail. The court heard that suspected cocaine with a street value of Â£15,000, as well as UVF flags, were found in the home of Andrew Crawford, of Cairndore Grange in Newtownards. The police officer said the alleged drug-dealing operation is linked to the east Belfast UVF, which, he added, ""consistently uses violence"". Police seized drugs and vehicles during the raids in Belfast, Newtownards and Comber Applying for bail, a defence solicitor told the court that the case against Mr Crawford was a ""scary experience for him"" and that he ""is worried about his job"". The police officer opposed bail because of ""the seriousness and gravity"" of the ""overwhelming"" case against Mr Crawford. The judge refused bail, citing the ""significant amount"" of cocaine allegedly found in the defendant's home. Mr Rainey, of St Patrick's Walk, did not apply for bail and will appear in court again by videolink next week. A 22-year-old man who also appeared in court accused of drugs offences was released on bail. The judge ruled that the case against him was a ""standalone"" case and separate from the other three. The four men were among nine who were charged after a operation on Friday by the PSNI's paramilitary crime taskforce. Eleven men were arrested after raids at 14 propertiesin Belfast, Newtownards and Comber in County Down. Class A drugs and ""high value"" cars were seized in the searches. Four men, aged 32, 47 and two 48 year olds, will appear at Belfast Magistrates' Court on 18 April, charged with being concerned in the supply of a class A drug. A 34-year-old man faces a charge of unlawfully obtaining and disclosing personal data. Another man, aged 32, who was arrested on suspicion of possession of a class A drug with intent to supply has been released on bail pending further inquiries. A 40-year-old man arrested on suspicion of possession of a class B drug, intimidation and improper use of electronic communications has been released to be reported to prosecutors. The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.

Celtic Boys Club abuser refused appeal,"Jim Torbett will now serve his six-year sentence Celtic Boys Club founder Jim Torbett has been refused leave to appeal his conviction for sexually abusing young players, the BBC has learned. The 71-year-old, from Kelvindale, Glasgow, was found guilty last year of five abuse charges between 1986 and 1994. His conviction followeda BBC investigation into his crimes against children. The judiciary office in Edinburgh has confirmed the appeal has been refused. Torbett's victims welcomed the news. Kenny Campbell was abused by Torbett during the 1980s while he played for Celtic Boys Club and Celtic FC and was a key witness in the trial. He told the BBC: ""I've had a knot in my stomach these past weeks worrying about this appeal, worrying that somehow that he could somehow have wriggled off this. ""But when I heard leave to appeal had been refused, it was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. He'll have to do his time now. ""Maybe one day he'll be man enough to admit what he's done."" Kenny Campbell waived his right to anonymity How Torbett used football as cover for his crimes How Celtic boys abuser was convicted a second time Torbett was convicted in November 2018 for abusing three boys over an eight year period. It was his second conviction for sex offences against boys. Sentencing Torbett to six years, Judge Lord Beckett told Torbett that Celtic Boys Club had given opportunities to hundreds of aspiring young footballers and that he ""used the club as a front for child sexual abuse."" The judge added: ""Yours is some of the most corrupting behaviour I have ever heard of in these courtsâ¦Your depraved conduct towards innocent children has blighted their lives."" Another of Torbett's victims Andrew Gray died in a swimming pool accident in Australia before the trial, although his evidence was read out in court. Andrew Gray with his sister Michelle His sister, Michelle Gray, also welcomed the news. She said: ""We can't begin to put into words the sense of relief that we feel today. Nothing will ever bring Andrew back but knowing the man that destroyed his life will remain behind bars and serve the sentence he was given for his heinous crimes, helps ease the pain a little. ""We only wish that he had been sentenced to longer. Through his actions the victims and their loved ones were given a life sentence."" Kenny Campbell and Andrew broke their silence in a BBC documentary, Football Abuse: The Ugly Side of the Beautiful Game. The BBC confronted Jim Torbett in California A month after the documentary was broadcast, the BBC tracked Torbett down to California and put the claims to him in a dramatic confrontation. Torbett was charged soon after but vigorously denied his crimes. He was convicted and sentenced to six years at the High Court in Glasgow after a two week trial.

Teenage boy chased and stabbed to death,"A teenage boy was found wounded outside a block of flats in Isleworth A teenage boy has been stabbed to death by a group of men who chased him and then attacked him in west London. The men pulled up in a vehicle near Syon Park, Isleworth, and chased the 17-year-old  boy before catching up with him and stabbing him, police said. The boy, who had been with a group of other people, was found injured outside a block of flats in Union Lane at about 22:35 GMT on Friday. Officers gave first aid but he died at the scene. No-one has been arrested. The Metropolitan Police has started a murder investigation but officers said they were ""keeping an open mind"" about a motive. Post-mortem tests and a formal identification are due to be held later. A section 60 order, granting police increased stop and search powers across the area, is in place. A murder investigation has been started by the Metropolitan Police A couple who called the police said there was ""blood everywhere"". The 35-year-old woman, who did not want to be identified, said the teenager was still alive when she and her husband saw him. ""There was someone else there trying to help by checking his pulse. He was responding but he couldn't speak,"" she said. A second witness said the teenager was assaulted by two people, one wearing a mask. ""It was one guy who was massive with a mask on his face and another small guy. They were kicking him, but it was dark so it was hard to see exactly what was happening.""

Grenfell council spent Â£90k in bonuses,"Seventy-two people died in the Grenfell Tower fire on 14 June 2017 Bosses at the council responsible for Grenfell Tower received bonuses totalling more than Â£90,000 in the year after the fire, it has emerged. It was also revealed housing staff at the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea had bonuses totalling Â£131,800. A survivors' group called the payments ""abhorrent"" since some households still do not have permanent homes. RBKC said bonuses were based on an employee's ""individual performance"" and the scheme was under ""full review"". The council also said: ""No-one got a bonus specifically for helping respond to the fire."" The fire in north Kensington on 14 June 2017killed 72 people. 'Frustration' at Grenfell charge delay Leaseholders spared Â£10k cladding bill Figures, obtained by the BBC via a freedom of information request, showed 12 employees in leadership roles at the council received a total of Â£93,174 in bonuses in May or June of 2018 - an average payment of Â£7,765 per employee. The council did not respond when the BBC asked for the salary brackets of staff in these positions. The amount spent on annual bonuses for leaders in the local authority has remained broadly stable since 2014/15, the earliest year for which data was provided, with the figure fluctuating between Â£92,418 and Â£99,463. The number of council bosses who received bonuses increased to 12 in 2017/18, from 11 in previous years. In May or June 2018, 52 members of staff working in housing received Â£131,804 in bonuses, an average of Â£2,534 per employee. The council did not say whether there was an overlap between the total figures for bonuses paid to leaders and housing staff. A survivors' group called the bonus payments ""abhorrent"" Both the amount spent on bonuses and the number of staff working on housing at the council increased in 2017/18. In 2016/17, 43 housing staff received Â£103,298 in bonuses between them - an average payment of Â£2,402. Around 21 months after the Grenfell Tower fire, 67 households from the estate have yet to move into permanent homes, according to the latest figures released by the council. Spike Western, a spokesman for the North Kensington Law Centre, which has been working to help rehouse former Grenfell residents, said the council ""certainly has some explaining to do"". He said staff at the local authority had been in a ""difficult situation"", but said homeless survivors had suffered from a ""sub-standard public service"". ""While bonuses are being handed out to staff at town hall, the law centre has been successfully challenging unfair decisions they have made that are causing more stress to the residents,"" he added. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower Campaign group Justice for Grenfell described the payments as ""vulgar"" and said RBKC should ""hang their heads in shame"". ""The fact that they've offered performance-related bonuses shows how desensitised RBKC were and remain to what happened at Grenfell,"" the group said. ""Their barefaced audacity to reward housing staff, when some Grenfell families still do not have permanent homes is abhorrent. ""Public sector workers are entitled to fair remuneration, but when senior managers help themselves to extra, it can only be classed as greed."" Labour MP for Kensington Emma Dent Coad said she was ""disgusted"" by the payments. ""Given the abject misery many Grenfell affected families have been left in, I find it extraordinary that senior staff have been offered bonuses,"" she said. ""They have said that they want to get back to 'business as usual'. Handing out bonuses within a failing service proves they've achieved just that. ""I am genuinely shocked."" A statement from Kensington and Chelsea Council said: ""Our permanent staff are eligible for performance-related pay, based on individual performance, as set out in their legal contract of employment with us. ""This is rigorously assessed every year and the overall scheme is currently subject to a full review."" The statement added that the bonuses relating to pay for staff working in housing cover the whole department - and that includes home building, buying properties, and rehousing people. None of the eligible staff returned their bonuses in light of the tragedy, the council confirmed. 'Frustration' at Grenfell charge delay Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims?

More bodies under Cyclone Idai floods - UN,"Rescue workers wear masks as they prepare to offload bodies from a helicopter The official death toll from Cyclone Idai, which tore through southern Africa more than a week ago, rose sharply on Saturday as authorities reported scores more deaths. The number of people declared dead in Mozambique rose from 242 to 417, Land and Environment Minister Celso Correia said. The new figure puts the overall death toll at about 700 people across Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. The toll is expected to rise further. The storm has killed at least 259 people in Zimbabwe, while in Malawi 56 people died when heavy rains hit ahead of the cyclone. But the United Nations said officials will only be able to determine the final casualty figure once the flood waters have receded. Thousands of people are still awaiting rescue from flooded areas across in southern Africa The UN Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said on Saturday that the Buzi and Zambezi rivers were at risk of breaking their banks again. ""We're going to have to wait until the flood waters recede until we know the full expanse of the toll on the people of Mozambique,"" OCHA co-ordinator Sebastian Rhodes Stampa said. Cyclone Idai: What are the dangers? 'We saw 200 bodies by the roadside' Maps reveal Cyclone Idai's destruction Thousands remain trapped by the floodwaters, and many of the Mozambican government's relief centres have only just started receiving food supplies. Some 1.7 million people are said to be affected across southern Africa, with no electricity or running water in areas where homes have been swept away and roads destroyed by the floods. This video can not be played 'It has become an inland sea' On Friday, cases of cholera were recordedin Beira in central Mozambique. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) warned of the risk of other outbreaks, already noting an increase in malaria. Cyclone Idai made landfall near Beira, a city of 500,000 people, with 177km/h (106 mph) winds on 14 March. Aid workers are slowly delivering relief, but conditions are said to be extremely difficult, with some areas completely inaccessible and helicopters scarce. In pictures: Cyclone Idai devastation Idai and the climate connection 'My hotel haven for cyclone homeless' Aid groups said Mozambique had borne the brunt of flooding from rivers that flow downstream from neighbouring countries. Nearly 90,000 Mozambicans are thought to be sheltering in temporary sites, while thousands of others are still stranded in floodwaters, AFP news agency reported. ""We are living an unprecedented natural disaster. A disaster that only matches major disasters,"" Mr Correia said.

'Burlesque helps us fight life's challenges',"This video can not be played The group are using burlesque to increase confidence and improve mental health. A group of women in the Highlands say forming a burlesque dance troupe has helped them to overcome mental and physical challenges in their lives. ""Troupe mamma"", or leader, Caroline Adkins suffers from health problems including arthritis and osteoporosis. She says performing improves her well-being, while other troupe members say it boosts their self-esteem. The group, Bump N Grind, plans to become a social enterprise, a business that reinvests or donates its profits. Caroline Adkins suffers health problems that include osteoporosis They describe themselves as the Highlands' first burlesque troupe. At present the group has five members. They are Caroline, who is known on stage as Evelyn Adore, also Emma MacKenzie aka Candy Kitten, Rowan Drever who performs as Lady Ivy, Cody Ross aka Moonstone Cherry and Rhianna Bain who performs as Miss Rhi Von Bee. Burlesque is a genre of variety show and features music, song and dance routines. BBC Scotland's The Ninecaught up with Bump N Grind during one of their rehearsals. The Inverness-based troupe Bump N Grind first started performing shows in December Many of the Inverness-based troupe's shows raise funds for charity, including Highlands-based suicide prevention group Mikeysline. A show this month is raising funds for the Scottish Association for Mental Health. Caroline says mental health was an issue ""close to the dancers' hearts"". ""All members of the troupe face challenges daily due to needs concerning mental and physical health,"" she says. ""Becoming part of Bump N Grind has helped them with their anxiety and depression and general mental health. ""It has built their confidence and self-esteem and helped them to be comfortable in their own bodies, and realise how much they are capable of, and indeed how talented they are - as I tell them daily."" Caroline adds: ""I myself also suffer with 'invisible illness' and have arthritis, ataxia, osteoporosis and severe joint and tissue pain and fatigue."" Rhianna says being part of the troupe has boosted her confidence Rhianna Bain says joining the troupe had boosted her confidence. ""I have actually found I have been able to love myself for who I am, and the shape I am as well,"" she says. ""I do suffer from anxiety and depression and I have found doing the troupe and burlesque has brought me so much out of my shell."" Cody Ross aka Moonstone Cherry and the rest of the troupe hope to recruit new members Rowan Drever has also drawn new confidence from being part of the group. She says: ""It's like I am a kid again and enjoying myself and dancing around no matter who is there. ""I couldn't have done that before."" Emma MacKenzie says: ""There is nothing like this in the Highlands. There is no cabaret or burlesque up here so it would be really nice to have a scene. Emma describes the dance and song performances as ""empowering"" ""There are lots of people interested at it. When we did our first show people were saying 'Oh my God this is great'. ""It also changed perceptions about what people think it is. It's empowering."" Bump N Grind was started in December last year. Its formation followed a solo performance by Ms Adkins a few months earlier at Ness Factor, a talent competition held in aid of the Highland Hospice. Rehearsals ahead of a show in Inverness Caroline says: ""I hope that when we begin classes we will be able to offer our students the opportunity to give performing a go with a view to becoming part of the troupe and our shows. ""There are no limits to burlesque. Anybody is a burlesque body, no matter what size, shape or age."" She adds: ""I believe it is this inclusivity that is part of the reason burlesque is so life-affirming and why it can bring about such changes for people. ""And that is the reason I fell in love with the art form years ago because it truly has the power to be life-changing, which is what we hope to bring to the wider community in the months to come.""

Passengers evacuated from Norway cruise,"This video can not be played Footage from on board showed furniture crashing and sliding as the vessel tilted Rescuers have airlifted hundreds of people stranded on a cruise ship off the west coast of Norway. The Viking Sky lost power on Saturday and sent out a distress signal after it began drifting towards land. It got into trouble in a notoriously difficult stretch of waters and was reportedly minutes from striking rocks. The vessel has since restarted three of its four engines and is moving towards the nearest port with the assistance of tugboats. So far, almost 500 of the 1,373 passengers have been airlifted off the ship. Most of those on board are said to be British or US citizens. ""During the night, the sea was very rough. The boat rolled and rolled. And then we went to breakfast. And then we were going for the afternoon film show, and then the lights suddenly went out,"" said Derek Browne, from southern England, who was on board with his wife Esther. ""We were airlifted on the helicopter, which was quite a frightening experience."" Britons tell of 'frightening' rescue Another rescued passenger, Janet Jacob, told Norwegian public broadcaster NRK she had ""never seen anything so frightening"". ""I started to pray. I prayed for the safety of everyone on board,"" she said. ""The helicopter trip was terrifying."" This video can not be played British passenger Derek Browne: 'We were told Mayday Mayday!' The Viking Sky suffered engine failure on Saturday afternoon while en route to Stavanger from Tromso. Five helicopters and several rescue ships were called in for the rescue. One of the rescue ships also lost engine power and a local paper said the ""brutal"" conditions meant lifeboats were forced to turn back. Fisherman Jan Erik Fiskerstrand, whose boat was one of the first to come to help Viking Sky, told Aftenposten newspaper, ""it was just minutes before this could have gone really wrong"". The ship could have hit the rocks ""if they had not started the engine and fastened the anchor"". Olav Magne Stromsholm, who captains tourist vessels in the area, told the VG newspaper the Viking Sky had been ""near disaster"", calling the waters there a ""shipyard cemetery"". Those brought ashore are being taken to a local sports complex and accommodation had been found for them in local hotels. Seventeen people have been taken to hospital. The Viking Sky is a Viking Ocean Cruises ship, which had its maiden voyage in 2017. Are you in the area? If it's safe to share your experiences, then please emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Plaid Cymru to target fast food outlets,"Plaid says it would demand powers to control fast food outlets if it found it needed to Plaid Cymru wants to restrict the number of fast food outlets if it wins the next assembly election, despite ministers saying they lack the powers. Health spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones told the party's spring conference she disagreed with Welsh Labour ministers who say it is not possible. She also said the party would consider tax rises to pay for more social care. Plaid Cymru said it would put the nation's health at the core of its 2021 Welsh Assembly election campaign. It is also promising a Clean Air Act to deal with pollution, including that from traffic and the burning of damp wood in household stoves. Hospital records Wales' worst A&E wait A&E target times worse than last winter Â£35m aims to ease winter NHS pressures In January, Health Minister Vaughan Gething told AMs ""it is not at all clear - in fact, the majority view is that we don't have the powers"" to impose planning rules that would stop fast food outlets opening near schools and leisure centres. He said the Welsh Government had ""argued"" with the UK government about it. But, speaking from the conference in Bangor, Ms Jones told BBC Wales that Plaid Cymru disagreed. ""We believe that the assembly has powers over planning, and local government has clearly got responsibility around licensing,"" she said. ""Of course our health minister is a great one for looking for reasons not to do things."" Plaid Cymru had been advised that it could be done, she said, but if the party took power it would get ""some strong clear views"" first, and demand the powers from Westminster if necessary. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We launched our Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales consultation in January, which outlines actions to help people maintain a healthy weight. ""This includes creating healthy environments to support people to make healthier food choices."" Helen Mary Jones is Plaid Cymru's health spokesperson Ms Jones also said Plaid wanted a Scottish-style social care system which was free at the point of need and funded through taxation. Asked if there would be tax rises to pay for it, she said: ""We wouldn't rule that out. We need to do the sums. ""I believe that is something people would be prepared to pay as an alternative to our older citizens losing their homes and their investments and life savings in order to pay for their own care, which we all know isn't fair."" Any proposals would be ""clearly costed"" before going into the manifesto, Ms Jones added. Plaid Cymru is currently in opposition in the assembly, with 10 AMs, and has four MPs. Opening the final afternoon session of the two-day conference, the party's leader in Westminster, Liz Saville Roberts, focused much of her speech on the prisons and the justice system, including the lack of female jails in Wales. The probation service, she said, had ""put profit before public safety"" when it was partially privatised by UK ministers in 2014. An overhaul of probation, announced last year, means Wales will have no privately-run services when contracts end next year. Liz Saville Roberts: ""We must be masters of our own ship"" Referring to the impasse over Brexit in the House of Commons, Ms Saville Roberts told Plaid Cymru activists ""now is our time"" because ""the government cannot govern and the Labour Party will not oppose"". ""What were the songs the Brexiteers sang but the siren songs of a false dream? And the rocks are nearby and the time to awake is now. ""We must be masters of our own ship,"" she said, a reference to Plaid Cymru's ultimate goal of Welsh independence. The Dwyfor Meirionnydd MP warmly praised a Europe she said had offered Wales the ""practical reality of a helping hand"", ""enriched our communities"" and ""enriched our opportunities to work, to live, to love"". Plaid Cymru is campaigning for another referendum on leaving the EU. Ex-party leader Dafydd Wigley told the BBC a Brexit compromise was attainable across the House of Commons. ""The roadblock to that at present is the leadership of the Conservative Party, who are relying on one formula, and the leadership of the Labour Party, who are just not going to engage, and I believe that it's got to be taken out of their hands,"" he said. ""It's got to be a leadership across parties to get a sensible settlement that looks after our industries, our business, our farmers, our tourism industry, our health dimension. ""All these depend on getting a sensible result. It can be got and for God's sake, let's get it."" Later, another former Plaid leader, Leanne Wood, called for a ""Green New Deal"" for Wales. ""The window of opportunity to save our planet is fast closing upon us,"" she said. ""Wales could - and should - be a pioneer in the movement to develop carbon neutral economies. ""We can lead the way to a sustainable future if there is the right political will.""

"Teenage boy chased and stabbed to deathPolice have started a murder investigation into the death of a boy, thought to be 17 years old.London","A teenage boy was found wounded outside a block of flats in Isleworth A teenage boy has been stabbed to death by a group of men who chased him and then attacked him in west London. The men pulled up in a vehicle near Syon Park, Isleworth, and chased the 17-year-old  boy before catching up with him and stabbing him, police said. The boy, who had been with a group of other people, was found injured outside a block of flats in Union Lane at about 22:35 GMT on Friday. Officers gave first aid but he died at the scene. No-one has been arrested. The Metropolitan Police has started a murder investigation but officers said they were ""keeping an open mind"" about a motive. Post-mortem tests and a formal identification are due to be held later. A section 60 order, granting police increased stop and search powers across the area, is in place. A murder investigation has been started by the Metropolitan Police A couple who called the police said there was ""blood everywhere"". The 35-year-old woman, who did not want to be identified, said the teenager was still alive when she and her husband saw him. ""There was someone else there trying to help by checking his pulse. He was responding but he couldn't speak,"" she said. A second witness said the teenager was assaulted by two people, one wearing a mask. ""It was one guy who was massive with a mask on his face and another small guy. They were kicking him, but it was dark so it was hard to see exactly what was happening."" Motives and circumstances behind killings have varied - as have the age and gender of the victims. Faces of the dead: The UK's first 100 victims 10 charts that help explain the rise in knife crime Halima Abubaker, 22, said she saw two males ""running for their lives"" around the time of the incident.

""This is a 17-year-old boy who has lost his life because of a knife attack,"" he said. ""My thoughts and prayers, as I'm sure are those of all Londoners, are with his family.""

What might Mueller report look like?The report into alleged collusion between Russia and Donald Trump's 2016 campaign has concluded.US & Canada,"Robert Mueller's report goes first to the attorney general, who will decide how much to release to the public It's been 22 months since former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed to head a special investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign was involved. Now his work is done and his report has been submitted to the Department of Justice. But what does that mean? Time Magazine senior editor Ryan Teague Beckwith has described trying to keep up with the twists in the Mueller investigation as akin to understanding the plot of a Russian novel by listening to a book club conversation. Now, at last, perhaps we will see the full manuscript. Or at least the CliffsNotes (that's York Notes to you Brits). Or maybe we won't. If it all seems confusing, that's because no-one knows exactly what happens next. It doesn't mean we'll know all the details immediately - or ever. The notoriously tight-lipped former FBI director could simply announce that his work is done, pack his bags and go back to a private life of golf clubs, corporate boards, academic speaking engagements and trips to the Apple store Genius Bar. Not necessarily. In fact, probably not. It doesn't seem likely there will be a detailed investigative narrative presented to the public similar to the multi-tome report produced by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr back in 1998. Boxes and boxes of the Starr report Mr Starr's wide-ranging investigation that started with a real-estate inquiry and ended up scouring Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky was governed by a federal statute with different rules. And Mr Starr himself - a former judge and Republican administration lawyer - was a different kind of man to the by-the-books ex-Marine Mueller. Mr Mueller's probe is conducted under the auspices of the Justice Department and isgoverned by its regulations,external. The special counsel's obligations at the conclusion of his work are to provide a ""confidential report"" to Attorney General Bill Barr explaining his prosecutorial decisions. The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words What does the special counsel do? Mr Barr must then provide the top members of the Senate and House Judiciary committees with a brief explanation of any actions taken - or instances where he overruled the special counsel's proposed action. It is up to the attorney general to decide whether it would be in the ""public interest"" to make any of these reports or communications accessible to the rest of us. This is the million-dollar question. In his testimony during his January Senate confirmation hearings, Mr Barr was repeatedly pressed by Democrats to promise he would make public any findings or reports produced by the Mueller investigation. He demurred. Now, in his just-released letter to senior members of Congress, the attorney general seems eager to tell us more. ""I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,"" he writes. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Five big things Mueller is looking at Traditionally the Justice Department has been reluctant to provide information about investigations that do not lead to criminal prosecution. That was a guideline notably violated by former FBI Director James Comey during his July 2016 press statement outlining the results of a federal investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Barack Obama's secretary of state. It would be ironic, to say the least, if the resulting political fallout from Mr Comey's decision - which Ms Clinton's campaign believes dealt a mortal wound - is used by Mr Barr to defend a decision to keep confidential damaging details of the Mueller investigation involving Donald Trump. His letter concludes: ""I remain committed to as much transparency as possible, and I will keep you informed as to the status of my review."" It's certainly a possibility. Or if we do learn something, it could take a while to render it into a form for public consumption (or, given the way things work in Washington, to leak). Imagine the scene in Washington, as the political world learns Mr Mueller has provided his findings to Mr Barr and then waits - for hours, days - to learn what, if anything, will come of it. There is another possibility, however. Up until now, Mr Mueller has spoken through his court filings, which are rich in detail and new revelations. While Mr Mueller's report to the attorney general will be confidential, it may not be his final word at the conclusion of his investigations. There may be more indictments to come. This video can not be played Mueller is done... this is what we know so far Over the course of the last 21 months, Mr Mueller - in his prosecutorial documents - has explained how Russian agents and operatives allegedly gathered information about the US political process, initiated a social media campaign to influence and enflame American political views, funded on-the-ground political activities, and hacked the emails and files of top Democratic operatives in an effort to damage Mrs Clinton's presidential campaign. He has prosecuted multiple members of the president's inner campaign circle for a variety of misdeeds, including obstruction of justice and lying about Russian contacts. He helped strike a deal with Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, which unearthed evidence of Trump business negotiations with Russian officials conducted in the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign. He indicted a Trump confidant, Roger Stone, for lying about his contacts with Wikileaks, the organisation he says was the conduit through which Russia injected its purloined material into the American political bloodstream. Former Trump adviser Roger Stone is among those indicted in connection with the inquiry The special counsel could be building a prosecutorial path that leads to the White House, with the final stones about to be set. Court-watchers note multiple sealed indictments have been filed in the federal courts used by Mr Mueller's team over the past few months. Those could be political and legal bombs, with their fuses lit. Or they could be duds. Hardly. Even if the Mueller investigation closes up shop and there is no ""report"", there are no new indictments and the attorney general's public pronouncements provide few details, it's not the end of the story. There are a number of cases initiated by the special counsel - involving Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and deputy campaign aide Rick Gates - that still await final sentencing. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been jailed for fraud and for conspiracy related to illegal lobbying. Long-time Trump adviser Mr Stone has yet to go to trial on his charges of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction of justice. Mr Mueller has handed this prosecution over to government lawyers. There's also a special counsel case against Concord Management and Consulting, which Mr Mueller has charged with assisting Russia's 2016 social media election-meddling campaign. Meanwhile there's a plethora of other ongoing investigations that are being run independently of the special counsel's office. Federal investigators in New York are looking into possible election-law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses and misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee. The US attorneys in Washington and Virginia also have their hands full, with the espionage case involving Russian Maria Butina and an unregistered foreign lobbying prosecution of Mr Flynn's business associates. There are also state-level investigations of Mr Trump's charitable foundation and Trump Organization tax filings, as well as an ongoing lawsuit by Maryland and the District of Columbia alleging that the president, through his business dealings, is violating a constitutional rule prohibiting the acceptance of money from foreign governments while in office. Mr Mueller may exit the stage, but the drama will continue. Bernie Sanders runs for president again Bird steals the show at Sanders rally.

"Passengers evacuated from Norway cruiseAbout 1,300 people are being evacuated from the cruise ship after it suffered engine trouble.Europe","This video can not be played Footage from on board showed furniture crashing and sliding as the vessel tilted Rescuers have airlifted hundreds of people stranded on a cruise ship off the west coast of Norway. The Viking Sky lost power on Saturday and sent out a distress signal after it began drifting towards land. It got into trouble in a notoriously difficult stretch of waters and was reportedly minutes from striking rocks. The vessel has since restarted three of its four engines and is moving towards the nearest port with the assistance of tugboats. So far, almost 500 of the 1,373 passengers have been airlifted off the ship. Most of those on board are said to be British or US citizens. ""During the night, the sea was very rough. The boat rolled and rolled. And then we went to breakfast. And then we were going for the afternoon film show, and then the lights suddenly went out,"" said Derek Browne, from southern England, who was on board with his wife Esther. ""We were airlifted on the helicopter, which was quite a frightening experience."" Britons tell of 'frightening' rescue Another rescued passenger, Janet Jacob, told Norwegian public broadcaster NRK she had ""never seen anything so frightening"". ""I started to pray. I prayed for the safety of everyone on board,"" she said. ""The helicopter trip was terrifying."" This video can not be played British passenger Derek Browne: 'We were told Mayday Mayday!' The Viking Sky suffered engine failure on Saturday afternoon while en route to Stavanger from Tromso. Five helicopters and several rescue ships were called in for the rescue. One of the rescue ships also lost engine power and a local paper said the ""brutal"" conditions meant lifeboats were forced to turn back. Fisherman Jan Erik Fiskerstrand, whose boat was one of the first to come to help Viking Sky, told Aftenposten newspaper, ""it was just minutes before this could have gone really wrong"". The ship could have hit the rocks ""if they had not started the engine and fastened the anchor"". Olav Magne Stromsholm, who captains tourist vessels in the area, told the VG newspaper the Viking Sky had been ""near disaster"", calling the waters there a ""shipyard cemetery"". Those brought ashore are being taken to a local sports complex and accommodation had been found for them in local hotels. Seventeen people have been taken to hospital. The Viking Sky is a Viking Ocean Cruises ship, which had its maiden voyage in 2017. Are you in the area? If it's safe to share your experiences, then please emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Christchurch shootings: The people killed as they prayed,"Fifty-one people were killed and dozens more wounded in an attack on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand on 15 March 2019. A lone gunman pleaded guilty to the shootings at the Al Noor mosque and the Linwood Islamic Centre and was convicted. Below are the names and, where available, pictures of those who died. Many had moved to New Zealand to study or to work, and to build a better life for themselves and their families. Some were refugees, who thought they had found safety. The 70-year-old father of four from Somalia was killed at the Al Noor mosque. His son Said arrived at the mosque as the attack was underway, saw the gunman in the street and drove off. ""This is devastating. My father survived through civil war. I never thought this kind of stuff would happen to him in New Zealand,"" he told the Washington Post. Abdul Fattah Qasem Ibrahim Qasem was the former secretary of the Muslim Association of Canterbury was a respected elder in the Muslim community and helped with interpretation for refugees and migrants from the Middle East. ""He is a massive man, a giant. He has a heart of gold. He was that fantastic person who just wanted everyone to be amazing,"" his son-in-law Mohammed Al-Kubaisy told Stuff. He was of Palestinian origin but also had Jordanian nationality. His death was confirmed by the Egyptian migration ministry. ""My dad was a good kind man,"" his son Omar told the BBC. ""Him and mum had great jobs and were well off in Egypt but they immigrated to NZ in 1996 for me. For my education, so that I could have a better chance to study what I want. We have been here 23 years."" ""He had many friends and family who loved him,â he added. âHe was a pure hearted soul who never treated anyone badly."" The retired engineer was killed while praying, his wife told the New Zealand Herald. ""We should be strong, especially in this case. I lose my husband but I'm not angry. I'm sad because I don't see him again, I don't talk to him again,"" Nuha Asad said. ""I'm happy in the same time because it happened while he prayed. I take comfort because he was a good man."" The Palestinian doctor's family believe he was killed in the attack at the mosque where he prayed every Friday. Mr Hamid and his wife Hahan moved to New Zealand 23 years ago, and had two sons. Mr Hamid specialised in cardiorespiratory illnesses for the Canterbury District Health Board. Ansi Alibava was at the mosque with her husband Ponnath Abdul Nazer, who worked in a local supermarket. The pair had moved to Christchurch from Kerala, India, in February last year so Ms Alibava could study for a master's degree in agricultural engineering. ""She loved all people - cousins, friends,"" Mr Nazer told the BBC. ""She kept a big space in her mind [for] family members.""
                        He said she had been living her dream by studying and travelling in New Zealand. Neither of them had previously been outside Kerala. They have been financially supporting their families. Ashraf Ali, from Fiji, had gone to the Al Noor mosque with his brother, Ramzan. Ramzan Ali said he managed to hide from the gunman, but his brother did not escape. Ramzan Ali told the New Zealand Herald he watched the video of the attack, and recognised his 58-year-old brother because of his Fijian rugby shirt. ""I will never be able to forget him. If he wanted to do something he would just do it. He won't even think twice. And he was always successful."" Ashraf Al-Masri was one of four Egyptian victims named by the Egyptian government. The father of two leaves behind a wife and two children. They are accompanying their husband and father's body back to Egypt for burial. He was one of four Egyptians killed in the attack.

He was an engineer, reportedly with a love of vintage cars, but in his retirement was a community leader in New Zealand. He was president of a local Afghan association and a known supporter of other migrant groups.
                        His son, Omar, told NBC News: ""Whether you're from Palestine, Iraq, Syria - he's been the first person to hold his hand up."" Farhaj Ahsan moved to New Zealand from Hyderabad in India 10 years ago and worked as an electrical engineer. He was married with two young children: a three-year-old daughter and six-month-old son.

Egyptian Hussein Moustafa had prayed in the same corner of the Al Noor mosque since the family moved to Christchurch 20 years ago, local media reported. His daughter told the New Zealand Herald that her 70-year-old father had been an active volunteer in his retirement and visited the mosque most days. Junaid was born to Indian parents and ran a corner shop in Christchurch. His twin brother Zahid told New Zealand's Checkpoint programme he had survived the shooting: ""I want him back. I would rather that I went than him. I'm the naughty twin, he's the better one and that's how it is."" Junaid leaves behind a wife and three children. Kamel Darweesh migrated to New Zealand from Jordan about six months ago to join his older brother. The 39-year-old was working on a dairy farm and waiting for his wife and children to come join him, according to local reports.

Remainer walks 200 miles to Brexit protest,"Members of Swansea 4 Europe bade farewell to Ed Sides (left) as his walk began on 6 March A man has walked 200 miles to join a march in London in favour of another EU referendum, engaging with Brexit supporters along the way. Ed Sides set off from Swansea two and a half weeks ago and has ""taken time to listen as much as talk"". Wales for Europe had booked out 30 coaches to transport protesters toSaturday's demonstration. But one Leave supporter said a fresh vote would just prolong the arguments for another three years. Others from across Wales made their own way to Hyde Park for the march. Ed Sides and his wife Rhiannon Barrar in Hyde Park following their arrival in London Mr Sides, who was joined by his wife Rhiannon Barrar for part of the journey, set out on foot from Swansea on 6 March. ""I set out on the walk to raise attention to our cause, but also to prove that just because you're passionate about something it doesn't mean you have to rubbish opposing opinions,"" he said. ""We need a kinder, more rational debate about Brexit, and everywhere I've stopped I've taken the time to listen as much as talk."" Hundreds of campaigners from Wales attended the march Welsh Government ministers Vaughan Gething and Eluned Morgan were among the many politicians joining the march in London. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but that date has now been put back to 12 April, as MPs try to find a way forward. Prime Minister Theresa May's exit deal, negotiated with the EU over two years hasbeen voted down twice in parliament, once by a record margin. MPs are now divided on what direction to take next - some want to leavewithout a deal, others want tonot leave at all, and some want another referendum. Tens of thousands on Brexit referendum march May 'hopes' UK will leave EU with a deal Brexit: What could happen next? In the 2016 referendum, Wales voted 52.5% to 47.5% in favour of leave, a slightly higher margin than the UK as a whole at 51.9% to 48.1%. But Peter Gilbey, director of the anti-Brexit campaign group Wales for Europe, believed the mood had shifted over the past three years. ""Those who were ardent Remainers are probably more so now, and likewise with Leavers, but equally those who were uncertain in 2016 are even more confused than ever,"" he said. ""The argument that a second referendum would be a betrayal of the people makes no sense; how can more information and more democracy equal less democracy?"" Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button However, retired Swansea builder Fred Jones, who voted Leave, told BBC Wales he found arguments espoused by some Remainers patronising. ""I wouldn't say that I'm passionate one way or the other, but I am fed up of being told I voted Leave because I am in my nineties, or because I'm stupid and didn't know what I was voting for,"" he said. ""I knew full well that leaving was going to cause upheaval and hardship in the short term, but would eventually allow Britain to decide for ourselves what sort of country we want to be. ""But the main reason why I don't believe in another referendum is that it will solve nothing - we'll be having the same arguments in three years' time."" Organisers claim more than a million people took part in the March in London on Saturday Million joined Brexit protest, organisers say What happens now that a deal's been done? How does another Brexit delay work? What happens after Brexit?

Duggan family to sue Met over death,"Mark Duggan was shot by police in Tottenham The family of Mark Duggan, whose death sparked riots across England in August 2011, are suing the Metropolitan Police for damages, BBC News has learned. Mr Duggan, 29, was shot dead by police who believed he was carrying a gun and posed a threat. An inquest jury found Mr Duggan was not holding the weapon when he was shot, but concluded he had been lawfully killed. The Met said it had received a civil claim and would not comment further. However, it is understood the force is defending the claim. The inquest heard how armed police had intercepted a minicab Mr Duggan was travelling in after intelligence indicated he was part of a gang and had arranged to collect a gun. The rioting erupted following a peaceful protest After Mr Duggan got out of the cab, one of the firearms officers - referred to as V53 - shot him twice, once in the chest. A pistol, wrapped in a sock, was later found on grassland behind railings 10-20ft (3-6m) from Mr Duggan's body. Jurors concluded in January 2014 that Mr Duggan had dropped the gun when the minicab came to a stop, but decided that V53 had ""honestly believed"" he still had the weapon and acted lawfully in self-defence. Detective sacked over Mark Duggan gun enquiry Duggan family loses new inquest appeal Riots in Tottenham after Mark Duggan shooting protest The civil proceedings, which are being brought by Mr Duggan's mother, Pamela, and at least some of his children, are in their early stages. The relatives want the Met to be held liable for his death and to pay compensation. Stafford Scott, a community activist who has supported the Duggan family, said the legal action was a ""good thing"". This video can not be played Exclusive footage obtained by the BBC shows the aftermath of Mark Duggan's shooting He pointed out the inquest jury was told that to reach a conclusion that Mr Duggan's death was ""unlawful"" they had to be ""sure"", whereas the standard of proof in a civil case is based on the balance of probabilities. He added: ""Mark Duggan's family and children have the right to have a second go at the police where the bar isn't set as incredibly high as at the inquest."" In a report after the inquest had ended, coroner Judge Keith Cutler said evidence gathered by investigators ""did not resolve, the vexed and very important issue of what precisely happened immediately before the fatal shot was fired"". Judge Cutler also expressed concern the Met and the Serious Organised Crime Agency could have reacted better to events before the shooting and used their joint intelligence resources more effectively. Ken Marsh, chairman of the Metropolitan Police Federation, which represents the officers involved, said he fully understood why the Duggan family felt the need to pursue a civil claim because they had ""lost a loved one"". But, he added the officers involved wanted to ""move on"". He said: ""This has been through the justice system. The findings have been clearly laid out in the public domain."" Mr Duggan's family challenged the lawful killing conclusion, but the High Court and the Court of Appeal ruled against them. The UK Supreme Court declined to hear the case and they have lodged an appeal with the European Court of Human Rights.

Nine men charged after paramilitary raids,"The PSNI's paramilitary crime taskforce carried out 14 searches on Friday Three men have been remanded in custody after being arrested during police raids targeting loyalist paramilitaries in east Belfast. Darren Baine, 29, and Mark Rainey, 39, both from Belfast, and County Down man Andrew Crawford, 27, are accused of supplying cocaine. They appeared at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Saturday. The court heard the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) has been ""flooding the streets of Belfast"" with drugs. The detective sergeant from the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) said that Mr Baine, of Cheviot Avenue, was part of a drug-dealing network and a criminal gang linked to the east Belfast UVF. The officer told the judge that the defendant played a key role in the drug-dealing operation. A defence solicitor applied for bail for Mr Baine, saying that others with a ""more serious role"", including ""a top player"", had already been released on police bail. When asked by the judge about his client's occupation, the solicitor said that Mr Baine did not work or receive benefits but has ""a small amount of savings"". The judge refused bail because of a ""real risk"" of more offences being committed. The solicitor said that Mr Baine would go to the High Court next week to apply for bail. The court heard that suspected cocaine with a street value of Â£15,000, as well as UVF flags, were found in the home of Andrew Crawford, of Cairndore Grange in Newtownards. The police officer said the alleged drug-dealing operation is linked to the east Belfast UVF, which, he added, ""consistently uses violence"". Police seized drugs and vehicles during the raids in Belfast, Newtownards and Comber Applying for bail, a defence solicitor told the court that the case against Mr Crawford was a ""scary experience for him"" and that he ""is worried about his job"". The police officer opposed bail because of ""the seriousness and gravity"" of the ""overwhelming"" case against Mr Crawford. The judge refused bail, citing the ""significant amount"" of cocaine allegedly found in the defendant's home. Mr Rainey, of St Patrick's Walk, did not apply for bail and will appear in court again by videolink next week. A 22-year-old man who also appeared in court accused of drugs offences was released on bail. The judge ruled that the case against him was a ""standalone"" case and separate from the other three. The four men were among nine who were charged after a operation on Friday by the PSNI's paramilitary crime taskforce. Eleven men were arrested after raids at 14 propertiesin Belfast, Newtownards and Comber in County Down. Class A drugs and ""high value"" cars were seized in the searches. Four men, aged 32, 47 and two 48 year olds, will appear at Belfast Magistrates' Court on 18 April, charged with being concerned in the supply of a class A drug. A 34-year-old man faces a charge of unlawfully obtaining and disclosing personal data. Another man, aged 32, who was arrested on suspicion of possession of a class A drug with intent to supply has been released on bail pending further inquiries. A 40-year-old man arrested on suspicion of possession of a class B drug, intimidation and improper use of electronic communications has been released to be reported to prosecutors. The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.

Teenage boy stabbed to death in fight,"A teenage boy was found wounded outside a block of flats in Isleworth A teenage boy has been stabbed to death by a group of men who chased him and then attacked him in west London. The men pulled up in a vehicle near Syon Park, Isleworth, and chased the 17-year-old  boy before catching up with him and stabbing him, police said. The boy, who had been with a group of other people, was found injured outside a block of flats in Union Lane at about 22:35 GMT on Friday. Officers gave first aid but he died at the scene. No-one has been arrested. The Metropolitan Police has started a murder investigation but officers said they were ""keeping an open mind"" about a motive. Post-mortem tests and a formal identification are due to be held later. A section 60 order, granting police increased stop and search powers across the area, is in place. A murder investigation has been started by the Metropolitan Police A couple who called the police said there was ""blood everywhere"". The 35-year-old woman, who did not want to be identified, said the teenager was still alive when she and her husband saw him. ""There was someone else there trying to help by checking his pulse. He was responding but he couldn't speak,"" she said. A second witness said the teenager was assaulted by two people, one wearing a mask. ""It was one guy who was massive with a mask on his face and another small guy. They were kicking him, but it was dark so it was hard to see exactly what was happening.""

Tag gives 'instant fix' on dead eagles,"Some golden eagles will be fitted with the new technology over the next 18 months A new type of satellite tag for tracking birds of prey is being trialled in the Cairngorms National Park. Over the next 18 months, some young golden eagles will be fitted with the Raptor Tracker. Organisations involved in the project said the tag should provide better information on the birds' movements. It should also give an ""instant fix"" on any eagles that die, which would help in efforts to tackle wildlife crime. Several organisations are involved in the project, including the Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and British Trust for Ornithology. They said tags in current use were ""limited"" in what information they could provide on the exact location of any bird which dies. The new device uses a satellite network that ensures that signal information is always available. The project team said that the new tag's multiple sensors can send a ""distress signal"" with an exact location if unusual behaviour is detected. This early warning system has the added benefit of helping to rapidly identify and recover birds which have died, said the team. The new tag will provide more information on the movement and behaviour of golden eagles in the Cairngorms Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the trial should improve understanding of the behaviour of the Cairngorms' golden eagles. She said: ""The tags should make a real difference in deterring would-be criminals, as well as playing a key role in establishing exactly what happened, should any of these magnificent birds of prey disappear or die in unusual circumstances."" Grant Moir, of the national park authority, said: ""Raptor conservation and tackling wildlife crime is one of the aims of the recently launched Cairngorms Nature Action Plan 2019-2023. ""This is an exciting breakthrough in the technology around raptor conservation, understanding the birds and combating wildlife crime."" Robbie Kernahan, of Scottish Natural Heritage, described the tag as ""exciting new technology"". He said it should be a ""significant deterrent"" to anyone thinking of persecuting raptors.

Crowds were told the initial count showed more than a million people had turned up -putting it on a par with the biggest march of the century, the Stop the War march in 2003. This video can not be played Marchers called for a ""proper vote"" and said they'd been ""sold down the river"" There was no independent verification of the numbers but BBC correspondent Richard Lister, who was at the scene, said it was a ""very densely packed"" protest and people were still arriving in Parliament Square five hours after the march began. He said: ""The organisers say it was one million-strong, it's very hard to verify those kinds of claims but this was a very significant march, well into the hundreds of thousands."" Protesters carried a mixture of homemade and official placards Protesters marched past some of London's most famous landmarks Labour's Tom Watson told the crowd in Parliament Square that Mrs May's deal was a ""lousy"" one - whether you voted Leave or Remain. He said he had this message for her: ""I can only vote for a deal if you let the people vote on it too. Prime Minister, you've lost control of this process, you're plunging the country into chaos, let the people take control."" Ms Sturgeon said now was ""the moment of maximum opportunity""to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By Katie Wright, BBC News, in Park Lane The streets around Park Lane were teeming with people hours ahead of the march's scheduled 1pm start, having come from all corners of the country - and some from further beyond. The blue and yellow of the EU was splashed all over the ever-expanding crowd, which was full of groups of families, friends, colleagues and political groups. Many people came draped in flags and carried homemade signs, featuring slogans ranging from playful - ""Never gonna give EU up"" - to political - ""Forget the Ides of March - beware the Brexit of May"". And then there were the plain angry - ""Brexit is treason"". One member of the crowd, German-born vet Chris Reichmann, described it as a ""carnival"" atmosphere - with ""lots of different nationalities"" but ""really British in a way"". And it was noisy, with some of London's most recognisable streets overflowing with people marching steadily to a soundtrack of beating drums, whistles and blaring horns. Occasionally the hordes would erupt into spontaneous cheering, as well as chants of ""What do we want? People's vote. When do we want it? Now!"" Game Of Thrones star Lena Headey, Strictly Come Dancing presenter Claudia Winkleman and Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys were among the famous names to take to the streets. Sadiq Khanjoined demonstrators at the front of the march,externalas it began, holding up a ""Put it to the People"" banner. He was flanked by Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable,who tweeted,externalthat there was a ""huge turnout of people here from all walks of life"". But veteran Conservative MP John Redwood told the BBC: ""We know that 16 million people wanted to stay in the EU, and some of those would still like to stay in the EU, and within that quite a few would like to have another go and have another referendum - but it was always a minority."" Aerial pictures taken from a helicopter showed the scale of the crowds The prime minister wrote to all MPs on Friday saying she will ditch plans to put the deal to another so-called meaningful vote on her withdrawal deal if not enough MPs support it. Unless her deal is passed by MPs, the UK will have to come up with an alternative plan or else face leaving without a deal on 12 April. Downing Street sources have denied reports inthe Times,externalnewspaper that discussions are under way about a timetable for the prime minister to step down. People gathered at Hyde Park Corner before marching towards Parliament People chanted for a ""People's Vote"" as they marched, accompanied by marching bands, whistles and cheers Meanwhile, a record-breaking online petition on Parliament's website calling for Brexit to be cancelled by revoking Article 50 has attracted more than four million signatures. As the number of signatures on the petition continued to climb, its creator Margaret Georgiadousaid she had ""received three death threats over the phone"", and a ""torrent of abuse"" via her Facebook account. Liberal Democrat MP Layla Moran said the petition could ""give oxygen"" to the campaign for another Brexit referendum. Sisters Calypso and Sophie Latham, from London ""I think a second vote might not be an entirely democratic solution because it would put into question every referendum we ever did.  But I wanted to show my anger - that I'm against xenophobic, racist and nationalistic rhetoric that is being spewed everywhere in the news to justify Brexit.""Law graduate Sophie Latham, 22 ""I was too young to vote in the last referendum. It's going to affect my career with research grants so I definitely wanted to come and protest.""Calypso Latham, 19, science student Lin and Rob Worthy from Oxford ""We've had so many opportunities growing up in the EU - freedom of travel, equal pay, sexual equality and so on. Will our kids get the same?""Lin Worthy, self-employed ""This is the first time in my life at the age of 62 that I've come to something to make a statement because I see no future for this country, for my kids or my grandkids. It's just a total mess so I thought I've got to make a stand.""Rob Worthy, 62, self-employed Simon Mead (right) with his 14-year-old daughter Aurore, from Bristol ""My partner is French, my two children are British-French, it has already caused lots of problems, having to apply for different passports has cost us lots of money. We've seen European friends leave Bristol - German and Spanish friends.""Simon Mead ""I really wanted to come because it's a big part of my future and my life.""Aurore Mead, 14 Lee and Richard, from Gloucestershire ""My costume has been deflating since I put it on at 11 this morning - which could be a metaphor for Brexit"".Lee, Gloucestershire ""I didn't get a vote but I moved to this country from Germany 20 years ago as a vet. I think it's a really silly decision. Now we've got a deal, the people should vote and see if that's really the deal the people want. I won't get a vote again but it has a massive implication on my life.Chris Reichmann, Ashford Nigel Farage said the People's Vote march in London were not the majority The march comes as the pro-Brexit March to Leave, which started in Sunderland a week ago, continues towards London. Former Ukip leader Nigel Farage re-joined the March to Leave in Linby, near Nottingham, on Saturday morning telling around 200 Brexit supporters that Mrs May had reduced the nation ""to a state of humiliation"". Speaking from the top of an open-top bus, Mr Farage said those gathering for the People's Vote march in London were not the majority, before leading the marchers through the village.

Christchurch mosque reopens after attacks,"Small groups were allowed to enter the Al Noor mosque on Saturday Worshippers have returned to the Al-Noor mosque in Christchurch for the first time since a mass shooting there in which dozens of people were killed. The building had closed so police could investigate the attack but on Saturday small groups were allowed to return. Fifty people were killed in shootings at two mosques on 15 March. As the Al Noor mosque reopened, some 3,000 people walked through Christchurch on Saturday for a 'march for love' intended to honour victims. Many walked in silence and some carried placards calling for peace and opposing racism. ""We feel like hate has brought a lot of darkness at times,"" said Manaia Butler, a 16-year-old student who helped to organise the march. ""Love is the strongest cure to light the city out of that darkness,"" she said. The lives lost and the world they revealed Aden Diriye, who lost his 3-year-old son in the attack, returned to the Al-Noor mosque on Saturday. ""I am very happy,"" he said after praying. "" I was back as soon as we rebuilt, to pray."" Australian Brenton Tarrant, a 28-year-old self-proclaimed white supremacist, has been charged with one murder in connection with the attacks and he is expected to face further charges. This video can not be played The victims have been remembered at events throughout the week With the crime scene investigation completed, the Al-Noor mosque, where the majority of the victims were killed, was handed back to the city's Muslim community. At around midday local time (23:00 GMT Friday), small groups of worshippers were allowed back onto the grounds, while armed police patrolled the site. ""We are allowing 15 people at a time, just to get some normality,"" Saiyad Hassen, a volunteer at the mosque, told AFP news agency. He did not say when the mosque would fully reopen. The mosque had been repaired, with bullet holes filled in and walls freshly painted - though the lack of rugs on the floor served as a reminder of what had happened. Worshippers knelt to pray on a grey padded carpet underlay taped to the floor. ""It is the place where we pray, where we meet, we'll be back,"" Ashif Shaikh, who was in the mosque at the time of the shooting, told Reuters news agency. Police said the nearby Linwood mosque, which was the second to be attacked, had also reopened.

This video can not be played New Zealand's PM said she hoped the ban would be in place by 11 April ""Six days after this attack, we are announcing a ban on all military style semi-automatics (MSSA) and assault rifles in New Zealand,"" Ms Ardern said in a news conference. ""Related parts used to convert these guns into MSSAs are also being banned, along with all high-capacity magazines."" An amnesty has been imposed so the owners of affected weapons can hand them in, and a buy-back scheme will follow. The buy-back could cost up to NZ$200m ($138m; Â£104m), but Ms Ardern said ""that is the price that we must pay to ensure the safety of our communities"".

ÃÂ£140m of Asian gold stolen in UK since 2013,"More than Â£140m worth of Asian gold jewellery has been stolen in the UK over the past five years, a BBC investigation has found. Gold jewellery is often bought as a wedding gift in British Asian families and passed down through generations. Out of 23 police forces that provided figures, Greater London had the highest value stolen - Â£115.6m, followed by Â£9.6m in Greater Manchester. Nearly 28,000 thefts of Asian gold have been recorded in the UK since 2013. A BBC Freedom of Information request to the 45 police forces in the UK revealed that Â£141.3m worth of so-called Asian gold had been recorded as stolen since 2013 in England - the forces in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland didn't provide data. Some police forces - such as Gwent and North Wales Police - were unable to provide data but have previously warned thatAsian families were being specifically targeted in their areas. Asian gold is often bought as wedding gifts and passed down through generations Video: Gold gang in north Wales 'organised and sophisticated' Arrests after spate of Asian gold thefts It is the first time that a comprehensive figure revealing the extent of the thefts of Asian gold in the UK has been collated. The five police forces found to have the highest value of thefts in 2017-18 were: Metropolitan Police - Â£21.2m (3,300 thefts) Kent Police - Â£1.6m (89 thefts) Greater Manchester Police - Â£1.5m (238 thefts) Essex Police - Â£495,000 (52 thefts) Thames Valley Police - Â£310,000 (102 thefts) Retired couple Shaheed and Syeda Syed, who live in the north of England, were victims of a violent robbery in their home in December last year. Attacked by masked intruders who were armed with an iron bar, both were beaten and Mr Syed suffered a heart attack. The thieves took bangles, necklaces and rings which had been in the family for generations and Mrs Syed had been keeping for her granddaughters. ""Most of the jewellery was from my parents, some was from my husband, so it had sentimental value,"" she said. The couple were left very shaken by the attack. Mr Syed said: ""At night when I lock all the doors and windows and go to bed, still I don't feel safe."" He said he couldn't understand why they were targeted as they are not rich and do not live in an expensive area. Mrs Syed added: ""Even if I had money, I would be scared to buy gold again and scared to keep it at home."" Police officers said that in some of the burglaries victims owned large amounts of jewellery, but that was not always the case. In Cheshire, police set up a dedicated team to work with members of the community after a series of Asian gold-related burglaries. Officers tracked groups of criminals who were working across the North West, into north Wales and the Midlands.Their operation led to a number of convictions. But Aaron Duggan, head of crime at Cheshire Police, said one of the challenges they face is that gold can be disposed of easily. He added: ""At second-hand outlets, certainly around Asian jewellery, questions should be asked - 'who is this person in front of me selling this gold?' ""The irony is it's often harder in this country to sell scrap metal than it is second-hand jewellery."" Jeweller Sanjay Kumar says people need to think carefully about storage Sanjay Kumar, who specialises in selling Asian gold in Southall, west London, said the jewellery has cultural significance. ""People are told by their parents and grandparents 'you must buy gold - it's an investment, it's lucky'"", he said. ""It's something that we as Asians do, so people are following the tradition and the culture."" He added that he advises his customers to think carefully about how they store it and to make sure that it is insured.

Mueller delivers Trump-Russia report,"President Donald Trump (left) has criticised Robert Mueller's (right) investigation as a ""witch hunt"" Special Counsel Robert Mueller has submitted his long-awaited report on alleged collusion between Russia and President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign. A justice department official said Mr Mueller's report did not recommend any further indictments. Six former Trump aides and a dozen Russians already face unrelated charges in connection with the investigation. The Attorney General William Barr will now summarise the report and decide how much to share with Congress. Mr Barr told congressional leaders in a letter that he anticipated being able to inform them of the report's key findings over the weekend. What might 'Mueller report' look like? Trump Russia: The saga in 250 words Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The report is intended to explain any prosecutorial decisions the special counsel has made in the 22 months since his appointment by deputy US Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Mr Trump and other Republicans have repeatedly condemned the probe as a ""witch hunt"". This video can not be played Mueller is done... this is what we know In his letter to Congress' judiciary committee leaders - Senators Lindsey Graham and Dianne Feinstein and Congressmen Jerrold Nadler and Doug Collins - Mr Barr confirmed there were no instances during the investigation where the Department of Justice had interfered with Mr Mueller's work. The attorney general said he will now consult with Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein - who managed the inquiry prior to Mr Barr's appointment - and Mr Mueller ""to determine what other information from the report can be released to Congress and the public"". ""I remain committed to as much transparency as possible, and I will keep you informed as to the status of my review,"" he said. Over the past 22 months, the special counsel has revealed how Russian agents and operatives allegedly obtained information about US elections to initiate a campaign to influence Americans, fund political activities in the US and hack emails of top Democrats to undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign. Who is special counsel Robert Mueller? What does the special counsel do? Key questions answered in the Trump Russia probe Mr Mueller was also investigating whether Mr Trump obstructed justice with his firing of FBI director James Comey, or by trying to mislead or end the inquiry. Mr Trump has repeatedly said there was ""no collusion"" with Russia and ""no obstruction"". The president refused to sit for an interview with Mr Mueller's team during the inquiry, but his lawyers submitted written answers to questions after months of negotiating terms. Is this how the Mueller investigation ends? Not with a bang, but with a letter? The details of the final report have yet to be disclosed, but because Attorney General Barr has said there were no instances where he or his predecessors overrode the special counsel's prosecutorial decisions - and no new indictments have been announced - it seems possible that what we have seen with the criminal portion of the probe is what we're going to get. There may still be politically damaging revelations to come, but Donald Trump has shrugged off many a political threat in his rise to the White House. Without a criminal caseload directly related to ""collusion"" by members of the Trump campaign - the central thrust of the investigation - it seems certain the president and his White House surrogates will shout from the hilltops that their side has been exonerated. This is far from the end of legal jeopardy for the president, his family, his aides and his business empire, of course. Investigations at both the state and federal level into various financial and campaign finance violations grind on, not to mention the aggressive oversight coming down the pipe from the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. After today's developments, however, the president will continue to claim he is the victim of an unfounded ""witch hunt"". His political adversaries, who were hoping for a courtroom coup de grace, will be left searching for a new silver bullet. This video can not be played How US networks reacted to Mueller news White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement: ""The next steps are up to Attorney General Barr and we look forward to the process taking its course. The White House has not received or been briefed on the Special Counsel's report."" Mr Trump's personal lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jay Sekulow echoed a similar sentiment, saying they were ""pleased"" the report had been delivered and trust Mr Barr to ""determine the appropriate next steps"". Mr Nadler, a New York Democrat, acknowledged the investigation had concluded on Twitter, saying: ""We look forward to getting the full Mueller report and related materials."" Allow Twitter content?

Earlier this month, the House of Representatives voted unanimously for a resolution demanding the Department of Justice release the full report to the public, signalling support within both parties to find out whether Mr  Mueller discovered any criminal wrongdoing. Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also called for transparency in a joint statement, adding that the White House ""must not be allowed to interfere"". ""The Special Counsel's investigation focused on questions that go to the integrity of our democracy itself: whether foreign powers corruptly interfered in our elections, and whether unlawful means were used to hinder that investigation.  The American people have a right to the truth."" Mr Graham, a South Carolina Republican and vocal Trump supporter, said he ""always believed it was important that Mr Mueller be allowed to do his job without interference, and that has been accomplished"". What happens next is in Mr Barr's hands. Legally, the attorney general is under no obligation to release the report publicly, and his copy to Congress could contain redactions, but during his confirmation hearings before senators he vowed to release as much as he could. And if he does provide Congress with the full details, members could leak the report to the public. Seven legal headaches for the president With the 2020 presidential elections looming, candidates are expected to campaign with promises of making the full report public. Many of the Democratic hopefuls - Beto O'Rourke, Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Julian Castro - have called for the full release of the report.

Trump sanctions tweet sparks confusion,"Mr Trump tweeted that ""large-scale"" sanctions had been withdrawn US President Donald Trump has not ordered the withdrawal of recently imposed sanctions against North Korea, administration officials say. Mr Trump caused confusion on Friday when he tweeted that ""additional large-scale sanctions"" would be withdrawn. It was thought he was referring to the treasury's move to blacklist two China-based shipping companies suspected of illegally trading with North Korea. But officials later said he was referring to future sanctions. Citing unnamed administration officials, US media reported that Mr Trump was in fact cancelling measures that had yet to be announced and were scheduled for the coming days. What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? US threw away 'golden opportunity' - N Korea North Korea crisis in 300 words It had been thought that his tweet was referring to sanctions announced by the Treasury on Thursday. Mr Trump sowed further confusion by referring to sanctions he said had been announced on Friday.

Plaid to make health top battlegroundThe party also wants numbers of fast food outlets near schools restricted.Wales politics,"Plaid says it would demand powers to control fast food outlets if it found it needed to Plaid Cymru wants to restrict the number of fast food outlets if it wins the next assembly election, despite ministers saying they lack the powers. Health spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones told the party's spring conference she disagreed with Welsh Labour ministers who say it is not possible. She also said the party would consider tax rises to pay for more social care. Plaid Cymru said it would put the nation's health at the core of its 2021 Welsh Assembly election campaign. It is also promising a Clean Air Act to deal with pollution, including that from traffic and the burning of damp wood in household stoves. Hospital records Wales' worst A&E wait A&E target times worse than last winter Â£35m aims to ease winter NHS pressures In January, Health Minister Vaughan Gething told AMs ""it is not at all clear - in fact, the majority view is that we don't have the powers"" to impose planning rules that would stop fast food outlets opening near schools and leisure centres. He said the Welsh Government had ""argued"" with the UK government about it. But, speaking from the conference in Bangor, Ms Jones told BBC Wales that Plaid Cymru disagreed. ""We believe that the assembly has powers over planning, and local government has clearly got responsibility around licensing,"" she said. ""Of course our health minister is a great one for looking for reasons not to do things."" Plaid Cymru had been advised that it could be done, she said, but if the party took power it would get ""some strong clear views"" first, and demand the powers from Westminster if necessary. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We launched our Healthy Weight: Healthy Wales consultation in January, which outlines actions to help people maintain a healthy weight. ""This includes creating healthy environments to support people to make healthier food choices."" Helen Mary Jones is Plaid Cymru's health spokesperson Ms Jones also said Plaid wanted a Scottish-style social care system which was free at the point of need and funded through taxation. Asked if there would be tax rises to pay for it, she said: ""We wouldn't rule that out. We need to do the sums. ""I believe that is something people would be prepared to pay as an alternative to our older citizens losing their homes and their investments and life savings in order to pay for their own care, which we all know isn't fair."" Any proposals would be ""clearly costed"" before going into the manifesto, Ms Jones added. Plaid Cymru is currently in opposition in the assembly, with 10 AMs, and has four MPs. Opening the final afternoon session of the two-day conference, the party's leader in Westminster, Liz Saville Roberts, focused much of her speech on the prisons and the justice system, including the lack of female jails in Wales. The probation service, she said, had ""put profit before public safety"" when it was partially privatised by UK ministers in 2014. An overhaul of probation, announced last year, means Wales will have no privately-run services when contracts end next year. Liz Saville Roberts: ""We must be masters of our own ship"" Referring to the impasse over Brexit in the House of Commons, Ms Saville Roberts told Plaid Cymru activists ""now is our time"" because ""the government cannot govern and the Labour Party will not oppose"". ""What were the songs the Brexiteers sang but the siren songs of a false dream? And the rocks are nearby and the time to awake is now. ""We must be masters of our own ship,"" she said, a reference to Plaid Cymru's ultimate goal of Welsh independence. The Dwyfor Meirionnydd MP warmly praised a Europe she said had offered Wales the ""practical reality of a helping hand"", ""enriched our communities"" and ""enriched our opportunities to work, to live, to love"". Plaid Cymru is campaigning for another referendum on leaving the EU. Ex-party leader Dafydd Wigley told the BBC a Brexit compromise was attainable across the House of Commons. ""The roadblock to that at present is the leadership of the Conservative Party, who are relying on one formula, and the leadership of the Labour Party, who are just not going to engage, and I believe that it's got to be taken out of their hands,"" he said. ""It's got to be a leadership across parties to get a sensible settlement that looks after our industries, our business, our farmers, our tourism industry, our health dimension. ""All these depend on getting a sensible result. It can be got and for God's sake, let's get it."" Later, another former Plaid leader, Leanne Wood, called for a ""Green New Deal"" for Wales. ""The window of opportunity to save our planet is fast closing upon us,"" she said. ""Wales could - and should - be a pioneer in the movement to develop carbon neutral economies. ""We can lead the way to a sustainable future if there is the right political will."" On Friday, Adam Price, who took over from Ms Wood last September after a leadership contest, saidWales should hold a referendum on independenceif a series of demands on tax and funding were not met after Brexit.

Eleven held in loyalist paramilitary searchesPolice say dawn raids targeting the Ulster Volunteer Force are linked to the murder of Ian Ogle.Northern Ireland'Love and anguish' as teenagers laid to restThree teenagers who died after a St Patrick's Day disco crush in County Tyrone are laid to rest.Northern Ireland,"Ian Ogle died in the street near his home in Cluan Place after he was stabbed and beaten Eleven men have been arrested in a major operation into the criminal activities of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) in east Belfast. The Paramilitary Crime Task Force made the arrests during raids of 14 properties in the greater Belfast, Ards and Comber areas. The men, aged between 22 and 48, are in police custody. The PSNI has linked the operation withthe murder of Ian Ogle in east Belfast. Mr Ogle, 45, died after he was stabbed and beaten in a street near his home on January 27. What is the UVF?,external A history of the UDA,external Analysing a loyalist statement The PSNI said tackling the UVF was a priority for the force because of its drug activities, particularly the supply of Class A drugs. They have confirmed that suspected Class A drugs valued at Â£15,000, ""high value"" vehicles and jewellery and a significant sum of cash were also seized in the raids, which began on Friday morning. These searches around greater Belfast have been in the pipeline for months. It's a pretty significant operation and I've been out with the team since early this morning. We attended a house raid in east Belfast at 07:00 GMT. A team of officers broke the door down and arrested one man inside. Det Supt Bobby Singleton said the UVF were ""nothing more than a drugs gang"" and that the police had a good case against those who had been arrested. ""These gangs aren't there to help the area they're in - they're there to exploit and make money off the community,"" he said. ""This investigation has been ongoing for some time and today's action will likely lead to further action by the Paramilitary Crime Task Force."" The UVF is a loyalist paramilitary group which was responsible for hundreds of murders during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. In some cases its memberscontinue to be heavily involved in violence and crime.

'Love and anguish' as teenagers laid to restThree teenagers who died after a St Patrick's Day disco crush in County Tyrone are laid to rest.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played Funeral services were held on Friday for Morgan Barnard, Lauren Bullock and Connor Currie The head of the Catholic Church in Ireland has said a ""valley of tears"" has been caused by the death of three teenagers at a hotel in County Tyrone. Speaking at the funeral for Morgan Barnard, 17, Archbishop Eamon Martin described the anguish felt by relatives and friends of the children. Morgan, Lauren Bullock, 17, and Connor Currie, 16,died after a crush at the Greenvale Hotelin Cookstown. Hundreds of young people were queuing to get into the St Patrick's Day disco. In pictures: Cookstown victims laid to rest Much loved teens remembered How to talk to traumatised teens The funeral service for Morgan Barnard was the first of the three to take place on Friday Two men, including the hotel owner Michael McElhatton, were arrested on Tuesday on suspicion of manslaughter. Mr McElhatton, 52, has since been released on police bail, as has the other man, who is aged 40. Guards of honour were held at all three funerals. Among the mourners at Morgan's funeral at St Patrick's Church in Dungannon, County Tyrone, were pupils from schools in the town and neighbouring Cookstown and Coalisland. Hundreds of mourners attended the funeral service for Morgan Barnard It was a day when young people clung to everything they could to try to bring some comfort. A friend of Morgan Barnard looked at the teenager's picture on the front of the funeral order of service, shook his head, wiped a tear and said: ""We were lucky to have him."" Between them, the three young victims only lived for 50 years. There were three separate funerals in Dungannon, Donaghmore and Edendork. Many people in the area travelled between the three areas in order to be able to offer their condolences to all three families. Archbishop Martin said: ""Words fail us at times like this. ""All that really matters and makes a difference is love and friendship and compassion. ""The shocking events of Sunday last have reminded us that life is very fragile; we need to cherish every moment and always look for each other and keep each other safe,"" he added. Father Aidan McCann, the curate of Dungannon, said Morgan was ""a vivacious, charismatic and energetic young man who nobody had a bad word to say about. This video can not be played On St Patrick's Day, a crush outside a disco in Cookstown killed Lauren Bullock, Morgan Barnard and Connor Currie. ""Morgan was a person of character with a great sense of humour with an abundance of wit, always a smile on his face."" School pupils at the funeral service for Lauren at St Patrick's Church in Donaghmore, County Tyrone, wore purple ribbons in tribute to the teenager who was an accomplished cheerleader with the Euphoria Allstate Group. Friends and family members carried her pink floral coffin into the church. In his homily, Fr David Moore said St Patrick's Day 2019 would be remembered as the ""awful day when three beautiful young people were overpowered, literally, in the mad rush of our modern world and needlessly lost their lives"". Mourners at Lauren Bullock's funeral heard that she gave her time to do good for others Lauren was a girl with a positive outlook on life, he said. ""She was a girl who was happiest when she was doing things to help others and gave of herself and her time to do a good deed whenever and wherever she could,"" he added. Connor Currie's funeral at St Malachy's Church in Edendork, County Tyrone, was the last of the three to take place. Members of St Malachy's Edendork GAC, who Connor Currie played for, flank his coffin Fr Kevin Donaghy said friends had remembered how Connor ""lit up a room as he entered it and his infectious smile warmed everyone's hearts"". He said the Armagh-born teenager was a ""star on the football field"" as well as a ""conscientious student who had his sights set on doing accountancy"". ""He recently went to the McKenna Cup Final with his Tyrone top on but before leaving he let his Armagh-born mother have a peep to see that he had an Armagh top on underneath the Tyrone one,"" added the priest. ""Connor was going to be a winner either way."" The teenagers' deaths have sparked a major police investigation - the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has identified more than 400 young people who were in the queue or the car park on the night. So far, more than 80 people have been interviewed. Det Ch Supt Raymond Murray said that while most potential witnesses had been identified, if any more were ""still out there"" they should come forward. Officers are examining CCTV footage of the incident and have appealed for any mobile phone footage or photographs of the crush to be passed to investigators. They have asked people in possession of images not to publish them online but to upload them to theMajor Incident Public Portal,external.

Detailed images of baby heart in the womb,"This video can not be played Watch how the foetus jumps around the inside the womb in MRI scan footage Researchers have produced unprecedented images of a baby's heart while it is still inside the womb. Pregnant women were scanned in an MRI machine and powerful computers built 3D models of the tiny beating hearts inside their unborn children. The team at King's College London and Guy's and St Thomas's says it will improve the care of babies with congenital heart disease. The researchers say their approach could easily be adopted by hospitals. Kirbi-Lea and Violet-Vienna Pettitt, now 11 months old Violet-Vienna developed life-threatening abnormalities in the blood vessels around her heart while she was still inside her mother. Problems were first detected when Kirbi-Lea Pettitt went for a routine ultrasound scan 20 weeks into her pregnancy. She then took part in the study to look at her baby's heart in vivid detail. It showed a narrowing of the main artery coming from the heart - the aorta - which would block the blood vessel after birth. Her daughter also had two holes in her heart. ""It was very scary, I was just shell-shocked really,"" Kirbi-Lea told the BBC. But it allowed doctors to plan how to save Violet-Vienna's life after she arrived in the world. ""I wasn't allowed to hold her, they had to take her straight away to put her on medication to keep her aorta open,"" said Kirbi-Lea. Her baby had heart surgery a week later, but after a tricky start is now a healthy 11-month-old. Kirbi-Lea said: ""She's doted on by everyone and she's just thriving - and it's all down to these specialists and this technology. ""It's amazing what they do, it's lifesaving."" BBC correspondent James Gallagher holds a 3D printed model of a baby's heart in the palm of his hand A series of 2D pictures of the heart are taken from different angles using an MRI machine. But the foetal heart is tiny, beats incredibly quickly, and the baby moves around inside the womb so the images of the heart look like a fuzzy blur. But then comes the really clever bit. Sophisticated computer software pieces the images together, adjusts for the beating of the heart and then builds an unprecedented 3D image of the heart. It gives doctors a clear view of the abnormality. This video can not be played See the 3D image of a foetal heart Congenital heart diseases affect up to eight in every 1,000 babies born in the UK. They can be caused by infections and some medicines, and can run in families. NHS: Congenital heart diseases,external Prof Reza Razavi, consultant paediatric cardiologist, wanted to improve the diagnosis of the birth defects after his daughter was born with one. ""We thought we were going to lose her, that was a strong motivator... we should be able to pick up the problem in the womb."" Prof Reza Razavi nearly lost his daughter to congenital heart disease. He describes the 3D images as ""beautiful"" and says they let doctors clearly see the problem and improve care. He told the BBC: ""We can have complete certainty and plan ahead what treatment is needed, what's the operation we need to do. ""It really helps the parents to have the right support to know what's going to happen. ""But it also really helps the babies because they get the right operation at the right time and have the best outcomes."" The study,published in the Lancet,external, shows the 3D imaging worked in 85 pregnant women, but has now been tested on more than 200 patients. Dr David Lloyd, a clinical research fellow at King's College London, said: ""Our hope is this approach will now become standard practice for the Evelina foetal cardiology team, who make a prenatal diagnosis in 400 babies each year. ""This will also improve the care of over 150 babies each year who deliver at St Thomas's Hospital with known congenital heart disease."" He says the technology would be easy to adopt if a hospital already has an MRI machine, because the only new equipment needed would be a computer with a decent graphics card. Pregnant woman having a routine ultrasound scan The research is part of theiFind project,externalto increase the number of health problems picked up during standard pregnancy scans. If they are diagnosed only after birth then vital time can be lost in trying to make a diagnosis. Another approach is to use four ultrasound probes at the same time - current scans use one - to get a more detailed picture.

"Grenfell council spent ÃÂ£90k in bonusesCampaigners call the payments ""abhorrent"", since some households still do not have permanent homes.","Seventy-two people died in the Grenfell Tower fire on 14 June 2017 Bosses at the council responsible for Grenfell Tower received bonuses totalling more than Â£90,000 in the year after the fire, it has emerged. It was also revealed housing staff at the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea had bonuses totalling Â£131,800. A survivors' group called the payments ""abhorrent"" since some households still do not have permanent homes. RBKC said bonuses were based on an employee's ""individual performance"" and the scheme was under ""full review"". The council also said: ""No-one got a bonus specifically for helping respond to the fire."" The fire in north Kensington on 14 June 2017killed 72 people. 'Frustration' at Grenfell charge delay Leaseholders spared Â£10k cladding bill Figures, obtained by the BBC via a freedom of information request, showed 12 employees in leadership roles at the council received a total of Â£93,174 in bonuses in May or June of 2018 - an average payment of Â£7,765 per employee. The council did not respond when the BBC asked for the salary brackets of staff in these positions. The amount spent on annual bonuses for leaders in the local authority has remained broadly stable since 2014/15, the earliest year for which data was provided, with the figure fluctuating between Â£92,418 and Â£99,463. The number of council bosses who received bonuses increased to 12 in 2017/18, from 11 in previous years. In May or June 2018, 52 members of staff working in housing received Â£131,804 in bonuses, an average of Â£2,534 per employee. The council did not say whether there was an overlap between the total figures for bonuses paid to leaders and housing staff. A survivors' group called the bonus payments ""abhorrent"" Both the amount spent on bonuses and the number of staff working on housing at the council increased in 2017/18. In 2016/17, 43 housing staff received Â£103,298 in bonuses between them - an average payment of Â£2,402. Around 21 months after the Grenfell Tower fire, 67 households from the estate have yet to move into permanent homes, according to the latest figures released by the council. Spike Western, a spokesman for the North Kensington Law Centre, which has been working to help rehouse former Grenfell residents, said the council ""certainly has some explaining to do"". He said staff at the local authority had been in a ""difficult situation"", but said homeless survivors had suffered from a ""sub-standard public service"". ""While bonuses are being handed out to staff at town hall, the law centre has been successfully challenging unfair decisions they have made that are causing more stress to the residents,"" he added. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower Campaign group Justice for Grenfell described the payments as ""vulgar"" and said RBKC should ""hang their heads in shame"". ""The fact that they've offered performance-related bonuses shows how desensitised RBKC were and remain to what happened at Grenfell,"" the group said. ""Their barefaced audacity to reward housing staff, when some Grenfell families still do not have permanent homes is abhorrent. ""Public sector workers are entitled to fair remuneration, but when senior managers help themselves to extra, it can only be classed as greed."" Labour MP for Kensington Emma Dent Coad said she was ""disgusted"" by the payments. ""Given the abject misery many Grenfell affected families have been left in, I find it extraordinary that senior staff have been offered bonuses,"" she said. ""They have said that they want to get back to 'business as usual'. Handing out bonuses within a failing service proves they've achieved just that. ""I am genuinely shocked."" A statement from Kensington and Chelsea Council said: ""Our permanent staff are eligible for performance-related pay, based on individual performance, as set out in their legal contract of employment with us. ""This is rigorously assessed every year and the overall scheme is currently subject to a full review."" The statement added that the bonuses relating to pay for staff working in housing cover the whole department - and that includes home building, buying properties, and rehousing people. None of the eligible staff returned their bonuses in light of the tragedy, the council confirmed. 'Frustration' at Grenfell charge delay Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims?

Tag gives 'instant fix' on dead eaglesBirds of prey are being fitted with the device as part of a trial in the Cairngorms.Highlands & Islands,"Some golden eagles will be fitted with the new technology over the next 18 months A new type of satellite tag for tracking birds of prey is being trialled in the Cairngorms National Park. Over the next 18 months, some young golden eagles will be fitted with the Raptor Tracker. Organisations involved in the project said the tag should provide better information on the birds' movements. It should also give an ""instant fix"" on any eagles that die, which would help in efforts to tackle wildlife crime. Several organisations are involved in the project, including the Cairngorms National Park Authority, Scottish Natural Heritage and British Trust for Ornithology. They said tags in current use were ""limited"" in what information they could provide on the exact location of any bird which dies. The new device uses a satellite network that ensures that signal information is always available. The project team said that the new tag's multiple sensors can send a ""distress signal"" with an exact location if unusual behaviour is detected. This early warning system has the added benefit of helping to rapidly identify and recover birds which have died, said the team. The new tag will provide more information on the movement and behaviour of golden eagles in the Cairngorms Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said the trial should improve understanding of the behaviour of the Cairngorms' golden eagles. She said: ""The tags should make a real difference in deterring would-be criminals, as well as playing a key role in establishing exactly what happened, should any of these magnificent birds of prey disappear or die in unusual circumstances."" Grant Moir, of the national park authority, said: ""Raptor conservation and tackling wildlife crime is one of the aims of the recently launched Cairngorms Nature Action Plan 2019-2023. ""This is an exciting breakthrough in the technology around raptor conservation, understanding the birds and combating wildlife crime.""

"Libby Squire death 'potential homicide'Police say the 21-year-old student, whose body was found in the Humber estuary, may have been killed.","Libby Squire was last seen in the early hours of 1 February The death of Hull student Libby Squire is being treated as ""a potential homicide"", Humberside Police has said. The 21-year-old's body was found in the Humber estuary on Wednesday, seven weeks after she went missing following a night out on 1 February. Detectives said she could have been killed but ""would not be releasing results of a post-mortem examination for investigative reasons"". Det Supt Martin Smalley said ""one man remains under investigation"". He said: ""In regards to our investigation, while we have considered throughout the missing person inquiry that Libby may have come to some harm, Libby's death and the recovery of her body now leads us to solely investigate as a potential homicide. ""The post-mortem examination concluded late last night and at this stage, we will not be releasing any results for investigative and operational reasons."" An inquest into her death is due to open and adjourn on Monday. Flowers and tributes have been left on a bench in Hull's Beverley Road where Ms Squire was last seen Det Supt Smalley said specially trained officers were continuing to support Ms Squire's family. ""Our thoughts remain today with Libby's family and friends at this incredibly sad and devastating time for them,"" he said. ""Libby captured the hearts of not just the people in Hull, but across the country, and as I have said before, the support shown has been overwhelming and my sincerest thanks to absolutely everyone who has been involved."" Hull Minster has invited people to light a candle in memory of the student Libby's body was recovered at around 15:30 GMT on Wednesday close to Spurn Point and taken to Grimsby Docks. A major police inquiry saw hundreds of officers and about 50 detectives search for the student. On the night of her disappearance, police believe Ms Squire got a taxi at the Welly Club music venue before arriving at her student house in Wellesley Avenue at about 23:30 on 31 January, where her mobile phone was found. They think she did not enter the house and have said her phone ""has not provided any further insight as to her movements that night"". She was spotted on CCTV 10 minutes later near a bench on Beverley Road, where it is thought a motorist stopped to offer her help. The bench has become a focal point for those wishing to remember Ms Squire, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and floral tributes have been left at the site.
