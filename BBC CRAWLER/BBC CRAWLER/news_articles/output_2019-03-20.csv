Driver hijacks school bus full of children,"The bus crashed into three other vehicles before the driver eventually got out A bus carrying 51 schoolchildren was hijacked by its driver and set alight near Milan in Italy. The children, some of them tied up, were rescued through smashed windows at the back of the bus and no-one was badly hurt. Fourteen people suffered smoke inhalation. The driver, a 47-year-old Italian citizen originally from Senegal, has been arrested. ""No-one will survive,"" the driver was alleged to have said. ""It was a miracle, it could have been a massacre,"" Milan chief prosecutor Francesco Greco was quoted as saying. A teacher who had been on the bus said the suspect - named by police as Ousseynou Sy - was known to be angry about Italy's immigration policy and about the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean. ""He shouted, 'Stop the deaths at sea, I'll carry out a massacre',"" police spokesman Marco Palmieri said. Italy government backs 'anti-migrant' bill Migrants allowed on land after stand-off Why known extremists can carry out terror attacks Prosecutors said the suspect faced charges of kidnapping, attempted mass murder, causing a fire and resisting arrest. Mr Greco said officials were still weighing terrorism charges against him. The suspect was known to police, having been previously convicted of assault and for driving while intoxicated, Alberto Nobili, head of counter-terrorism at the Milan public prosecutor's office, told a news conference. Two classes of teenagers and their adult supervisors were being driven from a school in Vailati di Crema to a gym but the driver suddenly took a different route, apparently heading for Milan's Linate airport, reports said. When the suspect began threatening passengers with a knife, a boy phoned his parents who alerted the police. Officers then tried to intercept the bus. The vehicle rammed into police cars before slowing down. Parents collected their children from police after the bus rescue Once the bus stopped, the driver jumped off and set it alight, having already doused it in petrol. Police were able to smash the rear windows and get passengers off before the vehicle was engulfed in flames. ""It was a miracle they [the children] survived and we have to thank the Carabinieri for that,"" Mr Greco said. Interior ministry officials are investigating the possibility of annulling the driver's Italian citizenship, the AFP news agency reports. A decree issued in September makes it easier to deport migrants and take away their citizenship if they commit serious crimes. Since coming into power in June, Italy's ruling right-wing League party and populist Five Star Movement have established a strong anti-immigration stance. Located at the frontline of migrants crossing the Mediterranean Sea into Europe, Italy has tried to close its ports to boats. On Tuesday, around 50 people were rescued by a charity ship from a rubber boat off the coast of Libya and taken to the island of Lampedusa. Italian authorities ordered that the ship be seized and launched an investigation into the alleged aiding of clandestine immigration. Earlier this month,around 200,000 people attended an anti-racism march in Milan.

"Trump complains about John McCain funeral""Not my kind of guy,"" the president says of the late Republican senator in his latest attack on him.US & Canada","Mr Trump made the remarks during a visit to a tank factory in Ohio US President Donald Trump has attacked the late Senator John McCain, complaining that he ""didn't get a thank you"" for his state funeral. ""We sent him on the way, but I wasn't a fan of John McCain,"" the president said during a visit to an Ohio tank factory. Mr Trump has repeatedly assailed the late Arizona senator in recent days, reigniting a feud that dates back to before his presidency. The Vietnam War veteran died of brain cancer last August at the age of 81. During his visit on Wednesday to the tank factory in Lima, Ohio, the president renewed his assault on McCain. The pair clashed frequently before and during Mr Trump's presidency ""I gave him the kind of funeral that he wanted, which as president I had to approve,"" he told workers at the factory. ""I don't care about this, I didn't get a thank you. That's OK."" Mr Trump approved the military flight of McCain's remains from Arizona to Washington, but it was Congress that accorded the late senator the honour of lying in state. The key moments in John McCain's life The angry politics of McCain's death The US president said McCain ""didn't get the job done for our great vets and the VA"" by refusing to repeal Obamacare and attacked him for ""a war in the Middle East"", in reference to the senator's support for the Iraq War. ""Not my kind of guy,"" the president said. ""But some people like him and I think that's great."" The president revived his spat with McCain on Saturday by tweeting that the late senator had backed the so-called Steele dossier, an unverified 2016 document by a former British intelligence officer, Christopher Steele, claiming ties between Mr Trump and the Kremlin. On Sunday, Mr Trump went after McCain again, saying the ""last in his class"" senator had sent ""the Fake Dossier to the FBI"". Asked by a reporter about his attacks while hosting the Brazilian president at the White House on Tuesday, Mr Trump said: ""I was never a fan of John McCain and I never will be."" Mr Trump has regularly clashed with McCain going back to his presidential campaign. Five times McCain clashed with Trump By Anthony Zurcher, BBC senior North America reporter Donald Trump is feuding with a dead man. It all began in 2015 when John McCain condemned then-candidate Trump's allegation that Mexico was sending rapists into the US. Mr Trump responded by questioning the Arizona senator's heroism as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. At the time there was a chorus of condemnation from across the Republican Party and predictions that the New York businessman's White House hopes were ruined. It didn't turn out that way, of course. Mr Trump not only won the White House, he has moulded the Republican Party in his own populist, pugilistic image. Now Mr Trump's outbursts against the late senator are met mostly with silence from within his own party. Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson stands out as one of the few to sharply rebuke the president's remarks. Mr Trump clearly believes leaning into this now one-sided fight benefits him politically. There are plenty of conservatives who never liked McCain, and they will love the president even more for not backing down. The feud helped launch Mr Trump's presidential bid, and it's a wave he will ride till the very end. This video can not be played McCain widow - I'll never get over Trump slur Mr Trump's attacks this week on McCain have drawn sharp condemnation from across the political spectrum, with Republican Senator Johnny Isakson calling the remarks ""deplorable"". ""The country deserves better, the McCain family deserves better,"" Mr Isakson told the conservative Bulwark news site,external, arguing that when the president insults ""the most decorated senator in history... it just sets the worst tone possible"". His Republican colleague, Senator Lindsay Graham, called McCain ""an American hero"" and said Mr Trump's comments ""hurt him more than they hurt the legacy of Senator McCain"". Allow Twitter content?

'Tell the world we are suffering',"This video can not be played Cyclone Idai: Survivors rescued by land and air Mozambique's port city of Beira is reeling from the damage inflicted by Cyclone Idai. So far 200 people have been confirmed dead in the southern African country, along with another 100 in neighbouring Zimbabwe, but the death toll could be much higher. Those who survived the disaster have had little reprieve to mourn the loss of their loved ones or salvage the little that is remaining of their belongings. They are in desperate need of food, shelter and clothing, as the BBC's Pumza Fihlani reports from Beira. Inside a makeshift response centre at the airport in Beira, aid agencies are scrambling to get to those still trapped across the region. It's the first point of call for all the teams coming in from around the world and offers the first glimpse of how heavily this operation is relying on outside help. A few kilometres away, panic is setting in. The people of Beira are growing anxious - help is coming, but it is really slow and not nearly enough. ""I have nothing. I have lost everything. We don't have food. I don't even have blankets. We need help,"" one woman tells me as we make our way through the village of Manhava. Most of the port city of Beira is under water Beira's geography, with parts of it lying below sea level, has always made it vulnerable to effects of extreme weather like Cyclone Ida which made landfall last week with winds of up to 177 km/h (106 mph). The city bore the full brunt of the destructive storm, which triggered flooding of the whole city and knocked down buildings and cut off roads. This is now stalling rescuers from reaching desperate people in need. The devastation in pictures 'My hotel haven for cyclone homeless' What's climate change got to do with it? Some people here are trying to salvage what they can to create shelter. Those who can are repairing their metal roofs, while others are tying together pine branches to sleep under. Homes have been damaged, some even completely destroyed, and there are pools of water everywhere. Some people have been trying to repair their houses A local church has become a temporary home for scores of people. Half of its roof was blown off, but the walls have held and to some it is better than being out in the cold. Floodwaters have cut off roads and knocked down buildings The UN has said that Cyclone Idai triggered a ""massive disaster"" in southern Africa, affecting hundreds of thousands if not millions of people. Neighbouring Zimbabwe and Malawi have also been affected by the freak storm that has caused the deaths of dozens and displacement of thousands of people. Everyone we come across here is begging us to come into their homes to show us what they have lost and how nature has stolen from them. We are the first people they have seen since the cyclone hit on Thursday night. ""Please help us. Tell the world we are suffering. We don't know where we are going to sleep,"" says Pedro, a father of three children - all under the age of 10. The residents here feel like they have been forgotten. A UN camp for the people displaced in Beira As the full picture of this crisis slowly becomes clear, there are questions about whether the government of Mozambique could have done more to prepare for the disaster. The floods of the year 2000 claimed hundreds of lives and yet some here feel lessons have not been learned. ""Our city was destroyed so easily because our infrastructure is not taken care of.  Every time there is a problem here we need foreign countries to save us. What is our government doing, what is our own plan?"" our driver asks me. Back at the airport, a helicopter has just landed and rescue workers rush out, carrying in their arms children whose eyes are wide with fear. ""Many villages have been washed away. We found women and children holding on to trees. We are doing what we can,"" said one of the rescuers. Many of those trapped are trying to get to higher ground but persistent rainfall has been hampering rescue operations. Those rescued are being taken to a network of 56 camps dotted across the region. More rains are expected and those who made it to safety are the lucky ones. Mozambique President Felipe Nyusi has said more than 100,000 people are at risk - and there is growing concern that help may not get to them in time.

UK survivor 'cradled woman' in NZ shooting,"This video can not be played The British man who survived the NZ mosque attack: ""The best ones are not coming home"" A British survivor of the Christchurch shootings has described how he cradled the body of a young woman killed amid the gunfire. Nathan Smith, who converted to Islam after moving to New Zealand 13 years ago, found the woman after he escaped over a wall at the Al Noor mosque. The father of three, originally from Poole in Dorset, said he wants to find her husband to know that he survived. Fifty people died and dozens were hurt in the attack at two mosques on Friday. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, has been charged with murder. Floral tributes have been left outside the Al Noor Mosque Mr Smith, who has two daughters in New Zealand and a son who lives in the UK, described how the horror unfolded. At first, he thought he heard ""firecrackers"" or ""electrical problems"" going on outside as the Imam began speaking. ""Then, all of a sudden it was becoming louder and louder,"" he said. ""The windows started going out, I could see people just falling forward. People standing up and just falling."" Who were the Christchurch victims? Mosque witness 'prayed for bullets to end' He said those who were shot around him said ""Allahu Akbar"" as they fell to the ground. Mr Smith managed to escape through the back of the mosque and ran to his car - dialling the New Zealand emergency number 111. When the gunfire briefly stopped, he said one man, who often helped at the mosque, returned inside. He never came out. In the car park, Mr Smith saw survivor Farid Ahmed take shelter behind a car, but another worshipper was shot. This video can not be played Farid Ahmed: ""I have forgiven him and I will pray for him"" When the firing started again and someone said the gunman was coming out, he escaped over a wall. ""I wasn't scared there was no time (to be) it was just reaction. I just went over,"" he said. He found a young woman lying in the road beside the mosque. He said: ""I can see she's been shot so I crouch down and try to roll her over."" He added: ""Now people are coming out of the Masjid (mosque) shouting and crying and people are being shot so I take my jersey off and I put it over this girl. ""I didn't know her name and I don't know where she's from at the time. I'm just holding her, I don't know why but I'm stroking her back - she's already dead."" Father and son in first NZ mosque funeral Ardern calls for global anti-racism fight He said he spent hours at a community centre in the hope of finding her husband. ""I was just hoping to catch a glimpse of her husband. I need to find him. I don't know his name. I just need to know he's okay. Friends who he had come to think of as ""second family"" were also killed, he said. Mr Smith has hardly slept since Friday, with memories of the victims, of the smells and sounds keeping him awake. ""The emotions just keep coming. You're okay for a few minutes or an hour and then it just comes back and you remember something that you didn't remember before. ""Fifty people dead. And the bodies were stacked on top of each other. People just falling. The windows going out. I can't explain it. ""How I got out I don't know. All my friend's dead and me not a scratch."" He said he feels ""proud"" of how New Zealanders have responded in the wake of the horror. ""People here have been good . They've looked after us,"" he said.

Now Mr Trump's outbursts against the late senator are met mostly with silence from within his own party. Georgia Senator Johnny Isakson stands out as one of the few to sharply rebuke the president's remarks. Mr Trump clearly believes leaning into this now one-sided fight benefits him politically. There are plenty of conservatives who never liked McCain, and they will love the president even more for not backing down. The feud helped launch Mr Trump's presidential bid, and it's a wave he will ride till the very end. This video can not be played McCain widow - I'll never get over Trump slur Mr Trump's attacks this week on McCain have drawn sharp condemnation from across the political spectrum, with Republican Senator Johnny Isakson calling the remarks ""deplorable"". ""The country deserves better, the McCain family deserves better,"" Mr Isakson told the conservative Bulwark news site,external, arguing that when the president insults ""the most decorated senator in history... it just sets the worst tone possible"". His Republican colleague, Senator Lindsay Graham, called McCain ""an American hero"" and said Mr Trump's comments ""hurt him more than they hurt the legacy of Senator McCain"". Allow Twitter content?

Fears over Instagram eating disorder posts,"This video can not be played 'My anorexia really loved Instagram' Content on Instagram that encourages eating disorders is ""spiralling out of control"", psychiatrists have warned. A BBC investigation found children swapping graphic images of weight loss and advice on how to make their illnesses more extreme. Dr Jon Goldin, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said ""vulnerable"" people were finding peer groups online. Instagram says it does not allow content encouraging or promoting eating disorders and removes it when aware. In January,the case of 14-year-old Molly Russell,who took her own life after viewing self-harm images, led to widespread criticism of Instagram. After public pressure the platform owned by Facebook announced a wide-ranging review and committed to removing all graphic self-harm images from the platform. But the BBC has found that posts, hashtags, images and search terms promoting and glamorising eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia are common on Instagram. Many of the posted images are of emaciated young women often accompanied by instructions on extreme dieting and methods for avoiding scrutiny by parents. Governments v social media Social media companies 'failing children' Facebook pledges to do more on self-harm 'Instagram stars are selling anorexia' Some users will praise others for efforts to lose extreme amounts of weight. Many of those posting such content will also include their ""target"" or ""goal"" weight - often dangerously low. Posts, hashtags and images on Instagram like these promote eating disorders There is evidence too of children searching for so-called ""ana buddies"" - others who can help them make their illness more extreme. In one exchange a user said: ""If you're ages 13-14 comment below"", concluding with the words ""I can't do it alone"". Her post received a stream of replies. One user said ""I can fast and I'm 14"", and another wrote ""I can totally do it with you"". Finally, one user said: ""I'm a little younger than that but I need a buddy too."" Figures obtained by BBC News from NHS Digital show a rise of more than 130% in those aged 19 and under suffering from eating disorders being admitted to hospital in England since 2011. In 2018 there were more than 2,000 admissions for children aged 15 or under - up by 163% on 2011. Jodie-Leigh Neil says Instagram ""fuelled"" her eating disorder. ""The pictures on there were so graphic - just skin and bones really. Anorexia would make you believe you are bigger than that.... And Instagram reinforced that with the comments of 'I feel so fat' all over those posts."" Jodie-Leigh says if she had not received medical treatment she would have died. She and her mother, Julie, now use Instagram to offer advice and fight back against damaging content. Rose Anne Evans also believes Instagram played a major part in her illness and says even when in hospital the platform bombarded her with recommendations to look at harmful content. ""I'd just get all these suggestions of weight loss hashtags... It just made it easier and in a way... tempting to dip my foot back into the eating disorder world."" Many of the patients treated for eating disorders by Dr Goldin, vice-chairman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' child and adolescent faculty, use Instagram and other social media platforms. ""It's deeply worrying and to some extent the situation is spiralling out of control"", he said.  ""It glamorises eating disorders."" Many of Dr Goldin's patients are often socially isolated and look for a peer group Dr Goldin added: ""Young people with eating disorders are quite vulnerable, they are often socially isolated, they don't have friends and they are looking for a peer group."" Thecharity Beat,externalsays the main signs to watch out for are: becoming obsessive about food changes in behaviour having distorted beliefs about their body size often tired or struggling to concentrate disappearing to the toilet after meals starting to exercise excessively If youâve been affected byeating disorders, help and support is available via theBBC Action Line Instagram and other platforms banned certain hashtags and searches around eating disorders in 2012. But research by Dr Ysabel Gerrard, a lecturer in digital media and society at the University of Sheffield, found users adopted different hashtags and search terms. ""I think that there is still content on Instagram that should not be there,"" Dr Gerrard said. Her main concern is the algorithm which recommends more of the content people have liked or accessed. ""It creates almost this rabbit hole, where you go further and further down itâ¦ the platform thinks that's what you want to see."" Instagram also already offers links to help and support and promotes helplines run by charities. And Dr Gerrard does not advocate removing pro-eating disorder accounts, saying keeping them live allows the platform to offer help. Instagram is reviewing how it deals with content on eating disorders Tara Hopkins, head of public policy for Instagram, says the platform does not allow content that encourages or promotes eating disorders but insists it is a complex issue. ""Many people recovering from eating disorders use Instagram in a positive way to get support for themselves and support others,"" she adds. Instagram is reviewing how it deals with ""self-injury content"" - which includes eating disorders - and Ms Hopkins said it expects to ""make some adjustments to our policy enforcement, including classifying more content as promotion, so more is removed"". Beat, a UK-based charity offering advice and support on eating disorders, wants social media firms to block harmful content. Its director of external affairs, Tom Quinn, said: ""The government must take whatever steps necessary to ensure that content that promotes eating disorders is not available."" Government proposals on reducing ""internet harms"" have been delayed several times but are due to be published before the end of the month. Ministers have spoken about the need to create a statutory duty of care for online platforms and the possibility of setting up an independent regulator.

Media 'must deny terrorists a voice',"The UK media must not help terrorists by showing ""harmful"" content in their coverage of incidents, Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer says. Neil Basu said a ""sensible conversation"" was needed,externalabout how incidents like the Christchurch attack should be reported. Several UK newspaper websites used film taken by suspected gunman or posted links to his so-called ""manifesto"". Mr Basu said it was wrong to ""hide behind the mantra"" of free speech. The attacks in Christchurch on Friday, the deadliest in New Zealand's history, happened as people were attending prayers at two mosques. Fifty people were killed and dozens more were injured. The gunman videoed his rampage and streamed the images live on social media. Ardern calls for global anti-racism fight Who were the Christchurch victims? The rising new threat of far-right violence Police in Christchurch asked social media users not to share the footage or links to a document the alleged gunman posted online about his motives. Social media companies like YouTube and Facebook raced to take the footage down,but it was still published on the front pages of some of the world's biggest news websites - including in the UK and Australia - in the form of still images, gifs, and even the full video. The Sun, Daily Mail and Daily Mirror all put edited footage on their websites, although the latter removed it soon afterwards. The Mirror's editor, Lloyd Embley, later apologised,explaining in a tweet,externalthe film should not have been carried as it was not in line with its policy relating to terrorist propaganda videos. The decision to disseminate the material prompted anger from people who argued that was exactly what the attacker had wanted. MailOnline did eventually remove a link to the alleged gunman's document from its site, and released a statement saying it was ""an error"". Neil Basu's open letter will inevitably stir up a debate about where the balance lies between freedom of speech and national security. And that is clearly what he wants. His frustration about the mainstream media's coverage of the New Zealand gun attack, and terrorism more broadly, seeps from the page. It strongly suggests that the Met Assistant Commissioner has seen compelling evidence of the impact of such reporting, as opposed to a theoretical concern. Nevertheless, criticising newspapers in the way he has runs the risk of losing support among those who are well placed to convey important police messages. Mr Basu clearly believes that's a risk worth taking. Assistant Commissioner Basu's open letter said it was ""time to have a sensible conversation about how to report terrorism in a way that doesn't help terrorists"". He said the same media organisations who have criticised social media platforms for not acting fast enough to remove extremist content have published ""uncensored propaganda"" of the Islamic State or made the ""rambling 'manifestos' of crazed killers available for download"". Freedom of speech ""is not an absolute right, it is not the freedom to cause harm"", Mr Basu said. Urging editors to debate the issue with survivors of terrorism and police, Mr Basu added: ""Anyone who seeks to deny the negative effects that promoting terrorist propaganda can have, should think carefully about the massive global effort to remove terrorist content from social media platforms and the pressure that governments, law enforcement and, ironically, the mass media has put on those companies to cleanse their sites."" He said extremist propaganda that might reach tens of thousands of people through their own channels or networks has a potential reach of tens of millions when a national newspaper published it. ""We must recognise this as harmful to our society and security,"" he said.

She urged her political colleagues to do the same.

EU backs Brexit delay but only with deal,"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: Extension possible but conditional on positive Brexit vote The EU will only agree to a short delay to Brexit if MPs approve the current withdrawal agreement next week, Theresa May has been told. EU Council President Donald Tusk said an extension, requested by the prime minister on Wednesday, was possible. Mrs May has written to Mr Tusk requesting a Brexit delay to 30 June, saying she needed more time to get her deal agreed by MPs and passed into law. The PM will be making a statement from Downing Street at 20:15 GMT. Mr Tusk said he believed all 27 other EU members, who must sign off on the extension, would agree but it depended on a ""positive"" vote in the House of Commons. The length of any extension was open for discussion, he told reporters in Brussels. The UK is due to leave the EU next Friday, on 29 March. In full: May's Brexit delay letter to EU LIVE: Reaction to Brexit delay Brexit: What could happen next? While a delay until 30 June ""had its merits"", Mr Tusk also suggested there were ""political and legal"" questions about delaying Brexit beyond 23 May - when European elections will be held. While the current withdrawal agreement could not be changed, he suggested additional legal assurances the EU gave Mrs May in Strasbourg last week could be formalised to help get the backing of MPs.

The prime minister is meeting MPs from opposition parties to discuss her letter. But ahead of the meeting, the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, Lib Dem leader Vince Cable MP, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts and the Green Party MP Caroline Lucas released a joint statement, calling for a longer extension and for Parliament to sit continuously ""until it can reach a decision"".

She said she had rejected calls for a longer delay to Brexit because she wanted to avoid the UK taking part in European elections in May, which she said would be ""unacceptable"" three years after voting to leave the EU. ""It would be a failure to deliver on the referendum decision this House said it would deliver,"" she told the Commons. But she added: ""As prime minister I could not consider a further delay beyond 30 June."" This was seen by some as an indication that Mrs May would resign rather than seek a further delay.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused her of leading the UK into ""crisis, chaos and division"". ""We are still legally due to leave the European Union in nine days' time,"" he told Mrs May at PMQs. ""Months of running down the clock and a concerted campaign of blackmail, bullying and bribery has failed to convince the House or the country that her deal is anything but a damaging national failure and should be rejected."" He urged the prime minister to meet him later on Wednesday to discuss a ""compromise to get through this crisis"", a plea ignored by the PM. The Labour leader will travel to Brussels on Thursday to meet the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier. He is also expected to hold talks with several EU 27 leaders. In her letter to Mr Tusk, the prime minister says she had wanted to hold a Commons vote on her withdrawal agreement this week but had been prevented from doing so by Commons Speaker John Bercow. But she adds: ""It remains my intention to bring the deal back to the House."" If the motion is passed, more time will be needed for Parliament to ratify the deal, she says. There is no mention in the letter of a longer delay, as some had been expecting. This video can not be played Is the UK in a crisis over leaving the EU? Mrs May, who has been meeting groups of cabinet ministers on Wednesday afternoon, told MPs that an extension beyond 30 June would not ""take no-deal off the table"" if an agreement had still not been reached. She has repeatedly insisted the UK would leave the EU on 29 March and she told MPs it had always been her preferred option, but with a withdrawal deal to ensure it was an ""orderly"" exit. But she was forced to seek a delay after MPs twice rejected the withdrawal deal she has agreed with the EU by massive margins and voted to reject a no-deal Brexit. Her plan to hold a third vote on the deal this week were blocked by the Speaker, John Bercow, who said it would break longstanding conventions preventing MPs from being repeatedly asked the same question. The UK is still by law due to leave the EU on 29 March - with or without a deal Theresa May has written to European Council President Donald Tusk asking for a three month extension to the leave date, taking it to 30 June The PM says this will give her enough time to win over MPs to support her deal in Parliament and get legislation through Mrs May has rejected calls for a longer delay, saying she wants to avoid the UK having to take part in this year's European Parliament elections But a document from the European Commission, seen by the BBC, says if the UK stays in the EU beyond 23 May, it will have to hold elections The 1922 Committee of Tory backbenchers is due to meet this evening Mrs May will make a statement from Downing Street at 20:15 GMT The prime minister will travel to Brussels on Thursday for a summit with the other 27 EU leaders This video can not be played Conservative MP to May: ""History will judge you at this moment"".

He urged her to ""develop a backbone and stand up to those who would take this nation to disaster"". Yvette Cooper - one of a string of Labour MPs to call for ""indicative votes"" on different alternatives to Mrs May's Brexit deal - accused the PM of harming the national interest, adding: ""I beg this prime minister to think again.""

"Kuenssberg: A risky pitch of Parliament versus PublicTheresa May says she is on the voter's side, but she needs to win over MPs to get her Brexit deal agreed.","It's not me - it's them. Theresa May has pitched herself tonight against Parliament on the side of the people. It's true that No 10 believes strongly that swathes of the population have simply had enough of Brexit. The way it drowns out other public concerns, the way its processes, contradictions and clamour have wrapped their way around the normal workings of Westminster - remote at the best of times and downright bizarre at the worst. But, when it is MPs the prime minister needs to get on side if she is to have a real chance of finally getting her deal through next week - third time extremely lucky - the choice of message was not without risk. 'Tired' public needs Brexit decision, says PM EU backs Brexit delay but only with deal Brexit: What could happen next? On her own side, some MPs have openly questioned the merit of her evening at the podium - toxic and delusional are some of the descriptions given. Yet Theresa May's allies say, at this vital moment, she felt it imperative to express that she has a line - staying in the EU three years after the referendum - that she is not, as prime minister, willing to cross. For those Brexiteers who want her gone, that is not, it's understood, a promise that she would quit in return for support for her deal. But No 10 must know too that choice, her fate, is not just in her hands, but in Parliament's and, as she prepares to travel to Brussels, in the grasp of the European Union.

"'Unprecedented' drug shortage linked to BrexitHospitals in England are experiencing a ""spike"" in medicine shortages, an NHS leader tells BBC Newsnight.Health","Hospitals across England are experiencing medicine shortages because of ""stockpiling and price pressure as the Brexit deadline approaches"", NHS Providers has told BBC Newsnight. The trade association warned some trusts had seen shortages of up to 160 different drugs in the past six weeks. This was compared with just 25 to 30 drugs in normal times, it said. The Department of Health said there was ""no evidence"" the ""small number of supply issues"" were related to Brexit. Mental health drugs and those used to treat rarer conditions are among the drugs reportedly affected by shortages. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts in England, told Newsnight one trust in England had reported a shortage of 300 different drugs. ""Trusts up and down the country are telling us that they have experienced a sharp spike in shortages of drugs in the past month,"" she said. ""We cannot confirm with absolute certainty that it is Brexit but the timing and unprecedented nature of these shortages suggest a correlation with Brexit preparation. ""This most probably is the impact of a combination of stockpiling and price pressure as the Brexit deadline approaches. We have not seen a spike like this before."" No-deal Brexit: Should patients worry? Brexit: What could happen next? Pharmacists warn of medicine shortage Ms Cordery's warning follows a meeting this week of leaders from NHS Trusts across England. She said hospital chiefs were reporting shortages of hundreds of different types of medicines, including those used to treat cardiac problems and high blood pressure. The south-west of England and London are particularly affected, according to hospital bosses. It is not thought that any patients have yet been directly affected by the reported shortages - but Ms Cordery warned that further uncertainty over Brexit could have a negative impact on the treatment of some conditions. She said: ""Because we are talking about kind of drugs that are needed when someone needs hospital care, it would seem very likely that if these drugs are not available, then this would ultimately have a serious impact on a patient's condition and the quality of care they receive. ""Obviously what we think about first and foremost is the impact on patients. ""Trusts are getting by at the moment. Whilst we aren't seeing direct impact on patients, if it continues in this way, obviously ultimately will have an impact."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock last year advised pharmaceutical companies to stockpile six weeks' worth of medical supplies and urged patients themselves not to stockpile. Mark Dayan, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said: ""Stockpiling might be a plausible mechanism for price rises and therefore shortages. ""It is possible to see how we could be getting a foretaste of the impact of [a no-deal Brexit] on medicine supplies now."" A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""We have well established procedures to deal with any disruption to the supply chain and our plans to ensure patients can continue to receive the medicines they need, whatever the outcome of negotiations, are well advanced. ""All NHS chiefs have been given all necessary information and we are confident that if everyone does what they need to do, the supply of medicines should be uninterrupted in the event of exiting the EU without a deal.""

"Hen party mum to be buried in wedding dressRuth Maguire, 30, drowned after becoming separated from friends on a hen weekend in Carlingford.","Ruth Maguire's funeral mass will be held on Saturday morning A mother-of-three who drowned on a hen weekend in the Republic of Ireland is to be buried in her wedding dress. Ruth Maguire, 30, went missing overnight on Saturday in Carlingford, County Louth. Herbody was recovered from the water on Monday afternoon; Irish police said they were treating the incident as ""a tragic accident"". The funeral of the County Down woman, who had been due to marry in August, will be held in Belfast this weekend. Her family said she would be buried in her wedding dress at Carnmoney Cemetery following a funeral Mass on Saturday morning at St Vincent de Paul Church, Ligoniel. Ruth's sister Rachel Wilkinsontold the Belfast Telegraph,externalher sister had been very organised about her wedding, which would have taken place in front of 180 family and friends. She said Ms Maguire's three children had been due to be part of the bridal party. ""She was getting married on 8 August. Everything was ready,"" she said. ""We are going to let her wear her wedding dress in her coffin."" Ms Wilkinson said she believed her sister lost her bearings on Saturday night when she got separated from the 32-strong group after leaving a bar.

'Unprecedented' drug shortage linked to Brexit,"Hospitals across England are experiencing medicine shortages because of ""stockpiling and price pressure as the Brexit deadline approaches"", NHS Providers has told BBC Newsnight. The trade association warned some trusts had seen shortages of up to 160 different drugs in the past six weeks. This was compared with just 25 to 30 drugs in normal times, it said. The Department of Health said there was ""no evidence"" the ""small number of supply issues"" were related to Brexit. Mental health drugs and those used to treat rarer conditions are among the drugs reportedly affected by shortages. Saffron Cordery, deputy chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents trusts in England, told Newsnight one trust in England had reported a shortage of 300 different drugs. ""Trusts up and down the country are telling us that they have experienced a sharp spike in shortages of drugs in the past month,"" she said. ""We cannot confirm with absolute certainty that it is Brexit but the timing and unprecedented nature of these shortages suggest a correlation with Brexit preparation. ""This most probably is the impact of a combination of stockpiling and price pressure as the Brexit deadline approaches. We have not seen a spike like this before."" No-deal Brexit: Should patients worry? Brexit: What could happen next? Pharmacists warn of medicine shortage Ms Cordery's warning follows a meeting this week of leaders from NHS Trusts across England. She said hospital chiefs were reporting shortages of hundreds of different types of medicines, including those used to treat cardiac problems and high blood pressure. The south-west of England and London are particularly affected, according to hospital bosses. It is not thought that any patients have yet been directly affected by the reported shortages - but Ms Cordery warned that further uncertainty over Brexit could have a negative impact on the treatment of some conditions. She said: ""Because we are talking about kind of drugs that are needed when someone needs hospital care, it would seem very likely that if these drugs are not available, then this would ultimately have a serious impact on a patient's condition and the quality of care they receive. ""Obviously what we think about first and foremost is the impact on patients. ""Trusts are getting by at the moment. Whilst we aren't seeing direct impact on patients, if it continues in this way, obviously ultimately will have an impact."" Health Secretary Matt Hancock last year advised pharmaceutical companies to stockpile six weeks' worth of medical supplies and urged patients themselves not to stockpile. Mark Dayan, of the Nuffield Trust think tank, said: ""Stockpiling might be a plausible mechanism for price rises and therefore shortages. ""It is possible to see how we could be getting a foretaste of the impact of [a no-deal Brexit] on medicine supplies now."" A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""We have well established procedures to deal with any disruption to the supply chain and our plans to ensure patients can continue to receive the medicines they need, whatever the outcome of negotiations, are well advanced. ""All NHS chiefs have been given all necessary information and we are confident that if everyone does what they need to do, the supply of medicines should be uninterrupted in the event of exiting the EU without a deal.""

Karadzic war crimes sentence raised to life,"This video can not be played Concentration camp survivor: ""The only thing he deserves"" A UN court has rejected an appeal by Bosnian Serb former leader Radovan Karadzic and increased his sentence to life in prison. The tribunal on Wednesday ruled that his initial sentence was too light. In 2016 Karadzic, 73, was found guilty of genocide and war crimes by a UN tribunal in The Hague and given a 40-year prison sentence. He planned the Srebrenica massacre of July 1995 - the worst atrocity in Europe since World War Two. Karadzic had said his conviction was based on ""rumours"". He launched an appeal against his sentence last year, telling judges that the expulsion of Muslims and Croats in the 1990s had been ""myths"". Karadzic, a former psychiatrist, was president of the Bosnian Serb entity Republika Srpska during the Bosnian War in the 1990s. Profile: Radovan Karadzic Karadzic jailed for Bosnian genocide The tribunal rejected the majority of Karadzic's appeal. Judge Vagn Joensen said the original sentence was too lenient, given the ""sheer scale and systematic cruelty"" of his crimes. Radovan Karadzic, right, pictured with General Ratko Mladic in 1995 The former leader cannot appeal the tribunal's decision. He sat in the chamber on Wednesday and did not react to the ruling. Correspondents say the ruling is likely to be one of the last remaining hearings stemming from the bloody break-up of the former Yugoslavia in the 1990s. By Anna Holligan, BBC Hague correspondent Gasps, a whistle, applause and a collective sigh of relief was how relatives in the public gallery reacted. Many have spent more than two decades in pursuit of justice. Back and forth between The Hague and the killing fields where human bones are still being found today. Witnessing the political mastermind behind their suffering being told he will be confined to a cell for the rest of his life, was as close to justice as they feel they can get. As the survivors filed out into the sunshine, on to a daisy strewn lawn, I asked Munira Subasic - a mother whose husband and only son were slaughtered in Srebrenica - how she felt about the fact the architect of her suffering would never walk free. ""He deserves that,"" she told me. ""I will never see my son again. [Karadzic] should just stay in a black hole. I will live with the pain. This should be a message to the world, to war criminals."" Satko Mujagic, who watched as his friends were taken away to be executed at the Omarska death camp, told me their victory was bittersweet. ""I'm satisfied. I'm happy I'm here. But many didn't survive to see this so we cannot say we are truly happy."" In its original verdict, the UN tribunal ruled that Karadzic and other leaders were responsible for the ""organised and systematic pattern of crimes committed against Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats"". At Srebrenica, Bosnian Serb soldiers slaughtered nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys in a ""safe area"" protected by Dutch peacekeeping forces for the UN. Judges also held Karadzic responsible for the siege of Sarajevo, a campaign of shelling and sniping which lasted more than three years and led to the deaths of an estimated 10,000 civilians. After the war, Karadzic hid for years masquerading as an expert in alternative medicine before his eventual arrest in Serbia in 2008. Former Bosnian Serb army commanderRatko Mladic was sentenced to life in prisonon similar charges of war crimes and genocide in November 2017.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says there is a ""degree of exasperation"" in Europe and in Parliament about the way the PM has dealt with Brexit. He says he made it clear in Brussels yesterday that there is no support for Theresa May's deal, but there is support for other options. Mr Corbyn says Parliament may have a series of indicative votes on Wednesday afternoon next week - which he says it a ""very promising way around the impasse"". DUP deputy leader Nigel
Dodds says the PM ""missed an opportunity"" at the EU summit to put forward proposals that could have ""improved the prospects of an acceptable withdrawal agreement"". He says ""nothing has changed"" in respect of the withdrawal agreement. ""Nothing fundamentally turns on the formal ratification of documents which
the Attorney General has already said do not change the risk of the UK being
trapped in the backstop,"" he says. ""The DUP has been very clear throughout that we want a deal which
delivers on the referendum result and which works for all parts of the UK and
for the EU as well. ""But it must be a deal that protects the union. ""That remains our
abiding principle. We will not accept any deal which poses a long term risk to
the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom.â Speaking on the delay to Brexit, Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar says: ""There won't be further extensions. ""We've set out now what the timeline is and in many ways the European Union has taken control of the timeline, which in the past had been set by the UK."" Mr Macron says ""it is clear"" the British people made a decision ""without having all the information"". He says Brexit was a ""sovereign decision"" that was ""based on fake news"". ""All those people who spread that have disappeared from the political situation now,"" he says. European Council president Donald Tusk sums up the past two days. Allow Twitter content?

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has welcomed the decision on a Brexit delay. She tells reporters: ""We have, for the time being, prevented a no-deal Brexit for the 29th. ""But these are very short periods of time, so Britain will have to make clear yet again which path it wishes to pursue. ""With the debate we had yesterday night, we proved yet again that what we have done for the past two years will continue to apply, because as 27 member states, we work together and act together."" Asked whether the decision to delay Brexit had allowed Theresa May to ""kick the can further down the road"", European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker says: ""The road the can has in perspective is a very short one."" He jokes about the themes of this week's talks on EU relations with the UK and China. ""We did not talk only about the United Kingdom, but also about China,"" he says. ""The discussion on China was easier than the discussion on the UK. ""Not because China would like to join the EU, but because China isn't leaving.""

In full: May's Brexit delay letter to EU,"Dear Donald The UK Government's policy remains to leave the European Union in an orderly manner on the basis of the Withdrawal Agreement and Political Declaration agreed in November, complemented by the Joint Instrument and supplement to the Political Declaration President Juncker and I agreed on 11 March. You will be aware that before the House of Commons rejected the deal for a second time on 12 March, I warned in a speech in Grimsby that the consequences of failing to endorse the deal were unpredictable and potentially deeply unpalatable. The House of Commons did not vote in favour of the deal. The following day it voted against leaving the EU without a negotiated deal. The day after that it supported a Government motion that proposed a short extension to the Article 50 period if the House supported a meaningful vote before this week's European Council. The motion also made clear that if this had not happened, a longer extension would oblige the UK to call elections to the European Parliament. I do not believe that it would be in either of our interests for the UK to hold European Parliament elections. I had intended to bring the vote back to the House of Commons this week. The Speaker of the House of Commons said on Monday that in order for a further meaningful vote to be brought back to the House of Commons, the agreement would have to be ""fundamentally different-not different in terms of wording, but different in terms of substance"". Some Members of Parliament have interpreted that this means a further change to the deal. This position has made it impossible in practice to call a further vote in advance of the European Council. However, it remains my intention to bring the deal back to the House. In advance of that vote, I would be grateful if the European Council could therefore approve the supplementary documents that President Juncker and I agreed in Strasbourg, putting the Government in a position to bring these agreements to the House and confirming the changes to the Government's proposition to Parliament. I also intend to bring forward further domestic proposals that confirm my previous commitments to protect our internal market, given the concerns expressed about the backstop. On this basis, and in the light of the outcome of the European Council, I intend to put forward a motion as soon as possible under section 13 of the Withdrawal Act 2018 and make the argument for the orderly withdrawal and strong future partnership the UK economy, its citizens' security and the continent's future, demands. If the motion is passed, I am confident that Parliament will proceed to ratify the deal constructively. But this will clearly not be completed before 29 March 2019. In our legal system, the Government will need to take a Bill through both Houses of Parliament to enact our commitments under the Withdrawal Agreement into domestic law. While we will consult with the Opposition in the usual way to plan the passage of the Bill as quickly and smoothly as possible, the timetable for this is inevitably uncertain at this stage. I am therefore writing to inform the European Council that the UK is seeking an extension to the Article 50 period under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty, until 30 June 2019. I would be grateful for the opportunity to set out this position to our colleagues on Thursday.

UK media 'must deny terrorists a voice',"The UK media must not help terrorists by showing ""harmful"" content in their coverage of incidents, Britain's most senior counter-terrorism officer says. Neil Basu said a ""sensible conversation"" was needed,externalabout how incidents like the Christchurch attack should be reported. Several UK newspaper websites used film taken by suspected gunman or posted links to his so-called ""manifesto"". Mr Basu said it was wrong to ""hide behind the mantra"" of free speech. The attacks in Christchurch on Friday, the deadliest in New Zealand's history, happened as people were attending prayers at two mosques. Fifty people were killed and dozens more were injured. The gunman videoed his rampage and streamed the images live on social media. Ardern calls for global anti-racism fight Who were the Christchurch victims? The rising new threat of far-right violence Police in Christchurch asked social media users not to share the footage or links to a document the alleged gunman posted online about his motives. Social media companies like YouTube and Facebook raced to take the footage down,but it was still published on the front pages of some of the world's biggest news websites - including in the UK and Australia - in the form of still images, gifs, and even the full video. The Sun, Daily Mail and Daily Mirror all put edited footage on their websites, although the latter removed it soon afterwards. The Mirror's editor, Lloyd Embley, later apologised,explaining in a tweet,externalthe film should not have been carried as it was not in line with its policy relating to terrorist propaganda videos. The decision to disseminate the material prompted anger from people who argued that was exactly what the attacker had wanted. MailOnline did eventually remove a link to the alleged gunman's document from its site, and released a statement saying it was ""an error"". Neil Basu's open letter will inevitably stir up a debate about where the balance lies between freedom of speech and national security. And that is clearly what he wants. His frustration about the mainstream media's coverage of the New Zealand gun attack, and terrorism more broadly, seeps from the page. It strongly suggests that the Met Assistant Commissioner has seen compelling evidence of the impact of such reporting, as opposed to a theoretical concern. Nevertheless, criticising newspapers in the way he has runs the risk of losing support among those who are well placed to convey important police messages. Mr Basu clearly believes that's a risk worth taking. Assistant Commissioner Basu's open letter said it was ""time to have a sensible conversation about how to report terrorism in a way that doesn't help terrorists"". He said the same media organisations who have criticised social media platforms for not acting fast enough to remove extremist content have published ""uncensored propaganda"" of the Islamic State or made the ""rambling 'manifestos' of crazed killers available for download"". Freedom of speech ""is not an absolute right, it is not the freedom to cause harm"", Mr Basu said. Urging editors to debate the issue with survivors of terrorism and police, Mr Basu added: ""Anyone who seeks to deny the negative effects that promoting terrorist propaganda can have, should think carefully about the massive global effort to remove terrorist content from social media platforms and the pressure that governments, law enforcement and, ironically, the mass media has put on those companies to cleanse their sites."" He said extremist propaganda that might reach tens of thousands of people through their own channels or networks has a potential reach of tens of millions when a national newspaper published it. ""We must recognise this as harmful to our society and security,"" he said. New Zealand Prime MinisterJacinda Ardern has vowed never to say the nameof the Christchurch mosque gunman because she refused to give him the ""notoriety"" he sought. She urged her political colleagues to do the same.

Cookstown hotel owner de-arrested over drugs,"Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie, died after the incident The 52-year-old hotel owner who was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after three teenagers' deaths has been released on police bail.

Police investigation over 'misgendering'Catholic commentator Caroline Farrow says she is being investigated by police for using the wrong pronoun.Surrey,"This video can not be played 'Why I reported journalist over transgender tweets' A journalist claims she is being investigated by police for using the wrong pronoun for a transgender woman. Caroline Farrow said Surrey Police wants to ""conduct a taped interview under caution"" because of tweets posted in October. They were made after she was on ITV's Good Morning Britain with Susie Green, whose daughter Jackie is transgender. Ms Green said the posts were malicious and it was ""not just the misgendering"" issue. Ms Green, the founder of the transgender rights charity Mermaids, said she had now withdrawn her complaint to the police. But Surrey Police said a withdrawal statement must be made for a complaint to be dropped and that had not yet happened in this case. Susie Green with daughter Jackie The force said it had received an allegation on 15 October ""in relation to a number of tweets which were posted in October 2018"". ""A thorough investigation is being carried out to establish whether any criminal offences have taken place,"" it said. ""A 44-year-old woman has been asked to attend a voluntary interview in relation to the allegation as part of our ongoing investigation."" In the ITV interview, the Catholic journalist and commentator had been discussing with Ms Green the Girl Guides letting children who have changed gender join. Ms Farrow tweeted the police's decision to launch an investigation was an ""outrage"", adding: ""I can't sleep I am so furious."" She said: ""I don't even remember said tweets. I probably said 'he' or 'son' or something. ""All I have been told is that following an appearance on Good Morning Britain I made some tweets misgendering Susie Green's child and that I need to attend a taped interview."" She added it was her ""religious belief that a person cannot change sex"" and she would ""happily do jail time"" for her right to express that view. But she added she tried ""really hard not to misgender people"". Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms Green said: ""Every day my daughter is misgendered online... this was a journalist who had a public platform who used that to send very deliberately malicious nasty messages. ""It's not just the misgendering, it's actually the context that she puts it in to, and that she calls me a child abuser."" She added that complaining to the police was the ""appropriate course of action"" given the ""really damaging things she said about me and my actions"". Ms Green said she had withdrawn her complaint partly because she did not want Ms Farrow to continue to have a platform.

She added it was her ""religious belief that a person cannot change sex"" and she would ""happily do jail time"" for her right to express that view. But she added she tried ""really hard not to misgender people"". Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, Ms Green said: ""Every day my daughter is misgendered online... this was a journalist who had a public platform who used that to send very deliberately malicious nasty messages. ""It's not just the misgendering, it's actually the context that she puts it in to, and that she calls me a child abuser."" She added that complaining to the police was the ""appropriate course of action"" given the ""really damaging things she said about me and my actions"". Ms Green said she had withdrawn her complaint partly because she did not want Ms Farrow to continue to have a platform.

Fears over Instagram eating disorder postsPsychiatrists raise concerns as the BBC finds children are swapping extreme images of weight loss.UK,"This video can not be played 'My anorexia really loved Instagram' Content on Instagram that encourages eating disorders is ""spiralling out of control"", psychiatrists have warned. A BBC investigation found children swapping graphic images of weight loss and advice on how to make their illnesses more extreme. Dr Jon Goldin, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said ""vulnerable"" people were finding peer groups online. Instagram says it does not allow content encouraging or promoting eating disorders and removes it when aware. In January,the case of 14-year-old Molly Russell,who took her own life after viewing self-harm images, led to widespread criticism of Instagram. After public pressure the platform owned by Facebook announced a wide-ranging review and committed to removing all graphic self-harm images from the platform. But the BBC has found that posts, hashtags, images and search terms promoting and glamorising eating disorders such as anorexia and bulimia are common on Instagram. Many of the posted images are of emaciated young women often accompanied by instructions on extreme dieting and methods for avoiding scrutiny by parents. Governments v social media Social media companies 'failing children' Facebook pledges to do more on self-harm 'Instagram stars are selling anorexia' Some users will praise others for efforts to lose extreme amounts of weight. Many of those posting such content will also include their ""target"" or ""goal"" weight - often dangerously low. Posts, hashtags and images on Instagram like these promote eating disorders There is evidence too of children searching for so-called ""ana buddies"" - others who can help them make their illness more extreme. In one exchange a user said: ""If you're ages 13-14 comment below"", concluding with the words ""I can't do it alone"". Her post received a stream of replies. One user said ""I can fast and I'm 14"", and another wrote ""I can totally do it with you"". Finally, one user said: ""I'm a little younger than that but I need a buddy too."" Figures obtained by BBC News from NHS Digital show a rise of more than 130% in those aged 19 and under suffering from eating disorders being admitted to hospital in England since 2011. In 2018 there were more than 2,000 admissions for children aged 15 or under - up by 163% on 2011. Jodie-Leigh Neil says Instagram ""fuelled"" her eating disorder. ""The pictures on there were so graphic - just skin and bones really. Anorexia would make you believe you are bigger than that.... And Instagram reinforced that with the comments of 'I feel so fat' all over those posts."" Jodie-Leigh says if she had not received medical treatment she would have died. She and her mother, Julie, now use Instagram to offer advice and fight back against damaging content. Rose Anne Evans also believes Instagram played a major part in her illness and says even when in hospital the platform bombarded her with recommendations to look at harmful content. ""I'd just get all these suggestions of weight loss hashtags... It just made it easier and in a way... tempting to dip my foot back into the eating disorder world."" Many of the patients treated for eating disorders by Dr Goldin, vice-chairman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' child and adolescent faculty, use Instagram and other social media platforms. ""It's deeply worrying and to some extent the situation is spiralling out of control"", he said.  ""It glamorises eating disorders."" Many of Dr Goldin's patients are often socially isolated and look for a peer group Dr Goldin added: ""Young people with eating disorders are quite vulnerable, they are often socially isolated, they don't have friends and they are looking for a peer group."" Thecharity Beat,externalsays the main signs to watch out for are: becoming obsessive about food changes in behaviour having distorted beliefs about their body size often tired or struggling to concentrate disappearing to the toilet after meals starting to exercise excessively If youâve been affected byeating disorders, help and support is available via theBBC Action Line Instagram and other platforms banned certain hashtags and searches around eating disorders in 2012. But research by Dr Ysabel Gerrard, a lecturer in digital media and society at the University of Sheffield, found users adopted different hashtags and search terms. ""I think that there is still content on Instagram that should not be there,"" Dr Gerrard said. Her main concern is the algorithm which recommends more of the content people have liked or accessed. ""It creates almost this rabbit hole, where you go further and further down itâ¦ the platform thinks that's what you want to see."" Instagram also already offers links to help and support and promotes helplines run by charities. And Dr Gerrard does not advocate removing pro-eating disorder accounts, saying keeping them live allows the platform to offer help. Instagram is reviewing how it deals with content on eating disorders Tara Hopkins, head of public policy for Instagram, says the platform does not allow content that encourages or promotes eating disorders but insists it is a complex issue. ""Many people recovering from eating disorders use Instagram in a positive way to get support for themselves and support others,"" she adds. Instagram is reviewing how it deals with ""self-injury content"" - which includes eating disorders - and Ms Hopkins said it expects to ""make some adjustments to our policy enforcement, including classifying more content as promotion, so more is removed"". Beat, a UK-based charity offering advice and support on eating disorders, wants social media firms to block harmful content. Its director of external affairs, Tom Quinn, said: ""The government must take whatever steps necessary to ensure that content that promotes eating disorders is not available."" Government proposals on reducing ""internet harms"" have been delayed several times but are due to be published before the end of the month. Ministers have spoken about the need to create a statutory duty of care for online platforms and the possibility of setting up an independent regulator.

Barclays to sponsor Women's Super LeagueThe Football Association agrees a multi-million pound sponsorship deal for the Women's Super League with Barclays.BBC Sport,"Chelsea won the Women's Super League title last season Barclays is to become the Women's Super League first ever title sponsor, in a deal the Football Association has called ""the biggest ever investment in UK women's sport by a brand"". The three-year partnership, understood to be worth in excess of Â£10m, will start from next season. The competition will be rebranded the Barclays FA Women's Super League and include a prize-money pot of Â£500,000. Previously, WSL winners have not been awarded any official prize money. ""It's a real landmark moment in the development of the women's game,"" the FA's director of the women's professional game Kelly Simmons told BBC Sport. ""We obviously want to get more fans and more revenue behind the game, making sure it's secure and sustainable for the future. ""But also the investment in schools makes sure lots of girls get the chance to play football, which is our pipeline for the future."" Former Arsenal and England striker Kelly Smith felt the deal was ""long needed"" for the women's game. ""It's massive, massive news,"" said Smith, who retired in 2017 after a 13-year career. ""Even when I was playing, I was hoping a big brand would come on board and help promote and develop the women's game. ""It's in such a healthy place now and you can see the interest growing year-by-year. ""If England can do well at the World Cup and get to the final or even win it, the game will be taken to a new level. It's a healthy place to be."" Smith scored 46 goals in her England career Barclays' sponsorship deal will see them become the lead partner of the FA Girls' Football School Partnerships, a nationwide scheme to help develop girls' access to football at school. The partnerships aim to double participation and fan base in the game through the FA's Gameplan for Growth strategy, a four-year plan launched in 2017. ""We'll create 100 girls football schools partnerships across the country, involving around 6,000 schools, making sure girls have opportunities to play right from a young age,"" Simmons said. The WSL began in 2011 initially as an eight-team, semi-professional breakaway division. It is now Europe's only full-time strictly professional competition with 11 teams. Last summer's restructuring of the English women's leagues saw the second tier renamed as the Women's Championship, with Manchester United the only current full-time side. A number of WSL clubs have previously struggled to sustain top-flight football financially, with Notts County Ladies folding on the eve of the 2017 Spring Series, while Sunderland and second-tier sides Doncaster Rovers Belles and Sheffield FC all dropped down the divisions last summer. On Tuesday, BBC Sport revealed that WSL sideYeovil Town Ladies had made cutsto off-field staff and may have to revert back to part-time status because of financial concerns. Prize money A 2017 study by BBC Sport found that the biggest disparities in prize money were found in football, cricket and golf. But news of the Barclays deal follows other big announcements in women's football. The winners of this year's Women's World Cup will see prize money doubled to $4m (Â£3.1m). The overall prize fund will increase from $15m to $30m, which is split between the 24 teams taking part at the tournament in France. That total amount is still less than the $40m increase that men's World Cup prize money will see in 2022 - for a total of $440m in prize money. Wages Adidas also recently confirmed that all of its athletes on the winning Women's World Cup team would receive the same performance bonuses as their male counterparts. Overall, female footballers' wages still lag behind. In the top seven women's leagues, 1,693 players earned combined club salaries of Â£32.8m a year in 2017, according to a Sporting Intelligence report. Uefa says that there are about 1,800 professional female footballers registered in Europe. Sponsorship Women's football is catching up in terms of sponsorship. Visa recently signed a seven-year deal with Uefa to sponsor women's football. It became the main partner of the Women's Champions League and European Championships. Lucozade Sport has also recently signed its first sponsorship in women's football with the England Lionesses. They've sponsored the men's senior team since 2008. Sponsorship is generally higher in men's sports, given that it features more prominently on television.

'Abuse of power' over land ownership,"Large concentrations of land ownership are leading to power being abused in some parts of Scotland, according to a report by the Scottish Land Commission. Its investigation said a ""land monopoly"" in effect existed in many areas. The report also said the law provided very little protection. Scottish Land and Estates, which represents land owners, said the report did not adequately reflect the contribution made by rural businesses. The commission's report calls for a public interest test for future land sales. More than 400 people gave evidence to the investigation, including land owners, land managers and community representatives and individuals. The report found that most of the disadvantages from Scotland's current pattern of land ownership related to a concentration of decision-making power. It said that in some parts, that hampered economic development and caused serious and long-term harm to communities. It added that there was an ""urgent need"" for mechanisms to protect fragile communities from the ""irresponsible exercise of power"". The commission's chief executive officer Hamish Trench said: ""Concern about the impacts of concentrated land ownership in Scotland has long been central to the land reform debate. ""This evidence report allows us to move on from debating whether ownership is an issue, to understanding what the issues are and how they can be addressed. ""The evidence we have collected shows clearly that it is the concentration of power associated with land ownership, rather than necessarily the scale of landholding, that has a significant impact on the public interest, for example in relation to economic opportunities, housing and community development."" He added: ""Good management can of course reduce the risks associated with the concentration of power and decision-making, but the evidence shows that adverse impacts are causing significant detriment to the communities affected. ""This points to the need for systemic change beyond simply a focus on good management."" The commission makes a series of recommendations including: A public interest test for significant land transfers The requirement for a land management plan for estates A statutory land rights and responsibilities review. The report and recommendations will now be considered by ministers. Sarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of Scottish Land and Estates, said: ""We are deeply concerned that the report still sees land ownership rather than land use as the prime route to dealing with issues being faced by communities. Nor does the report adequately reflect the positive and substantial contribution made by rural businesses. ""We also want to see more detailed and compelling examples to support the report's claim that concentrated landownership is damaging fragile communities. ""The stereotypical view of landowners held by some simply do not reflect current day reality."" She added: ""Landowners generally operate as modern businesses involved in a range of sectors such as agriculture, forestry, energy, leisure and tourism and pursuing innovation, economic prosperity and employment opportunities. ""For example, more than 9,000 rural homes are let by private land-based businesses and Scotland's three new towns are being developed by rural landowners."" The report describes abuse of power in rural communities as a result of individual behaviour and suggests that policy focus should be on changing those behaviours. But it adds that the system in which they operate is ultimately responsible for their ability to misuse their power. It said the ""socially corrosive"" effects of land monopoly occurred because of what a landowner ""could"" do rather than what they had actually done. But it said abuse was just as likely to come from public or community land owners as private ones. Community Land Scotland welcomed the commission's recommendations and described monopoly landowner power as ""an affront to a modern, democratic and socially progressive Scotland"". The organisation's policy director Dr Calum MacLeod said it was in ""cruel contrast"" to communities who now manage almost 600,000 acres in the interests of local residents. He said: ""Places like Eigg, Knoydart, Gigha, North and West Harris, first and foremost, pursued a community buyout to stem the tide of depopulation, and by and large they have succeeded. ""But, as things stand, not every community has the opportunity to acquire their local land."" A spokesman for the Scottish government said: ""We welcome the SLC's report and will be working closely with the commission and stakeholders to consider the recommendations in the coming months. ""We expect that the report will inform how we address long-standing issues caused by the concentration of land power in rural Scotland, to the benefit of local communities.""

Google hit with Ã¢ÂÂ¬1.5bn fine from EU,"Alphabet's Google remains a dominant force in online advertising Google has been hit with a â¬1.49bn (Â£1.28bn) fine from the EU for blocking rival online search advertisers. It is the third EU fine for the search and advertising giant in two years. The case accuses Google of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party rivals from displaying search ads between 2006 and 2016. In response, Google changed its AdSense contracts with large third parties, giving them more leeway to display competing search ads. Google owner Alphabet makes large amounts of money from advertising -pre-tax profits reached $30.7bn(Â£23bn) in 2018, up from $12.66bn in 2017. ""Google has cemented its dominance in online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites. ""This is illegal under EU anti-trust rules,"" said EC commissioner Margrethe Vestager. Google's global affairs head, Kent Walker, said: ""We've always agreed that healthy, thriving markets are in everyone's interest. ""We've already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the Commission's concerns. ""Over the next few months, we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe."" Last year, the EU competition authorityhit Google with a record â¬4.34bn finefor using its popular Android mobile operating system to block rivals. This followeda â¬2.42bn fine in 2017for hindering rivals of shopping comparison websites. The European Commission said that websites often had an embedded search function. When a consumer uses this, the website delivers both search results and search adverts, which appear alongside the search result. Google's ""AdSense for search"" product delivers those adverts for website publishers. The Commission described Google as acting like ""an intermediary, like an advertising broker"". In 2006, Google started to include ""exclusivity clauses"" in contracts which stopped publishers from placing ads from Google rivals such as Microsoft and Yahoo on search pages, the Commission said. From 2009, Google started replacing the exclusivity clauses with ""premium placement"" clauses, which meant publishers had to keep the most profitable space on their search results pages for Google's adverts and they had to request a minimum number of Google adverts. Publishers also needed to get written permission from Google before making any changes to how rival ads were displayed, letting Google control ""how attractive, and therefore clicked on, competing search adverts could be"", the Commission said. The restrictive clauses ""led to a vicious circle"", Ms Vestager said in a media conference. ""Google's rivals, they were unable to grow, and to compete, and as a result of that, website owners had limited options for selling advertising space on those websites, and were forced solely to rely on Google,"" she said. ""There was no reason for Google to include these restrictive clauses in their contracts, except to keep rivals out of the market,"" she added. Between 2006 to 2016, Google had more than 70% of the search intermediation market in the EU. It generally had more than 90% of the search market and more than 75% of the online search advertising market, the Commission added.

Wedding dress burial for drowned mum,"Ruth Maguire's funeral mass will be held on Saturday morning A mother-of-three who drowned on a hen weekend in the Republic of Ireland is to be buried in her wedding dress. Ruth Maguire, 30, went missing overnight on Saturday in Carlingford, County Louth. Herbody was recovered from the water on Monday afternoon; Irish police said they were treating the incident as ""a tragic accident"". The funeral of the County Down woman, who had been due to marry in August, will be held in Belfast this weekend. Her family said she would be buried in her wedding dress at Carnmoney Cemetery following a funeral Mass on Saturday morning at St Vincent de Paul Church, Ligoniel. Ruth's sister Rachel Wilkinsontold the Belfast Telegraph,externalher sister had been very organised about her wedding, which would have taken place in front of 180 family and friends. She said Ms Maguire's three children had been due to be part of the bridal party. ""She was getting married on 8 August. Everything was ready,"" she said. ""We are going to let her wear her wedding dress in her coffin."" Ms Wilkinson said she believed her sister lost her bearings on Saturday night when she got separated from the 32-strong group after leaving a bar. The group had travelled to Carlingford to celebrate a friend's forthcoming wedding. The alarm was raised by friends, who were staying at a house in the town, when they realised Ms Maguire had not returned after midnight.

Food and wine costs push up inflation,"Food and alcohol price rises helped push inflation higher in February, the first rise since August 2018. The rate of price changes, measured using the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), rose to 1.9%, from 1.8% in January. House prices are rising at their slowest rate for almost six years, the Office for National Statistics said. Inflation overall was ""stable"", with rising food and alcohol prices offset by slower price rises in clothing and footwear, the ONS said. Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages went up by more from January to February this year than in the same period a year ago. The main upward contributions came from bread, cereals and vegetables, the ONS said. Tobacco prices also rose more than last year. Duty on a bottle of wine rose on 1 February, pushing the cost of a bottle up by 8p, a tax rise that was announced in the Autumn Budget, alongside a rise in duty on some some high-strength sparkling cider. ""Rising prices for food, alcohol and tobacco, and across a range of recreational and cultural goods produced the largest upward contributions,"" the ONS said. ""The largest, offsetting, downward contribution came from clothing and footwear, with prices rising between January and February... but by less than between the same two months a year ago."" The inflation rate measures price changes over the last 12 months and is updated every month. Prices are rising slightly more quickly, but the inflation rate remains close to the two year low it hit in January. Moreover wages are rising at a much faster pace, of 3.4%. So any consumers benefitting from salary increases will feel better off. Inflation fell slightly in January after the introduction of a cap on domestic energy prices. But the government has already planned to raise the level of that cap in April. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said that would mean further upward pressure on prices over the next few months. ""Businesses also continue to report that the cost of imported raw materials are rising,"" he said. However, he said that over the longer term, inflation would remain near the Bank of England's 2% target level because of ""the UK's weakening economic outlook"". Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said inflation was unlikely to stay below 2% for long and said February's rise marked ""the start of an upward trend which could see inflation reach 2.5% by April"". The UK's inflation rates peaked at a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017. It's not just households, but the Bank of England too, which worries about the cost of living. It's tasked with setting interest rates to keep inflation close to a target of 2%. The latest rate of 1.9%, won't trouble those policy makers. But the Bank estimates it takes two years for interest rates to influence prices (largely via the spending and borrowing habits of households and businesses). So it's looking at the prospects for prices then, rather than now. And it's concerned faster wage growth - which official figures confirm, on average, are comfortably outstripping the cost of living - could have an impact by then. The view from the City is that those pressures won't persuade the Bank to raise rates yet - especially as the outcome of Brexit remains so unclear. But if the trend of faster real wage growth continues and a Brexit deal is swiftly agreed, with little disruption to the economy, some economists think there could be a small rate rise later this year. That's quite a few ifs. With prolonged uncertainty, or even a no-deal, some argue that the next move in interest rates, when it comes, may be down rather than up. The ONS said UK house prices in January rose by an annual 1.7%, the smallest increase since June 2013. The lower rate of house price rises was in large part down to a 1.6% fall in London house prices. Prices in the capital are 3.3% below their peak in June 2017, the ONS said. Jamie Durham, economist at PwC,  said: ""This decline is driven by ongoing uncertainty around Brexit - London has been particularly affected due to its integration with the rest of Europe."" ""London is not the only area with falling prices. House prices in the East of England also fell on an annual basis for the first time since October 2011, and declined by -0.2%. ""Elsewhere in the UK, strong positive house price inflation continued in the Midlands, and particularly the East Midlands. The North West and Yorkshire and the Humber also showed strong annual house price growth, of 3.4% and 2.9% respectively.""

Rape and abuse victims 'failed by police',"The super-complaint is being made to HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services Police in England and Wales are failing to protect victims of domestic and sexual violence, campaigners have said. In only the secondsuper-complaint,externalmade to a national watchdog, the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ) says forces are not using existing powers to deal with crimes including stalking and rape. There is a ""systematic failure"" to ""safeguard a highly vulnerable section of the population"", it adds. The Home Office said measures were in place to help police tackle abuse. The CWJ has lodged its super-complaint with the policing watchdog in England and Wales - HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services - calling for an investigation into the way criminal suspects in rape and domestic cases are being dealt with. The complaint makes four key claims that focus on bail for rape suspects, and alleged failures linked to domestic violence, non-molestation and restraint orders. It says they have ""become concerned that the various legal measures intended to provide protection to women are not being applied properly on the ground"". Thousands of violent crime suspects released Police bail limit comes into force The CWJ, which gathered information from 11 frontline services, highlights how changes to the bail system have led to thousands of violent crime suspectsbeing released under investigation without conditions being imposed. For example, it claims that most rape suspects are now released without bail conditions, meaning they are left unsupervised. One sexual violence survivors service said that of 120 active cases, only five suspects were on bail. The CWJ says that as a result of the changes, alleged rapists and perpetrators of domestic abuse are harassing, and in some cases violently assaulting, complainants. Bail conditions usually include things such as agreeing not to contact certain people and reporting to a police station at set times. The Home Office said pre-charge bail decisions were down to police forces. It said police can use bail where it was considered necessary and proportionate, adding that it can only be considered by police on a case-by-case basis. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The changes to the bail system in England and Wales were brought in by the governmentin April 2017,following criticism that suspects were spending months or even years on bail without charge. Under the new system, bail should only be used when deemed ""necessary and proportionate"" and in most cases it must be limited to 28 days. However, many suspects are instead released ""under investigation"" with no conditions imposed. Nogah Ofer, the solicitor from CWJ who prepared the super-complaint, said the system was currently ""failing women"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that women were left feeling ""extremely anxious"" as bail conditions were meant to ""keep the parties apart and stop women being intimidated while the police investigation is going on"". The complaint from the CWJ also alleges that police treat breaches of non-molestation orders - civil orders made by the family court - as a ""trivial matter"", even though breaking them attracts a maximum five-year jail term. It claims that domestic violence protection notices and orders - which are another way of restricting contact with a victim, that can be pursued without their evidence or support - are rarely used. And it claims that police and prosecutors often overlook the chance to apply for a restraint order at the end of criminal proceedings. A Home Office spokesman said prosecutions and convictions of domestic abuse were ""up by 20% and 28% respectively since 2010"". In a statement, he said: ""Our landmark draft Domestic Abuse Bill and consultation response published in January includes measures to help the police tackle domestic abuse, including the creation of a Domestic Abuse Protection Notice and Order and training for police. ""We will also continue to work with partners across the criminal justice system, including the National Police Chief's Council to ensure bail conditions are being imposed where appropriate - including to protect victims."" The super-complaint system allows organisations to raise concerns on behalf of members of the public about systemic issues. It is only the second time the legal tool has been made to a national watchdog since it was introduced in November.

Barclays to sponsor Women's Super League,"Chelsea won the Women's Super League title last season Barclays is to become the Women's Super League first ever title sponsor, in a deal the Football Association has called ""the biggest ever investment in UK women's sport by a brand"". The three-year partnership, understood to be worth in excess of Â£10m, will start from next season. The competition will be rebranded the Barclays FA Women's Super League and include a prize-money pot of Â£500,000. Previously, WSL winners have not been awarded any official prize money. ""It's a real landmark moment in the development of the women's game,"" the FA's director of the women's professional game Kelly Simmons told BBC Sport. ""We obviously want to get more fans and more revenue behind the game, making sure it's secure and sustainable for the future. ""But also the investment in schools makes sure lots of girls get the chance to play football, which is our pipeline for the future."" Former Arsenal and England striker Kelly Smith felt the deal was ""long needed"" for the women's game. ""It's massive, massive news,"" said Smith, who retired in 2017 after a 13-year career. ""Even when I was playing, I was hoping a big brand would come on board and help promote and develop the women's game. ""It's in such a healthy place now and you can see the interest growing year-by-year. ""If England can do well at the World Cup and get to the final or even win it, the game will be taken to a new level. It's a healthy place to be."" Smith scored 46 goals in her England career Barclays' sponsorship deal will see them become the lead partner of the FA Girls' Football School Partnerships, a nationwide scheme to help develop girls' access to football at school. The partnerships aim to double participation and fan base in the game through the FA's Gameplan for Growth strategy, a four-year plan launched in 2017. ""We'll create 100 girls football schools partnerships across the country, involving around 6,000 schools, making sure girls have opportunities to play right from a young age,"" Simmons said. The WSL began in 2011 initially as an eight-team, semi-professional breakaway division. It is now Europe's only full-time strictly professional competition with 11 teams. Last summer's restructuring of the English women's leagues saw the second tier renamed as the Women's Championship, with Manchester United the only current full-time side. A number of WSL clubs have previously struggled to sustain top-flight football financially, with Notts County Ladies folding on the eve of the 2017 Spring Series, while Sunderland and second-tier sides Doncaster Rovers Belles and Sheffield FC all dropped down the divisions last summer. On Tuesday, BBC Sport revealed that WSL sideYeovil Town Ladies had made cutsto off-field staff and may have to revert back to part-time status because of financial concerns. Prize money A 2017 study by BBC Sport found that the biggest disparities in prize money were found in football, cricket and golf. But news of the Barclays deal follows other big announcements in women's football. The winners of this year's Women's World Cup will see prize money doubled to $4m (Â£3.1m). The overall prize fund will increase from $15m to $30m, which is split between the 24 teams taking part at the tournament in France. That total amount is still less than the $40m increase that men's World Cup prize money will see in 2022 - for a total of $440m in prize money. Wages Adidas also recently confirmed that all of its athletes on the winning Women's World Cup team would receive the same performance bonuses as their male counterparts. Overall, female footballers' wages still lag behind. In the top seven women's leagues, 1,693 players earned combined club salaries of Â£32.8m a year in 2017, according to a Sporting Intelligence report. Uefa says that there are about 1,800 professional female footballers registered in Europe. Sponsorship Women's football is catching up in terms of sponsorship. Visa recently signed a seven-year deal with Uefa to sponsor women's football. It became the main partner of the Women's Champions League and European Championships. Lucozade Sport has also recently signed its first sponsorship in women's football with the England Lionesses. They've sponsored the men's senior team since 2008. Sponsorship is generally higher in men's sports, given that it features more prominently on television.

Ardern calls for global anti-racism fight,"This video can not be played New Zealand PM Jacinda Ardern spoke to the BBC's Clive Myrie New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has called for a global fight to root out racist right-wing ideology following last week's deadly attack on two mosques in Christchurch. In one of her first interviews since then, she told the BBC that she rejected the idea that a rise in immigration was fuelling racism. Fifty people were killed and dozens more wounded in Friday's gun attacks. The first funerals, of a father and son from Syria, took placeon Wednesday. Hundreds of mourners gathered at a cemetery near the Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch, one of two places of worship targeted. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, has been charged with murder. Fifty people died in the attack. Asked about the rise of right-wing nationalism she said: ""This was an Australian citizen but that is not to say that we do not have an ideology in New Zealand that would be an affront to the majority of New Zealanders."" She said there was a responsibility ""to weed it out where it exists and make sure that we never create an environment where it can flourish"". Father and son in first NZ mosque funeral How mass shootings have changed gun laws How prevalent is far-right extremism? ""But I would make that a global call,"" she added. ""What New Zealand experienced here was violence brought against us by someone who grew up and learned their ideology somewhere else. If we want to make sure globally that we are a safe and tolerant and inclusive world we cannot think about this in terms of boundaries."" She defended New Zealand's record on accepting refugees, saying: ""We are a welcoming country. I utterly reject the idea that in any way in trying to ensure that we have a system that looks after those who choose to call New Zealand home, that we have perpetuated an environment where this kind of ideology can exist."" This video can not be played A comic is asking searching questions about race relations in the wake of the attack Ms Ardern also defended her call not to refer to the suspect by name. ""One of his goals... was that he sought notoriety and we will absolutely deny him that,"" she said. Hywel Griffith, BBC News, Christchurch No leader can prepare for a moment like this. Carrying a nation through tragedy comes down to instinct and resolve. But Jacinda's Ardern's response to the Christchurch attack has been admired perhaps because it has felt honest and sincere. Compassionate but composed, from the first few hours she sought to place herself on the side of the victims and their families. Wearing a hijab as a sign of respect may seem a simple gesture, but it has resonated with the relatives and friends still lost in grief. So too have the phrases she has deliberately repeated since the attack. I have heard her words - ""we are one, they are us"" - spoken back to me by the families of victims here in Christchurch, and seen it written on countless cards and posters alongside all the bouquets of flowers. Of course, maintaining this feeling of national unity is a different challenge - but she has already created a platform of trust from which she could deliver meaningful change. Police on Wednesday named six of the victims of the shootings at the Al Noor mosque and hoped to release all 50 bodies to the families by the end of the day. All post-mortem examinations were complete, police said. However, some families expressed frustration with the delayed process. Mohamed Safi, 23, whose father Matiullah Safi died at the Al Noor mosque, complained about the lack of information. Wednesday's funerals were carried out away from the glare of publicity He told AFP news agency: ""They are just saying they are doing their procedures... Why do I not know what you are going through to identify the body?"" What are New Zealand's gun laws? What is known about the suspect? Why Turkish president is showing attack Police Commissioner Mike Bush has said authorities had to prove the cause of death to establish for the courts to treat it as murder.

Google hit with â¬1.5bn fine from EU,"Alphabet's Google remains a dominant force in online advertising Google has been hit with a â¬1.49bn (Â£1.28bn) fine from the EU for blocking rival online search advertisers. It is the third EU fine for the search and advertising giant in two years. The case accuses Google of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party rivals from displaying search ads between 2006 and 2016. In response, Google changed its AdSense contracts with large third parties, giving them more leeway to display competing search ads. Google owner Alphabet makes large amounts of money from advertising -pre-tax profits reached $30.7bn(Â£23bn) in 2018, up from $12.66bn in 2017. ""Google has cemented its dominance in online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites. ""This is illegal under EU anti-trust rules,"" said EC commissioner Margrethe Vestager. Google's global affairs head, Kent Walker, said: ""We've always agreed that healthy, thriving markets are in everyone's interest. ""We've already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the Commission's concerns. ""Over the next few months, we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe."" Last year, the EU competition authorityhit Google with a record â¬4.34bn finefor using its popular Android mobile operating system to block rivals. This followeda â¬2.42bn fine in 2017for hindering rivals of shopping comparison websites. The European Commission said that websites often had an embedded search function. When a consumer uses this, the website delivers both search results and search adverts, which appear alongside the search result. Google's ""AdSense for search"" product delivers those adverts for website publishers. The Commission described Google as acting like ""an intermediary, like an advertising broker"". In 2006, Google started to include ""exclusivity clauses"" in contracts which stopped publishers from placing ads from Google rivals such as Microsoft and Yahoo on search pages, the Commission said. From 2009, Google started replacing the exclusivity clauses with ""premium placement"" clauses, which meant publishers had to keep the most profitable space on their search results pages for Google's adverts and they had to request a minimum number of Google adverts. Publishers also needed to get written permission from Google before making any changes to how rival ads were displayed, letting Google control ""how attractive, and therefore clicked on, competing search adverts could be"", the Commission said. The restrictive clauses ""led to a vicious circle"", Ms Vestager said in a media conference. ""Google's rivals, they were unable to grow, and to compete, and as a result of that, website owners had limited options for selling advertising space on those websites, and were forced solely to rely on Google,"" she said. ""There was no reason for Google to include these restrictive clauses in their contracts, except to keep rivals out of the market,"" she added. Between 2006 to 2016, Google had more than 70% of the search intermediation market in the EU. It generally had more than 90% of the search market and more than 75% of the online search advertising market, the Commission added.

Suspect's handcuffed body found in riverThe 22-year-old had run from police as he was about to be searched and was missing for two months.Hampshire & Isle of Wight,"The man has been named locally as Reece Hillier The body of a man who fled police in January has been found in a river still wearing handcuffs. The 22-year-old, named locally as Reece Hillier, ran off after being detained by officers in Southampton. Police launched a manhunt but found no trace of him - until a body was discovered by magnet fishermen in the River Itchen at Woodmill on Sunday. The Independent Office for Police Conduct has agreed the death should be investigated by Hampshire Constabulary. It is not known whether the man entered the water by accident or in an attempt to evade the police. The BBC has been told he was about to be searched for drugs and faced the possibility of arrest. Floral tributes and balloons have been left at the scene Friends of Mr Hillier, who was from Southampton, said he was ""the life of the party"" and a ""loveable rogue"". His girlfriend, Brittany Bellows, said he was ""always singing and dancing and filling the room with laughter and joy"". Floral tributes and balloons have been left at the scene. The death is not being treated as suspicious, police said. The force said it was called at 18:19 GMT on 17 March after a body was found in the river. ""Identification has now taken place and we can confirm that the body is of a 22-year-old man from Southampton,"" a spokesman said. ""We can confirm that he was handcuffed, having been detained by police in Southampton on 12 January. ""Initial inquiries suggest the body had been in the water for some time.""

"Britons becoming happier, UN list findsThe UK is in 15th place in the annual ranking, which is topped by Finland, Denmark and Norway.","Britons are among the happiest people in the world - and are becoming more cheerful, according to an annual United Nations survey. The seventh annualWorld Happiness Report,externalplaced the UK 15th in the 156-country ranking, just ahead of Ireland. The list, based on research conducted between 2016 and 2018, is published on International Day of Happiness. Finland, Denmark and Norway were the happiest nations while South Sudan replaced Burundi as the least happy. International Day of Happiness began in 2012 when all countries of the United Nations agreed to create an official, annual fixture on the calendar. The list is published by the London-based Action for Happiness charity and sees survey respondents place the status of their lives on a scale ranging from 0 to 10. The nations at the bottom of the ranking are typically affected by a combination of economic, political and social stresses. The overall score given by Britons was up on the previous year, helping it to rise four places in the ranking. The top 10 of the list was made up by Iceland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Sweden, New Zealand, Canada and Austria, while Australia was 11th, Germany 17th and the US in 19th place. Experts say people can influence their own happiness. Prof Laurie Santos runs a course called Psychology and the Good Life at Yale University ""Science has proved that being happy requires a conscious effort. It's not easy, it takes time,"" says Laurie Santos, professor of psychology and cognitive science at Yale University. Prof Santos's class Psychology and the Good Life is the most popular in Yale's 317-year history, and broke the university's enrolment record when more than 1,200 students signed up. ""Being happy isn't something that just happens, you've got to practice to be better at it,"" she adds. Here are five exercises from Prof Santos to get you started. Thanks! Be grateful for the good people and things in your life Prof Santos asks her students to write down what they are grateful for - every night, for a whole week. This becomes their gratitude list. ""It might sound quite simple, but we've seen that the students who regularly do this exercise actually tend to be happier,"" she says. A well-rested person is a happier person - try to get a good eight hours of sleep a night The challenge is to sleep eight hours a night, every night, for a whole week. This simple exercise proves to be the hardest to achieve, according to Prof Santos. ""It might seem silly, but we know that sleeping more and better reduces your chances of suffering from depression and improves your positive attitude,"" she says. Meditation is a must - no need to go to a spa - grab 10 minutes anywhere that's quiet Meditate 10 minutes a day, every day. Prof Santos says that when she used to be a student, regular meditation made her feel better. Now she's a professor, she refers her students to several studies demonstrating how meditation and other activities that engage your full attention can help you become happier. Be in the present and spend time with people you like According to Prof Santos, there's growing research that shows enjoying quality time with your friends and family makes your happier. Spending time with people we like - or having ""healthy interpersonal relations and social connections"", in psychology speak - significantly boosts your wellbeing. It doesn't take much, says Prof Santos, just make sure you ""live in the moment, be aware you are having this time together, be conscious of how you spend your time"". The concept of time is very important for your happiness. ""We often associate wealth with how much money we have,"" adds Prof Santos, ""but research shows that wealth is more closely tied to how much time we have"". Put your phone away and get active Social media can give us a false sense of happiness, says Prof Santos, and it is important not to be swept away by it. The latest research shows that people who use social networks the most tend to be less happy than those who don't use it so much, she adds.

Parkinson's smell test explained by science,"This video can not be played Joy Milne can smell Parkinson's disease before it is medically diagnosed A Scottish woman who astonished doctors with her ability to detect Parkinson's disease through smell has helped scientists find what causes the odour. Researchers in Manchester said they had identified the molecules on the skin linked to the smell and hope it could lead to early detection. The study was inspired by Joy Milne, a 68-year-old retired nurse from Perth. She first noticed the ""musky"" smell on her husband Les, who was years later diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Joy has worked with the University of Manchester for three years Joy, who has worked with the University of Manchester on the research for three years, has been named in a paper being published in the journal ACS Central Science. The woman who can smell Parkinson's disease She has also been made an honorary lecturer at the university because of her efforts to help identify the telltale smell. Prof Perdita Barran designed experiments with a mass spectrometer to mimic what Joy does with her nose The research revealed that a number of compounds, particularly hippuric acid, eicosane, and octadecanal, were found in higher than usual concentrations on the skin of Parkinson's patients. They are contained in sebum - the oily secretion that coats everybody's skin, but which is often produced in greater quantity by people with Parkinson's, making them more likely to develop a skin complaint called seborrheic dermatitis. Lead author Prof Perdita Barran, from the school of chemistry at the University of Manchester, told BBC Scotland: ""What we found are some compounds that are more present in people who have got Parkinson's disease and the reason we've discovered them is because Joy Milne could smell a difference. ""She could smell people who've got Parkinson's disease. ""So we designed some experiments to mimic what Joy does, to use a mass spectrometer to do what Joy can do when she smells these things on people with Parkinson's."" One in 500 people in the UK has Parkinson's and that rises to about one in 100 among the over-60s. Joy's noticed the musky smell on her husband Les before he was diagnosed It can leave them struggling to walk, speak and sleep. Currently there is no cure and no definitive test for the disease, with clinicians diagnosing patients by observing symptoms. Prof Barran said she hoped the ""volatile biomarkers"" they identified could lead to a simple early detection test for the disease, such as wiping a person's neck with a swab and testing for the signature molecules. She said: ""What we might hope is if we can diagnose people earlier, before the motor symptoms come in, that there will be treatments that can prevent the disease spreading. So that's really the ultimate ambition."" Les died in 2015, 20 years after being diagnosed Joy's husband Les, who died in 2015, was told he had Parkinson's at the age of 45 but Joy said she detected the unusual musky smell about a decade earlier. The retired nurse only linked the odour to the disease after meeting people with the same distinctive smell at a Parkinson's UK support group. She told BBC Scotland that not knowing Les had Parkinson's put her family in a ""negative spiral"". ""What if we did know?,"" she said ""It would have changed things dramatically. ""The fact that he became withdrawn, reserved, he had bouts of depression and mood swings, if I had understood what was happening it would have changed our total outlook on life.""

Greenvale owner Michael McElhatton Officers are examining CCTV footage of the incident and have appealed for any mobile phone footage or photographs of the crush to be passed to the investigators. They have asked people in possession of images not to publish them online but to upload them to theMajor Incident Public Portal.,external The hotel was hosting a St Patrick's Day party on Sunday night and a large group of young people were queuing to get into the disco at about 21:30 GMT. The emergency services were called to the hotel after reports that several teenagers had been injured in the crush. The Northern Ireland Ambulance Service declared it a major incident and police, firefighters and environmental health staff rushed to the scene. Officers want to speak to people who were at the hotel at the time and have already tracked down 160 witnesses.

"Britons becoming happier, UN list finds","Britons are among the happiest people in the world - and are becoming more cheerful, according to an annual United Nations survey. The seventh annualWorld Happiness Report,externalplaced the UK 15th in the 156-country ranking, just ahead of Ireland. The list, based on research conducted between 2016 and 2018, is published on International Day of Happiness. Finland, Denmark and Norway were the happiest nations while South Sudan replaced Burundi as the least happy. International Day of Happiness began in 2012 when all countries of the United Nations agreed to create an official, annual fixture on the calendar.

"Rape and abuse victims 'failed by police'Forces are not using existing powers to deal with domestic and sexual violence, campaigners say.","The super-complaint is being made to HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services Police in England and Wales are failing to protect victims of domestic and sexual violence, campaigners have said. In only the secondsuper-complaint,externalmade to a national watchdog, the Centre for Women's Justice (CWJ) says forces are not using existing powers to deal with crimes including stalking and rape. There is a ""systematic failure"" to ""safeguard a highly vulnerable section of the population"", it adds. The Home Office said measures were in place to help police tackle abuse. The CWJ has lodged its super-complaint with the policing watchdog in England and Wales - HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services - calling for an investigation into the way criminal suspects in rape and domestic cases are being dealt with. The complaint makes four key claims that focus on bail for rape suspects, and alleged failures linked to domestic violence, non-molestation and restraint orders. It says they have ""become concerned that the various legal measures intended to provide protection to women are not being applied properly on the ground"". Thousands of violent crime suspects released Police bail limit comes into force The CWJ, which gathered information from 11 frontline services, highlights how changes to the bail system have led to thousands of violent crime suspectsbeing released under investigation without conditions being imposed. For example, it claims that most rape suspects are now released without bail conditions, meaning they are left unsupervised. One sexual violence survivors service said that of 120 active cases, only five suspects were on bail. The CWJ says that as a result of the changes, alleged rapists and perpetrators of domestic abuse are harassing, and in some cases violently assaulting, complainants. Bail conditions usually include things such as agreeing not to contact certain people and reporting to a police station at set times. The Home Office said pre-charge bail decisions were down to police forces. It said police can use bail where it was considered necessary and proportionate, adding that it can only be considered by police on a case-by-case basis. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The changes to the bail system in England and Wales were brought in by the governmentin April 2017,following criticism that suspects were spending months or even years on bail without charge. Under the new system, bail should only be used when deemed ""necessary and proportionate"" and in most cases it must be limited to 28 days. However, many suspects are instead released ""under investigation"" with no conditions imposed. Nogah Ofer, the solicitor from CWJ who prepared the super-complaint, said the system was currently ""failing women"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that women were left feeling ""extremely anxious"" as bail conditions were meant to ""keep the parties apart and stop women being intimidated while the police investigation is going on"". The complaint from the CWJ also alleges that police treat breaches of non-molestation orders - civil orders made by the family court - as a ""trivial matter"", even though breaking them attracts a maximum five-year jail term. It claims that domestic violence protection notices and orders - which are another way of restricting contact with a victim, that can be pursued without their evidence or support - are rarely used. And it claims that police and prosecutors often overlook the chance to apply for a restraint order at the end of criminal proceedings. A Home Office spokesman said prosecutions and convictions of domestic abuse were ""up by 20% and 28% respectively since 2010"". In a statement, he said: ""Our landmark draft Domestic Abuse Bill and consultation response published in January includes measures to help the police tackle domestic abuse, including the creation of a Domestic Abuse Protection Notice and Order and training for police. ""We will also continue to work with partners across the criminal justice system, including the National Police Chief's Council to ensure bail conditions are being imposed where appropriate - including to protect victims."" The super-complaint system allows organisations to raise concerns on behalf of members of the public about systemic issues. It is only the second time the legal tool has been made to a national watchdog since it was introduced in November.

National Portrait Gallery drops ÃÂ£1m donor,"The redevelopment of the National Portrait Gallery is due to be finished in 2023 A Â£1m donation to the National Portrait Gallery has been withdrawn because the potential donors are alleged to have fuelled the US opioid crisis. The Sackler Trust, run by the family that owns Purdue Pharma, seller of prescription painkiller OxyContin, said the donation might ""deflect"" the gallery from its important work. The Sackler family has ""vigorously denied"" the allegations against it. The National Portrait Gallery said it supported the family's decision. The Sackler Trust offered the money in 2016 to go towards the gallery's Â£35.5m redevelopment. The gallery had been mulling over whether to accept it. 'Yoda magnet' fears over gallery revamp What are opioids and what are the risks? In a joint statement,external, the Sackler Trust and the National Portrait Gallery said they had ""jointly agreed not to proceed at this time"" with the donation. A spokesman for the Sackler family said: ""The giving philosophy of the family has always been to actively support institutions while never getting in the way of their mission. It has become evident that recent reporting of allegations made against Sackler family members may cause this new donation to deflect the National Portrait Gallery from its important work. ""The allegations against family members are vigorously denied, but to avoid being a distraction for the [National Portrait Gallery], we have decided not to proceed at this time with the donation."" This video can not be played On America's trail of destruction Purdue Pharma is facing lawsuits in the US alleging that it sold OxyContin as a drug with a low chance of causing addictions, despite knowing this was not true. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has said that opioids - a class of drug which includes everything from heroin to legal painkillers - were involved in almost 48,000 deaths in 2017. President Donald Trump has called the US opioid epidemic a ""national shame"" and declared it a public health emergency. US schools prepare for overdoses The epidemic started with legally prescribed painkillers including Percocet and OxyContin. It intensified as these were diverted to the black market. There has also been a sharp rise in the use of illegal opioids including heroin, while many street drugs are laced with powerful opioids such as Fentanyl, increasing the risk of overdose. Will Gompertz, arts editor Museum directors throughout the country might well have mixed feelings about the Sackler Trust's decision not to go ahead with a planned Â£1m gift to the National Portrait Gallery because it did not wish to ""distract"" the institution from its ""important work"". On the one hand, they will be relieved that some clarity has been brought to the Sackler situation, which has become a very hot topic in the subsidised arts sector. Should they or shouldn't they take the money? Is the reputational risk too high? Would other key supporters approve? Could there be a public backlash? Right now, it would appear, there are too many downsides - probably for both parties - to accept a high-profile, million-pound-plus donation with the Sackler name attached. On the other hand, they will be throwing their arms up in frustration. Fundraising is very difficult at the best of times, but it is harder still when you are discounting one of the wealthiest and most generous philanthropic donors in the land. The Sacker Trust is not one of thousands of similar foundations with huge sums to donate to the arts. It is not even one of hundreds. It is one of a very few who have the reserves and commitment to consistently make large-scale gifts to arts organisations. With it out of the game, at least temporarily, there are likely to be a few fundraising targets missed because of a Sackler-sized hole. The Sackler family is one of the wealthiest families in the US. The Sackler brothers - Raymond, who died in 2010, and Mortimer, who died in 2017 - set up Purdue Pharma in 1952. The firm's fortunes rose with the launch of OxyContin in 1995 and the drug formed the basis of the Sackler family fortune. The family still wholly owns the company, with about 20 members sharing in the money. According to Forbes,externalmagazine, in 2016 the family was worth about $13bn (Â£10bn). This video can not be played The heroin-ravaged city fighting back The company has paid hundreds of millions in the past to settle charges that it said OxyContin was safer and less addictive than it was. In a lawsuit filed earlier this year,external, the Massachusetts Attorney General said dangerous opioid drugs were killing people across the state and that prescription medicines, which were supposed to protect health, were instead ""ruining people's lives"". ""Purdue Pharma created the epidemic and profited from it through a web of illegal deceit. ""At the top of Purdue, a small group of executives led the deception and pocketed millions of dollars."" The defendants were named as two companies and seventeen individuals who ""engaged in a deadly, deceptive scheme to sell opioids in Massachusetts"". The members of the Sackler family named in the lawsuit were Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, Jonathan Sackler, Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, and Theresa Sackler. Campaigning group Culture Unstained welcomed Tuesday's announcement that Sackler Trust money would not go to the National Portrait Gallery. ""The Gallery's decision to reject a donation from those that profited from the opioid crisis is a powerful acknowledgement that some sources of funding cross a red line,"" it said. The group hailed ""renowned artist and former opioid addict"" Nan Goldin, who it said ""significantly escalated the pressure on the gallery after she threatened to pull out of a planned retrospective if it were to accept the donation"". ""It was Nan Goldin and her supporters who forced the [National Portrait Gallery] to confront the ethical questions surrounding the Sacklers."" Many UK cultural institutions have benefited from donations from the Sackler Trust in the past, including the Serpentine's Sackler Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the National Gallery. However, the BBC understands no UK institutions have applied for fresh funding from the trust since the allegations emerged in 2017. What are opioids and what are the risks?

Irish police investigating Ms Maguire's sudden death confirmed they were preparing a file for the coroner. A spokesman said: ""There is nothing to say this is anything other than a tragic accident.""

Can PM still bring back her deal?,"Here is the relevant commandment from Erskine May aka the parliamentary bible: ""A motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided during a session, may not be brought forward again during that same session."" So, how can the government get round this rather large obstacle and get another vote on Theresa May's deal? LIVE: Updates from Parliament Third Brexit vote must be different - Speaker Brexit: What could happen next? Well, first of all, rules are there to be changed. If MPs suspend or change the ""standing orders"" of Parliament, they could get the Brexit deal back on the agenda. But here the power would be in the hands of Parliament as a whole, and could not be done at the whim of government ministers. Secondly, the government could change the proposition on offer. The former Attorney General Dominic Grieve has suggested that something ""substantially"" different would be to ask Parliament to vote for the deal subject to a referendum. It may be argued too that moving the Brexit date from 29 March to a later date would be substantial enough if Mrs May tacks this on to her deal. But the Speaker can set a high bar here. In response to MPs' questions, he has hinted that simply coming up with new legal advice or clarifications wouldn't be substantial enough. So, already there is a focus on the word ""session"" in Erskine May. If MPs can't discuss the same thing in the same session of Parliament, why not simply start a new one? In the parlance, Parliament would be ""prorogued"" - in other words, the Queen would end the current session and a new one would begin soon after. But this strategy would be extremely controversial, and may even be resisted by Buckingham Palace if it appeared that the monarchy was being used in a politically contentious way.

"Strong street cannabis 'psychosis danger'People who use potent cannabis increase their risk of serious mental illness, according to researchers.Health","People experiencing psychosis lose touch with reality and may hear voices, researchers said Smoking potent 'skunk-like' cannabis increases your risk of serious mental illness, say researchers. They estimate around one in 10 new cases of psychosis may be associated with strong cannabis, based on their study of European cities and towns. In London and Amsterdam, where most of the cannabis that is sold is very strong, the risk could be much more, they say inThe Lancet Psychiatry,external. Daily use of any cannabis also makes psychosis more likely, they found. Experts say people should be aware of the potential risks to health, even though the study is not definitive proof of harm. Lead researcher and psychiatrist Dr Marta Di Forti said: ""If you decide to use high potency cannabis bear in mind there is this potential risk."" Dr Adrian James from the Royal College of Psychiatrists said: ""This is a good quality study and the results need to be taken seriously."" Health risks of recreational cannabis Cannabis use in teens linked to depression Why are so many countries now saying cannabis is OK? People experiencing psychosis lose touch with reality, and may hear voices, see things that are not actually there or have delusional, confused thoughts. It is a recognised medical condition and different to getting high on a drug. There is disagreement as to what extent cannabis might cause or worsen mental health problems and many countries have gone ahead and legalised or decriminalised cannabis use. Doctors are concerned about the growing use of high potency cannabis that contains lots of the ingredient THC - the one that gives the high. Skunk-like cannabis with a THC content of 14% now makes up 94% of the drug sold on the streets of London, according to experts. Ad Gridley, who currently takes three different anti-psychotics, has suffered with schizophrenia and has tried to take his own life. He believes his psychosis is down to cannabis use. He no longer smokes. ""I was smoking so much it was common place for me to be stoned, and I started doing it a lot by myself too. After a couple of suicide attempts - that I didn't really admit to - my mum saw me at home in my flat hugging my knees, rocking, and she knew immediately something was wrong,"" he told theVictoria Derbyshire programme. ""Within 24 hours there was a GP out, and I was in hospital the next day. It plagued my life for about ten years after that. I couldn't function, and I was in and out of hospital ten times. I wasn't doing anything meaningful with my life. ""When I stopped, the psychosis stopped. I was on medications and things but that was to rectify what happened before, so my brain chemistry could get some sort of equilibrium. When I stopped smoking, the symptoms disappeared. ""If I had known the risks I doubt I would have taken it."" The researchers, from King's College London, looked at cannabis use by people in 11 EU towns and cities, including London, as well as one region of Brazil. They compared a sample of 901 people who had experienced psychosis with 1,237 (from the general population) who had not. They categorised the type of cannabis used by the participants according to strength, although they did not do any lab tests to measure the strength directly. Low potency cannabis was any illicit product thought to contain less than 10% concentration of the ingredient THC. High potency was anything containing more than 10% THC. The researchers found: Self-reported daily cannabis use was more common among patients with first episode psychosis, compared to controls - 29.5% (or 266 out of 901) of patients versus 6.8% (84/1,237) of controls High-potency cannabis use was also more common among patients with first episode psychosis, compared to controls - 37.1% (334/901) versus 19.4% (240/1,237) Across the 11 sites, people who used cannabis on a daily basis were three times more likely to have a diagnosis of first episode psychosis, compared with people who had never used cannabis This increased to five times more likely for daily use of high potency cannabis There was no evidence of an association between less than-weekly cannabis use and psychosis, regardless of potency The authors estimate that one in five new cases (20.4%) of psychosis across the 11 sites may be linked to daily cannabis use, and one in ten (12.2%) linked to use of high potency cannabis. In London, a fifth (21%) of new cases of psychosis might be linked to daily cannabis use, and nearly a third (30%) to high potency cannabis. Removing strong cannabis from the market would lower London's psychosis incidence rate from 45.7 to 31.9 cases per 100,000 people per year, the scientists estimate. For the South London region they looked at, that would mean 60 fewer cases of psychosis each year. Nick Hickmott from the drug and alcohol charity Addaction said: ""We've got a problem with potency. People who regularly take lots of high strength cannabis are at risk of potentially serious harm. It can be particularly harmful for younger, developing brains. ""My advice is avoid using high-strength cannabis every day and pay attention to how it makes you feel. If you end up feeling anxious or just unsettled then it might be best to give it a miss. It's also not a good idea to mix it with alcohol or other drugs. ""It's also important not to over-react. Lots of people experiment with cannabis and then move on without any problems. For people who do need advice or help I'd recommend reaching out to a GP or a local drug service."" Cannabis can vary in strength and type. Skunk tends to contain higher levels of THC than weed.

"Food and wine costs push up inflationUK prices rose by 1.9% in February, nudged higher by duty on wine and higher food bills.BusinessComments","Food and alcohol price rises helped push inflation higher in February, the first rise since August 2018. The rate of price changes, measured using the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), rose to 1.9%, from 1.8% in January. House prices are rising at their slowest rate for almost six years, the Office for National Statistics said. Inflation overall was ""stable"", with rising food and alcohol prices offset by slower price rises in clothing and footwear, the ONS said. Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages went up by more from January to February this year than in the same period a year ago. The main upward contributions came from bread, cereals and vegetables, the ONS said. Tobacco prices also rose more than last year. Duty on a bottle of wine rose on 1 February, pushing the cost of a bottle up by 8p, a tax rise that was announced in the Autumn Budget, alongside a rise in duty on some some high-strength sparkling cider. ""Rising prices for food, alcohol and tobacco, and across a range of recreational and cultural goods produced the largest upward contributions,"" the ONS said. ""The largest, offsetting, downward contribution came from clothing and footwear, with prices rising between January and February... but by less than between the same two months a year ago."" The inflation rate measures price changes over the last 12 months and is updated every month. Prices are rising slightly more quickly, but the inflation rate remains close to the two year low it hit in January. Moreover wages are rising at a much faster pace, of 3.4%. So any consumers benefitting from salary increases will feel better off. Inflation fell slightly in January after the introduction of a cap on domestic energy prices. But the government has already planned to raise the level of that cap in April. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said that would mean further upward pressure on prices over the next few months. ""Businesses also continue to report that the cost of imported raw materials are rising,"" he said. However, he said that over the longer term, inflation would remain near the Bank of England's 2% target level because of ""the UK's weakening economic outlook"". Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said inflation was unlikely to stay below 2% for long and said February's rise marked ""the start of an upward trend which could see inflation reach 2.5% by April"". The UK's inflation rates peaked at a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017. It's not just households, but the Bank of England too, which worries about the cost of living. It's tasked with setting interest rates to keep inflation close to a target of 2%. The latest rate of 1.9%, won't trouble those policy makers. But the Bank estimates it takes two years for interest rates to influence prices (largely via the spending and borrowing habits of households and businesses). So it's looking at the prospects for prices then, rather than now. And it's concerned faster wage growth - which official figures confirm, on average, are comfortably outstripping the cost of living - could have an impact by then. The view from the City is that those pressures won't persuade the Bank to raise rates yet - especially as the outcome of Brexit remains so unclear. But if the trend of faster real wage growth continues and a Brexit deal is swiftly agreed, with little disruption to the economy, some economists think there could be a small rate rise later this year. That's quite a few ifs. With prolonged uncertainty, or even a no-deal, some argue that the next move in interest rates, when it comes, may be down rather than up. The ONS said UK house prices in January rose by an annual 1.7%, the smallest increase since June 2013. The lower rate of house price rises was in large part down to a 1.6% fall in London house prices. Prices in the capital are 3.3% below their peak in June 2017, the ONS said. Jamie Durham, economist at PwC,  said: ""This decline is driven by ongoing uncertainty around Brexit - London has been particularly affected due to its integration with the rest of Europe."" ""London is not the only area with falling prices. House prices in the East of England also fell on an annual basis for the first time since October 2011, and declined by -0.2%. ""Elsewhere in the UK, strong positive house price inflation continued in the Midlands, and particularly the East Midlands. The North West and Yorkshire and the Humber also showed strong annual house price growth, of 3.4% and 2.9% respectively.""

"PayPal urged to block essay firm cheatsMinisters call for payments companies to block essay writing firms, in a bid to beat university cheats.","The education secretary is calling on payments firms such as PayPal to block transactions for essay writing firms, in a bid to beat university cheats. Damian Hinds says it is ""unethical for these companies to profit from this dishonest business"". He also suggests UK universities should consider US-style ""honour codes"" where students promise not to cheat. A PayPal spokesman says an ""internal review is already under way"" into essay-writing services. There have been repeated warnings from university leaders about the risk of cheating from students using online essay writing firms. Such firms might say they are offering legitimate help for students, but the higher education watchdog, the Quality Assurance Agency, has warned they can be ""unscrupulous services that damage reputations and lives"". ""Companies that try to entice students to buy so-called plagiarism-free essays pose a real threat to the academic integrity of our higher education,"" said Douglas Blackstock, head of the QAA. YouTube deletes cheating videos Essay cheat companies face university ban How do you stop online students from cheating? The man who helps students to cheat ""These unscrupulous operators, increasingly and falsely marketing themselves as providing legitimate study aids, must be stopped in their tracks."" Mr Blackstock also warned of students being blackmailed by essay-writing firms, with demands for money under the threat of exposing the previous cheating. The QAA wrote to PayPal in November,externalcalling on the firm ""to close down the payment facilities for the essay-writing companies that encourage students to cheat"". But the university standards watchdog says there has not been any indication of any change in policy. A PayPal spokesman said: ""We carefully review accounts that are flagged to us for possible violations of our policies, as well as UK laws and regulations. ""An internal review is already under way looking at the implications of essay writing services. ""We would be happy to talk to the Department of Education about their concerns."" The education secretary wants payment service companies to take action to stop such ""essay mills"" - and says their ""corporate reputation"" should matter to them. He said the QAA identified 17,000 academic offences in 2016 - but it was impossible to know how many cases had gone undetected. ""Sadly there have always been some people who opt for the easy way and the internet has seen a black market in essay writing services spring up."" Mr Hinds added that such firms are ""exploiting young people and it is time to stamp them out"". ""I am determined to beat the cheats who threaten the integrity of our system and am calling on online giants, such as PayPal, to block payments or end the advertisement of these services - it is their moral duty to do so,"" said Mr Hinds. He also suggested that universities should adopt ""honour codes"", in which students formally commit to not cheating, and also recognise the consequences facing students who are subsequently caught. There has been research from the US showing that suchhonour codes can act as a deterrentand reduce levels of cheating. Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, said: ""Cheating should be tackled and the problem should not be allowed to fester any longer. ""Legislation is needed to outlaw this abominable practice, but this is a valuable first step."" The education secretary's call for a tougher line on essay writing services was backed by Chris Hale of Universities UK. He said the university organisation wanted ""essay mills to be made illegal and we continue to work together with government, the Quality Assurance Agency and other higher education bodies to tackle their use"".

BenjamÃ­n SÃ¡nchez went missing during a family trip on Sunday and was found by a team of volunteers 21km (13 miles) from where he was last seen. ""I was cold, I slept badly, leaning on a rock,"" said the boy, who was wearing only a T-shirt and light trousers. He said he had survived by eating grass and drinking water from a stream. After being rescued on Monday afternoon, the child was taken by helicopter to a hospital in San Juan suffering slight dehydration and was released on Tuesday. BenjamÃ­n was found sitting under a tree by a motorcyclist after a search operation that involved some 1,000 police, civil defence officials and volunteers. ""My mum was chasing me and I started running.,externalAt first I could hear her but then I got lost,"" he told El ClarÃ­n newspaper (in Spanish). The boy was with his family on a trip in western Argentina ""I leaned on a stone, started calling her, but she didn't hear me... I [started] walking towards a light that was very far away.""

""I was cold, I slept badly, leaning on a rock,"" said the boy, who was wearing only a T-shirt and light trousers. He said he had survived by eating grass and drinking water from a stream. After being rescued on Monday afternoon, the child was taken by helicopter to a hospital in San Juan suffering slight dehydration and was released on Tuesday. BenjamÃ­n was found sitting under a tree by a motorcyclist after a search operation that involved some 1,000 police, civil defence officials and volunteers. ""My mum was chasing me and I started running.,externalAt first I could hear her but then I got lost,"" he told El ClarÃ­n newspaper (in Spanish). The boy was with his family on a trip in western Argentina ""I leaned on a stone, started calling her, but she didn't hear me... I [started] walking towards a light that was very far away."" Temperatures in the region this time of the year vary from 30C (86F) during the day to around zero at night.

His mother says he is scared of flying and initially refused to board the helicopter. He only agreed to fly after being told he would be reunited with his family. ""I was really happy when I saw my mum. I was missing them all,"" said BenjamÃ­n. San Juan Governor Sergio UÃ±ac tweeted pictures of the boy after visiting him on Monday. Allow Twitter content?

PayPal urged to block essay firm cheats,"The education secretary is calling on payments firms such as PayPal to block transactions for essay writing firms, in a bid to beat university cheats. Damian Hinds says it is ""unethical for these companies to profit from this dishonest business"". He also suggests UK universities should consider US-style ""honour codes"" where students promise not to cheat. A PayPal spokesman says an ""internal review is already under way"" into essay-writing services. There have been repeated warnings from university leaders about the risk of cheating from students using online essay writing firms. Such firms might say they are offering legitimate help for students, but the higher education watchdog, the Quality Assurance Agency, has warned they can be ""unscrupulous services that damage reputations and lives"". ""Companies that try to entice students to buy so-called plagiarism-free essays pose a real threat to the academic integrity of our higher education,"" said Douglas Blackstock, head of the QAA. YouTube deletes cheating videos Essay cheat companies face university ban How do you stop online students from cheating? The man who helps students to cheat ""These unscrupulous operators, increasingly and falsely marketing themselves as providing legitimate study aids, must be stopped in their tracks."" Mr Blackstock also warned of students being blackmailed by essay-writing firms, with demands for money under the threat of exposing the previous cheating. The QAA wrote to PayPal in November,externalcalling on the firm ""to close down the payment facilities for the essay-writing companies that encourage students to cheat"". But the university standards watchdog says there has not been any indication of any change in policy. A PayPal spokesman said: ""We carefully review accounts that are flagged to us for possible violations of our policies, as well as UK laws and regulations. ""An internal review is already under way looking at the implications of essay writing services. ""We would be happy to talk to the Department of Education about their concerns."" The education secretary wants payment service companies to take action to stop such ""essay mills"" - and says their ""corporate reputation"" should matter to them. He said the QAA identified 17,000 academic offences in 2016 - but it was impossible to know how many cases had gone undetected. ""Sadly there have always been some people who opt for the easy way and the internet has seen a black market in essay writing services spring up."" Mr Hinds added that such firms are ""exploiting young people and it is time to stamp them out"". ""I am determined to beat the cheats who threaten the integrity of our system and am calling on online giants, such as PayPal, to block payments or end the advertisement of these services - it is their moral duty to do so,"" said Mr Hinds. He also suggested that universities should adopt ""honour codes"", in which students formally commit to not cheating, and also recognise the consequences facing students who are subsequently caught. There has been research from the US showing that suchhonour codes can act as a deterrentand reduce levels of cheating. Sir Anthony Seldon, vice-chancellor of the University of Buckingham, said: ""Cheating should be tackled and the problem should not be allowed to fester any longer. ""Legislation is needed to outlaw this abominable practice, but this is a valuable first step."" The education secretary's call for a tougher line on essay writing services was backed by Chris Hale of Universities UK. He said the university organisation wanted ""essay mills to be made illegal and we continue to work together with government, the Quality Assurance Agency and other higher education bodies to tackle their use"".

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn says there is a ""degree of exasperation"" in Europe and in Parliament about the way the PM has dealt with Brexit. He says he made it clear in Brussels yesterday that there is no support for Theresa May's deal, but there is support for other options. Mr Corbyn says Parliament may have a series of indicative votes on Wednesday afternoon next week - which he says it a ""very promising way around the impasse"". DUP deputy leader Nigel
Dodds says the PM ""missed an opportunity"" at the EU summit to put forward proposals that could have ""improved the prospects of an acceptable withdrawal agreement"". He says ""nothing has changed"" in respect of the withdrawal agreement. ""Nothing fundamentally turns on the formal ratification of documents which
the Attorney General has already said do not change the risk of the UK being
trapped in the backstop,"" he says. ""The DUP has been very clear throughout that we want a deal which
delivers on the referendum result and which works for all parts of the UK and
for the EU as well. ""But it must be a deal that protects the union. ""That remains our
abiding principle. We will not accept any deal which poses a long term risk to
the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom.â Speaking on the delay to Brexit, Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar says: ""There won't be further extensions. ""We've set out now what the timeline is and in many ways the European Union has taken control of the timeline, which in the past had been set by the UK."" Mr Macron says ""it is clear"" the British people made a decision ""without having all the information"". He says Brexit was a ""sovereign decision"" that was ""based on fake news"". ""All those people who spread that have disappeared from the political situation now,"" he says. European Council president Donald Tusk sums up the past two days. Allow Twitter content?

German Chancellor Angela Merkel has welcomed the decision on a Brexit delay. She tells reporters: ""We have, for the time being, prevented a no-deal Brexit for the 29th. ""But these are very short periods of time, so Britain will have to make clear yet again which path it wishes to pursue. ""With the debate we had yesterday night, we proved yet again that what we have done for the past two years will continue to apply, because as 27 member states, we work together and act together."" Asked whether the decision to delay Brexit had allowed Theresa May to ""kick the can further down the road"", European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker says: ""The road the can has in perspective is a very short one."" He jokes about the themes of this week's talks on EU relations with the UK and China. ""We did not talk only about the United Kingdom, but also about China,"" he says. ""The discussion on China was easier than the discussion on the UK. ""Not because China would like to join the EU, but because China isn't leaving.""

National Portrait Gallery drops Â£1m donor,"The redevelopment of the National Portrait Gallery is due to be finished in 2023 A Â£1m donation to the National Portrait Gallery has been withdrawn because the potential donors are alleged to have fuelled the US opioid crisis. The Sackler Trust, run by the family that owns Purdue Pharma, seller of prescription painkiller OxyContin, said the donation might ""deflect"" the gallery from its important work. The Sackler family has ""vigorously denied"" the allegations against it. The National Portrait Gallery said it supported the family's decision. The Sackler Trust offered the money in 2016 to go towards the gallery's Â£35.5m redevelopment. The gallery had been mulling over whether to accept it. 'Yoda magnet' fears over gallery revamp What are opioids and what are the risks? In a joint statement,external, the Sackler Trust and the National Portrait Gallery said they had ""jointly agreed not to proceed at this time"" with the donation. A spokesman for the Sackler family said: ""The giving philosophy of the family has always been to actively support institutions while never getting in the way of their mission. It has become evident that recent reporting of allegations made against Sackler family members may cause this new donation to deflect the National Portrait Gallery from its important work. ""The allegations against family members are vigorously denied, but to avoid being a distraction for the [National Portrait Gallery], we have decided not to proceed at this time with the donation."" This video can not be played On America's trail of destruction Purdue Pharma is facing lawsuits in the US alleging that it sold OxyContin as a drug with a low chance of causing addictions, despite knowing this was not true. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has said that opioids - a class of drug which includes everything from heroin to legal painkillers - were involved in almost 48,000 deaths in 2017. President Donald Trump has called the US opioid epidemic a ""national shame"" and declared it a public health emergency. US schools prepare for overdoses The epidemic started with legally prescribed painkillers including Percocet and OxyContin. It intensified as these were diverted to the black market. There has also been a sharp rise in the use of illegal opioids including heroin, while many street drugs are laced with powerful opioids such as Fentanyl, increasing the risk of overdose. Will Gompertz, arts editor Museum directors throughout the country might well have mixed feelings about the Sackler Trust's decision not to go ahead with a planned Â£1m gift to the National Portrait Gallery because it did not wish to ""distract"" the institution from its ""important work"". On the one hand, they will be relieved that some clarity has been brought to the Sackler situation, which has become a very hot topic in the subsidised arts sector. Should they or shouldn't they take the money? Is the reputational risk too high? Would other key supporters approve? Could there be a public backlash? Right now, it would appear, there are too many downsides - probably for both parties - to accept a high-profile, million-pound-plus donation with the Sackler name attached. On the other hand, they will be throwing their arms up in frustration. Fundraising is very difficult at the best of times, but it is harder still when you are discounting one of the wealthiest and most generous philanthropic donors in the land. The Sacker Trust is not one of thousands of similar foundations with huge sums to donate to the arts. It is not even one of hundreds. It is one of a very few who have the reserves and commitment to consistently make large-scale gifts to arts organisations. With it out of the game, at least temporarily, there are likely to be a few fundraising targets missed because of a Sackler-sized hole. The Sackler family is one of the wealthiest families in the US. The Sackler brothers - Raymond, who died in 2010, and Mortimer, who died in 2017 - set up Purdue Pharma in 1952. The firm's fortunes rose with the launch of OxyContin in 1995 and the drug formed the basis of the Sackler family fortune. The family still wholly owns the company, with about 20 members sharing in the money. According to Forbes,externalmagazine, in 2016 the family was worth about $13bn (Â£10bn). This video can not be played The heroin-ravaged city fighting back The company has paid hundreds of millions in the past to settle charges that it said OxyContin was safer and less addictive than it was. In a lawsuit filed earlier this year,external, the Massachusetts Attorney General said dangerous opioid drugs were killing people across the state and that prescription medicines, which were supposed to protect health, were instead ""ruining people's lives"". ""Purdue Pharma created the epidemic and profited from it through a web of illegal deceit. ""At the top of Purdue, a small group of executives led the deception and pocketed millions of dollars."" The defendants were named as two companies and seventeen individuals who ""engaged in a deadly, deceptive scheme to sell opioids in Massachusetts"". The members of the Sackler family named in the lawsuit were Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, Jonathan Sackler, Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, and Theresa Sackler. Campaigning group Culture Unstained welcomed Tuesday's announcement that Sackler Trust money would not go to the National Portrait Gallery. ""The Gallery's decision to reject a donation from those that profited from the opioid crisis is a powerful acknowledgement that some sources of funding cross a red line,"" it said. The group hailed ""renowned artist and former opioid addict"" Nan Goldin, who it said ""significantly escalated the pressure on the gallery after she threatened to pull out of a planned retrospective if it were to accept the donation"". ""It was Nan Goldin and her supporters who forced the [National Portrait Gallery] to confront the ethical questions surrounding the Sacklers."" Many UK cultural institutions have benefited from donations from the Sackler Trust in the past, including the Serpentine's Sackler Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the National Gallery. However, the BBC understands no UK institutions have applied for fresh funding from the trust since the allegations emerged in 2017. What are opioids and what are the risks?

Billionaire celebrity jeweller held in UK,"Nirav Modi's diamonds were worn by celebrities like Rosie Huntington-Whitely A billionaire Indian diamond trader, whose jewellery was worn by the likes of model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and actress Priyanka Chopra-Jonas, has been arrested in the UK. Nirav Modi is wanted for his alleged role in India's largest bank fraud, totalling some $2bn (Â£1.5bn). He left the country in early 2018, and has not returned to India since. Mr Modi, 48, was arrested in central London on Tuesday, and appeared in court on Wednesday. Police said the arrest had been made on behalf of the Indian authorities, who have asked for his extradition. The judge at Westminster Magistrates Court refused to grant him bail and he has been remanded in custody until 29 March. Who is India's scandal-linked billionaire? Mr Modi's case was thrust back into the limelight after a British newspaper found him living in an Â£8m ($10.5m) London flat. The Telegraph newspaper spoke to him near the Oxford Street apartment,externalin early March 2019. It is thought Mr Modi - who disappeared in February 2018 - had reportedly been in the British capital since at least June. Within days, officials confirmed that UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid had certified India's extradition request, initially made last August. The arrest comes at an interesting time in India, where people will start voting for their new MPs in the next few weeks. A successful extradition could boost the ruling BJP's standing in the polls. Punjab National Bank (PNB), India's second-largest state-run bank, accuses Mr Modi of being one of the main suspects in a scam which defrauded it of $2bn. His uncle Mehul Choksi, who has been in Antigua since the allegations emerged, is also wanted by the Indian authorities. Priyanka Chopra-Jonas advertised the brand The banks said the suspects had used unapproved guarantees, issued by rogue PNB staff, to borrow from other lenders. Mr Modi has previously denied any wrongdoing. Mr Modi is one of India's richest men, worth an estimated $1.75bn, according to Forbes. He was born into a diamond trading dynasty, but only launched his own eponymous brand back in 2010. The brand grew quickly, and he soon had stores across India, as well as in New York, London and Hong Kong. His diamond-encrusted designs were worn by stars like  Kate Winslet, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Naomi Watts, while the Bollywood star Priyanka Chopra-Jonas appeared in advertisements for the brand. The shops were raided and his assets frozen after the allegations emerged last year. Who is billionaire jeweller in fraud probe?

Google hit with Ã¢ÂÂ¬1.49bn fine from EU,"Alphabet's Google remains a dominant force in online advertising Google has been hit with a â¬1.49bn (Â£1.28bn) fine from the EU for blocking rival online search advertisers. It is the third EU fine for the search and advertising giant in two years. The case accuses Google of abusing its market dominance by restricting third-party rivals from displaying search ads between 2006 and 2016. In response, Google changed its AdSense contracts with large third parties, giving them more leeway to display competing search ads. Google owner Alphabet makes large amounts of money from advertising -pre-tax profits reached $30.7bn(Â£23bn) in 2018, up from $12.66bn in 2017. ""Google has cemented its dominance in online search adverts and shielded itself from competitive pressure by imposing anti-competitive contractual restrictions on third-party websites. ""This is illegal under EU anti-trust rules,"" said EC commissioner Margrethe Vestager. Google's global affairs head, Kent Walker, said: ""We've always agreed that healthy, thriving markets are in everyone's interest. ""We've already made a wide range of changes to our products to address the Commission's concerns. ""Over the next few months, we'll be making further updates to give more visibility to rivals in Europe."" Last year, the EU competition authorityhit Google with a record â¬4.34bn finefor using its popular Android mobile operating system to block rivals. This followeda â¬2.42bn fine in 2017for hindering rivals of shopping comparison websites. The European Commission said that websites often had an embedded search function. When a consumer uses this, the website delivers both search results and search adverts, which appear alongside the search result. Google's ""AdSense for search"" product delivers those adverts for website publishers. The Commission described Google as acting like ""an intermediary, like an advertising broker"". In 2006, Google started to include ""exclusivity clauses"" in contracts which stopped publishers from placing ads from Google rivals such as Microsoft and Yahoo on search pages, the Commission said. From 2009, Google started replacing the exclusivity clauses with ""premium placement"" clauses, which meant publishers had to keep the most profitable space on their search results pages for Google's adverts and they had to request a minimum number of Google adverts. Publishers also needed to get written permission from Google before making any changes to how rival ads were displayed, letting Google control ""how attractive, and therefore clicked on, competing search adverts could be"", the Commission said. The restrictive clauses ""led to a vicious circle"", Ms Vestager said in a media conference. ""Google's rivals, they were unable to grow, and to compete, and as a result of that, website owners had limited options for selling advertising space on those websites, and were forced solely to rely on Google,"" she said. ""There was no reason for Google to include these restrictive clauses in their contracts, except to keep rivals out of the market,"" she added. Between 2006 to 2016, Google had more than 70% of the search intermediation market in the EU. It generally had more than 90% of the search market and more than 75% of the online search advertising market, the Commission added.

B&Q owner's boss to go as profits fall,"The boss of struggling DIY group, Kingfisher, which owns B&Q and Screwfix, is to step down amid worsening profits. Veronique Laury, who had been overseeing a turnaround plan, will leave the company, although no date was given for her departure. Profits fell 13% over the last year, with the firm's French chain, Castorama, dragging down sales. The firm also announced it would close all 19 Screwfix outlets in Germany. It said it was considering the closure of 15 further stores across the group. Kingfisher said Ms Laury would remain at the firm until a successor was found.  She has been in the role since December 2014. Her departure will leave only five other female chief executives in the FTSE 100. Ms Laury's turnaround strategy for the group, dubbed ""One Kingfisher"", is set to cost Â£800m over five years. It involves unifying product ranges across brands, boosting e-commerce and seeking efficiency savings. However, doubts were raised over Ms Laury's future at the DIY group after sales continued to flag three years into the new strategy. The group's shares have fallen 27% over the last year. Ms Laury said: ""Leading the transformation has been so exciting but also very challenging. ""As the transformation approaches its final year, I believe it is right for someone else to lead the next phase of the One Kingfisher journey."" Hot weather unable to stem shopper decline Sainsbury and Asda vow merger price cuts Ocado sales hit by warehouse fire Kingfisher, which also owns the Castorama and Brico DÃ©pÃ´t chains in France, said sales at existing stores, known as like-for-like sales, fell 1.6% over the year, although overall sales were 0.3% up. But while overall sales at B&Q fell 2.8%, the group's other UK-based chain, Screwfix, has performed strongly, with a 10% rise in sales. While B&Q targets home DIY enthusiasts, Screwfix caters to trade customers, such as plumbers and electricians. Neil Wilson, analyst at Markets.com, said that while Screwfix's success was down to its specialist trade desks, B&Q was facing a Brexit-related impact on consumer confidence, reducing spending on big purchases. ""It's a tough game to be in and perhaps, with the slowdown in the secondary housing market, people are not replacing kitchen and bathroom suites as often,"" he added. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said: ""The contrast between B&Q's 'stack them high' retail policy and Screwfix's one-to-one service with expert advice from the sales assistants is marked. This approach appears to have created a very loyal customer base."" Brico DÃ©pÃ´t's positive record in France and Poland was offset by the French chain Castorama, which continued to underperform. In November, the firm announced it was pulling out of Russia, Spain and Portugal altogether, as part of the plan to simplify the business. Underlying profit fell 13% to Â£693m. But when costs including Â£111m for store closures were included, profits were 52.8% lower for the year to the end of January. Kingfisher said it would continue to expand the Screwfix chain, increasing its store target from 700 to about 800 outlets. The brand will be launched in Ireland this year. Ms Palmer said the results gave ""little hope to investors"", pointing to ""tumultuous market conditions"" and civil unrest in France. ""The group will now be facing growing pressure to hold on to its prized assets, B&Q and Screwfix, which have seen vultures circling for some time,"" she added.

"National Portrait Gallery drops Â£1m donorThe Sackler Trust, under scrutiny over money it gets from an addictive opioid drug, withdraws its donation.Business","The redevelopment of the National Portrait Gallery is due to be finished in 2023 A Â£1m donation to the National Portrait Gallery has been withdrawn because the potential donors are alleged to have fuelled the US opioid crisis. The Sackler Trust, run by the family that owns Purdue Pharma, seller of prescription painkiller OxyContin, said the donation might ""deflect"" the gallery from its important work. The Sackler family has ""vigorously denied"" the allegations against it. The National Portrait Gallery said it supported the family's decision. The Sackler Trust offered the money in 2016 to go towards the gallery's Â£35.5m redevelopment. The gallery had been mulling over whether to accept it. 'Yoda magnet' fears over gallery revamp What are opioids and what are the risks? In a joint statement,external, the Sackler Trust and the National Portrait Gallery said they had ""jointly agreed not to proceed at this time"" with the donation. A spokesman for the Sackler family said: ""The giving philosophy of the family has always been to actively support institutions while never getting in the way of their mission. It has become evident that recent reporting of allegations made against Sackler family members may cause this new donation to deflect the National Portrait Gallery from its important work. ""The allegations against family members are vigorously denied, but to avoid being a distraction for the [National Portrait Gallery], we have decided not to proceed at this time with the donation."" This video can not be played On America's trail of destruction Purdue Pharma is facing lawsuits in the US alleging that it sold OxyContin as a drug with a low chance of causing addictions, despite knowing this was not true. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has said that opioids - a class of drug which includes everything from heroin to legal painkillers - were involved in almost 48,000 deaths in 2017. President Donald Trump has called the US opioid epidemic a ""national shame"" and declared it a public health emergency. US schools prepare for overdoses The epidemic started with legally prescribed painkillers including Percocet and OxyContin. It intensified as these were diverted to the black market. There has also been a sharp rise in the use of illegal opioids including heroin, while many street drugs are laced with powerful opioids such as Fentanyl, increasing the risk of overdose. Will Gompertz, arts editor Museum directors throughout the country might well have mixed feelings about the Sackler Trust's decision not to go ahead with a planned Â£1m gift to the National Portrait Gallery because it did not wish to ""distract"" the institution from its ""important work"". On the one hand, they will be relieved that some clarity has been brought to the Sackler situation, which has become a very hot topic in the subsidised arts sector. Should they or shouldn't they take the money? Is the reputational risk too high? Would other key supporters approve? Could there be a public backlash? Right now, it would appear, there are too many downsides - probably for both parties - to accept a high-profile, million-pound-plus donation with the Sackler name attached. On the other hand, they will be throwing their arms up in frustration. Fundraising is very difficult at the best of times, but it is harder still when you are discounting one of the wealthiest and most generous philanthropic donors in the land. The Sacker Trust is not one of thousands of similar foundations with huge sums to donate to the arts. It is not even one of hundreds. It is one of a very few who have the reserves and commitment to consistently make large-scale gifts to arts organisations. With it out of the game, at least temporarily, there are likely to be a few fundraising targets missed because of a Sackler-sized hole. The Sackler family is one of the wealthiest families in the US. The Sackler brothers - Raymond, who died in 2010, and Mortimer, who died in 2017 - set up Purdue Pharma in 1952. The firm's fortunes rose with the launch of OxyContin in 1995 and the drug formed the basis of the Sackler family fortune. The family still wholly owns the company, with about 20 members sharing in the money. According to Forbes,externalmagazine, in 2016 the family was worth about $13bn (Â£10bn). This video can not be played The heroin-ravaged city fighting back The company has paid hundreds of millions in the past to settle charges that it said OxyContin was safer and less addictive than it was. In a lawsuit filed earlier this year,external, the Massachusetts Attorney General said dangerous opioid drugs were killing people across the state and that prescription medicines, which were supposed to protect health, were instead ""ruining people's lives"". ""Purdue Pharma created the epidemic and profited from it through a web of illegal deceit. ""At the top of Purdue, a small group of executives led the deception and pocketed millions of dollars."" The defendants were named as two companies and seventeen individuals who ""engaged in a deadly, deceptive scheme to sell opioids in Massachusetts"". The members of the Sackler family named in the lawsuit were Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, Jonathan Sackler, Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, and Theresa Sackler. Campaigning group Culture Unstained welcomed Tuesday's announcement that Sackler Trust money would not go to the National Portrait Gallery. ""The Gallery's decision to reject a donation from those that profited from the opioid crisis is a powerful acknowledgement that some sources of funding cross a red line,"" it said. The group hailed ""renowned artist and former opioid addict"" Nan Goldin, who it said ""significantly escalated the pressure on the gallery after she threatened to pull out of a planned retrospective if it were to accept the donation"". ""It was Nan Goldin and her supporters who forced the [National Portrait Gallery] to confront the ethical questions surrounding the Sacklers."" Many UK cultural institutions have benefited from donations from the Sackler Trust in the past, including the Serpentine's Sackler Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the National Gallery. However, the BBC understands no UK institutions have applied for fresh funding from the trust since the allegations emerged in 2017. What are opioids and what are the risks?

Love Island stars to be offered therapy,"Mike Thalassitis was described as being ""loved by so many people"" by a friend Love Island stars will in future be offered therapy, social media training and financial advice, ITV has said after the death of an ex-contestant. Mike Thalassitis, who was on the show in 2017,was found deadin a north London park on Saturday. Police are not treating the incident as suspicious. His death sparked calls for better aftercare for people on reality shows. In a statement,external, ITV said the show's medical support is being independently reviewed. And rather than waiting for contestants to ask for help, Love Island will ""proactively"" check up on them after they have left the show. Last year, another former contestant of Love Island, Sophie Gradon, died aged 32. An inquest into her deathwas recently postponed. Meanwhile, a government minister has told the BBC that the public has ""started to enjoy reality TV a bit too much"" and needs to take a ""step back"". 'Love Island has got to open its eyes' 'I wish I'd never gone on reality TV' ""When something so awful happens it is natural to enter a period of soul-searching and ask whether anything could have been done to help avoid something so terrible happening,"" the ITV statement continued. This video can not be played Former Love Island contestant Zara Holland on what it's like inside the villa The statement outlines the support currently on offer, which includes every contestant debriefing with a medical team - including a psychological consultant - after they leave the show. ITV said that six months ago, the programme asked Dr Paul Litchfield - a well-being expert and former adviser to the government - to carry out a review into Love Island's medical processes. ""This review has led us to extend our support processes to offer therapy to all Islanders and not only those that reach out to us,"" it went on. ""And we will be delivering bespoke training to all future Islanders to include social media and financial management. ""The key focus will be for us to no longer be reliant on the Islanders asking us for support but for us to proactively check in with them on a regular basis."" 2016 Love Island contestant Sophie Gradon died last year Meanwhile, Health Minister Jackie Doyle-Price said reality TV was a ""bit voyeuristic"" and it was time for viewers to ""step back here"". She told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""And is this really what we want to be encouraging? Do we really want to encourage people to have five minutes of fame and then be dropped and then deal with all the mental stresses that come with that?"" Ms Doyle-Price called the two deaths a ""wake-up call"". After Mr Thalassitis found fame on Love Island, he also appeared on the reality show Celebs Go Dating in 2018. He split from The Only Way Is Essex star Megan McKenna late last year. Following his death, many other contestants of reality shows have spoken out to share tributes andto call for more supportfor people after they leave the programme and others like it. Concerns over the mental health pressures caused by sudden TV stardom have been raised in the past, for examplein the case of Britain's Got Talent runner-up Susan Boyle,externalwho was admitted to a London clinic in 2009. And there has long been discussion overthe well-being of contestants on Big Brother and Celebrity Big Brother. Big Brother contestants could often leave the house to be greeted with booing crowds, and in its early series the show employed an on-screen ""resident psychologist"". For more recent reality TV shows, such as Love Island and The Bachelor, there may not be waiting crowds as contestants get eliminated from the show, but they may instead endure trolling and negative comments on social media.

Parkinson's smell test explained by scienceA woman who can smell Parkinson's disease helps scientists discover what causes the musky odour.,"This video can not be played Joy Milne can smell Parkinson's disease before it is medically diagnosed A Scottish woman who astonished doctors with her ability to detect Parkinson's disease through smell has helped scientists find what causes the odour. Researchers in Manchester said they had identified the molecules on the skin linked to the smell and hope it could lead to early detection. The study was inspired by Joy Milne, a 68-year-old retired nurse from Perth. She first noticed the ""musky"" smell on her husband Les, who was years later diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. Joy has worked with the University of Manchester for three years Joy, who has worked with the University of Manchester on the research for three years, has been named in a paper being published in the journal ACS Central Science. The woman who can smell Parkinson's disease She has also been made an honorary lecturer at the university because of her efforts to help identify the telltale smell. Prof Perdita Barran designed experiments with a mass spectrometer to mimic what Joy does with her nose The research revealed that a number of compounds, particularly hippuric acid, eicosane, and octadecanal, were found in higher than usual concentrations on the skin of Parkinson's patients. They are contained in sebum - the oily secretion that coats everybody's skin, but which is often produced in greater quantity by people with Parkinson's, making them more likely to develop a skin complaint called seborrheic dermatitis. Lead author Prof Perdita Barran, from the school of chemistry at the University of Manchester, told BBC Scotland: ""What we found are some compounds that are more present in people who have got Parkinson's disease and the reason we've discovered them is because Joy Milne could smell a difference. ""She could smell people who've got Parkinson's disease. ""So we designed some experiments to mimic what Joy does, to use a mass spectrometer to do what Joy can do when she smells these things on people with Parkinson's."" One in 500 people in the UK has Parkinson's and that rises to about one in 100 among the over-60s. Joy's noticed the musky smell on her husband Les before he was diagnosed It can leave them struggling to walk, speak and sleep. Currently there is no cure and no definitive test for the disease, with clinicians diagnosing patients by observing symptoms. Prof Barran said she hoped the ""volatile biomarkers"" they identified could lead to a simple early detection test for the disease, such as wiping a person's neck with a swab and testing for the signature molecules. She said: ""What we might hope is if we can diagnose people earlier, before the motor symptoms come in, that there will be treatments that can prevent the disease spreading. So that's really the ultimate ambition."" Les died in 2015, 20 years after being diagnosed Joy's husband Les, who died in 2015, was told he had Parkinson's at the age of 45 but Joy said she detected the unusual musky smell about a decade earlier. The retired nurse only linked the odour to the disease after meeting people with the same distinctive smell at a Parkinson's UK support group. She told BBC Scotland that not knowing Les had Parkinson's put her family in a ""negative spiral"". ""What if we did know?,"" she said ""It would have changed things dramatically. ""The fact that he became withdrawn, reserved, he had bouts of depression and mood swings, if I had understood what was happening it would have changed our total outlook on life.""

UK democracy 'all but dead' - Trump Jr,"Donald Trump Jr said an anti-establishment movement was behind both Brexit and his father's election The current deadlock over Brexit and possible delay to the UK's planned leaving date of 29 March suggests democracy in the UK is ""all but dead"", Donald Trump Jr has claimed. Mr Trump Jr, who is the US president's son but holds no political position, wrote a columnin the Daily Telegraph.,external In it, he criticises PM Theresa May for having ""ignored advice from my father"". Mr Trump Jr added that ""the will of the people is likely to be ignored"" because of ""elite"" politicians in Brussels. The US businessman's intervention in UK politics comes with nine days to go until the UK's scheduled departure from the EU. In an interview with Sky News, US National Security Adviser John Bolton said US President Donald Trump wanted a resolution that allowed the US and Britain ""to come to trade deals again"". He added: ""He sees huge opportunity if Britain's status can be resolved."" Ms Mayis writing to the EUto formally ask for Brexit to be postponed, and Downing Street has confirmedthe prime minister will not be asking for a long delay. Any delay will then have to be agreed by all 27 EU member states and Mrs May is heading to Brussels on Thursday to discuss the matter with fellow leaders. However, 29 March remains the date the UK leaves the EU unless an extension is agreed before then.

Danish MP's baby 'not welcome' in chamber,"Mette Abildgaard's Facebook post garnered more than 1,000 comments A Danish MP has spoken out after being told to remove her baby from the parliament's chamber. Mette Abildgaard said it was the first time she had brought her five-month-old daughter to work, as her father could not step in to take care of her. Pia Kjaersgaard, parliament speaker and ex-leader of the right-wing Danish People's Party, reportedly told her she was ""not welcome"" with her baby. Ms Kjaersgaard said clearer guidelines should be given for MPs with children. In a post on Facebook,external, Ms Abildgaard, who is group leader of the Conservative People's Party, said she had witnessed another colleague taking their child to work without any problems so she did not ask permission to do so. She said she had agreed with her secretary that if her baby made ""the slightest noise"", she would not take her into the chamber, but as her daughter was ""in a good mood"" she decided to take her in. 'I thought parental leave would be easy' Ardern and Bhutto: Two different pregnancies in power 'Maternity leave is hard and lonely' Ms Kjaersgaard then passed a message to an assistant, asking the MP to remove her baby. ""MPs should be in the chamber, not babies or children,"" Ms Kjaersgaard later told news agency Ritzau. Her spokesman told Denmark's BT tabloid that she was only following the rules as speaker of Parliament and felt the baby was ""disturbing the meeting"". Denmark is among the most generous providers of parental leave in the world. New mothers are entitled to 18 weeks, with both parents entitled to a further 32 weeks which they can split between them as they please. In her Facebook post, Ms Abildgaard said she had chosen to return to work ""to serve democracy"". ""A chamber that represents mothers, fathers and babies ought to be open to mothers, fathers and babies,"" one Facebook user said in a comment. Jacinda Ardern was the first elected leader to take maternity leave This was not the first time that bringing a baby into the political sphere has made headlines. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern brought her baby along to her debut speechat the UN in New York in September, becoming the first world leader to attend a general assembly meeting with her child. And last year, footage of Canadian minister Karina Gould breastfeeding her son in parliament went viral. Laws in Western Australia are currently being discussed to allow mothers to breastfeed in parliament, but the proposals sparked controversy by not also allowing for bottle-feeding.

Gallery drops opioid-producing donor,"The redevelopment of the National Portrait Gallery is due to be finished in 2023 A Â£1m donation to the National Portrait Gallery has been withdrawn because the potential donors are alleged to have fuelled the US opioid crisis. The Sackler Trust, run by the family that owns Purdue Pharma, seller of prescription painkiller OxyContin, said the donation might ""deflect"" the gallery from its important work. The Sackler family has ""vigorously denied"" the allegations against it. The National Portrait Gallery said it supported the family's decision. The Sackler Trust offered the money in 2016 to go towards the gallery's Â£35.5m redevelopment. The gallery had been mulling over whether to accept it. 'Yoda magnet' fears over gallery revamp What are opioids and what are the risks? In a joint statement,external, the Sackler Trust and the National Portrait Gallery said they had ""jointly agreed not to proceed at this time"" with the donation. A spokesman for the Sackler family said: ""The giving philosophy of the family has always been to actively support institutions while never getting in the way of their mission. It has become evident that recent reporting of allegations made against Sackler family members may cause this new donation to deflect the National Portrait Gallery from its important work. ""The allegations against family members are vigorously denied, but to avoid being a distraction for the [National Portrait Gallery], we have decided not to proceed at this time with the donation."" This video can not be played On America's trail of destruction Purdue Pharma is facing lawsuits in the US alleging that it sold OxyContin as a drug with a low chance of causing addictions, despite knowing this was not true. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has said that opioids - a class of drug which includes everything from heroin to legal painkillers - were involved in almost 48,000 deaths in 2017. President Donald Trump has called the US opioid epidemic a ""national shame"" and declared it a public health emergency. US schools prepare for overdoses The epidemic started with legally prescribed painkillers including Percocet and OxyContin. It intensified as these were diverted to the black market. There has also been a sharp rise in the use of illegal opioids including heroin, while many street drugs are laced with powerful opioids such as Fentanyl, increasing the risk of overdose. Will Gompertz, arts editor Museum directors throughout the country might well have mixed feelings about the Sackler Trust's decision not to go ahead with a planned Â£1m gift to the National Portrait Gallery because it did not wish to ""distract"" the institution from its ""important work"". On the one hand, they will be relieved that some clarity has been brought to the Sackler situation, which has become a very hot topic in the subsidised arts sector. Should they or shouldn't they take the money? Is the reputational risk too high? Would other key supporters approve? Could there be a public backlash? Right now, it would appear, there are too many downsides - probably for both parties - to accept a high-profile, million-pound-plus donation with the Sackler name attached. On the other hand, they will be throwing their arms up in frustration. Fundraising is very difficult at the best of times, but it is harder still when you are discounting one of the wealthiest and most generous philanthropic donors in the land. The Sacker Trust is not one of thousands of similar foundations with huge sums to donate to the arts. It is not even one of hundreds. It is one of a very few who have the reserves and commitment to consistently make large-scale gifts to arts organisations. With it out of the game, at least temporarily, there are likely to be a few fundraising targets missed because of a Sackler-sized hole. The Sackler family is one of the wealthiest families in the US. The Sackler brothers - Raymond, who died in 2010, and Mortimer, who died in 2017 - set up Purdue Pharma in 1952. The firm's fortunes rose with the launch of OxyContin in 1995 and the drug formed the basis of the Sackler family fortune. The family still wholly owns the company, with about 20 members sharing in the money. According to Forbes,externalmagazine, in 2016 the family was worth about $13bn (Â£10bn). This video can not be played The heroin-ravaged city fighting back The company has paid hundreds of millions in the past to settle charges that it said OxyContin was safer and less addictive than it was. In a lawsuit filed earlier this year,external, the Massachusetts Attorney General said dangerous opioid drugs were killing people across the state and that prescription medicines, which were supposed to protect health, were instead ""ruining people's lives"". ""Purdue Pharma created the epidemic and profited from it through a web of illegal deceit. ""At the top of Purdue, a small group of executives led the deception and pocketed millions of dollars."" The defendants were named as two companies and seventeen individuals who ""engaged in a deadly, deceptive scheme to sell opioids in Massachusetts"". The members of the Sackler family named in the lawsuit were Richard Sackler, Beverly Sackler, David Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, Jonathan Sackler, Kathe Sackler, Mortimer Sackler, and Theresa Sackler. Campaigning group Culture Unstained welcomed Tuesday's announcement that Sackler Trust money would not go to the National Portrait Gallery. ""The Gallery's decision to reject a donation from those that profited from the opioid crisis is a powerful acknowledgement that some sources of funding cross a red line,"" it said. The group hailed ""renowned artist and former opioid addict"" Nan Goldin, who it said ""significantly escalated the pressure on the gallery after she threatened to pull out of a planned retrospective if it were to accept the donation"". ""It was Nan Goldin and her supporters who forced the [National Portrait Gallery] to confront the ethical questions surrounding the Sacklers."" Many UK cultural institutions have benefited from donations from the Sackler Trust in the past, including the Serpentine's Sackler Gallery, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the National Gallery. However, the BBC understands no UK institutions have applied for fresh funding from the trust since the allegations emerged in 2017. What are opioids and what are the risks?

Food and wine costs push inflation up,"Food and alcohol price rises helped push inflation higher in February, the first rise since August 2018. The rate of price changes, measured using the Consumer Prices Index (CPI), rose to 1.9%, from 1.8% in January. House prices are rising at their slowest rate for almost six years, the Office for National Statistics said. Inflation overall was ""stable"", with rising food and alcohol prices offset by slower price rises in clothing and footwear, the ONS said. Prices for food and non-alcoholic beverages went up by more from January to February this year than in the same period a year ago. The main upward contributions came from bread, cereals and vegetables, the ONS said. Tobacco prices also rose more than last year. Duty on a bottle of wine rose on 1 February, pushing the cost of a bottle up by 8p, a tax rise that was announced in the Autumn Budget, alongside a rise in duty on some some high-strength sparkling cider. ""Rising prices for food, alcohol and tobacco, and across a range of recreational and cultural goods produced the largest upward contributions,"" the ONS said. ""The largest, offsetting, downward contribution came from clothing and footwear, with prices rising between January and February... but by less than between the same two months a year ago."" The inflation rate measures price changes over the last 12 months and is updated every month. Prices are rising slightly more quickly, but the inflation rate remains close to the two year low it hit in January. Moreover wages are rising at a much faster pace, of 3.4%. So any consumers benefitting from salary increases will feel better off. Inflation fell slightly in January after the introduction of a cap on domestic energy prices. But the government has already planned to raise the level of that cap in April. Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), said that would mean further upward pressure on prices over the next few months. ""Businesses also continue to report that the cost of imported raw materials are rising,"" he said. However, he said that over the longer term, inflation would remain near the Bank of England's 2% target level because of ""the UK's weakening economic outlook"". Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said inflation was unlikely to stay below 2% for long and said February's rise marked ""the start of an upward trend which could see inflation reach 2.5% by April"". The UK's inflation rates peaked at a five-year high of 3.1% in November 2017. It's not just households, but the Bank of England too, which worries about the cost of living. It's tasked with setting interest rates to keep inflation close to a target of 2%. The latest rate of 1.9%, won't trouble those policy makers. But the Bank estimates it takes two years for interest rates to influence prices (largely via the spending and borrowing habits of households and businesses). So it's looking at the prospects for prices then, rather than now. And it's concerned faster wage growth - which official figures confirm, on average, are comfortably outstripping the cost of living - could have an impact by then. The view from the City is that those pressures won't persuade the Bank to raise rates yet - especially as the outcome of Brexit remains so unclear. But if the trend of faster real wage growth continues and a Brexit deal is swiftly agreed, with little disruption to the economy, some economists think there could be a small rate rise later this year. That's quite a few ifs. With prolonged uncertainty, or even a no-deal, some argue that the next move in interest rates, when it comes, may be down rather than up. The ONS said UK house prices in January rose by an annual 1.7%, the smallest increase since June 2013. The lower rate of house price rises was in large part down to a 1.6% fall in London house prices. Prices in the capital are 3.3% below their peak in June 2017, the ONS said. Jamie Durham, economist at PwC,  said: ""This decline is driven by ongoing uncertainty around Brexit - London has been particularly affected due to its integration with the rest of Europe."" ""London is not the only area with falling prices. House prices in the East of England also fell on an annual basis for the first time since October 2011, and declined by -0.2%. ""Elsewhere in the UK, strong positive house price inflation continued in the Midlands, and particularly the East Midlands. The North West and Yorkshire and the Humber also showed strong annual house price growth, of 3.4% and 2.9% respectively.""

US jury rules weedkiller a cancer 'factor',"A US jury has found that one of the world's most widely-used weedkillers was a ""substantial factor"" in causing a man's cancer. Pharmaceutical group Bayer had strongly rejected claims that its glyphosate-based Roundup product was carcinogenic. But the jury in San Francisco ruled unanimously that it contributed to causing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in California resident Edwin Hardeman. The next stage of the trial will consider Bayer's liability and damages. During this phase, which starts on Wednesday, Mr Hardeman's lawyers are expected to present evidence allegedly showing Bayer's efforts to influence scientists, regulators and the public about the safety of its products. In morning trading, Bayer's shares immediately plunged, dropping almost 12% to â¬61.62. The German company, which acquired Roundup as part of its $66bn takeover of US rival Monsanto, said it was disappointed with the jury's initial decision. ""We are confident the evidence in phase two will show that Monsanto's conduct has been appropriate and the company should not be liable for Mr. Hardeman's cancer,"" the company said. Bayer continues ""to believe firmly that science confirms that glyphosate-based herbicides do not cause cancer"". The case was only the second of some 11,200 Roundup lawsuits to go to trial in the US. Another California man was awarded $289m in August after a state court jury found Roundup caused his cancer, sending Bayer shares plunging at the time. That award was later reduced to $78m and is on appeal. Bayer has argued that decades of studies and regulatory assessments have shown the weed killer to be safe for human use. Mr Hardeman, 70, treated his property in Sonoma County, California, regularly with the herbicide from 1980 to 2012 and was eventually diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His lawyers Aimee Wagstaff and Jennifer Moore said in a joint statement their client was ""pleased"" with the decision. ""Now we can focus on the evidence that Monsanto has not taken a responsible, objective approach to the safety of Roundup,"" they added. ""Instead, it is clear from Monsanto's actions that it does not particularly care whether its product is in fact giving people cancer, focusing instead on manipulating public opinion and undermining anyone who raises genuine and legitimate concerns about the issue."" Another Roundup trial is scheduled to begin in California state court in Oakland on 28 March, involving a couple who claim Roundup caused their non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Glyphosate was introduced by Monsanto in 1974, but its patent expired in 2000, and now the chemical is sold by various manufacturers. In the US, more than 750 products contain it. In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the World Health Organisation's cancer agency, concluded thatglyphosate was ""probably carcinogenic to humans"",external. However, the US Environmental Protection Agency insists it is safe when used carefully. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) also says glyphosate is unlikely to cause cancer in humans. In November 2017EU countries voted to renew the licence of glyphosatedespite campaigns against it. In California - where a judge had ruled that coffee must carry a cancer warning - the agriculture industry sued to prevent such a label for glyphosate, even thoughthe state lists it as a chemical known to cause cancer,external.

EastEnders set rebuild project criticised,"The original set was only supposed to be used for two years The BBC has been criticised by a group of MPs for the way it has handled the redevelopment of the EastEnders set. In December, theNational Audit Office (NAO) revealedthat the project had gone Â£27m over budget. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said the BBC was ""complacent"" and the project ""was flawed from the start"". In a statement the BBC said it ""strongly rejected"" the ""notion that there has been any complacency in managing this project"". The PAC said the BBC should provide annual updates on the work to ""demonstrate it now has a firm grip on the project's costs and progress"". The current set has been there since 1984, with the soap first airing in February 1985. The project to build a new HD-ready Albert Square and expand the external EastEnders set was due to be completed by 2018, but won't be ready until 2023. The building project is codenamed E20, after Albert Square's notional postcode. The original 2015 forecast for the cost of the project was Â£59.7m, but the revised budget is now Â£86.7m. The PAC chairwoman, Labour MP Meg Hillier, said the BBC had made ""fundamental planning mistakes"", adding there was an ""apparent complacency"" with which the BBC approached the project which ""is entirely at odds with EastEnders' strategic importance to the Corporation"". The new outdoor lot will extend Walford to better reflect modern East End London The report from the PAC points out that the soap is a flagship programme for the BBC but is being ""outperformed by its soap rivals, such as Coronation Street, and its overall audience has reduced as fewer people watch traditional linear TV"". It adds: ""Therefore, it is important for EastEnders that the BBC completes E20 so that the programme is best placed to not only succeed but to also secure its long-term future."" ""It was a serious error at the outset not to consider exactly what skills would be needed to see E20 through,"" said Ms Hillier. ""The resulting shortfall in key expertise set the tone for much of what followed."" The report said: The BBC failed to allocate enough money to manage the risks and contingencies of the project in 2015. It took over a year for a design change process to be agreed between the E20 team and EastEnders production teams. Contract negotiations took six months longer than planned, partly because of discussions about what bricks to use for the set. The BBC underestimated the scale and complexity of the project, including how it would age the new sets so that they either exactly replicate what viewers are used to, or look realistic where there are new locations. The commercial problems the BBC has encountered on this project demonstrate its ineffective sourcing and negotiating approach, which may have implications for other contracts. Some of this criticism was also included in the NAO report, which also acknowledged that the BBC had faced issues such as asbestos and obstructions in the ground, which could not have been foreseen when the project was first planned. And inflation has also risen faster than expected in the construction industry. In a statement, the BBC said they welcomed the PAC's ""recognition of the importance of the E20 project to secure the long-term future of EastEnders"", and pointed out the project has ""already delivered many vital improvements at BBC Elstree Centre which help other programmes"". ""However, we strongly reject the notion that there has been any complacency in managing this project. Like any building work of this scale, there have been challenges along the way including construction market issues beyond our control and working on a brownfield site. ""We have made improvements to the project and continue to keep it under close scrutiny."" Follow us onFacebook,external, on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external, or on Instagram atbbcnewsents,external.

Oil industry 'needs ÃÂ£200bn of investment',"A total of Â£200bn needs to be spent by exploration and production companies to fully exploit the UK oil and gas sector's remaining potential, a new report has said. Industry body Oil and Gas UK (OGUK) said its Business Outlook Report 2019 showed the need for a focus on cost and efficiencies was the ""new reality"". The study reveals production has increased by 20% over the past five years. This follows 14 years of decline. The report found 62% of contractor companies had an improved outlook for 2019, but that many areas of the supply chain were still facing challenges. The Â£200bn figure is seen as pivotal for ""adding a generation of productive life"" to the area. OGUK chief executive Deirdre Michie said the report showed that industry's approach during the downturn was delivering results. She said: ""Following 14 years of decline, production has increased by a fifth over the past five years. Cost improvements are being sustained and there is building momentum around exploration, with more new opportunities being drilled and the largest two conventional discoveries for a decade made in the second half of 2018. ""Our report finds an industry that's getting better at what it does, getting smarter in how it does it and is well positioned to deliver attractive returns on investment within this environment, maintaining our global competitiveness. ""This is the new reality and we need to embrace it."" She acknowledged that supply chain companies faced challenges with revenues and profit margins still under pressure, and cash flow stretched. ""If capabilities and resources are to stay anchored here in the UK, there must be a competitive proposition for supply chain companies to invest in too,"" she added. ""With focus on adding a generation of productive life to the basin, our report reveals around Â£200 billion will need to be spent to find, develop and operate the reserves of the future. ""This is a UK industry which is critical for security of energy supply, at the heart of the move to a lower carbon economy, supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and contributes billions to the economy. ""With the new reality clear and clarity around the future potential, there is all to play for."" Scotland's Energy Minister Paul Wheelhouse said the report showed that the strategies adopted by operators and the supply chain were now helping to deliver sustained efficiencies across the sector. He added: ""However, it is clear that more needs to be done to realise the industry's Vision 2035, including diversification into new areas such as transitional technologies and areas such as hydrogen production, and providing sustainable opportunities for the supply chain which, while seeing improvements, is still continuing to face challenges in some areas.

Brexit food stockpiling loan ad banned,"A financial services company has been ordered not to reuse an advert in which it tried to persuade people to take out a loan, in case they wanted to stockpile food because of Brexit. Cash On Go, trading as Peachy.co.uk, sent out an email saying, ""it's a good idea to have a little stockpile ready."" The Advertising Standards Authority upheld a complaint from a reader who said the advert was irresponsible. Peachy said it referred to Brexit light-heartedly and to make it topical. It added that it wanted to reflect some situations where people may find it hard to prepare fully for unexpected scenarios. The advert talked about Brexit, saying that some people had said it ""could affect the amount of food available"". It went on to say that while the company did not want to believe this claim, it was worth consumers buying some extra food because ""that way, you're always prepared for the worst"". It also offered a promotional discount for a loan if readers used a button saying: ""In case of emergency, press here."" Warehouses thriving from Brexit stockpiling Manufacturers stockpiling at record pace The ASA said that the advert was likely to put emotional pressure on people and added: ""We considered that the ad's references to possible food shortages and the stockpiling of food were likely to play on some people's concerns regarding Brexit, including financially vulnerable consumers who were already struggling or worrying about their financial situation."" The ASA ruled that the advert must not appear again in its current form. ""We told Peachy to ensure future ads did not send an irresponsible message about debt to readers,"" it added. In response, Peachy said it would abide by the ruling not to use the advert any more and would ensure it ""considered public sensitivities more thoroughly"".

Genetic reserve to protect Scots Pine,"Scots pines growing at Beinn Eighe have developed their own DNA signature over hundreds of years The Beinn Eighe nature reserve in Wester Ross has been named the UK's first genetic conservation area.  Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and its scientific partners hope to protect the unique DNA fingerprint of the area's totemic Scots pine trees. The Scots pine is Scotland's national tree. Its distinctive and asymmetric appearance sets it apart from the standard bottle brushes which cloak so much of rural Scotland, its ragged glory swelling many a Scot's chest. The bad news? It's not particularly Scottish. You can find Scots pines growing in northern latitudes from here to Siberia. But the north west of Scotland does boast a population of Pinus sylvestris (that's its formal name) which is unique. The Scots pines growing in the east of the country enjoy a climate which is relatively dry. (Please note the ""relatively"". After all, this is Scotland we're talking about.) A Scots pine seedling on Beinn Eighe Far to the west on the SNH reserve at Beinn Eighe, there are as many as 10,000 Scots pines, some of them more than 350 years old. These trees have endured in a climate which is hugely different. That has created a DNA signature which is unique to the pines in the area. These are, if you like, especially Scottish Scots pines. SNH's woodland adviser Jeanette Hall says it has created a genetic code worth preserving. She says: ""It's much milder, much longer growing season, much wetter - and the pine that is growing here has had to adapt to that over the last few hundred years."" In 1951 this precious area of Caledonian pine forest became the first place in the UK to be designated a national nature reserve. Now it has notched up another UK first as a Gene Conservation Unit with the European Forest Genetic Resources Programme. Scots Pine boughs at dusk The big idea is to manage the pine forest, not as a tree museum to preserve the pines as they are now, but to enable their DNA to keep evolving and adapting to changes in the environment. The work is part of a wider effort to conserve genetic diversity in Scotland's wild species, itself part of theAichi Target 13 drive,externalto preserve and develop the world's biological diversity. SNH's partners include Edinburgh University, Scotland's Rural College, the Moredun and James Hutton research institutes, Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland, Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture, the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the Royal Botanic Garden Kew, Forest Research and the Forestry Commission Scotland. The Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh (RBGE) is a key player. It holds more than three million plant samples dating from as early as the 17th Century, some of them collected by Charles Darwin. Its modern DNA labs have contributed to a revolution in understanding plant life. ""By conserving genetic diversity we're essentially helping nature to help itself,"" says the RBGE's head of science Prof Pete Hollingsworth. ""Genetic diversity is needed to allow the Scots pine to adapt and change as our environment changes, as our climate changes."" Scots pines growing beside the mountain trail at Beinn Eighe National Nature Reserve The development of this project will be closely watched. If it is successful it is unlikely to remain the UK's only genetic conservation area. Jeanette Hall believes there is much at stake. She says: ""One of the things at risk if we get it wrong, if pine is unable to regenerate, is fossilising the woodland as it is now, which will prevent adaptation in the future. ""Ultimately we could lose the woodland.  But also we would lose a lot of unique genetic material that isn't represented anywhere else in Scotland - or across the world.""

Watchdogs 'must prove consumers protected',"Four major UK regulators need to do more to prove they are offering enough protection to those who need it, spending watchdog the NAO has said. Ofwat, Ofgem, Ofcom and the FCA understand the ""significant difficulties"" facing consumers. But they can't prove they are effectively responding to them, the National Audit Office (NAO) said. The most common problem facing consumers in these sectors was how to handle debt, the NAO added. The watchdog recommended that regulators do more to measure their performance ""so that they can understand what is working well for consumers and what isn't"". The most common consumer problem across all four sectors was dealing with debt from bills and credit repayments. The situation for some consumers has not been helped by real-term price increases of 28% in gas, 37% in electricity and 6% in water since 2007. Consumers can find it difficult to get the best deal or service, leading to those who fail to switch paying a collective ""loyalty penalty"" of an estimated Â£4.1bn a year, the NAO said. Vulnerable customers are less likely to switch, the spending watchdog noted. It added that 15% of broadband customers complained about their service last year, most commonly about connection problems, while 36,000 homes were left without any water for more than a day during last year's ""Beast from the East"" bad weather. Heavy snowfall affected large parts of the UK in 2018, as seen here in Ripponden, Yorkshire The NAO said regulators do not have a common way of measuring or sharing issues that affect consumers across the different sectors they regulate. It added that regulators have not been specific enough in defining what they would like to see happen for consumers, saying that ""high-level aims"" were not matched by practical targets. Amyas Morse, NAO head, said: ""Regulators need to do more to show the concrete results they are aiming to achieve for consumers. ""I understand that there is a difficult balance to be struck between long and short-term outcomes, between the needs of businesses and the interests of consumers, but at present the regulators' results can come across as somewhat academic and detached from people's practical concerns and pressures."" An Ofgem spokesman said: ""We agree with the NAO that regulators need to effectively measure their impact to help deliver the best possible outcomes for consumers. He added that Ofgem ""has already made progress in this area"". ""Last year, for example, we published our first Consumer Impact Report measuring how much our regulatory decisions were expected to benefit consumers and we also publish annual reports on the state of the energy market and on the situation of vulnerable consumers."" An Ofwat spokesperson said it would ""look seriously"" at the NAO's recommendations. An Ofcom spokesperson said: ""We'll keep working closely with other regulators, exploring different ways to measure the effectiveness of our work."" Andrew Bailey, chief executive at the FCA, said: ""Understanding the impact of our interventions is an important part of our mission to ensure that financial markets are working in consumers' best interests. ""We will consider the National Audit Office's recommendations when evaluating our work to protect consumers."" Consumer group Which? said that there was a severe lack of trust in some essential markets ""because people don't believe their interests are being put first"". Caroline Normand, Which? director of advocacy, called for more powers for regulators ""to take on the might of powerful companies."" ""Regulators must also step up and clearly demonstrate how their work is making a positive difference and stopping people from getting ripped off,"" she added. Labour shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said: ""This confirms what households struggling with extortionate bills have known for a long time: regulators have a limited ability to protect customer interests. ""This is partly due to a lack of regulatory teeth, and partly due to the inherent contradictions in pitting the needs of bill payers against those of private companies looking to maximise profits. She added that a Labour government would ""fundamentally reform our regulatory system, for example, by absorbing Ofwat into Defra to create a National Water Agency.""

May will not seek long Brexit delay from EU,"This video can not be played Donald Tusk: Extension possible but conditional on positive Brexit vote The EU will only agree to a short delay to Brexit if MPs approve the current withdrawal agreement next week, Theresa May has been told. EU Council President Donald Tusk said an extension, requested by the prime minister on Wednesday, was possible. Mrs May has written to Mr Tusk requesting a Brexit delay to 30 June, saying she needed more time to get her deal agreed by MPs and passed into law. The PM will be making a statement from Downing Street at 20:15 GMT. Mr Tusk said he believed all 27 other EU members, who must sign off on the extension, would agree but it depended on a ""positive"" vote in the House of Commons. The length of any extension was open for discussion, he told reporters in Brussels. The UK is due to leave the EU next Friday, on 29 March. In full: May's Brexit delay letter to EU LIVE: Reaction to Brexit delay Brexit: What could happen next? While a delay until 30 June ""had its merits"", Mr Tusk also suggested there were ""political and legal"" questions about delaying Brexit beyond 23 May - when European elections will be held. While the current withdrawal agreement could not be changed, he suggested additional legal assurances the EU gave Mrs May in Strasbourg last week could be formalised to help get the backing of MPs.

Meanwhile, an emergency debate took place in Parliament on Wednesday afternoon, with Labour pressing for further detail about the PM's intentions and demanding that any delay is long enough to allow MPs to ""break the impasse and find a way forward"". The prime minister is meeting MPs from opposition parties to discuss her letter. But ahead of the meeting, the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, Lib Dem leader Vince Cable MP, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts and the Green Party MP Caroline Lucas released a joint statement, calling for a longer extension and for Parliament to sit continuously ""until it can reach a decision"". This video can not be played PM: 'Not prepared' to delay Brexit beyond 30 June At a highly charged Prime Minister's Questions earlier, Mrs May said MPs had ""indulged themselves on Europe for too long"" and voters ""deserved better"". She said she had rejected calls for a longer delay to Brexit because she wanted to avoid the UK taking part in European elections in May, which she said would be ""unacceptable"" three years after voting to leave the EU. ""It would be a failure to deliver on the referendum decision this House said it would deliver,"" she told the Commons. But she added: ""As prime minister I could not consider a further delay beyond 30 June."" This was seen by some as an indication that Mrs May would resign rather than seek a further delay.

Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused her of leading the UK into ""crisis, chaos and division"". ""We are still legally due to leave the European Union in nine days' time,"" he told Mrs May at PMQs. ""Months of running down the clock and a concerted campaign of blackmail, bullying and bribery has failed to convince the House or the country that her deal is anything but a damaging national failure and should be rejected."" He urged the prime minister to meet him later on Wednesday to discuss a ""compromise to get through this crisis"", a plea ignored by the PM. The Labour leader will travel to Brussels on Thursday to meet the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier. He is also expected to hold talks with several EU 27 leaders. In her letter to Mr Tusk, the prime minister says she had wanted to hold a Commons vote on her withdrawal agreement this week but had been prevented from doing so by Commons Speaker John Bercow. But she adds: ""It remains my intention to bring the deal back to the House."" If the motion is passed, more time will be needed for Parliament to ratify the deal, she says. There is no mention in the letter of a longer delay, as some had been expecting. This video can not be played Is the UK in a crisis over leaving the EU? Mrs May, who has been meeting groups of cabinet ministers on Wednesday afternoon, told MPs that an extension beyond 30 June would not ""take no-deal off the table"" if an agreement had still not been reached. She has repeatedly insisted the UK would leave the EU on 29 March and she told MPs it had always been her preferred option, but with a withdrawal deal to ensure it was an ""orderly"" exit. But she was forced to seek a delay after MPs twice rejected the withdrawal deal she has agreed with the EU by massive margins and voted to reject a no-deal Brexit.

New threat of alt-right violence,"The suspect flashed a hand sign as he appeared in court on Saturday charged with murder The man accused of the Christchurch shootings left a trail of references to online culture and extremist alt-right ideology. When he first appeared in court, Brenton Tarrant flashed an ""OK"" hand sign. The gesture was described in some accounts as a white nationalist symbol, but perhaps more accurately could be called a trollish gesture. It is used by extremists, but also by a range of conservatives, far-right figures and the alt-right - a disparate group of activists who congregate on extreme message boards. A document posted shortly before the shooting and widely credited to the suspect, indicates the author is steeped in the alt-right's toxic culture. Online, white nationalist ideology hides under layers of irony, often allowing its proponents to duck accusations of extremism while actively spreading hateful language and memes. Potential clues to the suspect's ideology and inspiration also appear in a live-streamed video whichsocial networks have struggled to completely take down. The written document was posted on the extreme message board 8chan shortly before the attack began on Friday. It has been called a ""manifesto"" but that term rather grandly overstates a confused jumble of thoughts and misinformation which rambles on for 74 poorly-written pages. Beyond Today podcast:Christchurch: how do you find the terrorists among the trolls? BBC Trending radio:What is 4chan? In it, the author describes the conservative activist Candace Owens as a key influence. While Owens has repeated claims about declining birth rates and dubious statistics about population growth in European countries, her influence over the suspect is doubtful considering his committed opposition to minorities in Western countries and the fact that Owens is an African-American. The document also includes an internet-famous joke - a piece of ""copypasta"", or a block of text that has been copied and pasted from elsewhere. The joke involves a US ""Navy Seal"" who claims to be posting on 4chan's extreme /pol/ (short for ""politically incorrect"") message board. Elsewhere in the document, the writer says that popular video games taught him about ethno-nationalism and violence, before immediately dismissing that idea. All of these appear to be sick ""jokes"" - not the laugh-out-loud funny kind but rather the internet meme kind, designed to make it difficult for people to glean his true meaning. Difficult - but not impossible. Police officers stand guard near the scene of the deadly shooting in New Zealand At the start of the document and throughout, the author refers to a conspiracy theory central to the new brand of far-right extremism springing from the alt-right: that there is a grand plan to eliminate the ""white race"" through a combination of immigration and interbreeding. It's a fiction that plays into the paranoia of the hardcore alt-right, and relies on false assumptions about fixed, sharply genetically defined racial groups, bogus and distorted statistics, and the racist ""one-drop"" theory from early 20th Century America: the idea that any amount of racial interbreeding negates white racial heritage. The bizarre conception of a monolithic genetic ""white"" culture under worldwide attack is a mainstay of the alt-right - although most of the amorphous movement's leaders would outwardly denounce specific acts of violence like the attack in Christchurch. Mosque attacks mapped What is known about NZ shooting suspect? Trumpâs shock troops: Who are the âalt-rightâ? 'I went undercover in the alt-right' The movement's foot soldiers are less inhibited. Shortly after the attack, on the nearly-anything-goes message boards 8chan and 4chan, there were a few scattered thoughts of condolence for the victims. But they were swamped by waves of vile abuse, extremist celebration of the attacks, exhortations to more violence and worries about how the attack would negatively affect white nationalist causes. At the same time, alt-right and relatively less extreme activists speculated that mainstream media outlets would take the entire ""manifesto"" document at face value. That didn't really happen. Robert Evans,writing for the investigative news site Bellingcat,external, sounded an early alarm shortly after the attacks, and wrote that the document was a trap laid for journalists. ""There is truth in there, and valuable clues to the shooter's radicalization, but it is buried beneath a great deal"" of trolling (Evans himself uses a more specific, scatological, term). Local news outlets including Radio New Zealand and The New Zealand Herald steered clear of reporting on the document in any detail in the hours immediately after the attacks. At the same time, reporters from the international mainstream press - outlets likeThe New York Times,externalandThe Atlantic,external- easily saw through the apparent misinformation. One question raised in the aftermath of the attack is: Why aren't the authorities doing more to monitor sites like 4chan and 8chan to pick up on potential extremist activity? Setting aside the difficulty of tracing people who use the completely anonymous message boards, even constant monitoring might not be effective. This is because of the sheer volume of material posted, which includes near-constant violent language and threats. According to web statistics site Alexa, 8chan isamong the top 5,000 websites in the world,external, even though it does not show up in Google results. 4chan,which is among the top 1,000,external, claims to host 1 million new posts per day and attract nearly 28 million monthly unique visitors. The chans are places where racial slurs and exhortations to violence and suicide are not just common, but form the fundamental language by which users communicate. On the slices of 4chan and 8chan devoted to politics (there are many other sections devoted to less extreme parts of internet culture), there is a near total dehumanisation of victims of terror attacks - and everyone else. The victims: a child, a father, an aspiring footballer 'This mosque was precious to us': A city in shock The children who lost a best friend Anyone looking from the outside might have difficulty separating the often-shocking irony from authentic red flags - posts like the one made shortly before the Christchurch attacks. Alt-right activists have used this irony as both a sword and a shield - to poke their liberal enemies who take their words at face value and to deny responsibility for egging on murderers and white nationalist terrorists. For instance, the idea of turning the ""OK"" gesture into a white nationalist signifierwas floated in early 2017,external. The anonymous poster - on 4chan,everyoneis an anonymous poster - outlined a plan to create fake accounts that would supposedly trick ""leftists"" into denouncing a common, everyday hand gesture, and thus open themselves to ridicule. Many people on social media took the bait. At the same time, far-right activists and conservatives started flashing the ""OK"" sign more frequently - as did hardcore white nationalists. When the alt-right first came to prominence on the coattails of Donald Trump's election campaign, its cheerleaders onright-wing websites were able to dismiss concerns about the movement,externalas overreaction by left-wing activists and the mainstream media. But that was before the full extent of the movement's violent fringes had completely come to light. According to a recent study from the US-based Southern Poverty Law Center,more than 40 murders have been committed by people with alt-right links,externalsince 2014. Some of the more well-known incidents include the murder of a peaceful protester in Charlottesville, Virginia, a 2017 double murder in Portland, Oregon, and a massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh last year. And now, in Christchurch, the alt-right death toll has more than doubled.

Father and son in first NZ mosque funeral,"The burials have been delayed because of the identification process A father and son from Syria have been buried in New Zealand, the first funerals for the 50 victims of last week's mosque shootings. Khaled Mustafa, 44, and Hamza, 16, came as refugees to New Zealand last year. Six burials took place on Wednesday. Police hope they will soon be able to release the bodies of all those killed in the two Christchurch mosques. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. Islamic tradition calls for bodies to be buried as soon as possible, but the funerals have been delayed by the scale of the identification process. NZ PM vows never to say gunman's name Christchurch and the new threat of far-right violence Students perform Haka for attack victims Zaid Mustafa attended the funeral of his father and brother in a wheelchair Hundreds of mourners gathered at a cemetery near the Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch on Wednesday, one of two places of worship targeted in last Friday's attacks. The two victims buried were killed at the Al-Noor mosque. Khaled leaves behind a wife and a younger teenage son, who was injured in the attack. Zaid Mustafa attended the funeral in a wheelchair. ""I shouldn't be standing in front of you. I should be lying beside you,"" Zaid Mustafa said, according to bystanders cited by AFP. Fifty people lost their lives in the shootings at two mosques in the city. The child, the father, the aspiring footballer 'This mosque was precious to us': A city in shock 'I lost a best friend' Police on Wednesday named six of the victims of the shootings and said all post-mortem examinations were complete. Yet some families expressed frustration with the delayed identification process. Police Commissioner Mike Bush said authorities had to prove the cause of death so that the courts could treat it as murder. ""You cannot convict for murder without that cause of death,"" he said. ""So this is a very comprehensive process that must be completed to the highest standard."" This video can not be played A comic is asking searching questions about race relations in the wake of the attack Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said there would be two minutes of silence on Friday, which is the Muslim day of prayer and will mark one week since the shooting. The Islamic call to prayer will also be broadcast on national TV and radio on Friday. The rites vary between regions, but one common feature is that the deceased must not be cremated - and must be buried as soon as possible after death, usually within 24 hours. However, community leaders say that if a person has not died from natural causes, a delay is acceptable. Other rites performed as soon as possible after death - often within hours - include washing the body, and wrapping it in cloth. Men's bodies are washed by men, and women's by women. ""We treat the body as if it is still alive,"" Rehanna Ali, of the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand, told a press conference. ""We cleanse it as we would before we were about to pray. Because we believe that the soul in this body is about to undertake a journey to God, and this is a form of worship."" The body is shrouded in a simple white, unsewn cloth to symbolise that the person is leaving behind all material goods. Muslim funerals do not usually involve a service or eulogy. Before the burial, formal prayers are said for the forgiveness of the dead. Coffins are not used, and pallbearers rarely feature. Once at the cemetery, the body is shouldered by members of the Muslim community, and laid by the graveside. Family members will lower the deceased into the ground, with his or her head facing towards Mecca. Jacinda Ardern received a hug from a student when she visited Cashmere High School On Wednesday, Ms Ardern visited Cashmere High School, which lost pupils Sayyad Milne and Hamza Mustafa, and former student Tariq Omar, in the attack. She asked students to help her rid New Zealand of racism and reiterated her call ""never to mention the perpetrator's name... never remember him for what he did"". Following an appeal by Ms Ardern, some New Zealanders have begun handing in weapons. John Hart, a farmer in the North Island district of Masterton, posted on Twitter that he had given his semi-automatic rifle to police to be destroyed. Allow Twitter content?

"May to ask EU for Brexit date delayThe PM will write to the EU asking for Brexit to be postponed, amid reports of a cabinet row.","Prime Minister Theresa May is writing to the EU to formally ask for Brexit to be postponed. One ministerial source told the BBC the longer delay could be up to two years, amid reports of a cabinet row, but No 10 said no decision had been made. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU would not grant a delay without a ""concrete plan"" from the UK about what they would do with it. Under current law the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal in nine days. MPs rejected the withdrawal deal Mrs May has negotiated with the EU for a second time last week by 149 votes. They also voted in favour of ruling out leaving the EU without a deal, andin favour of extending the Brexit process. The prime minister had hoped to have another try at getting MPs to back the deal this week - but Speaker John Bercow effectively torpedoed that with hissurprise interventionon Monday. Kuenssberg: Cabinet split on Brexit delay Brexitcast: The last days of Rome Merkel to fight for 'orderly Brexit' Brexit: A really simple guide She still hopes to ultimately get it in front of MPs for a third go, but says even if that happens and they vote in favour of it, the UK will need a short extension to get the necessary legislation through Parliament. A cabinet source told the BBC she therefore plans to ask the EU to agree to postpone the UK's departure until 30 June, but with an option of a longer delay as well. Mrs May has warned Brexiteer Tories that a longer extension will be needed if her deal does not get through Parliament. This video can not be played Will the UK leave the EU on time? One ministerial sourcetold the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg,externalthere was ""no agreement"" around the cabinet table when a delay was discussed. Another cabinet source said they were frustrated that the PM had not been clear about which delay option she would be arguing for. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom is said to have criticised colleagues, saying they now amounted to a ""Remain cabinet"", not a ""Brexit cabinet"". Chancellor Philip Hammond said ministers all wanted the ""shortest possible delay"" but cabinet members ""have different approaches to how we should do this"". Any delay will have to be agreed by all 27 EU member states and Mrs May is heading to Brussels on Thursday to discuss the options with fellow leaders. The PM is writing to the EU to ask for Brexit to be postponed Mrs May will travel to an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the delay options All 27 EU members have to agree to any extension proposed If an extension is agreed, Mrs May will probably try to get her deal - that was previously heavily defeated - through Parliament MPs and peers will also get a vote on any delay Talks have been continuing with the DUP and Tory Brexiteers who voted against the deal The government could seek to hold a third ""meaningful vote"" on the withdrawal agreement next week But the speaker has said he will not let MPs vote again if the question is exactly the same The UK leaves the EU on 29 March with or without a deal, unless a delay is agreed Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who campaigned to remain in the EU, told BBC Newsnight that the question of whether to have another referendum was ""for a later time"". Although leaving without a deal was still the default position, Mr Blair said a no-deal Brexit ""won't happen"", adding that the challenge now was making any extension to Article 50 count. Mr Blair called for a delay of between nine months and a year to ""allow Parliament to reach a conclusive opinion on the central Brexit question - soft or hard?"" On Monday, the Speaker said he would not allow a third ""meaningful vote"" in the coming days on ""substantially the same"" motion as MPs rejected last week. What Bercow ruling means for Brexit Who is the Speaker and why does he shout order? Brexit: What could happen next? How could Article 50 be extended? Mr Bercow declined to discuss the reasons for his decision when questioned by the BBC, as he made his way in to Parliament the following day. This video can not be played Commons Speaker John Bercow is questioned on Brexit vote decision Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay suggested a third vote on the Brexit deal could take place next week - after Mrs May has sought a delay. On Mr Bercow's ruling, he said it was important to ""respect the referee"" and abide by his decisions - but, he added, the Speaker himself had said in the past that if Parliament was guided only by precedent then ""nothing ever would change"". Mr Barclay suggested that MPs would ""find a way"" to get another vote, if the government manages to persuade enough of them, including the 10 Democratic Unionists, to change their mind and back the deal. At a news conference in Brussels, Mr Barnier said it was up to the 27 EU leaders to decide whether to grant a delay, based on what was in the ""best interest"" of the bloc. But for a longer delay ""there needs to be a new event"" or a ""new political process"" - so that ""we are not back in the same situation as today"". ""Extending the uncertainty without a clear plan would add to the economic cost for our business but will also incur a political cost for the EU,"" said Mr Barnier. ""It is for the British government and Parliament to decide very quickly what the UK wants to do next."" Mr Barnier also warned that UK MPs voting against ""no deal"" would not prevent it from happening, saying that ""everyone should now finalise all preparations for a no-deal scenario"". BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said the EU had ""little trust"" in the prime minister, with some leaders wanting to see proof from Parliament that MPs would support a longer delay before the EU signed up to it. She said there was ""irritation"" that those at Westminster appeared to be ""inward-looking"" and were not taking into account the cost of a delay to the EU. And she said the EU's final decision on a delay may not be given this week, with talk of an emergency summit on 28 March. Angela Merkel: I will fight to the last hour of the deadline Earlier,German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would struggleuntil the last possible moment to achieve ""an orderly Brexit"", saying the interests of Germany, Britain and the EU were at stake. Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar and European Council president Donald Tusk released a joint statement after their meeting in Dublin. ""They agreed that we must now see what proposals emerge from London in advance of the European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday,"" it said. The Labour leader has been holding talks with other opposition parties Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Speaker's intervention showed Mr Bercow was ""ensuring Parliament is taken seriously"". He said he had spoken to Conservative and Labour MPs about a so-called Norway-Plus style of future relationship with the EU - a closer one than Mrs May's deal would bring about - calling it an ""interesting idea"" which had not got his ""complete support"". When asked about another referendum, he said: ""The issue has to be put to the people after Parliament has made some kind of decision."" He said a public vote had to be on a range of options, saying: ""It cannot just be on Theresa May's deal or Remain - there has to be some choice for the people."" Mr Corbyn also held ""constructive"" talks with the Westminster leaders of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green Party about the potential to unite around a closer future relationship with the EU, a Labour spokesman said. Reality Check: What is the Norway model? What happened with Brexit last week? But Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, suggested the Labour leader had not really engaged during the meeting with the case for giving the public the final say on Brexit. ""We were there to talk about a People's Vote and the only thing I felt he was comfortable talking about was Labour's version of Brexit,"" she said.

US jury rules weedkiller a cancer 'factor'Jury to consider damages after one of the world's most widely-used weedkillers is blamed for cancer.Business,"A US jury has found that one of the world's most widely-used weedkillers was a ""substantial factor"" in causing a man's cancer. Pharmaceutical group Bayer had strongly rejected claims that its glyphosate-based Roundup product was carcinogenic. But the jury in San Francisco ruled unanimously that it contributed to causing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in California resident Edwin Hardeman. The next stage of the trial will consider Bayer's liability and damages. During this phase, which starts on Wednesday, Mr Hardeman's lawyers are expected to present evidence allegedly showing Bayer's efforts to influence scientists, regulators and the public about the safety of its products. In morning trading, Bayer's shares immediately plunged, dropping almost 12% to â¬61.62. The German company, which acquired Roundup as part of its $66bn takeover of US rival Monsanto, said it was disappointed with the jury's initial decision. ""We are confident the evidence in phase two will show that Monsanto's conduct has been appropriate and the company should not be liable for Mr. Hardeman's cancer,"" the company said. Bayer continues ""to believe firmly that science confirms that glyphosate-based herbicides do not cause cancer"". The case was only the second of some 11,200 Roundup lawsuits to go to trial in the US. Another California man was awarded $289m in August after a state court jury found Roundup caused his cancer, sending Bayer shares plunging at the time. That award was later reduced to $78m and is on appeal. Bayer has argued that decades of studies and regulatory assessments have shown the weed killer to be safe for human use. Mr Hardeman, 70, treated his property in Sonoma County, California, regularly with the herbicide from 1980 to 2012 and was eventually diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. His lawyers Aimee Wagstaff and Jennifer Moore said in a joint statement their client was ""pleased"" with the decision. ""Now we can focus on the evidence that Monsanto has not taken a responsible, objective approach to the safety of Roundup,"" they added. ""Instead, it is clear from Monsanto's actions that it does not particularly care whether its product is in fact giving people cancer, focusing instead on manipulating public opinion and undermining anyone who raises genuine and legitimate concerns about the issue."" Another Roundup trial is scheduled to begin in California state court in Oakland on 28 March, involving a couple who claim Roundup caused their non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Glyphosate was introduced by Monsanto in 1974, but its patent expired in 2000, and now the chemical is sold by various manufacturers. In the US, more than 750 products contain it.

In November 2017EU countries voted to renew the licence of glyphosatedespite campaigns against it.

"'Abuse of power' over land ownershipThe Scottish Land Commission's investigation says a ""land monopoly"" exists in effect in many parts of Scotland.Scotland","Large concentrations of land ownership are leading to power being abused in some parts of Scotland, according to a report by the Scottish Land Commission. Its investigation said a ""land monopoly"" in effect existed in many areas. The report also said the law provided very little protection. Scottish Land and Estates, which represents land owners, said the report did not adequately reflect the contribution made by rural businesses. The commission's report calls for a public interest test for future land sales. More than 400 people gave evidence to the investigation, including land owners, land managers and community representatives and individuals. The report found that most of the disadvantages from Scotland's current pattern of land ownership related to a concentration of decision-making power. It said that in some parts, that hampered economic development and caused serious and long-term harm to communities. It added that there was an ""urgent need"" for mechanisms to protect fragile communities from the ""irresponsible exercise of power"". The commission's chief executive officer Hamish Trench said: ""Concern about the impacts of concentrated land ownership in Scotland has long been central to the land reform debate. ""This evidence report allows us to move on from debating whether ownership is an issue, to understanding what the issues are and how they can be addressed. ""The evidence we have collected shows clearly that it is the concentration of power associated with land ownership, rather than necessarily the scale of landholding, that has a significant impact on the public interest, for example in relation to economic opportunities, housing and community development."" He added: ""Good management can of course reduce the risks associated with the concentration of power and decision-making, but the evidence shows that adverse impacts are causing significant detriment to the communities affected. ""This points to the need for systemic change beyond simply a focus on good management."" The commission makes a series of recommendations including: A public interest test for significant land transfers The requirement for a land management plan for estates A statutory land rights and responsibilities review. The report and recommendations will now be considered by ministers. Sarah-Jane Laing, chief executive of Scottish Land and Estates, said: ""We are deeply concerned that the report still sees land ownership rather than land use as the prime route to dealing with issues being faced by communities. Nor does the report adequately reflect the positive and substantial contribution made by rural businesses. ""We also want to see more detailed and compelling examples to support the report's claim that concentrated landownership is damaging fragile communities. ""The stereotypical view of landowners held by some simply do not reflect current day reality."" She added: ""Landowners generally operate as modern businesses involved in a range of sectors such as agriculture, forestry, energy, leisure and tourism and pursuing innovation, economic prosperity and employment opportunities. ""For example, more than 9,000 rural homes are let by private land-based businesses and Scotland's three new towns are being developed by rural landowners."" The report describes abuse of power in rural communities as a result of individual behaviour and suggests that policy focus should be on changing those behaviours. But it adds that the system in which they operate is ultimately responsible for their ability to misuse their power. It said the ""socially corrosive"" effects of land monopoly occurred because of what a landowner ""could"" do rather than what they had actually done. But it said abuse was just as likely to come from public or community land owners as private ones. Community Land Scotland welcomed the commission's recommendations and described monopoly landowner power as ""an affront to a modern, democratic and socially progressive Scotland"". The organisation's policy director Dr Calum MacLeod said it was in ""cruel contrast"" to communities who now manage almost 600,000 acres in the interests of local residents. He said: ""Places like Eigg, Knoydart, Gigha, North and West Harris, first and foremost, pursued a community buyout to stem the tide of depopulation, and by and large they have succeeded. ""But, as things stand, not every community has the opportunity to acquire their local land."" A spokesman for the Scottish government said: ""We welcome the SLC's report and will be working closely with the commission and stakeholders to consider the recommendations in the coming months. ""We expect that the report will inform how we address long-standing issues caused by the concentration of land power in rural Scotland, to the benefit of local communities.""

"Danish MP's baby 'not welcome' in chamberThe speaker asked the MP to remove her child because ""MPs should be in the chamber, not babies or children"".","Mette Abildgaard's Facebook post garnered more than 1,000 comments A Danish MP has spoken out after being told to remove her baby from the parliament's chamber. Mette Abildgaard said it was the first time she had brought her five-month-old daughter to work, as her father could not step in to take care of her. Pia Kjaersgaard, parliament speaker and ex-leader of the right-wing Danish People's Party, reportedly told her she was ""not welcome"" with her baby. Ms Kjaersgaard said clearer guidelines should be given for MPs with children. In a post on Facebook,external, Ms Abildgaard, who is group leader of the Conservative People's Party, said she had witnessed another colleague taking their child to work without any problems so she did not ask permission to do so. She said she had agreed with her secretary that if her baby made ""the slightest noise"", she would not take her into the chamber, but as her daughter was ""in a good mood"" she decided to take her in. 'I thought parental leave would be easy' Ardern and Bhutto: Two different pregnancies in power 'Maternity leave is hard and lonely' Ms Kjaersgaard then passed a message to an assistant, asking the MP to remove her baby. ""MPs should be in the chamber, not babies or children,"" Ms Kjaersgaard later told news agency Ritzau. Her spokesman told Denmark's BT tabloid that she was only following the rules as speaker of Parliament and felt the baby was ""disturbing the meeting"". Denmark is among the most generous providers of parental leave in the world. New mothers are entitled to 18 weeks, with both parents entitled to a further 32 weeks which they can split between them as they please. In her Facebook post, Ms Abildgaard said she had chosen to return to work ""to serve democracy"". ""A chamber that represents mothers, fathers and babies ought to be open to mothers, fathers and babies,"" one Facebook user said in a comment. Jacinda Ardern was the first elected leader to take maternity leave This was not the first time that bringing a baby into the political sphere has made headlines. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern brought her baby along to her debut speechat the UN in New York in September, becoming the first world leader to attend a general assembly meeting with her child. And last year, footage of Canadian minister Karina Gould breastfeeding her son in parliament went viral. Laws in Western Australia are currently being discussed to allow mothers to breastfeed in parliament, but the proposals sparked controversy by not also allowing for bottle-feeding.

Juncker criticised over 'freeports',"Jean-Claude Juncker has come under attack for dismissing concerns that controversial art storage facilities may be enabling money laundering. MEPs have criticised the response of the European Commission president to allegations about ""freeports"" - tax-exempt warehouses for high-value goods close to ports and airports. They include one in Luxembourg which was authorised when Mr Juncker was prime minister of Luxembourg. A spokesman for Mr Juncker said he had ""personally and tirelessly"" pursued an agenda against money laundering and tax evasion. The owner of the Luxembourg Freeport, called Le Freeport, said it makes sure the tenants who rent its space conform to best practice in anti-money laundering controls. But MEPs on a special European Parliament committee on financial crime and tax evasion found freeports could enable money laundering because they circumvent the normal international rules on transparency. ""We came away from our visit to Le Freeport with a lot of apprehension,"" Anamaria Gomes MEP told the BBC. ""This is a way that could be easily used to store goods away from anybody's control, for putting them in the dark when it's more convenient, avoiding tax. ""The controls were extremely perfunctory and we did not see any real attempt to establish who were the real owners of the goods."" Freeports were originally designed as bonded warehouses to exempt goods in transit from import duties or sales taxes such as VAT. But they are now used to store high-value items such as paintings, precious stones, gold and antiquities for indefinite time periods. Ownership of the goods can also legally be traded, transferring large sums without any public disclosure of information about transactions. Paintings, gold and other artefacts can potentially be bought and sold within the freeports without physically leaving the warehouses, enabling their owners to bank large gains without notifying tax authorities. Information on price, buyer and seller is not publicly disclosable. The MEPs heard evidence that freeports were ""being used for shady, illegal transactions"" in a ""system that can be used for illicit economic activity all the time"". ""The high level of monetary transactions, the unfamiliarity of enforcement agencies with values and the portable nature of art itself all contribute to making the art market a suitable vehicle for illegal activity,"" the committee's report found. Modigliani's Seated Man with a Cane was found at Geneva Freeport The BBC's seen a letter from a member of the committee, German MEP Wolf Klinz, who wrote to the European Commission president in January warning of possible fraudulent activities at Le Freeport, Luxembourg. In a response cited by Mr Klinz, the Commission praised the advantages of freeports, as ""useful to simplify commercial operations"", adding there was ""no evidence showing that free zones in the EU are systematically used to commit fraud"". Mr Klinz criticised that response: ""Even if they are not used systematically to do fraud they may occasionally do that. It is not satisfactory at all: I don't think he has taken seriously what we contacted him to tell him,"" Mr Klinz told the BBC. Concern about the lack of transparency at freeports was underlined in 2016, when Swiss investigators raided Geneva Freeport and confiscated a valuable painting, Seated Man with a Cane by the Italian artist Amedeo Modigliani, whose ownership was under dispute. Le Freeport was built in 2013, when Jean-Claude Juncker was prime minister of Luxembourg. Located near the duchy's Findel airport, its majority shareholder is Yves Bouvier. In a matter unrelated to Le Freeport, Mr Bouvier, who is also a prominent art dealer, is currently under investigation by the Swiss authorities on suspicion of tax evasion. He has strongly denied any wrongdoing. He said the shipping companies who rent space at Le Freeport are required to know the beneficial owners of their goods and to conduct anti-money laundering checks. ""The Luxembourg freeport is the most controlled and transparent bonded warehouse in Europe, with 100% of the goods entering and exiting being checked and controlled by the customs and mandatory identification of all beneficiary owners. It is high time European politicians took actions to reinforce controls in the 16,000 other bonded warehouses in the EU, where little if no custom checks are taking place and no information about beneficiary owners,"" Mr Bouvier told the BBC. MEPs who visited Le Freeport described it as ""a black hole"". ""What motivation do they have for putting these works of art in a bunker?"" said one MEP, Evelyn Regner, after the visit. In a statement to the MEPs committee, Le Freeport said Luxembourg customs had three agents at its site, who were able to operate independently. It added it was subject to the same regulations as financial services companies. Speaking generally about freeports, a spokesman for Mr Juncker acknowledged they ""can potentially pose risks of money laundering and tax evasion."" But it said the Commission was addressing that with a review of freezones across the EU. ""Since this Commission took office, we have made unprecedented strides to boost tax transparency and to close loopholes leading to large-scale tax avoidance at EU level. Steps that would have been unthinkable just a few short years ago without the political will and drive of President Juncker himself."" Are free ports the future?

Plans for NI weight-loss surgery unit,"In 2017/18 almost two-thirds of adults in Northern Ireland were overweight or obese The Department of Health is considering setting up Northern Ireland's first dedicated weight-loss surgery unit. An assessment will be carried out into whether or not the unit should be created in Enniskillen. Weight-loss surgery is sometimes used to tackle health conditions in very obese adults and, until now, it has not been provided within NI's health service. In 2017/18, almost two-thirds of adults in NI were overweight or obese. How bariatric surgery works Five surprising things that affect weight The Department of Health (DoH) said the total estimated direct and indirect costs of people being obese and overweight in Northern Ireland rose to Â£457m in 2015/16 - up from Â£268m in 2009/10. In 2017/18, 64% of adults in Northern Ireland were either overweight or obese, along with 26% of children. It said that while managing obesity through a healthy diet and exercise remained the best approach, there was growing evidence that in some cases weight-loss surgery - also known as bariatric surgery - could be used as an effective treatment. There are several types of weight-loss surgery It highlighted its use on adults who have been diagnosed with other health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, and are considered clinically appropriate for treatment. There are several types of weight-loss surgery, including a gastric band, gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy. A DoH planning group will assess population need for such a service, develop a bariatric service specification and examine the capability of the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, to deliver the service. Consultant surgeon Mark Taylor, who is one of those heading the group, said that for ""far too long"" the bariatric surgical service had not been provided within Northern Ireland's health service. ""That is for those patients who have morbid obesity, very, very, high BMI (Body Mass Index) with associated complications such as diabetes type 2, so this is a really welcome piece of news,"" he said. ""The surgery has been available on a limited aspect privately, but has not been available to this point on the National Health Service."" Mr Taylor said he was ""confident"" the service would be ""up and running"" by the start of 2020. He said that while it was proposed that the surgery would take place in Enniskillen, there were plans for several centres to assess patients before and after it was carried out. DoH permanent secretary Richard Pengelly said the announcement was a ""clear signal of intent"". ""Obesity is one of the most important public health issues facing Northern Ireland today,"" he said. ""Being obese can reduce life expectancy by up to nine years and increase the risk of a range of health complications including heart disease and stroke, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, mental health issues such as depression and complications in pregnancy.""
