'The state is the enemy',"Paris suburbs have seen violent protests after Theo's alleged sexual assault In the Paris suburbs, youth sits idle. Young men chat and smoke. Some deal drugs. Most days are spent like this. But today the talk is still aboutthe alleged sexual assault on one of their friends, 22-year-old Theo, a young black man, who was brutalised by police. A truncheon, they say, was rammed into his backside, leaving him hospitalised for two weeks. Eleanor says she was in disbelief when she heard the details of what had happened to her brother I meet his sister Eleanor, behind the graffiti-covered building where the assault is said to have taken place. ""They pulled him around the side to make sure the cameras couldn't see it,"" she says. ""Everyone here knows where the CCTV cameras are, and he tried to get to a place where they could see him. But the police - there were four of them - they pulled him back. ""I was afraid. I was afraid to see how he is and what they had done."" Eleanor says she was in disbelief when she heard the details of what had happened. Her elder brother told her it was rape. ""'Rape?' I said. 'What are you talking about?' ""I started to cry because I was so shocked. But after that I knew I had to be strong."" Frenchman describes brutal 'police rape' Who would be a French cop? The bright side of France's migrant suburbs Attacks by police, residents here say, are pretty common. But this provoked real anger. Protests erupted across the French capital - cars were burned and property destroyed. Theo (left) was last week visited in hospital by French President Francois Hollande Mejdi is 27 and was born on the estate. He rides up and down on his BMX, but is keen to stop and talk. ""If there is no charge for rape,"" he warns, ""people here will go mad."" ""Nothing changes here. I was here in 2005 during the massive protests - they came back and tried to clean the place up. But you don't change anything with a coat of paint. Work, hope. We have none of that."" He - like many here - is bright and well informed. He knows what the problems are - but is despondent that no-one seems to want to solve them. An air of boredom and hopelessness hangs over this place. For the young men here, the state is the enemy. Police cars drive up and down the roads, through column after column of social housing. Groups of young men shout ""rapists"" as they go by. Franco says banlieue youths ""have to fight"" for justice Local activist Franco, from the anti-negrophobia league, says the anger is justified. ""The expression of their anger is the consequence of this first violence against Theo. This violence is a system, and this keeps us in a place where we cannot progress. ""When there is no justice, we have to fight to have it."" Theo's ordeal is part of a bigger cycle of violence that keeps on spinning. Youth vs police; black vs white; haves vs have nots. And communities left behind. Fabien is also from the anti-negrophobia group. ""What the police are trying to do right now is not protecting us,"" he says. ""They want us to just shut up. They don't want us to express in any shape or form. They are just here to shut us down. ""We have to come and ask for justice. We have to acknowledge that this injustice is particular to a certain type of people. Coloured, minority, black, Arab - whatever you want. We are the most exposed to the systemic racism of the French state."" Theo himself appealed for calm from his hospital bed. His sister is also keen to stress her commitment to peace. ""We speak because we trust in justice,"" she says. But she knows what's in store if that justice isn't seen to be done. ""If not, there will be more anger, for sure,"" Eleanor says.

Human computers,"The Oscar-nominated film Hidden Figures tells the story of African-American women whose maths skills helped put a US astronaut into orbit in the 1960s. But the history of black women working for Nasa goes back much further - and they were still struggling to get the best jobs in the 1970s. In 1943, two years after the US joined World War Two, Miriam Daniel Mann was 36 years old. She had three children, aged six, seven and eight - but she also had a Chemistry degree. Job opportunities for married women were limited then, especially for those with children, and even more so for African-American women. But as men went off to war, there was a skill shortage in vital industries. The president signed an executive order allowing black people to be employed in the defence sector for the first time, and Nasa's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), started looking for black women to work on mathematical calculations. Through her husband, a college professor, Mann heard about the recruiters visiting black college campuses. She registered to take an exam, passed it, and became one of the first black women to work as a ""human computer"" at the NACA aeronautics research facility at Langley in Virginia. These were the days before the machines we now know as computers were available to crunch numbers - and when they were invented, they took their name from the humans who had done the job before them. Miriam Mann's daughter, Miriam Mann Harris,wrote in 2011,external: ""My early memories are of my mother talking about doing math problems all day. Back then all of the math was done with a #2 pencil and the aid of a slide rule... She would relate stories about the 'colored' sign on a table in the back of the cafeteria. She brought the first one home, but there was a replacement the next day. New signs went up on the bathroom door, 'colored girls'."" Mann's granddaughter, Duchess Harris - a professor at Macalester College and co-author of Hidden Human Computers, the Black Women of Nasa - points out that Mann was born in 1907, only half a century after the end of slavery. But there had been a big drive to educate African Americans, most of whom had been illiterate before emancipation, Harris says, so by the 1940s there was a pool of talented black women with maths and science degrees waiting to be employed. Thanks to them - and to white women, who had been employed as computers since the 1930s - male engineers could spend more time theorising and writing equations. ""After the war in most industries the women were sent home again,"" says Bill Barry, Nasa's chief historian.  ""But in the computing business that didn't happen. In fact, Nasa started hiring more women, in large part because of the quantity of work going on."" Often jobs were held open for women to come back to after having a child. ""A skilled computer was an incredibly valuable resource,"" he says. At Langley, in the 1940s and 1950s the women were split into two pools - the East computing unit for white women, and the West computing unit for black women. This segregation had been a requirement of Virginia state law, says Barry. For most of the 50s, a woman called Dorothy Vaughan was the supervisor in charge of West Computing - she is one of the main characters in the film Hidden Figures. When tasks from the engineers came in, she would allocate the work and show her team what they needed to do. ""Dorothy Vaughan would take the equation and break it into sections and tell you how to solve that equation in small parts. Tell you which columns you multiply, which ones you add,"" says Christine Darden, who started working for Nasa in 1967. ""By the time you have followed all her directions across you would have the solution."" By the time Darden joined, the women were no longer in separate pools and had been allocated to specific engineering sections. Christine Darden learned to programme the new IBM computers She had fallen in love with maths as a teenager, but when she told her father she wanted to study it at college, he didn't like the idea. He could not see a career path. ""My father insisted I get a degree in teacher education because during that time black females generally didn't get very many jobs in math,"" says Darden. ""He told me I had to be able to teach so I could get a job."" Darden listened to her father, but as she was determined to follow her passion she took extra maths classes and even carried on studying for a Master's while teaching. One day at college she was handed an application form for Nasa, and a few weeks later she was offered a job in one of their computer offices. While most of the women were still carrying out their tasks using spreadsheets and a calculator, she was among a growing number who learned to programme the new IBM computers. These were capable of doing laborious calculations in a fraction of the time it took a human. When Darden was given an equation to solve, she would work out the different steps required, and then write a program telling the computer each step, by punching holes in a card that would be fed into the machine. ""We had a card punch in our office. I would punch the cards. I would take the cards over to the building that had the computer and they had people who would run the program."" The work that these women did from the 1940s onwards was essential for Nasa's work, but their names didn't appear on research papers. Katherine Johnson calculated the trajectory for Alan Shepard, the first American in space Slowly, however, some of these highly educated and intelligent women started to make their way into more advanced roles. The film Hidden Figures features a woman named Katherine Johnson who helped work out the trajectories to launch the first American into orbit around the planet. Another is Mary Jackson who fought for the right to be an engineer in her own right. Mary Jackson became Nasa's first black female engineer in 1958 But years later, Christine Darden, with her Masters degree, still had to struggle to be treated as an equal to the male engineers. ""When I found out that the engineers were doing very theoretical engineering - sitting at their desk working with equations, I decided that was what I wanted to do,"" she says. Her manager told her it wasn't possible. But in 1972, as funding for the space programme was scaled back, Christine feared she was about to be made redundant. ""That gave me the incentive to go to a higher-level boss and ask why men were assigned to engineering sections to do their own projects - write the paper, give the paper - but the females were assigned to the computer pools to do the calculating as a support role."" It worked - Christine was allocated to an engineering team that was studying planes flying faster than the speed of sound. She studied ways to minimise sonic booms which are caused by planes travelling at such speeds. By the time she retired in 2007, as a Nasa senior executive, she had published more than 50 papers.

Trolling the Pope,"Earlier this month posters criticising the Pope sprang up across Rome, and a spoof news story mocking the pontiff was sent to the city's cardinals. Christopher Lamb asks what it's all about. I was shocked when I saw them. I was sitting just a few rows behind a nun on a tram, when it stopped alongside some posters of a stern-looking Pope Francis. Underneath his glum, almost menacing face, was a list of complaints: he'd removed priests, ignored the concerns of cardinals and ""decapitated"" an ancient Catholic group, the Knights of Malta. This is the opposite of what I have come to expect in Rome. The tram was winding through a part of the city where you're normally greeted by images of a smiling Pope, with arms outstretched or making a thumbs up. Here in Italy the papacy is the closest thing there is to a monarchy, so perhaps it is no surprise that the city authorities ordered the offending text to be pasted over, leaving just the grim-faced image of Francis and a sign reading: ""Illegal bill posting"". At roughly the same time the posters were plastered around the city's walls, cardinals in Rome were opening their email inboxes to find a ""fake"" front page of the Vatican newspaper, L'Osservatore Romano. It had the traditional Latin motto which sits on the paper's masthead beneath a papal coat of arms, and a list of questions sent to the Pope by a group of conservative cardinals, with the answer, in each case, ""Sic et non!"" - ""Yes and no!"" This is the Pope being trolled on his home turf - and what's more, in Latin. While Francis enjoys huge popularity among many ordinary Catholics he's facing resistance to his shake-up of the Vatican and he's infuriating believers from the Church's more traditional wing. The main source of tension has been - yes - sex. Francis wants to give communion to divorcees who have married again; his opponents say this undermines the Church's teaching on marriage, because second unions are adulterous. The questions shown on the spoof front page were all on this subject. At the forefront of the opposition to Pope Francis is an American Cardinal, Raymond Burke, a stickler for the rules who once told John Kerry, when he was a presidential candidate, that he could not receive communion because of his previous support for abortion. Cardinal Burke has dedicated much of his life to studying the church's laws, and he wants to ensure they are enforced. He believes this Pope is tinkering dangerously with Christianity's 2,000-year-old tradition and has even threatened to issue an ""act of correction"" against Francis. This would be a very bold, highly unusual move - it hasn't happened for centuries. The cardinal lives in a large flat just off the grand thoroughfare built by Mussolini that leads into St Peter's Square from the River Tiber. It is here that he runs his operation for promoting what he calls ""doctrinal clarity"". Custom and ceremony are held in high regard. When I visited to interview him I was shown past a cardinal's red hat sitting enclosed in a glass case, as if it was a holy relic, and then into a drawing room with high-backed chairs, where we waited in anticipation for the grand entrance. Sitting alongside me was his press adviser, who greeted the cardinal by kneeling and kissing the gold ring on the ring finger of his hand, the traditional sign of respect given to a prince of the church. By contrast, when I have met Pope Francis - as a member of the Vatican press corps - we shake hands, and I can't help noticing that he looks slightly uncomfortable when people go down on one knee before him. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 BST and Saturdays at 11:30 BST The word in Rome is that the posters were the work of a right-wing group that dislikes the Pope's appeals for Europe to be more welcoming of immigrants. Once again, Cardinal Burke appears to be on the other side of the argument - he recently met the leader of the anti-immigration Northern League - but there is no evidence that he lies behind the posters, or the spoof news story. There are many conservative Catholics who are uncomfortable with some of Pope Francis's changes. The Pope's decision to live in a Vatican guest house, carry his own brief case and be driven around in a Ford Focus has burst the balloon of papal pomp. Some regard this freewheeling approach as ""un-papal"", and resent his description of those on the traditional wing of the church as ""rigid"". So far the Pope has shrugged off the criticisms. ""I'm not on tranquillisers,"" he joked recently. His way of dealing with the stress, he explained, is to jot down problems and place the notes under a figure of a sleeping St Joseph. St Joseph, the carpenter, is the figure Catholics turn to when facing practical difficulties. ""Now he is sleeping on a mattress of letters!"" Francis added. The trouble is that the Pope's job is to be the rock of church unity. Alarm bells start ringing when a papacy becomes divisive. While Francis has been hugely successful in reaching out to lost sheep, he runs the risk of alienating those already in the fold. The Pope has admitted that ""cracks"" are appearing between bishops and priests - rifts that if left untreated could develop into bigger problems. There may well be more papal trolling ahead.

'Paralysed by grief',"Facebook's new bereavement leave policy was announced by Sheryl Sandberg Facebook last week doubled its bereavement leave allowance for its staff. Employees can now take up to 20 days off with pay to mourn the death of an immediate family member. The new policy was announced by Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, who has spoken publicly about mourning her husband, Dave Goldberg, who died in 2015. ""We need public policies that make it easier for people to care for their children and aging parents and for families to mourn and heal after loss,"" Ms Sandbergposted on Facebook,external. She added that companies that stand by the people who work for them do the right thing and ""improve their bottom line by increasing the loyalty and performance of their workforce"". The move has sparked huge debate on social media and has been lauded as extremely generous. Is it enough? We asked the views of four people dealing with grief in the workplace. Chad Andrews' son Connor died suddenly of myocarditis in June 2014 Chad Andrews and his family returned home from an Alaskan cruise three years ago when his eight-year-old son, Connor, was rushed to hospital a few days later. Connor had mild flu symptoms that suddenly worsened. He was placed in intensive care but deteriorated rapidly. In June 2014, he died of myocarditis - an inflammation of the heart stemming from a virus. Mr Andrews told the BBC that his life became a blur. He had lost an ""exceptional, brilliant and beautiful"" son and was left in shock. But he forced himself to return to work a fortnight later even though he admits he wasn't very productive. ""When you're paralysed by grief and it's all your mind can absorb, the last thing you care about is work,"" he says. ""I had no capacity to be in control or function in the everyday world."" Mr Andrews works at IBM where he builds technology platforms for video content. Officially, the company gives staff three days of bereavement leave but he says there was never any pressure for him to return. After many stops and starts, it took him seven weeks to resume work full-time. While he believes there is no magic formula, he says Facebook's 20 days bereavement leave ""seems like a good best effort to set an effective benchmark"". But he adds that it depends on when the individual can function again. Chad Andrews and his family on holiday in Alaska. His son Connor (right) died a week later Chan Lay Lin has been a social worker and family therapist for more than 20 years. She is a principal medical social worker at Singapore's Institute of Mental Health and says most organisations in Singapore will allow about three days of compassionate leave when a staff member suffers a bereavement. In her experience, this is adequate when the circumstances are not overly traumatic. But she says in exceptional cases experienced by around one in seven people, a longer grieving period may be needed, with the approval of a doctor or therapist. The factors considered, she says, include the relationship with the deceased, the level of attachment and dependency and the nature of the death. Sudden and unexpected deaths are all the more traumatic. Ms Chan says in severe cases some people may never feel like they get back to normal and can fall into depression, making them unable to go back to work for a long time. For those people the grief may never end, even if it gets easier to bear. But she stresses these are very rare and extreme cases. Peter Wilson believes 20 days bereavement leave would be ""excessive"" if it became law Peter Wilson has been a boss working in human resources for 33 years, and is the chairman of the Australian Human Resources Institute. According to him, the standard for bereavement leave in democratic, Western cultures is between two and five days. When his own parents died he used compassionate leave to take one day off for the funeral and another to grieve with his family. He took an extra week of annual leave in each instance, which he describes as a ""fair balance"". Mr Wilson believes Facebook's bereavement leave policy is unusual and doubts it will be adopted widely. Twenty days amounts to nearly 10% of the working year, which he says would be ""excessive"" if it became law. His concern is that it would put pressure on employers to increase other categories of leave too. ""This could have a knock-on effect which could make companies uncompetitive,"" he says. He favours a ""sensible, minimum standard which the government prescribes and the discretion to give more leave on a case-by-case basis"". Ten years ago, he granted three months' paid leave to an indigenous employee on cultural grounds. Mr Wilson says most employers will extend leave provisions where there's a good case for it. A company's compassionate leave policy can give an insight into its ethics, says headhunter Dan Clements Dan Clements is the managing director of the technology executive recruitment firm, Identify, and says most people probably do not factor in bereavement leave when they are deciding whether to join a company. However, he believes a firm's compassionate leave policy could give potential employees insight into its culture and ethics. Firms that take a mature and humane approach stand to attract great talent because employees want to be treated fairly and with kindness, he says. Mr Clements surveyed the compassionate leave policies of 10 multinational companies. They all offered between three and 10 days, with five days being the most common. One firm went further, giving its managers discretion to grant staff more days off for a bereavement. But he says companies can do more by offering flexible working arrangements such as remote or part-time working, as well as job sharing to help staff in need of more time to grieve.

Progress check,"The first two years of the Trump White House have been eventful, to say the least. But let's ignore the drama and instead focus on the numbers. We're tracking the president's progress on his agenda and how it is received by the American public and the wider world. And there are interesting - and surprising - comparisons with some of his predecessors. Donald Trump began his term as one of the most unpopular presidents in the modern era and he remains so. His approval rating is just 37%, according toGallup,external. Presidents Barack Obama (50%), George W Bush (58%) and Bill Clinton (54%) were all higher at this point. The only president in recent decades to have anything like Mr Trump's low rating at this stage was, perhaps surprisingly, Ronald Reagan, who was also languishing at 37% in 1983. His numbers slowly improved after that and he went on to win a second term as president. One upside for Mr Trump is that he still has the backing of Republican voters - 88% of them approve of his presidency. If that number stays high, it's unlikely he'll face a serious challenge to be the Republican candidate in 2020. President Trump's administration has repeatedly been branded as chaotic and dysfunctional by his critics. There is a long list of senior officials who have either quit, been fired or forced out of the White House - but has the turnover been worse than previous administrations? The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Well, yes, it has.Research,externalby the Brookings Institution found that 65% of his senior-ranking advisers had left their job within the two-year mark. That's considerably more than most of his recent predecessors. Usually, a president's top team sticks together for the first year and then changes a little in the second - but for Mr Trump, the departures have been fairly regular since day one. The lack of stability in the White House has shown when it comes to measuring Mr Trump's success with policy. He has had trouble delivering in areas where he's needed to navigate the corridors of Congress, despite controlling both chambers until Democrats regained the House at the start of January. On healthcare, for example, he failed on his promise to kill off President Obama's Affordable Care Act, which helped more than 20 million previously uninsured Americans get health cover but suffered from rising premiums. His main legislative success was passing a major tax reform bill, which saw corporation tax was reduced from 35% to 21%. However, individual cuts for families failed to help Republicans in the mid-term elections. His other big success was getting two new Supreme Court judges confirmed, including Brett Kavanaugh, who faced allegations of sexual assault during his confirmation process. Meet the Supremes - the judges on the top US court Elsewhere, the president has used executive orders to meet symbolic policy goals like moving of the US embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and the withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate agreement. He has also moved to draw down troop levels overseas, including in Afghanistan and Syria. But overall, independent fact-checking website Politifactsays,externalthat President Trump has delivered on relatively few of his campaign promises, while almost half have been blocked or dropped. In full: Has Trump kept his promises? Building a border wall paid for by Mexico was President Trump's signature issue during the election campaign but it still appears unlikely to happen. Congress has approved $1.7bn in funding for 124 miles of new and replacement barrier since Mr Trump entered the White House, but estimates for building the president's desired wall range from from $12bn to $70bn. In December, after criticism over the lack of progress on the wall from some conservative commentators, President Trump triggered an unprecedented 35-day partial shutdown of the US government. US shutdown: Four reasons why Trump blinked He had hoped to pressure Democrats into making a deal, but he was eventually forced into reopening the government without an agreement. The US economy lost $11bn during the five-week period but about $8bn would be recouped as employees receive back pay,according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office,external. Throughout the shutdown, Mr Trump argued that the wall was needed to stem a ""growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border"", involving ""thousands of illegal immigrants"". However, figures show that illegal border crossings have seen an overall decline since 2000. The dispute over Trump's wall in seven charts President Trump continues to press Congress to change US immigration laws, including ending the visa lottery system and ""chain migration"" that gives priority to relatives of existing legal US residents. The Supreme Court also handed him a victory in June last year, when it upheld his ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries entering the US on grounds of national security. During the campaign, Mr Trump vowed to create 25 million jobs over 10 years and become ""the greatest jobs president... ever"". He used to claim the actual unemployment rate was more than 40%. Now he's America's CEO, he's embracing the same jobless figures he once dismissed as ""phony"". Those figures do show, though, that job creation under Mr Trump during his first two years in office fell slightly when compared to President Obama's final two. However, the basic trajectory of the economy under President Trump remains the same as it was under President Obama - the unemployment rate is historically low and wages are growing at a faster rate in recent months. But there are some concerns for Mr Trump. Global economic growth is down and his decision to start a trade war with China led to retaliatory tariffs on US goods worth hundreds of billions of dollars. The president has been quick to take credit for booming stock markets over the past couple of years, but they have started to wobble in recent weeks. The next presidential election may be more than 18 months away, but the campaign has already kicked off. Encouraged by a good set of mid-term election results, the Democrats are optimistic on retaking the White House. Several candidates have already announced that they are standing for the Democratic nomination, with the two biggest hitters being senators - Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris. Other potentials, like former Vice President Joe Biden, are still mulling a run. But whoever the candidate turns out to be, the early signs are that President Trump is in for another tough battle. Arecent poll,externalfound that seven possible Democrat rivals are all outperforming the president in hypothetical head-to-heads.

Weekend Edition: The week's best reads,"""I was looking at one of the family portraits from 1830 of Eleanora, my grandmother's great-great-grandmother,"" says Peruvian artist and photographer Christian Fuchs. ""I began to think, 'Considering we share the same genes, could I actually look like her?'"" Christian is obsessed with his illustrious ancestors and spends months painstakingly recreating portraits of his forebears, and posing for them himself. The man who dresses up as his ancestors ""When I woke up I could still hear the sounds in the operating room,"" says Canadian Donna Penner. ""They were moving around and doing their things and then all of a sudden I heard him say, 'Scalpel please.' I just froze. I thought, 'What did I just hear?'"" Donna was undergoing abdominal surgery when she woke up just before the surgeon made his first incision. She describes how she survived the excruciating pain of being operated on while awake. Waking up under the surgeon's knife When you're heartbroken, everything reminds you of the person who's no longer there. So do you burn your love letters? Throw away your wedding dress after a divorce? Send back that single mismatched sock? At the Museum of Broken Relationships in Hollywood, everyday stuff is exhibited as art along with each object's story of betrayal or loss. The result is an intriguing collection of heartbreak. You're never alone at the Museum of Broken Relationships ""Mustering all my courage, I challenged my views on arranged marriage and agreed to marry you. This man I hardly knew. It wasn't love at first sight, but your kind eyes and that smile really drew me in,"" writes Hina in a love letter to her husband Kam. To mark Valentine's Day, read four love letters, each telling a unique story - tales of heartbreak, elation, rejection and redemption. Four remarkable love letters ""I didn't want it to be a big thing. I just wanted people to know I was there and to accept it as normal. Just having one teacher as a visible gay person in their lives could make a huge difference,"" says secondary school teacher Daniel Gray. He has always kept his sexuality to himself at work. But to mark LGBT History Month, the 32-year-old from Brighton made the nerve-wracking decision to come out to more than 1,000 students. Teacher Daniel Gray: The day I told students I was gay ""We were taught that we were celestial children, having been born from the prophet Ervil LeBaron. And we believed it. Even though we were treated so poorly we still believed we were celestial children."" Anna LeBaron's father, Ervil, was the leader of a polygamous cult responsible for more than 20 murders. The killings continued even after his death thanks to a hit list he had left behind. Anna speaks for the first time about how she escaped from the cult - and her hope to ""redeem"" the LeBaron name.

Russia 'assassination plot' and Brexit 'limbo',"TheDaily Telegraph carries claims from senior Whitehall sources that Russia plotted,externalto assassinate the prime minister of Montenegro and overthrow its government last year. Montenegro's PM Milo Djukanovic is said to have been the targeted on election day last October It is claimed the plot was designed to sabotage Montenegro's attempts to join Nato and was foiled ""only hours"" before being carried out. The paper says British and American intelligence agencies have gathered evidence of ""high-level Russian complicity"" - but the Kremlin has denied any involvement. Aleaked document seen by the Observer suggests the EU is concerned that millions of EU nationals from other countries living in the UK will be ""stranded in a legal no-man's land"",externalafter Brexit because of weaknesses in Britain's immigration system. The report - drawn up by MEPs - argues the Home Office doesn't have the information or systems in place to select who can stay once Britain leaves. The lead story in theMail on Sunday claims the head of the police force investigating allegations of historical sexual abuse against Sir Edward Heath,externalis convinced the former prime minister was a paedophile. Wiltshire's Chief Constable Mike Veale is said to regard the claims as ""120% genuine"" and plans to publish a report in June. Sir Edward died in 2005, and the Sir Edward Heath Charitable Foundation has previously said it is confident he will be cleared of any wrongdoing. Wiltshire Police declined to comment on the story but said its chief constable had previously stated it was his job to ensure the probe was ""proportionate, measured, legal and necessary"". A head teacher in Oldham has raised fears of anew ""Trojan Horse plot"" to take over her school, according to the Sunday Times.,external She is said to have emailed her local authority in December to report a campaign of intimidation against school staff, and to highlight concerns about the activities of a Muslim former parent governor. Thelead story in the Sunday Express says children as young as five are calling a helpline to be read bedtime stories,externalbecause their parents are too drunk to tuck them in at night. The paper's editorial argues it's a ""national scandal"" that so little has been done to help the estimated two-and-a-half million children who live with an alcoholic parent. It says it is ""even more tragic"" that no local authority appears to have a strategy to deal with the problem. TheSunday Mirror claims a convicted rapist who is alleged to have won a lottery jackpot of Â£2.5m,externalwith a fraudulent ticket carried out a ""dry run"" of the suspected scam. He is said to have shown friends a faked ticket in 2009 - five months before he claimed the prize money. The Mirror says he has refused to comment on the fraud allegations that have been made against him, and police investigated the case but decided to take no action. The Mirror's editorial argues the Gambling Commission probe into the payout was covered up, and calls for this latest evidence to be investigated as part of an inquiry by MPs because, it says, ""a parliamentary report cannot be covered up"". Meanwhile,Justice Minister Liz Truss has told the Sun on Sunday that prisons must stop acting as offender warehouses,externaland rehabilitate inmates instead. She says she is determined to get a grip of the ""epidemic of reoffending"" so will change the law this week to make reforming offenders a ""key aim"" of prison. According to the paper, seven months in the job ""have convinced Ms Truss of the enormity of the task"", after violence in prisons hit a 10-year high under her watch. And Lincoln City's win in the FA Cup yesterday - making them the first non-league side to reach the quarter final stage of the competition for over a century - allows the headline writers to come up with a plethora of puns, using the club's nickname, The Imps.

TheSun on Sunday hails the team as ""Impcredibles"",,externalwhile theMail on Sunday thinks Lincoln have achieved the ""Imp-possible"".,external TheSunday Telegraph says Lincoln's feat will have repercussions ""long beyond this season"",externalas the club's financial future is now secure ""for many years to come"".

Music Matters,"This video can not be played Lea Violinist Gaelynn Lea chose her musical craft over surgery which might have changed her life, but it is a decision she does not regret. She now tours America and Europe with her haunting electro-folk music, but at just 3ft tall she plays her violin like a cello, enhanced by haunting electronic loops. ""When I was in fourth grade I saw an orchestra which came to school and I remember being blown away by the sound,"" she says. ""I actually wanted to play the cello because it's beautiful, but it's obviously really big."" Lea from Duluth, Minnesota, who has Osteogenesis Imperfecta - or Brittle Bone Disease -  settled for the much smaller, musical sister of the cello - the violin - after she scored 100% in a music aptitude test at school. It was a decision which would see her travel the world. ""Because I did so well in the test, my teacher was really determined, and we experimented a lot until we worked out I could play the violin like a cello. ""She could have said 'this isn't going to work' or 'you should have done choir' but she was really encouraging. We made a good team and I'm very grateful that she was so open minded."" The duo developed a technique which involved Lea holding the bow ""like a baseball bat"" with the body of the instrument placed in front of her, like a cello, and attached to her foot so it wouldn't slip when she played. There were a few other workarounds which also had to be developed. ""I can't use my fourth finger because of the angle of my right hand, so I had to re-write a lot of classical music. It makes it a little harder to do some stuff, but I practice a lot,"" she says. Lea turned to Celtic and American folk music when she was 18, after finding her busy schedule precluded her from joining the college orchestra. Gaelynn Lea in the studio before recording her Christmas album The haunting sound which is her trademark was developed when she started experimenting with a loop pedal which enabled her to build and repeat several layers of sound. ""Looping fiddle music is one of my favourite concepts to play and it meant I could start doing solo shows,"" she says. ""I have a set loop that I start with but its never the same twice because I improvise a lot."" The inspiration for her songs and music comes from the people she knows or cares about and is often about the human condition. Lea says people ""never have the same life experiences or outlook"". ""Usually the songs come into my mind with a melody and I'll play my violin to figure it out, but it's all in my head,"" she says. ""Nothing is written down, except the odd chord."" Lea in concert Lea released her debut solo album All the Roads that Lead Us Home in 2015, and last year won NPR Music's Tiny Desk Contest - a name which does not reflect the height of the musicians - with her song Someday We'll Linger in the Sun which defeated more than 6,000 other submissions. ""I didn't expect to win but it's meant playing in a few places including New York which was a dream of mine, but I really want to play Paris. ""The thing that I love about performance is the energy in the room, when you're connected to the audience and that can happen anywhere - the pizza shop, a cafe, busking - I've had some moments where I've connected with the audience and it's like a spiritual experience."" Despite the apparent ease with which she plays Lea has to contend with the continual challenges of Brittle Bone Disease - a genetic defect in the collagen in the bones. A genetic condition present from birth and more commonly known as Brittle Bone Disease Collagen (the protein responsible for bone structure) is missing or of low quality and cannot support the minerals in the bone, making it weak and susceptible to fracture Bones may also be short or bowed In severe cases, people with OI can have between 200 and 300 fractures by the time they reach age 18 Source:Great Ormond Street Hospital,externalÂÂ She has ""only"" broken 16 bones since she was born and is proud to say she hasn't had a fracture in the last five years. One of her arms is twisted which can make things more difficult, but she decided against a potentially life-changing operation for fear it could hamper her music career. Known in America as ""rodding"", the operation would have seen her arm and leg bones threaded onto a metal rod which would act as a splint and keep the bone aligned if it fractured. It could also have improved her mobility. ""I actually chose not to walk and I'm happy,"" she says. ""I could have had operations to put rods in my arms and my legs but there was no guarantee how well they'd work. I'd already started playing the violin so I didn't want to have my arms operated on and have my nerves damaged. ""I use an electric wheelchair so I didn't feel I needed to walk to make my life more fulfilling. And I don't think I'd even be who I am without brittle bones so I don't regret the decision."" A selection of Gaelynn's violin students When Lea is not on the road she works as a violin teacher and has 15 students on her books. ""I teach them the regular way - with the violin up on their shoulder,"" she says. ""I watched some videos so I knew how it should be held and I understood the physics but it was trial and error to begin with."" Her students cover a vast age spectrum, and her main hope for them is that they always remain involved in music. ""Music is such an important part of peoples' lives,"" she says. Throughout her own musical development Lea says she has come across some people who see her disability as an obstacle, but many others have been supportive. ""If you think about it - I just play the violin at a different angle. It's still the same music but some people cant' get over the fact it's not regular. ""I'm sure there'll be other challenges, but it's not impossible. And I don't want to be limited by my disability.""

Taking the lead,"One of the most popular reality TV programmes in the US has cast an African-American lead. People are asking: what took so long? It was no huge surprise that Monday night's announcement of the latest lead in America's most popular reality TV dating show franchise, The Bachelorette, got Twitter excited. But this announcement was, in the words of its producer Mike Fleiss, ""historic"". That's because after 16 years and 33 seasons, the ABC franchise cast 31-year-old lawyer Rachel Lindsay as its first black Bachelorette. There has only been one previous minority lead. In 2013, Juan Pablo Galavis, a Venezuelan-American, was cast as the Bachelor. The reveal of Lindsay resulted in the trending hashtag #BlackBachelorette and a doubling of her Twitter following. Twitter told BBC Trending that the micro-blogging site ""went wild hearing the news"" when it was revealed on the Jimmy Kimmel show, and that within moments there were ""more than 36,000 Twitter mentions of Rachel (@therachlindsay,external)"". The vast majority of the tweets expressed support for Lindsay. The first season of the Bachelor premiered on ABC in 2002. A group of women competed for the affection of one man. The programme involved extravagant dates in exotic locations as contestants were eliminated week-by-week during a ""rose ceremony"" (you guessed it, the unsuccessful contestants donotget a rose). The traditional aspects of a relationship all took place on camera - like hometown dates, and meeting each other's families. Then there were overnight ""Fantasy Suite"" dates for the final three contestants. The cameras were not allowed in the room. That first season witnessed all the tears and tantrums you'd expect as as twenty-odd women simultaneously dated the same man. That first series ended with a proposal (but not, in the end, a marriage). The runner up, Trista Rehn, was named the Bachelorette - and she went on to lead in the following series, with two dozen men competing for her affections. Rehn married her chosen beau Ryan Sutter in 2003, and the two remain together. In all but two seasons, the show has concluded with a marriage proposal. The formula, with male and female leads switching off each series, proved to be gold - the show has consistently been one of America's most popular, averaging more than 7 million viewers per episode, according to market research company Nielsen. Visit theTrending Facebook page,external Lindsay has been the only black female contestant on the franchise to have made it to the top four. That in itself has been a subject spoofed on satire shows like Saturday Night Live. ""Tell me about yourself,"" asks the male lead. ""I'm the Black One,"" replies the woman. ""Let me walk you out."" Saturday Night Live spoof of the Bachelor ""Like horror movies in which loose women and black characters are killed off quickly, the fate of the shows' non-white cast members has become a recognisable trope,"" wrote theLos Angeles Times,external. Fleiss, the show's creator, addressed the issue in a 2011 interview with Entertainment Weekly, claiming that he would like to cast more people of colour on the show, but ""for whatever reason, they don't come forward."" However another reality TV producerShawn Ryan tweeted,externalhis suspicion that the show's producers ""just don't think America will watch black bachelor or root for mixed-race marriage."" In 2012, two would-be black contestantsbrought a lawsuit against the franchise,externalfor under-representing minorities. The suit alleged that ABC deliberately cast fewer people of colour in the pool of contestants - and that the show was nervous that interracial romance may ""create controversy among its audience."" That suit was dismissed, but some tweeters felt that due to her race, the next Bachelorette was set a higher bar in order to qualify in the lead role than other previous contestants. Lindsay, who is a civil ligation lawyer, is the daughter of Sam Lindsay, who was nominated by President Bill Clinton to be a federal judge in Texas. Prior to Monday's announcement about Lindsay,former Bachelorette contestant Wells Adams speculated,externalthat a black Bachelorette might not be a successful move for the show. ""I think the franchise wants to so badly break out of its cookie-cutter, white-person shell, but I don't think that America will embrace it, sadly enough,"" he said. And after the announcement, others online seemed to echo this thought. And the timing of the announcement surprised many. Traditionally, ABC announces the next Bachelorette or Bachelor after the season's final episode. Lindsay is a yet-to-be-eliminated contestant on the current season of the show. Some fans, who call themselves ""Bachelor Nation"", called the reveal a ""premature spoiler"". Former Bachelorette Ali Fedotowsky toldAccess Hollywood,externalthat the announcement had come so soon in order to take the discussion over diversity into account. ""They needed to let people of all different backgrounds and races and cultures that we're mixing it up this season,"" she said. Bachelor Nick Viall shared an Instagram photo of the two of them after the announcement, writing that ""no one is better prepared to show Bachelor Nation, and the world, the beauty of embracing diversity. Good luck Rachel, not that you'll be needing it."" Meanwhile, Lindsay toldPeople magazine,external, ""I'm obviously nervous and excited to take on this opportunity but I don't feel added pressure being the first black Bachelorette, because to me I'm just a black woman trying to find love. Yes, I'm doing on this huge stage, but again my journey of love isn't any different just because my skin colour is.""

New murals,"A large portrait in Belfast city centre by Australian-born artist 'Smug One' Belfast is a city better known for its history than its artwork, but a new generation of artists are claiming its public spaces as their own. For decades the streets of Northern Ireland have been peppered with political murals depicting the region's religious divisions. But a new wave of contemporary mainstream art is emerging in some of Belfast's neglected and more up-and-coming areas. DMC (aka Dermot McConaghy) painted this on Kent St in the city The art in the city's Cathedral Quarter has become so popular local art curator Adam Turkington now runs a tour around the area. ""There's over 100 pieces of street art within a very short walking distance,"" he said. ""I grew up in the Troubles. If you have environments where walls are political then public art becomes accentuated and more important. French artist MTO created this striking work for the city's 'Culture Night' festival ""If you go to Berlin or Bethlehem, there is a real tradition of street art as an active protest against the political position of walls within communities. ""We already had a tradition of murals and writing on walls here, which is more often than not associated with division. So to create a body of work that is a counter narrative to that is really powerful. ""So much of the path to creating a shared cultural identity is creating visuals and architecture that everybody can take ownership of."" A colourful graffiti piece in the city centre by artist 'Verz' Many of the local artists who started as amateurs have now gained commercial contracts as Belfast's businesses aim to decorate their premises with their own commissioned stylised graffiti. Here are profiles of some of the faces behind some of the city's most striking artwork. Dean Kane started doing graffiti when he was young and quit his corporate job to pursue street art full time Dean Kane (under his alias Visual Waste) specialises in pop culture designs, painting portraits of celebrities that have fast became local tourist attractions. He said:""I had a corporate job with a great salary but it bored me and I wasn't passionate about it. ""After I had my first kid I was going to go back to it, but I ended up walking in, writing my resignation on a napkin and heading straight to the job centre to register myself as self-employed. ""I started putting my work on social media and soon I was getting lots of commercial work.  I started a website and then a video blog and it really raised my profile. His portrait of Jon Snow from Game of Thrones has become a must-see for people visiting the series' filming locations ""Belfast is evolving, millennials aren't interested in all the political murals, they want something that means something to them. ""Street art communicates to a much broader age and social media allows its profile to be elevated to a whole new level where everyone has access to seeing it. ""Vandalism is when somebody just sticks their name on a wall but doesn't have any intention of actually saying something with any real meaning."" Eoin McGinn (a.k.a EMIC) has a unique and surreal art style Eoin McGinn from County Tyrone, is a street artist who decided that he had enough of 'normal' jobs after losing two in a month. He said: ""I come from a rural upbringing, but I moved to Manchester and then Belfast to study art. ""I loved all the art that comes with living in the city and it really inspired me to start it myself. ""Eventually a local newspaper did a feature on one of my pieces and it kind of just built from there. ""The political murals still have a place in Belfast because of its history, but my work is nothing like that, what I do is a blend of photo realism and abstraction."" Marian goes by the allias Friz and is inspired by mythology and nature Marian Noone is originally from County Sligo, Ireland. ""I studied animation originally but never went into the industry,"" she said. She moved to Belfast 11 years ago, where she found and fell in love with spray painting: ""I paint, maybe subconsciously, powerful strong looking women."" ""I'm really inspired by nature and by Celtic mythology. It may not be totally accurate, but there's that kind of fantasy element where I take liberties. ""If I had been in any other city it wouldn't have happened as organically as it did in Belfast."" Glen Molloy, 46, next to his mural of the 'The Notorious' Conor McGregor in west Belfast Throughout 2016 mysterious paintings of celebrities began appearing in the docks area of the city. Glen Molloy was eventually revealed as the anonymous man behind the portraits. ""I want to do this every spare minute I get. I want people to see positive images of people they love or respect,"" he said. ""Right now I'm just doing it because I am passionate and I want to brighten up the city. ""Personally I am on benefits, so I want to get to a point where I can do this as a living. ""I could be sitting with Â£15 and I know I should go and spend it on electricity, but I end up spending it on spray cans because I just want to keep doing this.""

'It changed my life',"The Beatles made history when they performed at the Cavern in 1961 It has been shut down, demolished, and rebuilt, but Liverpool's Cavern Club remains an icon of pop history. As it celebrates its 60th year, those who were there in its heyday recall its evolution from subterranean jazz club to international music Mecca. The Cavern was inspired by a Paris jazz club Peter Morris was a friend of the club's first owner, Alan Sytner, who modelled the basement venue on Le Caveau de la Huchette - a jazz place he'd seen in Paris. He recalled how they were drinking at The Grapes pub in Mathew Street when the idea was formed. ""Alan said, 'We should have a place like [Le Caveau]'. He said, 'I'd love to find a place, like a basement or something'. ""We came out of the pub and [one of us] said, 'Hey Alan, what about that place there?' And there was a sign that said 'Basement For Sale, Or Let'. ""The next day we met up again for a pint at lunch time and Alan said, 'Got that place. I've bought it'."" Peter recalled how Alan's vision for the club, which opened on 16 January 1957, involved some questionable manual labour. ""It was actually three rooms, and Alan said, 'What we need is one big room, so these walls will have to come down'. He said, ''I'll get the sledgehammers and a barrel of ale, and we'll all go down one night and knock these walls down'. ""Just thinking about it afterwards, you know, the whole thing could have come down on top of us."" Regulars at the club often did the Cavern Stomp, a jive which involved holding your hands low Colin Hanton was the drummer with John Lennon's skiffle group, The Quarrymen - a precursor to The Beatles. He remembered how the jazz club's owners were less than impressed with their set in 1958. ""John had done a couple of rock and roll numbers and someone passed him a folded piece of paper. So John said over the microphone, 'Oh, we have a request from the audience'. ""He opened it up and it said, 'Do not do any more rock n' roll, signed the management'. Apparently we weren't the only band that got that kind of note. ""But rock and roll was coming, you know? It was like King Canute trying to hold back the waves. ""The more we played rock and roll the more people got up and left and John was quite beside himself. He turned to me and said, 'They're all leaving, I can't believe it'. Gerry Marsden said the club used to be packed By 1960, theclub's new owner Ray McFall- whose bankruptcy forced its temporary closure in 1966 - had abandoned the venue's jazz roots for rock 'n' roll. He would help launch the careers of many Merseybeat bands, including The Beatles, who played their first Cavern gig in 1961. Gerry Marsden, lead singer of Gerry and the Pacemakers, remembered the club as a popular spot which shone a spotlight on then-cloakroom attendant, Cilla Black. ""We would play alternate days with The Beatles. It used to be packed - all the girls would come from the offices and the lads would all come in [at lunchtime]. ""Cilla asked, 'Can I sing?' 'Yep come on, get up. Here she is! Here's our Cilla'. ""And that was it. She just got up and did it and a star was born."" Cilla Black worked in the cloakroom at the club Debbie Greenberg said there was so many people there condensation would run down the walls For Cavern regular Debbie Greenberg, the anticipation started above ground. ""We would queue up in Mathew Street waiting to go in and you could hear the 'throb, throb, throb' of the beat inside. ""There was a small opening to get in and 18 stone steps to go down. And there'd be a guy sitting at a wooden table taking the money as you went in. ""You'd pay your shilling to get in and then you'd be part of the excitement."" People used to queue along Mathew Street to get into the club But it wasn't just the thrill of the music and the bands that made an impression. ""It was a smelly place, because there were no drains, no main drains, just a cesspit under the toilets, and the cleaners used to top it up with disinfectant every day. ""There would be condensation running down the walls, everybody would be perspiring because it was so hot in there, it was like a steam bath. ""But that was what made [it] The Cavern."" Debbie Greenberg saw life at the Cavern from both sides, as a regular and later as the daughter of the owner The Cavern would became an even bigger fixture in her life when her father Alf Geoghegan bought it in the late 1960s. ""Dad came to me and said 'I've got a chance of buying the Cavern, what do you think?' Well, you offer a child a key to a sweet shop it's not going to say no. ""Paul McCartney turned up [once] and said: 'I've got my new girlfriend in the car outside, and I'd like to bring her back and show her where it all began'. ""They came in and she took a photograph of me with Paul."" The Cavern put on countless Liverpool acts, including the Merseybeats Billy Kinsey, lead singer of The Merseybeats, also recalled the cellar's strange aroma - ""horrible smell, very distinctive"". But despite its dungeon-like qualities, he credits the club with shaping the course of his life. ""I knew the minute I saw The Beatles playing on the Cavern - that's what I wanted to be, a professional musician. ""And three days later I left school. I became a professional musician, which I still am. ""It changed my life. It absolutely changed my life."" People packed into the venue even during their lunch breaks The Cavern was pulled down in 1973 and the cellar filled in The club's long and winding road looked set to hit a dead end when in 1973 British Rail obtained a compulsory purchase order to build a new underground railway. The original venue was bulldozed and the cellar filled in, bringing what many thought was an end to the landmark venue. But following John Lennon's murder in 1980, it was rebuilt on the original site and opened four years later. It now mixes its 60s heritage with modern acts. Dave Jones, who has owned the club since 1991, said the venue and the success of The Beatles has helped make Liverpool a global destination. Dave Jones says the new Cavern is a better venue ""We know it's not the original Cavern, we don't pretend that it is, but [it] is where the original Cavern was,"" he said. ""In hindsight you could say that because it led to the demolition, and it led to the rebuilding, we actually ended up with a better venue anyway, on the same site.

House sales 'slump' and NHS staff 'crisis',"Tony Blair's rallying cry to people who want to defy Brexit goes down like a lead balloon in many of Saturday's papers. According tothe Daily Express, ""yesterday's man has no place in modern Britain"".,external Thepaper cites a poll which, it says, demonstrates that more than two-thirds of voters now want the government to press ahead,externalwith implementing Brexit. TheDaily Mail brands the former prime minister ""messianic"".,externalThe paper's leader column accuses Mr Blair of hypocrisy, having ""twice promised a referendum on the EU and reneged both times"". Mr Blair, says the Guardian, is facing a backlash from Labour MPs,externalfor ""fuelling the party's divisions over Brexit"" with his speech. Butin the same paper, John McTernan, who was Mr Blair's political secretary for part of his period in office, says his former boss is offering a ""principled and optimistic argumen,externalt for a better future for Britain"". However, commentator Rafael Behr tells the paper that while Mr Blair has a reasonable argument, he cannot be the ""trusted messenger"" who he says is needed to deliver it. And most of the papers continue to be exercised by the government's forthcoming shake-up of business rates. TheSun has spoken to the owner of the pie shop opposite Arsenal's stadium in north London.,external While his rates are doubling, the paper reports, those of the football club are getting a 2.3% cut. ""This isn't fair,"" says the owner. ""Go tax someone else."" Inthe Daily Mirror, Lord Sugar writes that the rate revaluation will put a lot of small traders out of business.,external He wants the government to scrap business rates for traders with a turnover below a figure yet to be defined, and ""whack the deficit on the giant retailers that dominate the major high streets"". TheDaily Telegraph says it has spoken to three former trade secretaries,external- Lord Tebbit, Sir Vince Cable and Dame Margaret Beckett - who have all voiced concerns about the changes. Underthe headline ""shopkeeper who spoke for Britain"", the Daily Mail carries a letter written by a wine merchant in the Welsh borders to the chief secretary to the Treasury,external, David Gauke, which warns the plans risk turning ""the whole of Britain into a retail wasteland"". Thelead story in the Times warns of a slump in the housing market,,externalwith homeowners in some areas reportedly waiting an average of 10 months to sell their properties. ""Inflated asking prices and economic uncertainty cause the housing market to stall,"" it reports. Parts of southern England, where prices have risen rapidly, and the north-east, where the economy is slow, are worst affected.  The paper says that ""real pain"" will be felt if the slowdown in the number of sales translates into tumbling prices. TheSun features the imminent sale of what it says is one of the cheapest homes in the country.,external The two-bedroom mid-terrace at Trimdon, in County Durham, is going for auction with a guide price of Â£10,000, though it needs some work. The paper says a similar property in London would cost 64 times as much. Elsewhere, thefront page story in the i says there is a looming staff crisis in the NHS in England,external. An investigation by the paper suggests government plans to recruit more GPs are struggling to keep pace with retirement, while figures show nurse recruitment levels have fallen. Donald Trump continues to be a rich source of copy. TheFinancial Times says it is clear that, however ""finely tuned"" Mr Trump's administration may be, it is ""leaking prodigiously"".,external The paper believes it will be hard for the president to ""plug the leaks"" of the sort that cost the job of his short-lived national security adviser, Mike Flynn. However, the FT argues that Mr Trump made himself ""fair game"" on the campaign trail, by celebrating the publication of thousands of Hillary Clinton's hacked emails. Finally,the Daily Mail has details of a study that suggests parents should let children play with their food.,external Researchers at De Montfort University in Leicester found that youngsters who were allowed to touch, handle and even squash their fruit and veg were more inclined to snack on them later.

Trump goes to war with 'un-American' leakers,"Washington is rife with political warfare, as 2016's presidential electoral combat spills over into Donald Trump's presidency and shows no signs of abating. It's a battle of leaks and tweets, background innuendo and rhetorical broadsides. In the middle of the maelstrom are federal law-enforcement and intelligence agencies and operatives that are supposedly above the partisan fray. It hasn't worked out that way. James Comey, director of the FBI, has come under fire from the left and the right During the campaign, Donald Trump loved to tout the latest news about the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server - whether through the agency's public pronouncements or background leaks to media outlets. ""The investigation is the biggest political scandal since Watergate,"" he said at a late October rally in Iowa, ""and it's everybody's hope that justice at last can be delivered."" In one early November television advert, an ominous voice warned that the former secretary of state couldn't lead the US while ""crippled by a criminal investigation,external"". ""She is unfit and unqualified to be president,"" Mr Trump said at a rally in Michigan, ""and her election would mire our government and our country in a constitutional crisis we cannot afford."" Meanwhile, it was Democrats who were crying foul - focusing their scorn on FBI Director James Comey in particular. ""By providing selective information, he's allowed partisans to distort and exaggerate in order to inflict maximum political damage,"" Clinton campaign chair John Podesta said in October, ""and no one can separate what is true from what is not because Comey has not been forthcoming with the facts."" Some in the FBI, on background, said the leaks were a reflection of the anti-Clinton views of many in the bureau. Mrs Clinton, one unnamedFBI agent told The Guardian,external, ""is the antichrist personified to a large swath of FBI personnel"". What a difference an election, an inauguration and four weeks of being president make. Vice-President Mike Pence (left) had publicly insisted Michael Flynn did not discuss sanctions with the Russians This week, Mr Trump has repeatedly lashed out at the FBI and other intelligence agencies for leaks about investigations into his administration's ties to the Russian government. ""The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by 'intelligence' like candy,"" he tweeted on Wednesday. ""Very un-American,external!"" He mentioned the FBI and the National Security Agency by name,compared them to Russia,external(an interesting choice) and said theNew York Times should apologise,externalfor writing stories based on leaks. In his press conference on Thursday Mr Trump again pledged to bring to justice those responsible for the leaks, which he said have led to ""fake news"" stories and could possibly threaten national security. ""Those are criminal leaks,"" Mr Trump said. ""They're put out by people either in agencies - I think you'll see it stopping because now we have our people in."" Mr Trump's comments hint at what others in his White House have called ""sleeper cells,external"" of career government workers - internal saboteurs - whom they view as hostile to the new president. The Flynn controversy may sharpen the focus on Donald Trump's past pro-Russia statements There's little doubt that the Trump administration has been rife with leaks. Stories about Justice Department contact with the White House regarding Michael Flynn's conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak - secretly recorded by US intelligence operatives - helped force the embattled national security advisor's resignation. A New York Times article about ties between members of the Trump team and Russian intelligence agents was based solely on the accounts of anonymous government officials. According toEli Lake of Bloomberg View,external, the recent flood of weaponised leaks points to a disturbing trend. ""Selectively disclosing details of private conversations monitored by the FBI or NSA gives the permanent state the power to destroy reputations from the cloak of anonymity,"" he writes. ""This is what police states do."" Lake's column rose to particular prominence when Mr Trump thanked the author in a Thursday morning tweet and said it was a ""very serious situation,external"". The leaks are just one piece of what has become an ongoing feud between Mr Trump and the intelligence community over concerns of Russian meddling in the US election. Mr Trump and his team view attempts to investigate and document Russian efforts as an under-the-table effort to undermine the legitimacy of his electoral win. In January, before his inauguration, Mr Trump upped the rhetoric by comparing agency leaks to the actions ofNazi Germany,external. This prompted a stinging rebuke from formerCIA head John Brennan.,external ""I found that to be very repugnant, and I will forever stand up for the integrity and patriotism of my officers who have done much over the years to sacrifice for their fellow citizens,"" he told the Wall Street Journal. Reports say Robert Harward (right) turned down the National Security Advisor job due in part to toxic politics In the last days of the presidential campaign, some observers framed the election as a ""deep state,external"" feud between the CIA, which backed Mrs Clinton, and the Trump-friendly FBI. Given Mr Trump's recent animosity towards the FBI, and reports of an ongoing investigation by the bureau into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia, that now seems less likely. The fact that such views could have been widely shared, however, demonstrates just how toxic the partisan views of these government entities have become. If anything, the conflict between the Trump team and the intelligence community seems to have escalated in the days following Mr Flynn's resignation. AWall Street Journal report,externalindicated that members of the intelligence community were withholding details in the president's national security briefings for fear of compromising their information sources. Meanwhile, White House sources told the New York Times of a pending review - and perhaps restructuring - of the intelligence community, led by an outsider,financier Stephen Feinberg,external, who is intensely loyal to the president. In other sections of the executive branch, systemic ""housecleaning"" is already underway. The State Department, which is also viewed by the White House as stocked with political opponents, justannounced widespread layoffs,external. Intelligence agencies may fear what's coming their way - and further leaking is their best way of pushing back against the White House. Mark Felt was revealed as Deep Throat in 2005 While it is easy for critics to paint the ongoing drama as unprecedented, this is far from the first time members of the intelligence community have become entangled with politics. In 1993 President Bill Clinton fired FBI Director William Sessions - the first time the nation's top law enforcement official had been sacked mid-term. Then there's the case of the deputy director of the FBI whose background leaks helped bring down President Richard Nixon during the Watergate scandal. The man was Mark Felt, but for decades he was known by different name - Deep Throat. The leaks in Washington right now are many - and some have proven quite damaging. If history is any guide, however, the real fireworks may still be ahead.

The boy behind Facebook's best chatbot,"Alec Jones aspires to one day work for 'exciting' tech giants It's been nearly a year since Microsoft's Satya Nadellaproclaimed,external""bots are the new apps"". Yet despite the promise of a revolution in how we interact with services and companies online, progress has been utterly miserable - the vast majority of chatbots are gimmicky, pointless or just flat out broken. But this week I was given great cause for optimism, in the form of Alec Jones, a 14-year-old from Victoria, Canada. For the past six months, Alec been working onChristopher Bot,external, a chatbot that helps students keep track of homework they've been given over the course of a week. To set things up, a student shares his or her schedule with Christopher Bot, and from then on it will send a quick message at the end of each lesson asking if any homework had been set. ""Do you have homework for maths?"" it asked 30-year-old me pretending to be a child for the sake of this piece. ""Yes!"" I replied. ""Your teacher needs to chill out on the homework,"" came the auto-response, adding, ""what homework do you have?"" ""Algebra :-("" ""Ok, got it."" The chatbot takes answers in from messages and adds it to a homework schedule Through this interface, I'm able easily insert ""algebra"" - urgh - into a weekly schedule that I can then refer back to at any point to see what I need to get done. Once I complete a piece of homework, I tell Christopher Bot, and it congratulates me, automatically removing the homework from my list of things to do. The best bit? The bot keeps quiet during the holidays. Chatbot promise What makes me so impressed by this is that, of all the experiments I've seen so far, it is the first time a chatbot has genuinely been the best way to tackle a problem. Other chatbots are a lesser experience of something else. The CNN news chatbot, for example, is worse at giving you the news than any of CNNâs other products. And popular weather bot Poncho, while cute and well-branded, has a habit of telling me it's about to rain five minutes after water started falling on my head. But Christopher Bot shows the potential for producing a service that is completely at home within chat - removing the need for students to access some extra tool to keep track of what needs doing, and interacting in a way that (slightly) lessens the unavoidable chore of homework. ""I wanted it to not just sound like a robot,"" Alec told me. ""I wanted it to sound kind of like my friends would. If you get homework, everyone always just shakes their heads and says 'that sucks'."" And it does this within an app his friends are already likely using (though perhaps Snapchat would be a more useful place for it, one day). In short, it's a product those companies banking on chatbots being a winner should seek to emulate. Allo allo It's extremely difficult, for now, to measure the success of chatbots.Ad industry magazine AdAge noted that,external: ""Bot analytics and bot-building software companies all have shortcomings, largely because this technology is in its infancy. ""Few benchmarks exist, especially when trying to compare data across platforms."" So without data, we can't say what's working just yet - though there are some clues to what isn't. Google's AI-powered messaging app Allo,since being launched to much fanfare last year, has failed to make even a minor dent in a messaging app market dominated by Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. Google's artificial-intelligence-enhanced chat app runs on Android and iOS And that's because there's no compelling reason to bother with Allo. None of its features - like asking it for directions - provide enough of a benefit beyond what you'd get from just tapping in your request the ""old fashioned"" way. Users have an incredibly short fuse for chatbots not working exactly as we expect. Most big companies are missing the point, Alec told me. ""There are a lot of chatbots made by these big companies that are supposed to help you interact with their service more and give you more functionality,"" he said. ""But it feels like they just saw this new platform, bots, and thought 'oh that's cool, people are looking at these now, let's build a bot'. ""It feels like they've just made a compromised version of what they're actually trying to build."" Usefulness Earlier this week,Alec's bot was shared on Product Hunt,external, a website Iprofiled recently, where it gained rave reviews and a fair share of feature requests. ""You're solving a problem many students have,"" read one reply. This video can not be played Mark Zuckerberg said bots offered advantages over using dozens of specialised apps ""Fellow 14 year old here,"" began another. ""Great job man! That's sick that youâre my age and made such a cool and useful product. Awesome!"" Like any good developer, Alec has aspirations to build on the what heâs made - he wants to make it work for people in the working world, too. But first he feels Facebook and others must do more to prove the usefuless of chatbots to people. ""I think that the real problem is that not enough people on Facebook who aren't 'techies' don't know what a bot is, and then they don't use it. More people need to know what a bot is,"" he said. When Mark Zuckerberg took to the stage in front of his developers last year, he said he was opening up Messenger so that anybody could make great apps. I bet he didnât think it would be a 14-year-old who would show him how itâs done.

Stephen McDonell: Will killing derail North Korea-China ties?,"The apparent killing of Kim Jong-nam raises tricky questions for China Beijing needs to do more to rein in North Korea: that's the view of US President Donald Trump and his new team. But how much leverage does China really have there and what are the chances of it being used, asks the BBC's Stephen McDonell in Beijing. China and North Korea seem to be heading into yet another tense period in their recently rocky relationship. Once brothers-in-arms fighting against ""imperialist aggression"" during the Korean War, now Beijing accuses Pyongyang publicly of breaching United Nations sanctions in the pursuit of its missile and nuclear weapons programmes. And the apparent assassination of Kim Jong-nam - the half brother of North Korea's brutal leader - is being seen as a fresh point of tension between these official allies. In fact, some view it as direct slap in the face for China. Kim Jong-nam: North Korea's critic in exile Death in a dynasty: What led to the demise of Kim Jong-nam? Will the the latest sanctions on North Korea work? North Korea's missile programme It appears Mr Kim was murdered in Kuala Lumpur airport, on his way back to Macau, by female killers using of some type of poison. Kim Jong-nam died at Kuala Lumpur airport as he prepared to board a flight Kim Jong-nam spent much of the past decade in a type of self-imposed exile inside the former Portuguese colony. There he was seen to have the protection of China. The eldest son of North Korea's late leader Kim Jong-il, he said time and again that he had no interest in becoming involved in his country's politics. What's more, whenever he was cornered by reporters in the Asian casino city, with his shirt unbuttoned to number three and sporting a three-day growth, you could really believe him when he said it. After all, why would he want to? There has been speculation that he operated some sort of North Korean sanction-busting slush fund out of Macau and that this was the reason that Beijing and Pyongyang tolerated his hedonistic life style. But for China there was something else too. He was an ally inside the North Korean elite: somebody who thought the best way forward for his homeland was a Chinese-style opening up. For years, China has been trying to promote this style of thinking with its isolated, impoverished neighbour. Before he died, Kim Jong-il was shown around the prosperous Chinese city of Dalian. The message: ""You too could have some of this at home with a bit of opening up!"" But the Kim dynasty has appeared petrified by the prospect of such openness, and that Kim Jong-nam would side with the Chinese. So despite his apparent lack of interest in political power, the fact that he could be seen hanging around down in Macau as a possible leader to be called on by Beijing in the event of regime collapse in Pyongyang made him a threat to the paranoid figure in power there today. If this was a political assassination, then most North Korea observers think the order came right from the top. China joined UN Security Council condemnation of North Korea's latest missile test This will not go down well with the government of Xi Jinping in Beijing. In recent days the two countries' relationship has become even more murky. South Korea's Yonhap news agency has reported that China turned back a $1m (Â£800,000) coal shipment from North Korea. China has long been criticised for turning a blind eye to North Korean coal exports, in violation of UN sanctions, but maybe not this time. In the wake of last weekend's North Korean ballistic missile test, 16,295 tonnes of its coal were denied entry to Wenzhou Port in Zhejiang Province. You see the sequence of events: Sunday 12 February missile test, next morning an ally of China is murdered, later that afternoon Beijing criticises the test, two days later the coal shipment is turned back. What's next? When asked about the death of Kim Jong-nam, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Geng Shuang said his government had ""seen the media reports"" and that that they were ""following the developments"". I'll bet they are. Coal had been one of North Korea's main exports with most going to China At a social function run by the Chinese military recently, I was speaking to a Chinese officer about the US demand that they do more to bring pressure on North Korea. He shrugged his shoulders. He said they didn't know what the North Koreans would do next and that they had no idea what China could do to change their minds. Yet by far and away the vast majority of trade in and out of the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea), as the country prefers to be called, is with China. If you take Chinese trade out of the equation there's not much left. So why would Beijing put up with all this? Why put up with the waves of instability flowing out of Korean peninsula? The answer is US troops. US and South Korean marines recently conducted a joint military exercise It's often said that a meltdown in North Korea could lead to millions of refugees pouring into China but, even if this did happen, it would likely only be a temporary problem. No. The real fear is that a complete collapse of the North Korean regime could lead to Korean unification, with American soldiers based in a country with a land border with China. Beijing will not let that happen and Pyongyang's current ruler, Kim Jong-un, knows it. So no matter how many times North Korea drives its powerful protector to distraction, in the end, Beijing believes it doesn't have much choice but to put up with its weirdness, with its basket-case economy, with its erratic behaviour and probably also with its pursuit of nuclear weapons.

Twenty-eight days later,"Four weeks. Twenty-eight days. It feels like 280 days. I feel 280. If Donald Trump is exhausting even the news-hungry political journalists, I wonder what he is doing to the rest of the world. For the first three weeks I started the day repeating a mantra, ""watch what he does, not what he says."" I've discarded that notion. What Mr Trump says and how he says it is an important part of his presidency. His rhetoric, both in person and Twitter, appeals to his supporters. It's new and fresh and irreverent. But one day it could also be his undoing. He is increasingly losing respect among key Republicans, and he needs them to govern effectively. This video can not be played Trump's busy first month in 90 seconds This is my fourth American administration and we've never seen anything like it for sheer non-stop drama. Lewinsky was a daily feast of slightly prudish titillation, but it was one story line, and in the end it was just sex. 9/11 was far more serious and scary, and the ramifications lasted far beyond that fateful morning. But in a way it was a more conventional (though nonetheless horrifying) story of geopolitics and ideology. We journalists knew how to cover them both. John McCain has been a Republican critic of Trump Sometimes now, I admit, I'm at a loss. There is so much to say and think, and even feel, about the Trump administration that I find myself curiously stuck for words. What's the most important story here? Is the psychodrama of a president who is both fantastically confident and oddly insecure, who publicly lashes out those who offend him and rewards those who please him? Is it the hard right turn he plans for America? Is it Russia, the curious crush Donald Trump seems to have on Vladimir Putin and what that might mean for global security? Is it America's allies, floundering in the face of this unpredictability? Four long long weeks ago, we speculated that this may become a normal presidency, hemmed in by the restrictions of US institutions and the customs of US political tradition. We were wrong, again. Michael Flynn resigned as National Security Advisor Yes, Mr Trump has seen his agenda slowed, either by the structures of government or the realities of diplomacy. On five major national and international issues. he has either rowed back or been checked. In a long overdue phone call with Xi Jinping he gave up toying with the one China policy. In a conversation with a top EU official, members of his administration said Mr Trump would not tear up the Iran nuclear deal even though, in the President's words, it is the worst deal America has ever made. In a statement the White House urged the Israelis to stop building new settlements in the West Bank. A judge in Seattle and an appeals court in San Francisco have halted his immigration ban, at least for now. Repealing Obamacare ""on day one"" did not happen - a recognition that without a replacement the slogan was just that, a slogan. That's how government functions. Even this White House, with its ambition of rapid change, has been forced to bow somewhat to business as normal. Especially on foreign policy, there is actually little difference today between the Obama and Trump policies. This video can not be played Trump voters say US president is 'doing a fabulous job' But in other more profound ways this administration is anything but normal - which is precisely what Mr Trump's voters wanted. For a start, the president himself breaks the rules. He berates allies (Australia, Mexico,) praises despots (notably, and most worryingly, Putin) and he has dropped the filter of ""behaving presidentially."" His Twitter attacks on the press, the intelligence services and individual Senators feel more schoolyard than Oval Office. There is so much personal drama in his early morning tirades that I wake up anxious wondering who is it today and what does it all mean? But his supporters didn't send him to Washington to play nice. All the polls suggest they still really like what they see. This video can not be played Where do Donald Trump supporters get their news from? That his White House acts like some medieval court is not really so unusual. Jockeying for power has been a long tradition of US administrations. But it doesn't usually play out on the front pages of the newspaper. It also doesn't usually lead to the firing of one senior official within the first month and his potential replacement turning down the job because he fears being tainted by the dysfunction. Whatever the president may say, that is not normal and it is not a well-oiled machine. Candidate Trump met with Mexican president Pena Nieto during the campaign Then there's the issue of what to believe. We've never seen an administration where one official says one thing publicly and the president says another. On the two state solution, the firing of General Flynn and Russian interference in the election, this week alone saw a string of public contradictions. It is hard to see how this is sustainable. A lot is not getting done because of the administration chaos. There is still no tax reform bill, no Obamacare replacement, no infrastructure spending plan - all things he planned to do immediately. It is also hard to see how it ends. President Trump appears to like the chaos theory of government and it fits his narrative of change. Four weeks in, his approval ratings are not great but they're not disastrous. The most reliable national poll, by one of the few truly non-partisan organisations left in America, Pew Research, has him at 39%. That's lower than his predecessors at this stage but it's not through the floor. In twenty years in Washington, I've never heard so much talk of the possibility of a President not finishing his term, even in the late 90s at the height of Clinton's Lewinsky scandal. But for that to happen there are only two options, Mr Trump would have to resign or be impeached. For the moment neither of those look at all likely.

Unilever: Profile of a consumer giant,"Unilever is behind some of Britain's best-known brands UK-based household goods maker Unilever has rejected a takeover bid of about $143bn (Â£115bn), one of the biggest in corporate history, from US giant Kraft Heinz. Unilever's leading brands include Marmite, PG Tips, Pot Noodle, St Ives, Vaseline, Lipton, Knorr, Ben & Jerry's, Brut, Magnum and Persil. The deal - if it was to eventually succeed - would be the biggest acquisition of a British company on record, based on offer value. Steve Clayton, fund manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, said such a deal would create enormous cost savings. ""Putting portfolios of brands together can create huge synergies across marketing, manufacturing and distribution, even before you think about cutting the combined HQ back to size,"" he said. ""Kraft Heinz are attempting a massive push on the fast forward button, for to acquire the sheer scale of brands that Unilever represents through one-off acquisitions could take decades. ""With debt cheap and abundant right now, Kraft have spotted their opportunity."" Globally, it would be the second-biggest deal behind Vodafone Airtouch's takeover of Germany's Mannesmann AG for $172bn (Â£138bn) in 1999. Unilever announced last month that annual pre-tax profit rose to 7.47bn euro (Â£6.3bn) from 7.2bn euro (Â£6.1bn) last year, but revenues dropped 1% to 52.7bn euros (Â£44.7bn), while underlying sales rose by a lower-than-expected 3.7%. Unilever clashed with supermarket Tesco in October over its attempts to raise prices to compensate for the steep drop in the value of the pound.

How Trump 'enemies' remark echoes tyrants,"Trump's remark drew comparisons with dictators Stalin and Mao At a different time, in another country, it was effectively a death sentence. Being branded an ""enemy of the people"" by the likes of Stalin or Mao brought at best suspicion and stigma, at worst hard labour or death. Now the chilling phrase - which is at least as old as Emperor Nero, who was called ""hostis publicus"", enemy of the public, by the Senate in AD 68 - is making something of a comeback. In November, the UK Daily Mail used its entire front page to brand three judges ""enemies of the people"" following a legal ruling on the Brexit process. Then on Friday, President Donald Trump deployed the epithet against mainstream US media outlets that he sees as hostile. ""The FAKE NEWS media (failing New York Times, NBC News, ABC, CBS, CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!"" he wrote on Twitter. More on this story A most extraordinary news conference Full transcript Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake The reaction was swift. ""Every president is irritated by the news media. No other president would have described the media as 'the enemy of the people'"", tweeted David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama. Gabriel Sherman, national affairs editor at New York magazine, called the phrase a ""chilling"" example of ""full-on dictator speak"". Steve Silberman, an award-winning writer and journalist, wondered whether the remark would prompt Trump supporters to shoot at journalists. And that might not be a far-fetched concern. Late last year, a Trump supporter opened fire in a pizza restaurant at the centre of a bizarre conspiracy theory about child abuse. The US president's use of ""enemies of the people"" raises unavoidable echoes of some of history's most murderous dictators. Under Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, out-of-favour artists and politicians were designated enemies and many were sent to hard labour camps or killed. Others were stigmatised and denied access to education and employment. And Chairman Mao, theleader of China who presided over the deaths of millionsof people in a famine brought about by his Great Leap Forward, was also known to use the phrase against anyone who opposed him, with terrible consequences. Mr Trump's remark followed a bizarre and erratic press conference The president was widely criticised for his choice of words. ""Charming that our uneducated President manages to channel the words of Stalin and fails to hear the historical resonance of this phrase,"" tweeted Mitchell Orenstein, a professor of Russian and East European studies at the University of Pennsylvania. Carl Bernstein, a reporter who helped to bring down Richard Nixon with his reporting on the Watergate scandal, tweeted: ""The most dangerous 'enemy of the people' is presidential lying - always. Attacks on press by Donald Trump more treacherous than Nixon's."" Mr Trump is not the first US president to have an antagonistic relationship with the media - Nixon is known to have privately referred to the press as ""the enemy"" - but his latest broadside, with all its attendant historical echoes, is unprecedented.

Ecuador polls: Who will succeed Rafael Correa?,"Ecuadoreans will go to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president Ecuadoreans will go to the polls on Sunday to elect a successor to President Rafael Correa after three terms of what he and his administration have dubbed ""21st-Century socialism"". After 10 years in power and three election wins, President Correa will not be running again, so change at the top is inevitable. Rafael Correa will not run again after 10 years in power When he was first elected in 2007, Mr Correa was one of a group of left-wing leaders in power in Latin America, including Argentina's Nestor Kirchner, Bolivia's Evo Morales, Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Cuba's Raul Castro, Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega and Venezuela's Hugo Chavez. Some observers spoke of a ""pink tide"" sweeping across the continent. A decade on, Argentina and Brazil are led by conservative presidents, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro faces a hostile legislative and Evo Morales is on his last term after Bolivians rejected a proposal to change the constitution to allow him to run again. Will Ecuadoreans follow the lead of Argentines and Peruvians and turn their backs on left-wing politics and favour a conservative candidate? Or will they favour the man who served as Mr Correa's vice-president? With Mr Correa not running again, his governing leftist Alianza PAIS (Country Alliance) party threw its weight behind former vice-president Lenin Moreno. Lenin Moreno is the candidate for the left-wing governing Alianza PAIS political party Despite having been a key figure in Mr Correa's cabinet between 2007-2013, Mr Moreno has sought to differentiate himself from the outgoing leader. Challenged when he disagreed with the president about tax policies, Mr Moreno simply stated: ""The President has the right to think differently. Each one decides in his own government."" Observers say the 63-year-old's style is less confrontational than that of Mr Correa and they suspect Mr Moreno may try to jettison some aspects of his predecessor's socialist policies. As vice-president, Mr Moreno, who became paraplegic after being shot in the back in 1998, set out to improve the rights of people with disabilities. Mr Moreno fought to make Ecuador more accessible to those with disabilities Not only did he give motivational talks, he also published books on humour and happiness with titles proclaiming: ""Being Happy is Easy and Fun"". Most recently, he served as UN Special Envoy on Disability and Accessibility. Among his main campaign promises are increasing employment opportunities and ensuring that all Ecuadoreans have the chance to go on to higher education. Most polls suggest Mr Moreno is likely to get a majority of the votes on 19 February, but not the 40% needed to win outright in the first round. His main rival is centre-right businessman and former presidential candidate Guillermo Lasso. Guillermo Lasso The 61-year-old is running for the Creando Oportunidades (Creating Opportunities) party. A banker, Mr Lasso wants to create jobs by promoting foreign investment and has promised to cut taxes for big companies. He also has plans to make Ecuador's central bank independent of the government.  The youngest of 11 children, he says he wants to ""create an Ecuador with opportunities for all"". Hot on his heels in the polls is Christian-Socialist candidate Cynthia Viteri. Cynthia Viteri has been catching up in the polls in recent weeks The 51-year-old lawyer has also pledged to cut taxes to promote job creation. She wants to slash government spending by at least $700m (Â£560m) on existing programmes she calls ""luxuries"". If whoever wins the first round on 19 February does not get 40% or more of the vote, a run-off will be held on 2 April. The eventual winner of the election will be sworn in to a four-year term in May. Economic recovery is likely to be a top priority for Ecuador. The oil-exporting country has suffered from a drop in international oil prices and has seen its GDP contract 1.7% in 2016. Corruption is another major problem with officials from Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht recently revealing that they paid close to $35.5m in bribes to Ecuadorean officials in exchange for contracts. Brazilian construction company paid over 35 million dollars in bribes to Ecuadorean officials Officials of Mr Correa's government, including his former energy minister Carlos Pareja, are also under investigation over the granting of contracts by state-owned oil company Petroecuador. In foreign policy, the new president will have to deal with US President Donald Trump and his potentially more protectionist economic policies. He or she will also have to adapt to a shift of alliances in the region, following the departure from power of left-wing governments in Argentina, Brazil and Peru over the last two years. President Rafael Correa formed alliances with other left-wing Latin American leaders such as Hugo Chavez of Venezuela (right) Rafael Correa was elected in 2007 on a promise of bringing radical social and political reforms to Ecuador. During his tenure, Mr Correa increased government spending on social programmes and looked to diversify Ecuador's trade and political relationships. He forged close ties with the left-wing regional group Alba, which includes Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela among others. China became Ecuador's main creditor after Quito's ties with the US cooled He also moved Ecuador much closer economically to China, which is now one of the country's major creditors and trade partners. Mr Correa has been credited with reducing poverty until 2014, when the oil price slump hit government revenue and its ability to finance poverty reduction programmes. But recent corruption scandals and Mr Correa's frequent clashes with the media have produced some disillusionment. One poll suggests 70% of Ecuadoreans want ""important changes"" to be made. Voting is mandatory and more than 12 million people are entitled to vote for the president, the vice-president and also 137 seats in the legislature.

Second date for tennis star's Twitter fan,"The student seems to have charmed Ms Bouchard, who declared their evening ""awesome!"" When Canadian tennis star Eugenie Bouchard agreed to a date with a student after losing a Twitter wager, it had the hallmarks of a one-off event. But in love, as in tennis, there is always room for surprises. Talking about her evening with 20-year-old John Goehrke, Ms Bouchard called him a ""gentleman"" and declared it ""awesome!"" Asked by a reporter if there would be a second date, she answered: ""For sure!"" The saga behindthe original datehas charmed millions as it played out online, starting amid the drama of the US Super Bowl. While the Atlanta Falcons were 21-0 ahead, Ms Bouchard predicted their victory on Twitter. But when New England Patriots fan Mr Goehrke bet her a date that his team would triumph, she gamely accepted. The Patriots duly mounted a nail-biting comeback in the game's dying minutes. Ms Bouchard, 22, clearly a woman of her word, met the University of Missouri student in New York on Wednesday to watch a basketball game - andtweeted,externala picture with him en route. ""Just met my 'Super Bowl Twitter Date' John. On our way to the @BrooklynNets game!"" she wrote. Eugenie Bouchard tweeted a selfie with John Goehrke after he won their bet - and a date The Montreal native had secured prime courtside seats for the encounter, where the Brooklyn Nets took on the Milwaukee Bucks. Ms Bouchard is a one-time Wimbledon finalist who is currently 44th in the world tennis rankings. The signs were good when sheshared a photo,externalof Mr Goehrke kissing her cheek at the evening's end. And when US news site TMZasked how the date had panned out,external, she answered: ""He picked me up at my hotel, like a gentleman, and we came over here. He got me a nice little gift. We enjoyed the game courtside, and he's a normal fan!"" Sports writer eats paper after lost bet Viral video makes case for 'US first, India second' Is Zealandia the eighth continent? She admitted feeling ""so lucky"" the total stranger had turned out to be a regular guy. ""The most amazing part is that she agreed to it without knowing who I was,"" her date noted. The Brooklyn Nets lost the basketball 129-125. But the dating game, it seems, was a win for all concerned. The student and the tennis player beamed their way through an NBA basketball game Eugenie Bouchard is not the first famous face to prove a good sport in the romance stakes. In 2011, actress Mila Kunisaccompanied a US serviceman, Sgt Scott Moore, to a Marine Corps Ballin North Carolina after he asked her to be his date via a YouTube video. The same trick worked on Justin Timberlake, whojoined Cpl Kelsey de Santis at a Marine Corps ballin Virginia - and called it ""one of the most moving evenings"" of his life. And singers Rihanna and Taylor Swift both made teenage dreams come true via the MTV show Once Upon a Prom - showing up as glamorous prom dates for two high school boys.

This 14-year-old made the best Facebook chat bot,"Alec Jones aspires to one day work for 'exciting' tech giants It's been nearly a year since Microsoft's Satya Nadellaproclaimed,external""bots are the new apps"". Yet despite the promise of a revolution in how we interact with services and companies online, progress has been utterly miserable - the vast majority of chatbots are gimmicky, pointless or just flat out broken. But this week I was given great cause for optimism, in the form of Alec Jones, a 14-year-old from Victoria, Canada. For the past six months, Alec been working onChristopher Bot,external, a chatbot that helps students keep track of homework they've been given over the course of a week. To set things up, a student shares his or her schedule with Christopher Bot, and from then on it will send a quick message at the end of each lesson asking if any homework had been set. ""Do you have homework for maths?"" it asked 30-year-old me pretending to be a child for the sake of this piece. ""Yes!"" I replied. ""Your teacher needs to chill out on the homework,"" came the auto-response, adding, ""what homework do you have?"" ""Algebra :-("" ""Ok, got it."" The chatbot takes answers in from messages and adds it to a homework schedule Through this interface, I'm able easily insert ""algebra"" - urgh - into a weekly schedule that I can then refer back to at any point to see what I need to get done. Once I complete a piece of homework, I tell Christopher Bot, and it congratulates me, automatically removing the homework from my list of things to do. The best bit? The bot keeps quiet during the holidays. Chatbot promise What makes me so impressed by this is that, of all the experiments I've seen so far, it is the first time a chatbot has genuinely been the best way to tackle a problem. Other chatbots are a lesser experience of something else. The CNN news chatbot, for example, is worse at giving you the news than any of CNNâs other products. And popular weather bot Poncho, while cute and well-branded, has a habit of telling me it's about to rain five minutes after water started falling on my head. But Christopher Bot shows the potential for producing a service that is completely at home within chat - removing the need for students to access some extra tool to keep track of what needs doing, and interacting in a way that (slightly) lessens the unavoidable chore of homework. ""I wanted it to not just sound like a robot,"" Alec told me. ""I wanted it to sound kind of like my friends would. If you get homework, everyone always just shakes their heads and says 'that sucks'."" And it does this within an app his friends are already likely using (though perhaps Snapchat would be a more useful place for it, one day). In short, it's a product those companies banking on chatbots being a winner should seek to emulate. Allo allo It's extremely difficult, for now, to measure the success of chatbots.Ad industry magazine AdAge noted that,external: ""Bot analytics and bot-building software companies all have shortcomings, largely because this technology is in its infancy. ""Few benchmarks exist, especially when trying to compare data across platforms."" So without data, we can't say what's working just yet - though there are some clues to what isn't. Google's AI-powered messaging app Allo,since being launched to much fanfare last year, has failed to make even a minor dent in a messaging app market dominated by Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. Google's artificial-intelligence-enhanced chat app runs on Android and iOS And that's because there's no compelling reason to bother with Allo. None of its features - like asking it for directions - provide enough of a benefit beyond what you'd get from just tapping in your request the ""old fashioned"" way. Users have an incredibly short fuse for chatbots not working exactly as we expect. Most big companies are missing the point, Alec told me. ""There are a lot of chatbots made by these big companies that are supposed to help you interact with their service more and give you more functionality,"" he said. ""But it feels like they just saw this new platform, bots, and thought 'oh that's cool, people are looking at these now, let's build a bot'. ""It feels like they've just made a compromised version of what they're actually trying to build."" Usefulness Earlier this week,Alec's bot was shared on Product Hunt,external, a website Iprofiled recently, where it gained rave reviews and a fair share of feature requests. ""You're solving a problem many students have,"" read one reply. This video can not be played Mark Zuckerberg said bots offered advantages over using dozens of specialised apps ""Fellow 14 year old here,"" began another. ""Great job man! That's sick that youâre my age and made such a cool and useful product. Awesome!"" Like any good developer, Alec has aspirations to build on the what heâs made - he wants to make it work for people in the working world, too. But first he feels Facebook and others must do more to prove the usefuless of chatbots to people. ""I think that the real problem is that not enough people on Facebook who aren't 'techies' don't know what a bot is, and then they don't use it. More people need to know what a bot is,"" he said. When Mark Zuckerberg took to the stage in front of his developers last year, he said he was opening up Messenger so that anybody could make great apps. I bet he didnât think it would be a 14-year-old who would show him how itâs done.

Steve Rosenberg: Russian media no longer dazzled by Trump,"28 January: President Trump (left) speaks to Vladimir Putin on the White House phone For several months, the pro-Kremlin media had nothing but praise for Donald Trump. During the US election campaign, Russian state TV bulletins and pro-government newspapers portrayed him as some kind of David taking on the Goliath of a ""corruptâ¦ Russia-hating"" Washington elite. They welcomed his calls for warmer US-Russian relations. They played down some of his more outlandish comments. It was almost as if a US presidential candidate, and subsequently a new US president, had become the golden boy of Russian politics. In January he even received more mentions in the Russian media than President Vladimir Putin. But I detect a change in tone. On Friday, Russia's most popular tabloid, Komsomolskaya Pravda, accused President Trump of making ""contradictory"" statements about Nato. The paper points out: ""(During the election campaign) Trump had called the Alliance obsolete and useless. Less than two months have passed since he moved into the Oval Office and he's already expressed full support for Nato. ""As the saying goes, you need to be drunk to understand the true position of America's president."" Friday's edition of the Russian government paper, Rossiyskaya Gazeta, notes: ""Recently the White House has been making many contradictory and incompatible statements about the foreign policy direction of Trump's team, including issues that affect Russia's interests."" Reporting Thursday's meeting in Bonn between Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and the new US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, the paper emphasises ""it was obvious how tense and, at the same time, confused Tillerson looked"". US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (left) and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met in Bonn on Thursday Meanwhile, Nezavisimaya Gazeta warns against ""excessive Trumpophilia"". And with President Trump under sustained pressure back home over alleged links to Russia, the business daily Vedomosti doubts he will have ""flexibilityâ¦ in talks with Russia. ""Every step he takes, particularly any concessions, will be examined under a microscope. It's even hard to believe now that there ever was a window of opportunity (to improve relations) that made it seem worth raising our glasses and toasting Trump's victory."" In recent days there has been noticeably less Trump on Russian TV. The resignation of the president's national security adviser Michael Flynn on Tuesday may have made headlines around the world. But it was not mentioned in Russian state TV's 45-minute evening news bulletin. That is extraordinary, considering that Russia was central to the story. December 2015: Gen Flynn (left) sits next to President Putin at a dinner in Moscow There are reports that state television has been instructed to scale back its coverage of the US president. The Kremlin has dismissed these as ""rumours"". ""I was told by someone closely connected to one of Russia's main state TV companies that such instructions exist and were issued in the wake of Flynn's departure,"" says Konstantin Eggert, a political commentator for the independent channel TV Rain. ""As far as I know, the idea is not so much to present him in a negative light, but to scale down coverage of the United States in general. Inevitably I think there's going to be a scaling down of positive coverage of Trump, too. The Kremlin's idea is to reduce expectations from this much-anticipated detente between Moscow and Washington."" ""Everything's a muddle in the White House"", says Moskovsky Komsomolets President Putin's spokesman told the BBC reports of Kremlin meddling were ""absolute rubbish"" and ""fake news"". ""TV channels and the Russian media have total independence to decide their own editorial policy,"" Dmitry Peskov told me. I asked him whether he thought it was odd that Russian TV channels appeared to have reduced their coverage of Mr Trump. ""To be honest, we don't study so closely the proportions in which different stories are reported,"" he replied. US sets out cautious approach to Russia Russia: The scandal Trump can't shake Where Trump stands on key issues Last November one Russian official admitted to me having celebrated Mr Trump's victory - with a cigar and bottle of champagne. So why has the champagne gone flat? Judging by the angry reaction of senior Russian politicians, Moscow was disappointed by Michael Flynn's departure. The Trump adviser had championed closer US-Russian ties. Then came White House comments about Crimea, making clear that President Trump expects Russia to return the annexed peninsula to Ukraine. To Russia it seemed a sudden 180-degree turn. During the election campaign Donald Trump had told ABC television: ""The people of Crimea, from what I've heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were."" Crimea, March 2014: pro-Russian troops in unmarked uniforms seized key buildings And on Thursday senior members of the Trump administration sounded less than enthusiastic about the idea of a rapprochement with Moscow. US Defence Secretary James Mattis said Washington was ""not in a position right now to co-operate on the military levelâ¦ Russia's aggressive actions have violated international law and are destabilising."" US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson indicated that America ""will consider working with Russia"". That is hardly a ringing endorsement. Yet Donald Trump has made it clear he still believes a better relationship with Vladimir Putin and Russia is good for America. Could he once again becoming the American darling of the Russian media? That will partly depend on whether the two presidents can strike up a good relationship when they eventually meet. But it depends, too, on how much pressure President Trump will be under by then, over his team's alleged Russian connections.
