UK threatens to withhold UN funding,"This video can not be played Theresa May says UN shortcomings risk undermining confidence in the organisation Theresa May has warned the United Nations that Britain could withhold up to 30% of its Â£90m core funding each year unless the organisation reforms. The PM told delegates at the UN general assembly there was a gap between ""the nobility of its purposes and the effectiveness of its delivery"". In order to secure the full Â£90m, UN agencies will need to show they are efficient and transparent. Mrs May urged the international body to ""win our trust"". And she warned of a ""crisis of faith in multilateralism"" if the UN is no longer able to meet the challenges of the age. Earlier this week,US President Donald Trump also threatened to withdraw fundingfrom the UN unless it reformed. May warns tech firms over terror content The new UN secretary general, Antonio Guterres, has promised reforms to make it ""more agile, transparent and joined-up"". Plans to make up to 30% of the UK's core funding conditional on making good on this pledge were first announced by International Development Secretary Priti Patel, who has also been at the UN Summit in New York. Officials said it meant UN teams would have to co-operate more on the ground instead of setting up separate offices and operating independently of one another. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and International Development Secretary Priti Patel were among those watching the PM's speech They also say the UN should be more transparent in its expenditure and there should be less competition for funds between different agencies. In her general assembly address, Mrs May warned: ""If this system we have created is found no longer to be capable of meeting the challenges of our time, then there will be a crisis of faith in multilateralism and global co-operation that will damage the interests of all our peoples."" The BBC's Nick Bryant, in New York, said the funding would be withdrawn not from the UN as a whole, but from certain agencies that the UK thinks  are underperforming. So some, like Unicef and the World Food Programme are not under threat, but there are others - such as a UN development agency - that the UK does not like, he added. In the rest of her speech, she also highlighted the importance ofthe Paris climate change agreement,which Mr Trump has threatened to pull out of. Minutes later, she held a meeting with the president, who said he expected the US to do ""a lot of trading with the UK"".

Ryanair pilots reject extra work bonus,"A group of Ryanair pilots has rejected a cash bonus to work extra days after the airlinecancelled 2,100 flightsbecause it ""messed up"" crew holidays. In a letter seen by the BBC, pilot representatives from 30 of the company's 80 or so European bases have told bosses that most are not enthused. They want new contracts and better working conditions instead. Ryanair had offered captains a one-off payment of Â£12,000 or 12,000 euros, and first officers Â£6,000 or 6,000 euros. But the letter said: ""The pilot market is changing, and Ryanair will need to change the ways which the pilots and management work together to ensure a stable and common future for everyone"". New contracts, it says, ""should help stop the large number of colleagues who are leaving for ""greener pastures"" Ryanair cancellations: What are my rights? 'Pure frustration and anger at Ryanair' Does Ryanair have a pilot shortage? It also asks to bring in professional negotiators to help broker a deal. They have given the airline until tomorrow to respond. One pilot told me that this is their one chance to improve conditions at work. The letter comes from staff based all over Europe including Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Sweden. The BBC understands that pilots in Dublin have rejected an offer from the company potentially worth Â£10,000. In recent days I've been contacted by almost 20 current and former Ryanair pilots telling me that the company is losingunhappy crews quicker than it can replace them. They all told me that a shortage of pilots is the key reason why so many flights have had to be cancelled in recent days. But it is a claim strenuously denied by the airline's boss Michael O'Leary. It seems that, for the first time, scattered Ryanair pilot reps are joining forces in some numbers - often making contact over social media - because they have spotted a chance to collectively bargain for new, improved contracts. I asked Ryanair what they made of the counter-offer but they haven't got back to me yet. The big question now is, if pilots decide to escalate things, say, a work to rule for example, will Ryanair be able to get through the next few weeks without having to cancel yet more flights? At the weekend Ryanair decided to cancel 40 to 50 flights every day for the next six weeks. Ryanair said earlier that it had sent out emails to 315,000 affected customers on Monday, telling them about flight changes, alternative flights and refunds. It added: ""These cancellations are not a result of pilot shortages.  Ryanair has enough pilots to operate the planned schedule. ""However, a combination of [air traffic control] capacity delays and strikes, weather disruptions and the impact of increased holiday allocations to pilots and cabin crew as the airline moves to allocate annual leave during a nine-month transition period (April to December 2017) to move the airline's holiday year (currently April to March) to a calendar year (Jan to Dec) from 1 January 2018 onwards, has meant that some crew would exceed their maximum permitted hours (under EU regulations) if they were not allocated time off at this time."" This means it does not have enough pilots to crew all its scheduled flights this month and next. Ryanair compensation efforts 'woeful' Does Ryanair have a pilot shortage?

Take Me Out contestant 'took own life',"A Take Me Out contestant who lost his job because he took four days off to film the TV show later hanged himself, an inquest has heard. Charlie Watkins, 22, went on the dating show after saying he was disappointed he had been unlucky in love during his three years at the University of York. The criminology graduate lost his job at York Chocolate Story due to the filming commitments, the inquest heard. North Yorkshire Coroner Rob Turnbull concluded his death was suicide. Mr Watkins' housemate Swabir Abdul Rahmam, 24, told the inquest: ""He really loved his job at the chocolate factory, he was happy. ""But when he went to go film for the Take Me Out TV programme, he lost his job - they terminated his contract."" Mr Watkins' family and friends told the inquest he had self-harmed previously and taken anti-depressant medication in the past. But Mr Rahmam said those days were behind him and at the time ""he was cheerful and happy"". After graduating in June 2016, Mr Watkins, from Colchester in Essex, posted on social media: ""My one regret is not finding that one woman for me to spend the rest of my life with."" He also posted a picture on his Facebook account of the show's application form as he filled it in. He was then called up to join match-making host Paddy McGuinness to shoot scenes in November 2016 - and won a date. Mr Watkins' date was broadcast in April as the pair jetted off to the show's fictional Isle of Fernando's - and he said the date ""went really well"". The inquest heard he had spent the day before his death drinking with his brother in Leeds before enjoying a charity dinner with friends in York. He was found dead the following evening on 13 March after his flatmates broke down his bedroom door. The show was broadcast on 23 April after ITV was granted the go-ahead from his family. McGuinness, 43, tweeted at the time: ""Tonight's Take Me Out is in memory of Charlie. A fantastic lad who I'm sure will be greatly missed by his wonderful friends and family. RIP."" North Yorkshire Coroner Rob Turnbull said he was ""unable to answer questions put in front of him"" as Mr Watkins left no suicide note and his mother had died ""some years ago"". Returning a conclusion of suicide, Mr Turnbull said: ""Charlie was witty, charming and a considerate young man - that is what people thought of him. ""He was a popular young man and it was in a sad set of circumstances his life was to end the way it did.""

Landmark ruling on end-of-life care,"Legal permission will no longer be required to end care for patients in a permanent vegetative state, a judge has ruled. Until now a judge must also consent, even if medics and relatives agree to withdraw nutrition from a patient. But in what been described as a landmark decision, those cases will no longer have to come to court. The Official Solicitor, appointed by the state to act for such patients, is likely to appeal against the ruling. Doctors are able to withdraw treatment from a patient - if relatives consent - under various circumstances without needing court approval. Mr Justice Jackson, who sits in the Court of Protection, made his ruling in a case concerning a 50-year-old woman who suffered from a degenerative illness for 14 years. The patient, known in court as M, had Huntington's disease and was bed-ridden in hospital and fed by a tube. She had shown no sign of awareness for 18 months, the court heard, and Mr Justice Jackson agreed with her family and doctors that withdrawing nutrition from her would be in her best interests. The tube was removed and she died in August. Mr Justice Jackson said in his view the case should not have come to court. ""The decision about what was in M's best interests is one that could lawfully have been taken by her treating doctors, having fully consulted her family and having acted in accordance with the MCA (Mental Capacity Act) and with recognised medical standards,"" the judgement said. So long as relatives agree, and it's in the best interests of a patient in a minimally conscious or vegetative state, doctors can withdraw all sorts of treatment that will result in the end of someone's life. These include, for instance, the withdrawal of life-saving dialysis.  Doctors do not need the permission of a court to be able to do this. However, withdrawing food and water - the most basic requirements for life - has been handled differently, and for many years has needed the approval of a court. It's been treated as an exception, in part, perhaps, because of the emotional and psychological significance of the decision to remove sustenance from a person. This has resulted, some experts believe, in individuals spending longer on life support in a vegetative state than was necessary because hospitals have shied away from going to court due to the expense and bureaucracy involved. Today's ruling makes clear that as things stand, courts need not be involved in these sorts of cases, so long as doctors and families are in agreement, and the removal of food and water are in the best interests of the patient. Mr Justice Jackson said that even in M's case - when family and doctors agreed - legal costs reached Â£30,000. Law firm Irwin Mitchell, which represented M, described Mr Justice Jackson's ruling as a ""landmark"" decision for a ""previously unclear"" law. A spokesman said: ""The family argued that major life and death decisions happen every day in hospital and do not always need to come before the court. NHS doctors supported this argument."" For nearly 25 years, these decisions have been referred to the Court of Protection, even where doctors and families agree. This followed a House of Lords ruling that Tony Bland, who was left in a persistent vegetative state after suffering severe brain damage in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, should be allowed to die. Wednesday's ruling removes this exception and paves the way for a change in the way such cases are handled by hospitals. Sarah Wootton, chief executive of the campaign group Compassion in Dying, said the ruling was ""a helpful step towards a clearer, more person-centred view of end-of-life care"". ""When all parties - family, the hospital and treating doctors - are agreed on what someone would have wanted for their care, it seems absurd to require a costly court process to confirm this."" Research by the BBCestablished last year that there were more than 100 patientsin England and Wales in permanent vegetative or minimally conscious states. One patient had been in this condition for more than 20 years. Has the Charlie Gard case changed everything? How many minimally conscious patients are there?

Cycling law review after death crash,"Kim Briggs died after being injured while crossing Old Street in Shoreditch The government is launching a review into whether a new law is needed to tackle dangerous cycling. It will consider whether an equivalent offence to causing death by dangerous driving is needed for cyclists. It comes after Charlie Alliston, who killed Kim Briggs while riding a fixed-gear bike with no front brakes, was convicted under Victorian law. Mrs Briggs' widower Matthew Briggs welcomed the review, saying the case ""highlighted a huge gap"" in the law. Alliston, 20, was cleared of manslaughter but convicted under the 19th Century offence of ""wanton or furious driving"". On Monday he was sentenced to 18 months in a young offenders' institution. Cyclist detained over pedestrian death After the conviction, Mr Briggs called for the introduction of new laws, including causing death by dangerous cycling. Ministers are now seeking independent legal advice on this, with the review - covering the law in England, Scotland and Wales - due to report in the new year. Announcing the move, the government said there had been a ""series of high-profile incidents"" involving cyclists and that in 2015, two pedestrians had been killed and 96 seriously injured after being hit by a bicycle. This video can not be played Dangerous driving offences should be extended to cyclists, says Labour's Heidi Alexander Transport minister Jesse Norman said: ""It's great that cycling has become so popular in recent years but we need to make sure that our road safety rules keep pace with this change. ""We already have strict laws that ensure that drivers who put people's lives at risk are punished but, given recent cases, it is only right for us to look at whether dangerous cyclists should face the same consequences."" He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the review will consider how the law should be updated ""so there is a proper legal remedy if a pedestrian is seriously injured or killed by a cyclist"" and whether or not there should be a new law. But he added that was ""only part of the problem"" and the inquiry will consider ""much wider elements of cycle safety affecting cyclists and pedestrians, but also the relationships with motorists"". The government said in this second phase of the review - which covers England but will may also impact the situation in Scotland and Wales - signage and public awareness would be among the issues looked at. Some cycling groups point out the number of deaths caused by cyclists remains extremely low compared with the figures for cyclists and pedestrians killed and injured by motorists. The government had been urged to act by Labour MP Heidi Alexander, Mrs Briggs' constituency MP, who said at Prime Minister's Questions that the current law was ""hopelessly outdated and wholly inadequate"". This video can not be played Widower Matthew Briggs: ""Sometimes you have to stand up and do what's right"" Mr Briggs told BBC Breakfast that he welcomed the review and was pleased the government had ""responded so swiftly"". ""It seems to me there is a yawning gap in the legislation that needs to be filled,"" he said. ""What I want is the police and the CPS to have a coherent law to be able to reach for in the future."" But he said the call for a legislation update was ""not in any way anti-cycling"". ""With the increase in the number of cyclists there is of course an increase in the risk that comes with it,"" he said. ""Just because what happened to Kim is rare... it doesn't mean there shouldn't be a remedy in law."" He added: ""If I can get something good to come out of something so tragic, then I'll have done my job."" Paul Tuohy, chief executive of campaign group Cycling UK, said the consultation was an opportunity to keep cyclists and pedestrians safer. ""Cycling UK looks forward to working with the Department for Transport on this consultation to ensure it focuses on evidenced ways that keep our most vulnerable road users safe, by addressing risks such as dangerous roads, drivers and vehicles,"" he said. ""The proposed review of cycling offences needs to be carried out as part of the government's promised wider review of all road traffic offences and sentencing. ""This will ensure the justice system can deal with mistakes, carelessness, recklessness and deliberately dangerous behaviour by all road users."" The law explained in the Commentaries on the Laws of England, published in 1867 Alliston was charged with an admittedly archaic offence - but it is the closest to dangerous driving a cyclist can be charged with. Unlike a dangerous cycling charge, causing grievous bodily harm by wanton and furious driving takes into account injury. It may sound slightly eccentric, but perhaps it is down to its wording which was coined in 1861. Introduced under the Offences Against the Person Act, the charge was created to deter people from driving horse carriages recklessly. It is now used when it is not possible to prosecute under the Road Traffic Act 1988 - ie, when the vehicle in the crime was not mechanically propelled -  and in cases of serious injury or death caused by a cyclist's actions. It carries a maximum penalty of two years' imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine. Previous successful prosecutions under the offence include those against cyclistsDarryl GittoesandDarren Hall,external, who both knocked down pedestrians who later died.

Whole of Puerto Rico without power,"This video can not be played Where has Hurricane Maria hit? Hurricane Maria has knocked out power across the island of Puerto Rico, home to 3.5m people, officials have said. Flash flood warnings cover the entire island, which continues to be lashed by heavy rain in the storm's wake. Meanwhile more pictures are emerging of widespread destruction on the small island of Dominica, hit on Monday. Maria, now a category three storm, has been lashing the Dominican Republic further west and heading towards the Turks and Caicos Islands. It is the second devastating storm to hit the Caribbean this hurricane season - the first being category five Irma earlier in September. Hurricane Maria damaged buildings in Puerto Rico and left streets covered in debris US President Donald Trump said the storm had ""totally obliterated"" the US territory, and pledged to visit Puerto Rico. The island's Governor Ricardo Rossello described the hurricane as ""the most devastating storm in a century"" and said that Maria had hit the island's electricity grid so badly that it could take months to restore power. In pictures: Maria aftermath on Puerto Rico The storm is being blamed for at least 10 deaths across the Caribbean. In Puerto Rico one man died after being struck by a board he had used to cover his windows. The authorities have warned people to move to higher ground amid ""catastrophic"" flooding, and with up to 30in (76cm) more rain predicted by Saturday. Images shared on social media show roofs being stripped away as winds as strong as 140mph (225km/h) whipped trees and power lines in Puerto Rico's capital city, San Juan. ""God is with us; we are stronger than any hurricane,""Mr Rossello said,external. ""Together we will rise again."" The governor has asked President Donald Trump to declare the island a disaster area after the storm unleashed heavy flooding and life-threatening winds, and damaged infrastructure across the territory. The US president is yet to do so, but has made federal emergency aid available. Hurricane Maria: What to do before, during and after By Will Grant in San Juan, Puerto Rico This video can not be played Hurricane Maria: Puerto Rico faces long road to recovery Not far down the coast from the Puerto Rican capital, the small town of CataÃ±o is trying to pick itself up after Hurricane Maria. The massive storm hit the town with incredible power when it swept over the island, tearing roofs off homes, flooding many houses and even destroying entire buildings. The whole town is now gingerly making its way outside to begin the daunting task of clearing up. Some though, have nowhere to start. I spoke to one resident, Juan Romero as he surveyed what's left of his house: a tangled pile of wooden beams, rubble and twisted metal. ""All I own is the clothes I'm wearing,"" he told me. Nevertheless he was just thankful to have survived. His neighbour then called me over to see her kitchen, its roof ripped clean off. Evelyn had also lost much, all her possessions are soaked and need replacing. However, it was concern for her aged mother that moved her to tears. At 101 years old she is too frail to be made to live elsewhere at this stage in life. Just as I was leaving their street, a small piece of good news: Juan Romero found his two cats that had been missing in the ruins of his home, Blanca and Negra. Drenched and scared, they were at least alive. ""They'd had me worried"", Juan said with obvious relief. The storm has cut a swathe through the Caribbean on its north-westerly trajectory, hitting Dominica on Monday night. At least 15 people are dead and 20 others are missing on Dominica after Hurricane Maria,the Caribbean island's prime minister has said. Homes have been flattened, schools have been destroyed, telecommunications have been cut off and the island's main hospital is still without electricity, he said. PM's Facebook posts detail storm drama The eye of the hurricane passed directly over Dominica On ThursdayCNN posted footage,externalfrom a flight over the island showing scattered debris from homes ripped open and thousands of broken trees. An adviser to Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, Hartley Henry,said on Facebook,external: ""The country is in a daze - no electricity, no running water - as a result of uprooted pipes in most communities and definitely [no] landline or cellphone services on island, and that will be for quite a while."" Images from the capital, Roseau, show some streets knee-deep in debris. Aid agencies have been preparing to go to Dominica to provide relief. This video can not be played Aerial footage from Dominica Hours before reaching Puerto Rico, Maria barrelled through the St Croix in the US Virgin Islands as a category five storm, sustaining winds of up to 175mph (281km/h). The French territory of Guadeloupe suffered flooding on Monday and one person was killed by a falling tree and another died on the seafront. At least two others were missing after their ship sank near Desirade, the easternmost island in the archipelago. Are you in an area affected by Hurricane Maria?

Cathedral defends Hellboy filming,"Wells Cathedral officials allowed filming after reading the Hellboy story Church officials have defended their decision to allow the latest Hellboy movie to be filmed inside Wells Cathedral. The film involves a comic book superhero with a back story including Nazism and the occult. Some worshippers have criticised the decision to allow the 900-year-old building to host the filming. However, officials said the film was a classic story of good versus evil. Stranger Things actor David Harbour has been involved in the filming at the cathedral. The previous Hellboy film was released nearly a decade ago in 2008 The decision has proved controversial. Pamela Eagan who lives opposite the building said she was horrified. ""For heavens's sake. Are we losing sight of what this was built for?"" she said. ""I have to say I am surprised and shocked."" In a statement, cathedral officials said they realised the decision might cause concern, but allowed filming after looking further into the story. They said the superhero's true nature was that of a defender against the forces of darkness, in an eternal battle of good against evil. Cathedral officials did not say how much filmmakers paid for the site to be used.

Raid uncovers 35 men living in house,"The discovery was made on Winchester Avenue, Queensbury, following complaints from neighbours A raid on a three-bedroom house in north west London found 35 men living in rooms full of mattresses. The discovery was made on Winchester Avenue, Queensbury, on Tuesday following noise complaints from neighbours, Brent council said. The men, of Eastern European origin, had piled bedding in every room except bathrooms. The owner of the property is being traced. The council said it was a ""shocking example"" of a rogue landlord ""exploiting people"". In just one room, eight men were found to be sleeping side-by-side on ""wall-to-wall"" mattresses The council's raid on the semi-detached property found dozens of shoes piled on top of each other, clothes strewn across radiators and junk clogging the garden. One mattress was laid out under a canopy in the back garden. Harbi Farah, Brent's cabinet member for housing and welfare reform, said it highlighted the worst excesses of unscrupulous property owners. Brent council said the owner of the property was being traced ""Rogue landlords make their money by exploiting people who can least afford it, it's a shameful practice and this is an especially shocking example"", he said. In just one room, eight men were found to be sleeping side-by-side on ""wall-to-wall"" mattresses.

Groom asks guests to pay for wedding,"Ben Farina and Clare Moran have been together for almost six years and have a three-year-old daughter A couple unable to afford their dream wedding have asked guests to contribute up to Â£150 each to attend, under a ""business model"" devised by the groom. Ben Farina said his wedding to Clare Moran in June will be ""like an all-inclusive holiday"" for those attending. The charge includes a three-night stay at a venue in Derbyshire, which has a pool and spa. The groom, who lives in Rotherham, denied being ""tight"" and insisted the idea had ""gone down well"" with guests. More on this and other stories in the East Midlands Mr Farina said: ""I had it all mapped out before I proposed. ""I knew her reaction would be 'we can't afford to get married' so I started showing her how we could."" He said that if his guests did not support the idea, they would have a simpler and smaller wedding. But all of their 60 adult guests, with 20 children, have confirmed they are attending and paid deposits. The wedding venue, Knockerdown Cottages in Ashbourne, Derbyshire, is charging Â£10,000 There will be 60 adult guests and guests are paying Â£150 each - a total of Â£9,000 Parents will pay Â£50 for each of the 20 children attending - a total of Â£1,000 The groom's mother is paying Â£750 for a hog roast on the day of the wedding. His father is also giving Â£500 The couple are spending about Â£2,000 of their own money, which will cover alcohol, food, the wedding dress, bridesmaids dresses and cheap suits for the groom and best men The couple are buying alcohol from a supermarket for the wedding day itself, and guests can bring along their own alcohol to drink over the weekend Mr Farina's stepfather, who works as a chef, is cooking a Sunday roast for guests the day after the wedding and a family friend has offered to be the wedding singer Ben Farina said the venue is ""like a little holiday resort"" for their guests Mr Farina, who is originally from Leicester, said: ""People always pay a large amount of money to go to a wedding anyway, so why not have it paying towards the actual wedding rather than just to a business owner? ""I sold it to them a bit like an all-inclusive holiday, so all the food and drinks will be incorporated in that cost. ""The venue also has a spa, an indoor swimming pool, a games room, it's very close to local amenities, there's a lake, so it is like a little holiday resort."" Mr Farina said he and his partner paid Â£550 to go to a friend's wedding in Greece and spent Â£1,200 while they were there. He argued that a hotel stay for a wedding would normally cost Â£100 and guests might spend Â£50 at the bar. Miss Moran said her husband-to-be had ""put a lot of thought into it"" Miss Moran said: ""I never thought we would be able to have a wedding like this. ""We had spoken about marriage because we've got a little girl together and I always said we wouldn't be able to afford to do it, or it would have to be a registry office wedding, not a big wedding. ""This is a brilliant way to do it and I can't wait. He has put a lot of thought into it."" 'Fake' couple marry for real 13 years on.

Theresa May's speeches in the spotlight,"Theresa May's former chief of staff, Nick Timothy,writes in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat the Treasury's reluctance even to ""mention the positives"" of leaving the European Union - such as the freeing up of public money after Brexit - risks the UK receiving a bad deal. He says Chancellor Philip Hammond and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson ""must stop their games"" because the stakes for Britain are too high. The European edition of the non-partisanPolitico website asks if Mr Johnson used the claim,externalthat leaving the EU would mean an extra Â£350m a week under UK control as a ""smokescreen"". He re-used the figure in his unauthorised vision for Brexit published last week. The website points out that in his article Mr Johnson admitted the UK ""has a Brexit bill and it will have to be paid"", and it says his aides made clear he accepted the idea of continuing payments to the EU during a transition period - two major concessions lost in the furore over the Â£350m figure. The Daily Express says the prime minister will use a speech,externalin Italy on Friday to appeal directly to European leaders to break the deadlock over Brexit. TheFinancial Times,externalsays Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is in a bind over Brexit as the party is finding it harder to sustain its ""uneasy fudge on Brexit"", having neither embraced it nor sought to block it. But the paper says if Labour abandons its ambiguity it risks opening up its own wide divisions on the issue. Politics.co.uk,externalreports that a former advisor to Tony Blair told an audience in London that he did not think Brexit would happen. Darren Murphy said he believed Labour would end up voting against the EU Withdrawal Bill, and the government did not have the votes to push it through. In the Mexican capital, Mexico City, the El Universal newspaper describes the streets silenced in the wake of the earthquake now full of the noise of hundreds of volunteers looking to help. A commentator for the El Reforma paper, says the tremor has shown that people in Mexico must ""learn to coexist with earthquakes and hurricanes"". That is a sentiment echoed by El Nuevo Dia in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean island ravaged by two hurricanes in two weeks. The paper asks ""how can we prevent the country from collapsing for weeks and months after these events""? It says the island needs to rebuild in ways that mitigate climate change.

Frantic search at quake-hit Mexico school,"This video can not be played Moments after the earthquake hit At least 21 children and five adults died at a primary school which collapsed in Mexico City during Tuesday's quake, the government says. The shallow, 7.1 magnitude quake killed at least 230 people in total and caused major damage across states in the centre of the country. Desperate searches for survivors under the rubble are continuing. Hopes rose at the school when a girl was located alive and a delicate operation to rescue her is under way. Dozens of buildings collapsed across the country, including several churches where worshippers were killed. Families with young children could be seen sleeping outside their homes in the street in the capital. President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto has declared three days of mourning. The tremor struck shortly after many people had taken part in an earthquake drill, exactly 32 years after another quake killed thousands in the capital. Mexico is prone to earthquakes and earlier this month an8.1 magnitude tremorin the south left at least 90 people dead. Though it struck a similar region, Tuesday's earthquake does not appear to be connected with the quake on 7 September, which was at least 30 times more energetic, the BBC's Jonathan Amoswrites. As it happened Mexico quake: Where buildings collapsed Why did only some buildings collapse? The race to help after the quake Enrique RÃ©bsamen primary school, in Mexico City's southern Coapa district, collapsed. Confirming the death toll, Education Minister Aurelio NuÃ±oâ said 11 people had been rescued while two children and an adult were missing. Local media had reported a higher death toll earlier. More than 500 members of the army and navy, along with 200 police officers and volunteers, have been working at the site, Mexican newspaper Milenio says. This video can not be played Rescuers searched for survivors under the rubble at Enrique RÃ©bsamen primary school in Mexico City Details of the girl located on Wednesday have not been given. Rescuers detected her after she moved her hand and a hose was lowered to supply her with water. Civil Protection volunteer Enrique Gardia told the assembled crowd that a thermal scanner had detected several survivors trapped between slabs of concrete. ""They are alive! Alive!"" he shouted. ""Someone hit a wall several times in one place, and in another there was a response to light signals with a lamp,"" he added. One mother, standing nearby waiting for news of her seven-year-old daughter, told reporters: ""No-one can possibly imagine the pain I'm in right now."" At least 209 schools were affected by the quake, 15 of which have suffered severe damage. By Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Mexico City In the heat and humidity of Mexico City, there's also hope. Police officers guard a six-storey office and residential building in the Bohemian La Condesa neighbourhood. The concrete structure has been flattened to a towering mass of bricks and twisted metal. The damage is so severe I had to look at the building next door, which remains intact, to get an idea of its neighbour's pre-quake state. Moments later a team of rescuers in blue overalls and red hats strap head torches on as they prepare to enter the building. More than 50 people have been rescued in this city so far. People here are determined to make sure that it's that figure that climbs, and not the death toll. As is often the case in the wake of a devastating natural disaster, people are also displaying resilience. Hundreds of people are wandering the streets holding handwritten signs which offer water and food to people. A man also holds a sign which says ""no smoking"". The earthquake has led to many gas leaks and that, as well as the fear of further aftershocks, remains a concern here. The epicentre of the latest quake was near Atencingo in Puebla state, about 120km (75 miles) from Mexico City, with a depth of 51km, the US Geological Survey says. The prolonged tremor hit at 13:14 local time (18:14 GMT) on Tuesday and sent thousands of residents into the streets. Most of the victims died in the capital, according to government figures: Mexico City: 100 dead Morelos state: 69 dead Puebla state: 43 dead Mexico state: 13 dead Guerrero: Four dead Oaxaca: One dead Eleven people were killed at this church in Atzala, Puebla state Fifteen people were killed when a church near Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano collapsed during Mass.  The volcano itself had a small eruption as a result of the tremor. In Atzala, Puebla, another church collapsed during a baptism, killing 11 people including the baby, Church officials told Efe news agency. Alfredo del Mazo Maza, governor of the State of Mexico, said schools would be closed on Wednesday. He also ordered all public transport to operate services for free so that people could travel home. In pictures: Huge earthquake Are Mexico's two earthquakes connected? An earthquake drill was being held in Mexico City on Tuesday to mark the 32nd anniversary of a magnitude 8 quake that killed up to 10,000 people and left 30,000 others injured. The severe tremor caused serious damage to Mexico City and its surrounding areas, with more than 400 buildings collapsed and thousands more damaged. This video can not be played The strong quake was felt in the capital, Mexico City Correspondents say that residents may have mistaken earthquake alarms for part of the day of drills in the wake of the 1985 quake. Mexico City is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with more than 20 million people living in the metropolitan area. Mexico is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, sitting where three of the Earth's tectonic plates - the North American, Cocos and Pacific plates - meet. This video can not be played Mexicans were distraught as they surveyed the damage from the quake The latest tremor occurred near the boundary between the North American and Cocos plates, where the latter slides beneath the former. According to theUS Geological Survey,external, the country has seen 19 earthquakes of at least 6.5 magnitude within 155 miles of the epicentre of Tuesday's quake over the past century. Foreign leaders sent messages of support as the scale of the disaster became clear: US President Donald Trump, who has courted controversy with his plans for a border wall with Mexico, tweeted: ""God bless the people of Mexico City. We are with you and will be there for you"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also tweeted his support following the ""devastating news"" Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis, in New York for the UN General Assembly, expressed his ""solidarity"" with the Mexican people Pope Francis said his thoughts and prayers were with the families of those who had lost loved ones in the ""devastating"" quake. ""In this moment of pain I want to express my closeness and my prayer to all of the beloved Mexican population,"" the pontiff said at the Vatican The Mexican government issued the following guidance on what to do if a quake strikes in the country: stay calm find the evacuation route and meeting point stay away from windows and objects that may fall in case of emergency call 911 do not use lifts The UK Foreign Office hassaid,externalthat those travelling to Mexico should follow the advice of the local authorities.

This is up 13 places on 2015 when Princess Charlotte, now the fourth in line to the throne, was born. Her brother Prince George's birth appears to have had a positive effect on the popularity of his name as well. George was the 10th most popular name for boys in 2013, the year he was born, rising to seventh in 2014 and fourth in 2015. In 2016 5,263 boys were named George, making it the third most popular.

"RAF has killed 3,000 IS fighters","RAF Tornados have flown over Iraq since 2014 RAF airstrikes in Syria and Iraq have killed more than 3,000 militants from so-called Islamic State, Ministry of Defence figures suggest. Figures to the end of July show an estimated 2,684 fighters have been killed in Iraq since 2014. Another 410 have died in Syria since 2015, they suggest. The MoD said there was ""no credible evidence"" that it had killed civilians but said: ""That isn't the same as saying we have not or will not do so."" Airwars, a group which monitors civilian casualties from international airstrikes in the region, said it would be ""statistically impossible"" for the RAF to carry out hundreds of attacks without killing civilians. ""Air strikes by all parties remain the primary cause of civilian harm in Iraq and Syria,"" said the group's director, Chris Woods. ""The US, for example, has conceded around one (civilian) death for every 40 of its anti-IS strikes."" US central command controls the bombing campaign against IS. It admitted in June that 484 civilians had died due to coalition airstrikes. A spike in the number of fighters killed came in the summer, when RAF Typhoons and Tornados joined the coalition and Kurdish effortto liberate Mosul. Most IS deaths in Syria resulted fromstrikes in Raqqa, the terrorist group's stronghold. While Mosul has been reclaimed, IS still controls large areas of eastern Syria and pockets of territory in Iraq. Can civilian deaths be avoided in RAF strikes on IS? Assault on IS-held Raqqa in 'final stages' Mapped: the Islamic State Islamic State 'execution' stopped by RAF drone in Syria The figures were obtained by the Press Association under Freedom of Information laws. The killings include those killed by Reaper drones - which are operated from the UK - as well as conventional fighter jets. In April,BBC analysis showed the RAF had dropped at least 216 bombsand missiles in the first 99 days of 2017.

No Brexit bounce for the name Nigel,"Nigel Mansell, Nigel Kennedy and Nigel Farage - the last of a dying breed? Celebrities and sports stars are often credited with influencing parents' choice of baby names - but it seems that politicians rarely have the same effect. He was barely off the television in 2016 - but in the year of his greatest political triumph, it now seems there was no surge in people wanting to name their baby after Nigel Farage. Nigel as a baby name has been teetering on the brink of extinction in England and Wales for several years and has now all but disappeared, according tothe latest Office for National Statistics figures.,external At most there were two Nigels born in 2016 - the ONS doesn't keep the data to tell us whether it was two, one or zero - but we can says for sure that more people in England and Wales named their child Elvis - three - than Nigel last year. It seems unlikely to be anything personal, or to do with Brexit - there was an increase to 39 in the number of Borises, after all - but instead must just be another casualty of the mysterious forces of fashion that dictate baby names in Britain. Olivia replaces Amelia as top girl's name Do we judge people by their name? Fifth of parents 'regret baby's name' Where are all the Kevins, Trevors, Sharons, Doreens or, for that matter, Brians now? Why are names like Oliver, William, Olivia and Emily so popular? Peak Nigel occurred in 1963 - the year before the former UKIP leader was born - when 5,529 babies were given the name. Like Norman (14 babies in 2016), Clive (3), Trevor (6) and other popular baby boy names of the mid-20th Century, it has slipped steadily from use, and may have to wait a decade or two more for its inevitable revival - when it is no longer seen as a middle-aged chap's name. If it's any consolation, its decline was not as steep as that experienced by some 1970s favourites. The first Darren was elected to the House of Commons this year - Labour's Darren Jones. He might well be the last, with just 55 Darrens registered last year. The first Darren in Parliament - and the last? Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.      You can tell a lot about a politician or a public figure from their first name. Some are blessed with neutral-sounding names that can be easily adapted to any circumstance; others are not so lucky. Tony Blair - who has had children named after him in Kosovo and Sierra Leone (we're not sure about Iraq) in honour of his military interventions in those countries - was rarely Anthony, unless he was appearing as a barrister. David ""call me Dave"" Cameron was another prime minister with a classless moniker, unlike his posher-sounding Chancellor Gideon (39 babies in 2016), who changed his name to the ever-popular George (5,236) as a teenager. The current crop of party leaders are blessed with solid but rather unfashionable first names, befitting their age and background. Theresa is on the slide from an already low base - 19 babies shared their name with the prime minister last year, compared with 34 two decade ago - and Jeremy hardly fared better in 2016, with 54 newborn boys sharing the Labour leader's name, compared with 108 in 1996. Corbyn, though, is on the up as a first name - 18 in 2016 compared with less than three in 1996. There were slightly more baby Vinces (14) than Lib Dem MPs. Home Secretary Amber Rudd fares a lot better - there were 1,066 baby Ambers last year. But although Brits have long named their children after film stars and other celebrities - with the new Star Wars film apparently inspiring some choices in 2016 - politicians have rarely been a source of inspiration. Few named their children after Winston Churchill in the 1940s, although the name was popular in the Commonwealth. But one political name has undergone something of a revival in recent years, with 26 children beginning their journey in life last year as Enoch - up from none two decades earlier. It is not known how many - if any - named their offspring after controversial ""rivers of blood"" MP Enoch Powell, however.

Are Mexico's two earthquakes connected?,"Were the earthquakes of 7 September (L) and 19 September (R) connected? Mexico had barely begun to deal with the aftermath of one big quake before another rocked the country. People will naturally ask: are they related? Did one cause the other? Seismologists will spend a good deal of time in the coming months debating this issue, but on the face of it they look to be unconnected. The 7 September, magnitude 8.1 event certainly struck a similar region of the tectonic boundary, but the hypocentre - the point of origin within the Earth - was some 650km (400 miles) from Tuesday's magnitude 7.1. If the second quake were an aftershock you would normally expect a closer proximity, say seismologists - within 100km. That's not a definitive statement and scientists are sure to pore over the data as it comes in.  Perhaps they will eventually identify a way in which stress was transferred within the crust. What is related, for sure, is the driver. Mexico sits above three large tectonic plates. Both the 7 and 19 September events occurred where the Cocos plate, which carries the Pacific Ocean floor, dives under the North American plate, the platform for most of the Mexican landmass. The Cocos plate is converging at a rate of about 75mm (nearly 3 inches) a year, and does a kind of kink as it descends, making a steep downward movement before flattening out, before then dipping again. It is at the second point of descent that Tuesday's quake originated, a few tens of kilometres down. BBC in depth: Earthquakes History of deadly earthquakes Can earthquakes be predicted far in advance? Computer models are now used to estimate the likely casualties of a big earthquake. Within a couple of hours of Tuesday's tremor, these forecasts suggested we could expect something up to 5,000 injured and more than 200 dead. These numbers may well be an underestimate, certainly when you consider the way the death count has been rising in recent hours. So much can depend on what time of day a quake occurs. If it is during daylight hours, as was the case here, one weakly built school can kill a lot of children. The emerging story from the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school is a chilling underscore to that possibility. More than 20 children and two adults died when Enrique Rebsamen school collapsed in Mexico City The earthquake on 7 September was more than 30 times more energetic than the new one, but the magnitude does not tell the whole story. Tuesday's event was closer to more populated areas, and in Mexico City it impacted an urban centre which sits on the types of loose soils that amplify the shaking. Preparedness will have had the effect of limiting casualties. Mexico is one of the most seismically active places on Earth, and it will have learnt from the devastation of 1985 when a magnitude 8 killed up to 10,000 people and left 30,000 others injured. Tuesday was the 32nd anniversary. One outcome from that tragic event was the establishment of an early warning system - Sistema de Alerta SÃ­smica Mexicano (SASMEX). It was the world's first. The system relies on a network of sensors being able to pick up the arrival of a quake's fast-moving seismic waves (the so-called P-waves) ahead of its slower moving ones. It is the later arriving S-waves, as they are known, that produce the destructive shaking. Why scientists can predict where but not when earthquakes will strike The warning, depending on the distance from the origin of the quake, can be on the order of just seconds, but this is still sufficient time to adopt the classic drills, such as ""drop, cover and hold on"" (TÃ­rese, CÃºbrase y AgÃ¡rrese). There are videos online of people doing just this. In other words, the warning even gave people time to start up the camera on their phone. I have seen suggestions that some citizens may have ignored the warning because there was a practice sounding of the alarms and sirens earlier in the day - something that always happens on the anniversary of the 85 quake. But it is also true that many people will have reacted in swift and smart ways simply because their awareness of the dangers had been heightened following 7 September. The 7 September quake brought severe damage to buildings in southern Mexico and Guatemala, and killed at least 65 people History of deadly earthquakes Long-range earthquake prediction - really?

What can tech firms do to fight terror?,"The prime minister wants technology companies to do more to tackle extremist content on the web. They say it's not as straightforward as it might sound. As so-called Islamic State faces defeat in the battlefield of the Middle East, British security officials know the online battle will increasingly take centre-stage. IS has shown its ability to reach out to people online and radicalise, recruit and even instruct them on how to carry out acts of violence.A report from the think tank Policy Exchangesaid the UK was the world's fifth biggest audience for extremist material. The companies say they are acting on this problem. Facebook says it has begun to useartificial intelligence to spot images, videos and text related to terrorismas well as clusters of fake accounts. Meanwhile, Twitter says it suspended 299,649 accounts in the first six months of this year - 75% of these before their first tweet. The companies are now sharing databases of suspicious material, and they have set up the Global Internet Forum to bring together the major players on the issue. They stress that the challenge remains immense when so much material is being uploaded. Theresa May in New York, where she is addressing the UN General Assembly ""It is a computer science challenge when you are dealing with the scale and scope of the internet and the number of different accounts that are at issue,"" says Kent Walker, general counsel at Google, speaking in advance of the UN meeting where he is representing the Global Internet Forum. Google launches UK 'anti-terror fund' Cellan-Jones: Politicians v tech tycoons Theresa May to warn tech firms over terror content But Theresa May wants internet companies to go ""further and faster"", including developing new technology to stop extremist material from appearing on the web in the first place, or taking it down within an hour or two of appearing (the period in which it is more widely disseminated). Much of the talk has been about taking down content, but officials in London say they want the companies to tackle a broader problem - the presence of extremist groups on their platforms. The concern is over the ability of groups such as IS to not just upload propaganda but to use social media to engage directly with people and communicate with them. For instance, someone may find material on a site and then be directed to another channel (perhaps encrypted) where they will find a call to carry out acts of violence and perhaps even instructions on how to do it. Officials believe the companies could do more to deny extremist groups any presence on the platforms by focusing not just on content but also on the actors using the platforms. They believe technology companies could look at the metadata of users to spot potential extremist actors and then either exclude them or quarantine any material they try to upload so it can be reviewed. Such actions, they argue, are similar to the work to keep not just paedophile content but paedophile groups off the web. Companies have been resistant about going down this path. They say they do not want to have the ""signals intelligence"" work of government outsourced to them. They have been sensitive about accusations of spying on their users on behalf of government since theEdward Snowden revelations of 2013revealed the way in which the US National Security Agency (NSA) obtained material from companies including Microsoft, Yahoo and Facebook. British officials argue in turn that technology companies already analyse metadata in order to search for botnets (networks designed to infect computers and deliver spam). They say systems determine that a certain type of account in a certain country, exhibiting a certain pattern of behaviour, is likely to be being used in a botnet and therefore should be either blocked or reviewed. The same type of technology could be used for extremist actors, they maintain. Another problem for technology companies is that they are criticised when their automated tools remove the wrong material. For instance, there have been complaints that videos about the conflict in Syria have been removed from sites that document war crimes or analyse what is going on. There are also fears that tools might eliminate content that relates to legitimate news but features imagery from propaganda videos. ""We have thousands of people on behalf of all the different companies who are working to train and improve the quality of our machine learning,"" says Mr Walker. ""The challenge is that while machine learning is a powerful tool, it is still relatively early in its evolution.  We need the ability to identify the problematic material and remove it while being able to separate the wheat from the chaff. We need feedback from trusted government sources and our users."" For the companies, another challenge is their own global presence. They fear that bowing too far to demands to remove extremist content or blocking actors will lead to an avalanche of requests from governments who each define such content in different ways. A further problem is that the big companies of Silicon Valley are not the only players. The company Telegram in particular has been criticised for not doing more. It has positioned itself as keeping its distance from governments and their demands for information. This problem may grow as more and more companies set up outside the US and UK and see resisting pressure from governments as a way of differentiating themselves from the big players in Silicon Valley. Technology companies point to the amount of staff they are now putting in to review material, but government officials say they are still not putting their best engineering minds on the issue - for instance, the developers who come up with highly profitable techniques for targeting ads. Companies often say that technology can solve any problem. And government wants to see if they can prove it.

The 50-year journey of a British style icon,"This video can not be played QE2 launch remembered The QE2, which was launched 50 years ago, was a British ""style icon"" that became one of the most famous liners in the world - but it also marked the end of generations of large passenger ships being produced on the Clyde. The marketing for the new liner made bold claims about propelling cruise liners two decades into future. Adverts from the time proclaimed: ""The only thing QE2 has in common with other ships is that she floats."" The QE2 was launched by the Queen at John Brown's ship yard in Clydebank in September 1967 The QE2 enters the Firth of Clyde past Cumbrae Elbow lighthouse for the final time in October 2008 After early teething problems, the liner lived up to the hype, serving as shipping company Cunard's flagship for 35 years and becoming a by-word for luxury and elegance. The famous ship also played a crucial role in the Falklands War when it was pressed into action as a troop ship. But despite its success, the shipyards of the upper Clyde never again produced a passenger ship of its scale, as other countries around the world cashed in on the boom in cruise liners. The QE2 was built at the Upper Clyde Shipbuilding yard 963ft (293m) long 65,863 gross register tonnage 1,892 passengers and 1,040 crew Â£29m cost to build (approx Â£490m in today's money) Five restaurants and two cafes, three swimming pools, a 481-seat cinema, a hospital and a casino Almost six million nautical miles sailed 2.5 million passengers in total More than 800 transatlantic crossings completed The QE2 taking to the water at Clydebank after being named by the Queen on 20 September 1967 More than 30,000 people lined the streets of Clydebank on 20 September 1967 as the Queen and Prince Philip made their way to the launch at John Brown's shipyard. The ship was known to the yard as No 736 and to the Cunard as Q4. It was not until the Queen spoke that people discovered what the new liner was to be called. Thousands turned out at the shipyard in Clydebank as the QE2 was launched She named the ship ""Queen Elizabeth the Second"" but that caused Cunard a headache as she was the first Elizabeth to rule over Scotland. In order not to upset the nation that built her, they changed the name to QE2, using the Arabic numeral ""2"" instead of the Roman ""II"" the Queen uses. The interior of the ""Queen's Room"" on the QE2 Peter Kemp, who was a 19-year-old apprentice at the time, told BBC Scotland: ""The Queen announced the name and then there was a long pause. ""It seemed a long time before the ship actually moved. ""Somebody cried out 'give it a shove'. ""One of the gaffers with a bowler hat jumped up and gave it a kiddy-on shove and then the thing moved off down the river."" The QE2 at night in 1969 Mr Kemp says: ""The chains were rattling and the dust was flying about and everything. It was an amazing sight."" Shipyard history expert and author Ian Johnston says: ""It is such a definitive moment when a ship takes to the sea for the very first time, to see this mass of steel sliding into the river, right here on the Clyde and all the noises and atmospherics that go with it, the clouds of dust that are thrown up, just the sheer bulk of something of the scale of the QE2 going into the river. ""It was just a stunning, moving experience."" The QE2 moored alongside Southampton's Ocean terminal in 1969 1967- Launched from John Brown's yard in Clydebank on 20 September 1969- The QE2 made its maiden voyage to New York on 2 May 1971- The liner rescued passengers from another ship, the Antilles, after it ran aground 1972- While travelling from New York to Southampton, the ship was the subject of a bomb threat mid-Atlantic. An SAS-led team parachuted into the water next to the ship but no bomb was found 1982- The QE2 was requisitioned as a troop carrier for the Falklands War 1987- The ship was converted from steam power to diesel electric 2004- After 35 years, the QE2's reign as flagship of the Cunard fleet drew to a close when the title was handed over to the French-built sister ship, Queen Mary 2 2007- Cunard announced it had sold the QE2 to the Dubai government investment company, Isthimar, for Â£50m 2008- After a trip around the UK, including a final trip to the Clyde, the ship sailed to Dubai on 11 November 2008 2012- Plans for a luxury hotel on the QE2 are announced but they have never proceeded 2017- The QE2 remains moored in Dubai with no decision on its future The QE2 anchored in the harbour at Marseille for a stopover in 1996 Despite the liner's rise to fame, its early days were dogged by teething problems. Soon after being launched, its engines were beset with problems. The QE2 arrives in Sydney Harbour on its final voyage to Australia in 2008 Further hitches meant its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in January 1969 had to be cancelled and it did not make the journey until four months later. Mr Johnston said early headlines such as ""ship of shame"" were harsh and there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the liner, as it went on to prove over the next four decades. The QE2 passes the Isle of Arran on its final trip around the UK in 2008 The historian says: ""She became a favourite with cruising people all over the world. Her reputation was well-earned. She was an unusual and stylish ship, very handsome and with the best of British design. ""She also had a long history of service during which her reputation grew."" The QE2 in Sydney, shortly before it was taken out of service The liner also served the UK in a different way during the Falklands War in 1982. The QE2 had its fittings stripped out and three helicopter pads built. The lounges were turned into dormitories and the liner carried more than 3,000 troops to the South Atlantic. Crowds wave from the quayside as the QE2 sets out on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York on 2 May 1969 After almost 70 years, the QE2 was the last of the great Cunard liners to be launched on the Clyde. Ian Johnston says the liner was a ""style icon"". He told BBC Scotland the ship was part of the British design renaissance of the Sixties. In the words of Prime Minister Harold Wilson, it was forged in the ""white heat of technology"". The QE2 carrying British troops from Southampton during the Falklands War in 1982 ""People came to realise she was a leader in design terms, bringing together the best of British design excellence,"" said Mr Johnston. ""She embodied what was the best of British at the time and she stood the test of time in that respect."" In 35 years of service, the QE2 became a destination rather than a carrier, carrying about 2.5 million passengers including the Queen, Nelson Mandela, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, and astronaut Buzz Aldrin. The QE2 in Melbourne in 2008 Building the most famous ship in the world should have secured the future for John Brown's, but the shipyard was in trouble. Partly to keep its skilled workforce together before the Q4 order came in, it had built the Swedish liner Kungsholm and there was no profit from the new Cunarder. John Brown's put in a tender that barely covered costs, just to make sure it got the contract. There were also fears at the time that the QE2 itself was already obsolete in the new age of transatlantic jet travel. Ian Johnston says: ""She was designed to go across the Atlantic in the heavy swell at speed but principally she was designed to be a cruising ship and in that sense she was reading the future."" Mr Johnston says that in 1967 no-one foresaw the boom in cruise ships which has meant more are being built now that at any other point in history. He says: ""It is ironic that the Clyde yards that produced this beautiful ship is no longer in the market to build these liners. ""The sad thing is that none of the great shipbuilders of the Clyde survived into the era when they could have capitalised on the boom because that was their expertise, fitting out luxury ships and passengers ships was one of the things they did so well on the Clyde. ""It would have been very nice to think we could have been building some of these great cruise liners that are being built in Germany and Italy and Finland."" As for the QE2 itself, it is currently berthed in Dubai. The QE2 in Liverpool during its farewell tour of the UK in 2008 It went there in 2008 after it was sold to an investment company that wanted to turn it into a luxury hotel. Those plans have been on hold and the ship remains in Dubai awaiting its fate. Residents of Dubai wave the British and Emirati flags as the famous cruise liner arrives at its final destination For Peter Kemp there is sadness that the ship he worked on as an apprentice is no longer in use but he says that is often the way. ""If, like me, you spend your life working with ships, they come to the end of their working life,"" he says. ""It's sad to say but they go to the scrappers. ""Lots of ships don't have the longevity of the QE2. ""It's a shame it's been left lying out in Dubai. It would be nice to see it brought back up the Clyde.""

The Italians who prefer American coffee,"12oz Coffee Joint founder David Nathaniel says the chain has been welcomed in Italy In Italy coffee is synonymous with espresso, downed quickly and without ceremony. But a new breed of American-style coffee shops is drawing in younger Italians. ""We like it here because we can study and be connected online. We both prefer American-style coffee than Italian and we love the different style of cakes,"" say Aurora, 13, and Linda, aged 14. It's just before lunchtime and we're sitting inside 12oz Coffee Joint - a self-styled American coffee shop near the Duomo in Milan. Italy is viewed by many as the world capital of coffee - wherever you turn you see a bar serving espresso, cappuccino or caffe macchiato as well as the traditional brioche. In these places, if you asked for a latte you would be served a glass of milk. Ordering an espresso is also unnecessary; ""un caffe"" is all you need to say. Coffee and espresso are synonymous in Italy. But in here the drink options are far more exotic, with americano, iced cinnamon lattes or caramel macchiatos all on offer. It's not just the drinks. The counter is piled high with a vast array of doughnuts, muffins, brownies and bagels. 12oz Coffee Joint has a coffee shop near the Duomo in Milan. One customer, Alberto, who is 32, says it's these kinds of differences that have drawn him in. ""I enjoy coming here because it's stylish and has a young fresh feel to it compared to Italian coffee shops."" It's young Italians like these who are starting to shake up the traditional Italian coffee culture in Italy. 12oz Coffee Joint opened its first store in 2015 and there are now six in Milan and one opening soon in Verona. The chain wants to expand to major cities such as Rome and Venice. But what made Italian founder David Nathaniel want to sell American coffee in his home country? The chain also serves US-style cakes ""I have two children who are teenagers - whenever they went abroad they always wanted to have photos posted on social media with big cups of coffee with whipped cream,"" he says. ""Then one day I saw a typical woman from Milan with her Louis Vuitton handbag with a big cup of coffee and she became my muse. ""If she was walking the streets of Milan with a big cup of coffee then the time had come."" Despite the non-traditional concept, he says the coffee shop was broadly welcomed when it opened. ""We had no anger or opposition but it was funny to see the faces of people who would come in and not understand the concept. ""Their reactions to drinking coffee in big paper cups was quite amusing - a lot of professionals in the market actually felt there was a need for such a chain."" Young Italian coffee drinkers are keen to experiment Jonny Forsyth, global drinks analyst at market research firm Mintel, says traditional coffee shops have failed to keep up with changing tastes. ""Italian coffee shop culture is so traditional that it has determinedly ignored modern consumer trends. ""It is also very rare to find flavoured coffee, although some outlets in the north serve coffee with Nutella or hazelnut paste,"" he says. Yet Mintel's research has found that Italians, particularly younger ones, are keen to experiment beyond the traditional espresso. Its research showed a majority (64%) of 16-24 year-old Italian coffee drinkers like trying different flavours of coffee (e.g. vanilla, hazelnut) at home compared to 42% of those aged 55 and above. Mintel also found that over three-quarters of 16-24-year-olds who drink coffee in a typical week like the taste of milky coffee compared to 60% of regular Italian coffee drinkers aged 45 and above. Arnold Coffee, founded by Alfio Bardolla (right), opened in 2009 It's not just 12oz Coffee Joint which has emerged to take advantage of these changing tastes. US-style chain Arnold Coffee opened its first shop in 2009, also in Milan. It now has nine coffee shops with more set to open in Florence and Rome. Italian founder Alfio Bardolla says the fact that their shop allows customers to stay longer and linger over a coffee is one of their big attractions. ""The Italian bar is based on a 'drink up and leave' mentality and if you're there for more than 10 minutes they get annoyed. ""We thought that if McDonald's had succeeded [in Italy], then so would American coffee."" At Arnold Coffee customers stay longer than in traditional bars Mr Bardolla baulks at the idea that selling US-style coffee means the quality suffers, arguing the fact it is often diluted means they have to use better quality coffee. ""People do not come to us to drink an espressoâ¦ but an espresso with our coffee is even better than the traditional bars. Our price is higher but the quality is higher."" One self-confessed coffee addict and Arnold customer, 22-year-old Alessia, is convinced. ""It's lighter than Italian coffee and I love that you can carry it around with you in the big paper cups,"" she says. Starbucks says it is opening in Italy with ""humility and respect"" Coffee giant Starbucksis betting on more US coffee fans like Alessia when it opens its first store in the country next year, a high-end, high-concept roastery in Milan two minutes from the Duomo and the historic Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II. The American coffee chain has promised to enter the birthplace of the espresso ""with humility and respect"". But what do traditional Italian coffee owners think about the shift in culture? Caffe Rigoletto owner Vito Fortunato says they make US requests ""the Italian way"" Vito Fortunato, owner of Caffe Rigoletto in Salsomaggiore Terme, in the province of Parma, says he believes American-style coffees, particularly the flavoured ones ""are really bad for you"". Even when they get ""American requests"" he says they make it ""the Italian way"". ""In Italy for someone who wants to have a different style coffee we put a small drop of flavoured syrup or brandy or a drop of fresh whipped cream or a small scoop of ice cream but this is very traditionally Italian."" But he says the biggest loss from the growing numbers of young Italians choosing American-style coffee shops over their local neighbourhood espresso bars is nothing to do with flavour, but with culture. ""The customer sees the bar as a place to open up, to confide and have a chat and a point of human contact between two people. ""I see that this is slowly disappearing, but it is very important for our lives.""

Why do US police shoot people carrying knives?,"A police officer aims his gun at Scout Schultz, moments before the student died The shooting of a student at Georgia Tech has raised questions over when and why police resort to deadly force. In some cities, including one of America's poorest and most violent, officers are trying a different approach. On 17 November 2015, Sergeant Mickey White was driving home in his patrol car, his shift over, when a call went out about a man harassing customers at Jerry's Country Meat and Catering, a local grocery store in Arlington, Georgia. The employee who dialled 911 said the man was behaving oddly, accosting people and singing a hymn - ""Great is Thy Faithfulness"" - as he walked up and down the aisles. Sgt White took the call. When he arrived, the man was outside sitting in his car, the door open and hazard lights on. He was Derry Eugene Touchtone, a 58-year old white man from Headland, just over the state border in Alabama. He was unarmed. As Sgt White pulled up behind Touchtone, the dashboard camera in his patrol car was recording. In the video, the officer can be heard telling Touchtone to leave the vehicle. Touchtone complies but then ignores repeated instructions to put his hands on the car. Instead he walks slowly out of shot, towards White, and begins to sing. Sgt White fires his Taser but it fails to stop Touchtone. Off camera, a tussle can be heard, followed by two gunshots. Thirty-five seconds after Sgt White had arrived, Touchtone was dead. The dashcam kept recording as other officers arrived on the scene, and it overheard Sgt White talking to another deputy. ""You know the bad thing about it, Brent?"" White says, ""I could've fought him."" ""Don't second guess yourself,"" Brent replies. ""You did what Mickey had to do."" Sergeant Mickey White pictured after the shooting Two years later, and 200 miles north, another controversial police shooting in Georgia has raised questions over exactly what officers have to do to protect themselves against suspects who threaten them with fists, knives, bats or other non-firearm weapons. Scout Schultz, a 21-year-old Georgia Tech student who had battled depression, was reported to police on Sunday after being seen on campus with a knife. When officers arrived on scene, Schultz approached them holding the knife - in reality a multi-tool with a small blade, which a family lawyer says was closed. In an amateur video of the incident, Schultz can be heard saying ""Shoot me!"" while walking towards the officers. ""Drop the knife, man, come on,"" a police officer responds. ""Nobody wants to hurt you,"" another officer says. This video can not be played The final moments before Scout Schultz was shot Schultz ignores repeated requests to drop the knife, then takes a few steps towards one of the officers. The officer opens fire, hitting Schultz in the chest. The student was transported to the Grady Memorial Hospital but died from the gunshot wound. At a press conference, Schultz's father was asked what he would like to say to the officer who pulled the trigger. ""Why did you have to shoot?"" Bill Schultz said. ""That's the question, I mean that's the only question that matters right now. Why did you kill my son?"" It's question that goes to the heart of a shift in policing tactics that is taking place in some parts of the country - an attempted move away from the use of deadly force and towards de-escalation. A series of highly publicised police shootings have drawn national attention to so-called officer-involved shootings, but the vast majority of police officers in the US still have little or no training in how to recognise and engage with a suspect suffering from a mental health crisis, or de-escalate a threat from a knife without resorting to a gun. On 9 November 2015, about a week before Sgt Mickey White pulled up at Jerry's Country Meat, a 48-year-old man walked into a Crown Fried Chicken in Camden City, New Jersey, and pulled out a steak knife. High on PCP, and with a history of mental health problems, he was acting wildly, threatening customers. Outside, he jabbed the knife in the direction of two police deputies before setting off down the street. He was soon surrounded by a dozen or so officers, but he continued to swing the knife and move forward. At this point, the situation could so easily have played out the way it did at Georgia Tech on Sunday. The officers could have stood their ground, as they had the right to do. They could have followed a decades-old policing rule that anyone with a knife within 21ft presents an immediate threat to life. They could have shot him dead. But in Camden, one of the poorest and most violent cities in the country, police have for the past few years been taking a new approach. ""We stress to our officers that you do not have to rush in and rapidly resolve every scenario,"" said Lieutenant Kevin Lutz, who has overseen the shift in tactics. ""It's OK to slow down, it's OK to take a step back. Sometimes the best thing is to holster your weapon and talk."" The Camden officers following the knife-wielding suspect slowed down. They formed a loose group around the man, clearing the street ahead and walking alongside him. One spoke to him, periodically asking him to drop the knife. They waited. Most of the officers had their guns holstered, a few held them subtly at their sides. About 45 minutes after police arrived they were able to Taser the man, and he was arrested. This video can not be played Police in Camden City, NJ, resorted to patience instead of guns ""Those officers would 100% have been legally justified to use deadly force,"" said Lt Lutz. ""Had they stood their ground a deadly encounter would have been forced at that point. By allowing it to unfold, it ended with an arrest and the suspect is alive. Five or 10 years ago, he wouldn't be."" But the Georgia Tech shooting on Sunday shows that similar incidents still end fatally today. Of the 40,000 or so serving police officers in the state, about 10,000 have received some kind of mental health and de-escalation training over the past decade, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The gold standard is a 40-hour course run in conjunction with the National Alliance for Mental Illness, but the majority of those 10,000 officers - and the vast majority of police officers across the country - will have received significantly less than that. And a proportion of those 10,000 officers have retired or moved on to desk jobs, leaving no clear picture of how many current frontline officers in Georgia have had some form of de-escalation training. It is not known whether the officers that confronted Scout Schultz had had any. According to a 2015 national survey by the Police Executive Research Forum (Perf), police officers received on average 58 hours of firearms training, 49 hours on defensive tactics, and just eight hours on mental health and de-escalation. There are no states which mandate de-escalation training. Camden police worked closely with Perf in developing its new approach. Perf in turn took inspiration from officers in Scotland. In late 2014 - shortly after the police shooting of Michael Brown sparked violent unrest in Ferguson, Missouri - Perf director Chuck Wexler was in Scotland for a leadership training programme. Looking around him at a graduation ceremony, Mr Wexler was struck by the fact that none of the officers were carrying guns. ""What hit me was the fact that these officers deal with similar knife situations that we deal with,"" he said. ""A knife in Glasgow is the same as a knife in downtown Washington DC, so why are they able to do it without shooting?"" Mr Wexler returned to the US armed with the UK's National Decision Model - a framework that emphasises communication, patience, and minimal force. He took note of interesting tactics, like a police officer removing his hat to appear more open and less confrontational. Perf now works with police departments across the country to train officers in looking for alternatives to firing their gun. Scout Schultz at an LGBT pride march Those alternatives can present themselves in any number of small decisions before a final, momentous one, said Greg Ridgeway, a statistician at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied police shootings. ""Often you look at the three seconds before the shooting and it looks like a good shoot,"" he said. ""Suspect comes at officer with knife, officer shoots. Fine. But step back five minutes, even a minute, and you start questioning how the officer got themselves into that situation where they had no option but to shoot. And you see that a little bit of patience, a little bit of distance, could have resolved some of those incidents peacefully."" The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) declined to comment on the incident at Georgia Tech, but the video suggests that crisis intervention tactics - and the kind of patience exhibited by the officers in Camden County - might have resolved that incident peacefully. GBI director Vernon Keenan acknowledged that the amount of mental health and de-escalation training currently given to most officers was ""minimal"". He said the state was in the process of reviewing the amount of training on offer and recruiting 12 new permanent staff to oversee more. Even those who bang the drum loudest for a rethink over the use of deadly force acknowledge that it is still sometimes the only option, and the 300 million or so guns in America put it in a vastly different position to countries like Scotland. ""Make no mistake, there are times when force is going to be immediate and required,"" said Lt Lutz. But in places like Camden, they are trying to shift the emphasis. Officers are taught to put an ""absolute value on the life of the person they encounter, regardless of what behaviour they are exhibiting at the time,"" said Lt Lutz. ""If our officers value life, and they are morally sound, and they are responding to the call and thinking through why they are there, then we believe some of the more controversial shootings that have taken place across the country, right or wrong, can be avoided.""

10 university flashpoints over free speech,"Do students want to have debates? Or stop other people from speaking? Free speech - too much of it or too little of it - has become one of the thorniest and most emotive subjects for universities. At what point do strongly held views become extremism or hate speech? There have been violent flashpoints, particularly in US universities, about what can be said about race, gender and sexuality. And when does the ultra-liberal assertion of ""safe spaces"" and limits on language become intolerant and controlling? Or are these just first-world problems, missing the point about what freedom is really about? So as new academic terms begin, where are the significant battlegrounds? This video can not be played 'It gets lonely': Being conservative on a liberal campus 1) InHong Kong, students are under pressure to stop putting up posters and flying banners promoting independence from China. University campuses are being told that this is not an issue of freedom of speech, but an attack on the principle of Hong Kong's ""one country, two systems"" relationship with China. The posters are put up by students on ""democracy walls"", but authorities say this is an ""abuse"" of freedom. Security for a campus speech at Berkeley cost the university $600,000 2)The dollar price of free speech:The University of California, Berkeley, was a cradle of the ""free speech movement"" in the United States in the 1960s, when students were protesting against the Vietnam war. It's still on the front line of debates about free speech. Right-wing commentator Ben Shapiro spoke at Berkeley this month, drawing angry protests from opponents. Torches have been banned at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville The university authorities said the security operation around the event cost them $600,000 (Â£440,000). Another right-wing free speech event, also likely to provoke another protest, is planned for the autumn. 3)Looking west or east?: The Central European University in Budapest in Hungary has been at the centre of an international struggle, which the university says could see it being shut down. The university, originally funded by the liberal philanthropist George Soros, says it is being targeted by an unsympathetic, nationalist government. Protesters in Budapest want to protect the threatened Central European University Hungary's government says the university needs to comply with new higher education regulations - and negotiations in the United States have been trying to break the deadlock. 4)Illiberal liberals?:Republican lawmakers in the US state of Ohio are trying to put campus free speech into legislation - challenging what they see as excessive political correctness. They warn that a ""mentality is creeping into our culture that views disagreeable speech as inherently hateful, or even violent"". They want to stop universities setting up designated ""free speech zones"" on campus, where controversial opinions can be aired, arguing that the whole university should be open to free speech. 5)Torch ban:After the confrontations between torch-carrying white supremacists and protesters at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, the universities have clarified that carrying such ""open flames"" will not be permitted by the campus police. US campuses have seen conflicts over what views should be allowed to be expressed It shows the power of the symbol in arguments over free speech, with the burning torches evoking images of the Ku Klux Klan and far-right rallies. There are other measures toughening up security, but university authorities say that carrying ""open flame devices"" will be prohibited. 6)Turkey trial: The trial of a university lecturer accused of terror-related charges began last week in Turkey. Nuriye Gulmen, and a primary school teacher also facing charges, have been on ahunger strike protest and were not present at the court in Ankara, with supporters warning of their ill-health. They lost their jobs in a crackdown that followed the failed coup attempt against Turkey's president last year. Their case has become a symbol of the 150,000 people claiming to have been sacked or suspended since the coup attempt. 7)Carving out an argument: US universities have been caught in a series of symbolic battles over statues, the names of buildings and what constitutes campus freedom. Much of this has been about representations of race and identity. Hong Kong students are being told to take down posters and banners calling for independence Yale has decided that it needs to remove a 1920s carving from one of its buildings which ""depicts a Puritan settler holding a musket pointed toward the head of a Native American"". The university says leaving it in place could create the ""unintended effect"" of endorsing an image which shows a ""scene of warfare and colonial violence toward local Native American inhabitants"". The push for gender neutrality has also seen the university switch away from the traditional term ""freshman"" for new students to using ""first year"". 8)Chelsea Manning, imprisoned after giving government information to Wikileaks, was named as a visiting fellow at the Institute of Politics at Harvard Kennedy School last week. But two days later the university rescinded the appointment describing it as a ""mistake"". Harvard reversed its decision to offer a post to Chelsea Manning Harvard said in appointing her they wanted to hear from people who ""significantly influenced events in the world even if they do not share our values"". This raised the recurrent issue about being free to hear opposing views. But after ex-acting CIA director Michael Morell resigned from his post at the university over the decision, Harvard reversed her appointment. 9) ""My job is not to make you feel comfortable."" The University of Oxford vice chancellor, Louise Richardson, warned fellow university leaders that they had a responsibility to protect free speech on campus. She told them that students needed to confront views with which they disagreed, even if it meant addressing attitudes that made them ""uncomfortable"" or they found offensive. Should universities focus on protecting free speech or preventing provocation? But she then became embroiled in a row over whether the example she used showed a lack of opposition to homophobia, with calls for an apology and clarifications that she had been""completely misconstrued"". 10)North Korea:What are their worries about free movement? A private, English-language university in the country, the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, has been struggling with getting overseas staff through the US travel ban, but opened as planned this term. Meanwhile Kim Il-sung University, working on a technology project forecasting exchange rates, has only ""success"" to report. More fromGlobal education What's it like to start reading at 60?

Facebook overhaul after anti-Semitic ads,"Sheryl Sandberg said she was ""disgusted"" by ProPublica's discovery Facebook will add more human reviewers to its advertising system after admitting it failed to prevent, or even notice, anti-Semitic targeting on the network. Sheryl Sandberg, the networkâs chief operating officer, said she was ""disgusted"" by the findings of a ProPublica investigation published last week,external. The report found that ads could be bought to specifically target users who described themselves as âJew hatersâ, as well as other similarly hateful terms. âWe never intended or anticipated this functionality being used this way â and that is on us,â Ms Sandberg wrote. In a post on Facebook,external, she added: âSeeing those words made me disgusted and disappointed - disgusted by these sentiments and disappointed that our systems allowed this. âHate has no place on Facebook â and as a Jew, as a mother, and as a human being, I know the damage that can come from hate. âThe fact that hateful terms were even offered as options was totally inappropriate and a fail on our part. We removed them and when that was not totally effective, we disabled that targeting section in our ad systems.â Hold tech firms accountable Responding to the announcement, the Anti-Defamation League said it welcomed Ms Sandbergâs comments. âWe spoke to Facebook last week to understand what happened and asked for detailed steps they'd take to prevent this sort of hateful ad-targeting,â said Jonathan Greenblatt, the ADLâs chief executive. âWe are glad that they are taking immediate, meaningful action, and ADL will continue to hold tech companies accountable for following through on these actions.â Ms Sandberg said the team of human reviewers would be responsible for monitoring the terms that can be used to sell advertising. In addition, she said the company was working on a new system that would allow users to report inappropriate advertising categories, much in the way normal posts can be reported today. Facebook is not the only company to fall foul of poorly designed advertising algorithms in recent months. Google also had to take action after its system allowed the placement of search ads next to racist and anti-Semitic terms. So too did Twitter have to take action against abuses of its ad system. The stories are being seen as a wake-up call for companies that rely on algorithms to handle the heavy lifting on their platforms - without any thought given to the potential for abuse. Facebook's ads were alsoin the spotlight earlier this monthwhen it was discovered that a Russian group was likely behind the purchase of politically charged advertising targeting American voters. That information was passed on to a wider US investigation into Russian meddling in last year's presidential election. ___ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Facebook cuts ads aimed at 'Jew haters' Facebook detects 'Russian-funded' campaign Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Raging Bull boxer Jake LaMotta dies,"'The Bronx Bull' was willing to take a beating to get close to his opponent Jake LaMotta, the uncompromising fighter portrayed by Robert De Niro in Raging Bull, has died aged 95. The former world middleweight boxing champion died in a nursing home due to complications from pneumonia, his wife told US news site TMZ. Based on LaMotta's 1970 memoir, Raging Bull depicts an emotional fighter struggling with life outside the ring. The 1980 film, directed by Martin Scorsese, earned De Niro a Best Actor award at the Oscars. ""I just want people to know, he was a great, sweet, sensitive, strong, compelling man with a great sense of humour, with eyes that danced,"" Mrs LaMotta said. He often wore a hooded leopard-print robe into the ring His rough style made him one of the most famous fighters in boxing during the 1940s and 1950s Born on 10 July 1922 to Italian parents in the Bronx area of New York City, he took up boxing after being rejected by the US military due to a medical condition. Sports commentators praised his willingness to take a severe beating in order to get close enough to land the best punches on his opponent. His stamina in the ring, which he honed during a prison sentence, earned him the nickname ""The Bronx Bull"". One writer for the Associated Press described how he fought with ""blows bouncing off him like ball bearings off a battleship"". Allow Twitter content?

LaMotta first won national recognition two years after landing on the professional boxing circuit, when he handed Sugar Ray Robinson his first ever defeat in 1943. His rough style, and strong chin, made him one of the most famous fighters in boxing during the 1940s and 1950s at a time when boxing was one of the nation's most popular sports. After resisting Mafia efforts to control him, he later admitted to intentionally losing a fight at the behest of mobsters in 1947, causing him to suffer a suspension from the sport. According tothe International Boxing Hall of Fame,external, his career record was 83 wins, 19 losses, 4 draws, and 30 knockouts. After retiring from the ring in 1954, he went on to act in several films, also touring as a stand-up comedian. ""The truth of the matter?"" hetold the Chicago Sun-Times,externalin 1996. ""The punches never hurt me. ""My nose was broken six times, my hands six times, a few fractured ribs. Fifty stitches over my eyes. But the only place I got hurt was out of the ring."" In 1949 LaMotta defeated Robert Villemain after a 12-round bout in Madison Square Garden, New York City. In the lead up to the filming for Raging Bull, LaMotta spent nearly a year personally training De Niro to box in a New York City gym,according to ESPN,external. The film's stark style may have originated in LaMotta's own autobiography, in which he wrote: ""Sometimes, at night, when I think back, I feel like I'm looking at an old black-and-white movie of myself. ""Not a good movie, either, jerky, with gaps in it, a string of poorly lit sequences, some of them with no beginning and some with no end. No musical score..."" After the film debuted, he expressed puzzlement as to why he had allowed his life to be depicted, and even worked on set as a consultant. ""When I saw the film I was upset. I kind of look bad in it,"" he told a reviewer. ""Then I realised it was true. That's the way it was... It's not the way I am now, but the way I was then.""

Ryanair compensation efforts 'woeful',"Ryanair's information to customers about compensation for cancelled flights is ""woefully short"", consumer group Which? has said. Ryanair has stepped up efforts to deal with the 2,100 flights it has cancelled during the next six weeks. But Which? said it should make its compensation obligations clear. Meanwhile, Italy's competition regulator has opened a probe into the cancellations which it said the low-cost airline could have prevented. Ryanair is the biggest carrier in Italy, outstripping even Alitalia, which it is trying to buy. The Irish airline could be fined as much as 5m euros. The cancellations may have been ""largely due to foreseen organisational and management reasons... not random, external causes outside of (the company's) control"", said the Italian Competition and Market Authority (AGCM). Ryanair said all 315,000 affected customers received emails on Monday, advising them of the flight changes and offering alternative flights and refunds, after it decided at the weekend to cancel 40 to 50 flights every dayfor the next six weeks,external. It has blamed the fiasco on its own mistaken decision to force its pilots to take their remaining annual leave before the end of this year, rather than by the end of the financial year next March, which has left it without enough pilots to fly all its scheduled planes this month and next. The airline said that by the end of Wednesday, it expected to have reassigned 55% of the customers - 175,000 - to other Ryanair flights. More than 63,000 refunds will have been processed, it said. However Ryanair pilots have knocked back a proposal from the carrier to pay them bonuses to encourage them to work through the enforced holiday leave. The airline's currentadvice to customers,externalon its website does not mention the word ""compensation"", to which customers are entitledunder European legislation. The Ryanair website only says: ""We understand that flight cancellations may cause distress and we will accommodate your option of choice wherever possible, while complying with EU Regulation 261/2004."" Which? took a dim view of this oblique approach and said compensation should be paid automatically. Its spokeswoman, Alex Neill, said: ""Ryanair's approach to informing affected passengers about compensation falls woefully short. ""It is legally required to spell out compensation rules when a flight is cancelled and, in our view, has so far failed to do that, leaving passengers hunting around for information. ""This is another blow for the thousands of passengers who have already had to endure huge inconvenience as a result of this fiasco,"" she added. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary announced full details of his airline's flight cancellations on Monday 18 September, 2017 Ryanair estimates that the cancellations will cost it up to 20m euros (Â£17.7m), though this figure could eventually be higher, as the airline's estimate amounts to only 63 euros per affected passenger. The total number of passengers now affected is, however, lower than the airline's original figure of 390,000 because Ryanair's planes were only 70% booked in October, compared with 90% full in September. The airline also said it had taken on extra office staff to deal with the backlog of flight changes and compensation requests. It added that it hoped to have dealt with more than 95% of the affected customers by the end of this week. Kenny Jacobs, Ryanair's chief marketing officer, apologised again for its mistakes. ""We have taken on extra customer service teams to speed up the rate at which we accommodate and action alternative flight requests or refund applications,"" he said. ""We expect to have the vast majority of these completed by the end of this week. ""The vast majority of these requests are being dealt with online, but as our call centres and chat lines are extremely busy, we ask affected customers to bear with us as we do everything we can to respond to their requests and try to resolve any problems we have created for them, for which we again sincerely apologise,"" he added.

Outcry over Dutchwoman fined for public peeing,"Geerte Piening was told by the judge that she should have used a men's urinal The case of a Dutch woman fined â¬90 (Â£80; $105) for relieving herself in an alleyway in the centre of Amsterdam has turned into a debate about sexism. The Dutch capital offers 35 public urinals for men compared with just three toilets designed for women. Geerte Piening, 23, was caught short after a night out drinking in Amsterdam's vibrant Leidseplein in 2015. It was past closing time and the nearest public toilet was a couple of kilometres away, so she decided to find a quiet street while her friends kept watch. She was caught by three police officers. ""At the time I really didn't want to get involved in a discussion,"" she said. ""But the next day I thought, just a minute, I'm going to fight this."" The judge, in this case a man, told her she should have used one of the men's facilities rather than resorting to urinating in public - an offence known as ""wildplassen"" in Dutch.

Using the word as a hashtag, some women mocked his suggestion and shared photos of themselves demonstrating the obvious difficulties involved in adapting to urinals. Unlike men, women have no discreet way of using the metal structures. Berlin ponders urinals for women Delayed controversy of 'gay' toilet sign The judge also likened the offence to throwing litter on the street rather than in a bin, prompting one commentator to point out that banana peels or chocolate bar wrappers could be stashed in a pocket and dumped at any point in a gender-neutral bin. Ms Piening insisted she had used the alleyway only as a last resort and said public facilities for women in other European capitals were far superior. ""Isn't it embarrassing for a tourist city like Amsterdam that women have nowhere to go?"" she told the AD newspaper, ""It wasn't my intention that this would become an enormous feminist thing. On the other hand, it's good it's being addressed."" Toilets and transgender rights India divorce granted over lack of toilet The judge acknowledged there were fewer facilities for women but said the council was not obliged to provide them. Women were less likely to use them anyway, he added, noting this was a rare case. ""You are only the second woman I've seen in court for this,"" he was quoted as saying. Amsterdam city officials have questioned whether investing in public loos for women are worth the money Amsterdam's city council said there had never been any policy on public toilets. ""There are more men's than women's just because that's how it's gone,"" Peter Paul Ekker, a spokesman for the deputy mayor, told the BBC. ""Obviously it should be equal and everyone will agree it can be done better, but what are the costs, is there space, and is it worth it?"" But this may not be the end of the story. A Facebook group,externalhas been set up encouraging women to join a protest on Friday, taking up the judge's challenge of using the men's urinals. More than 5,000 people have so far expressed an interest in attending the event.

Iran's leader slams Trump in UN speech,"This video can not be played Trump and Rouhani trade insults in UN podium duel President Hassan Rouhani of Iran has used a speech to the UN General Assembly to hit back at Donald Trump over the US president's criticisms of his country and its 2015 nuclear deal. In his debut speech to the UN on Tuesday, President Trump included Iran among a ""small group of rogue regimes"". He described the nuclear deal as an ""embarrassment"" to the United States. Mr Rouhani responded by referring to a ""rogue newcomer to international politics"". He denied his country would be the first to violate the agreement but said Iran would ""respond decisively and resolutely to its violation by any party"". It would be a ""great pity"", he added, if the agreement were to be destroyed by Mr Trump. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Mr Trump has long condemned the nuclear deal concluded under Barack Obama, his predecessor in the White House. The White House said last month Iran was complying with the deal, but Mr Trump has said the country is violating its spirit. This video can not be played President Rouhani's remarks On Tuesday, healso accused Iran's government of being bent on ""death and destruction"". Iran, he said, was a ""corrupt dictatorship"" and an ""economically depleted rogue state"" that exported violence. Addressing the assembly at UN headquarters in New York, Mr Rouhani deplored ""ignorant, absurd and hateful rhetoric"" which was ""unfit to be heard at the United Nations"". In 2015, Iran reached its landmark nuclear deal with the P5+1 group of world powers - the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany. Crippling economic sanctions on Iran were lifted after the International Atomic Energy Agency certified Iran had restricted sensitive nuclear activities. This video can not be played Which 'rogue states' are in Trump's new axis of evil? Iran says it has the right to nuclear energy and insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only. The White House said at the time the deal would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Speaking on Wednesday, the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, said President Trump's remarks were ""not a clear signal that he plans to withdraw"". ""What it is, is a clear signal that he's not happy with the deal,""she told CBS News in an interview,external. Iran's uranium stockpile will be reduced by 98% to 300kg for 15 years There are two uranium enrichment facilities in Iran - Natanz and Fordo - where uranium hexafluoride gas is fed into centrifuges to separate out the most fissile isotope, U-235. Low-enriched uranium, which has a 3%-4% concentration of U-235, can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants, but it can also be enriched to the 90% needed to produce nuclear weapons. In July 2015, Iran had almost 20,000 centrifuges. Under theJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),external, it will be limited to installing no more than 5,060 of the oldest and least efficient centrifuges at Natanz for 10 years. Iran's uranium stockpile will also be reduced by 98% to 300kg (660lbs) for 15 years. It must also keep its level of enrichment at 3.67%.

Mexican quake devastates primary school,"This video can not be played Moments after the earthquake hit At least 21 children and five adults died at a primary school which collapsed in Mexico City during Tuesday's quake, the government says. The shallow, 7.1 magnitude quake killed at least 230 people in total and caused major damage across states in the centre of the country. Desperate searches for survivors under the rubble are continuing. Hopes rose at the school when a girl was located alive and a delicate operation to rescue her is under way. Dozens of buildings collapsed across the country, including several churches where worshippers were killed. Families with young children could be seen sleeping outside their homes in the street in the capital. President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto has declared three days of mourning. The tremor struck shortly after many people had taken part in an earthquake drill, exactly 32 years after another quake killed thousands in the capital. Mexico is prone to earthquakes and earlier this month an8.1 magnitude tremorin the south left at least 90 people dead. Though it struck a similar region, Tuesday's earthquake does not appear to be connected with the quake on 7 September, which was at least 30 times more energetic, the BBC's Jonathan Amoswrites. As it happened Mexico quake: Where buildings collapsed Why did only some buildings collapse? The race to help after the quake Enrique RÃ©bsamen primary school, in Mexico City's southern Coapa district, collapsed. Confirming the death toll, Education Minister Aurelio NuÃ±oâ said 11 people had been rescued while two children and an adult were missing. Local media had reported a higher death toll earlier. More than 500 members of the army and navy, along with 200 police officers and volunteers, have been working at the site, Mexican newspaper Milenio says. This video can not be played Rescuers searched for survivors under the rubble at Enrique RÃ©bsamen primary school in Mexico City Details of the girl located on Wednesday have not been given. Rescuers detected her after she moved her hand and a hose was lowered to supply her with water. Civil Protection volunteer Enrique Gardia told the assembled crowd that a thermal scanner had detected several survivors trapped between slabs of concrete. ""They are alive! Alive!"" he shouted. ""Someone hit a wall several times in one place, and in another there was a response to light signals with a lamp,"" he added. One mother, standing nearby waiting for news of her seven-year-old daughter, told reporters: ""No-one can possibly imagine the pain I'm in right now."" At least 209 schools were affected by the quake, 15 of which have suffered severe damage. By Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC News, Mexico City In the heat and humidity of Mexico City, there's also hope. Police officers guard a six-storey office and residential building in the Bohemian La Condesa neighbourhood. The concrete structure has been flattened to a towering mass of bricks and twisted metal. The damage is so severe I had to look at the building next door, which remains intact, to get an idea of its neighbour's pre-quake state. Moments later a team of rescuers in blue overalls and red hats strap head torches on as they prepare to enter the building. More than 50 people have been rescued in this city so far. People here are determined to make sure that it's that figure that climbs, and not the death toll. As is often the case in the wake of a devastating natural disaster, people are also displaying resilience. Hundreds of people are wandering the streets holding handwritten signs which offer water and food to people. A man also holds a sign which says ""no smoking"". The earthquake has led to many gas leaks and that, as well as the fear of further aftershocks, remains a concern here. The epicentre of the latest quake was near Atencingo in Puebla state, about 120km (75 miles) from Mexico City, with a depth of 51km, the US Geological Survey says. The prolonged tremor hit at 13:14 local time (18:14 GMT) on Tuesday and sent thousands of residents into the streets. Most of the victims died in the capital, according to government figures: Mexico City: 100 dead Morelos state: 69 dead Puebla state: 43 dead Mexico state: 13 dead Guerrero: Four dead Oaxaca: One dead Eleven people were killed at this church in Atzala, Puebla state Fifteen people were killed when a church near Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano collapsed during Mass.  The volcano itself had a small eruption as a result of the tremor. In Atzala, Puebla, another church collapsed during a baptism, killing 11 people including the baby, Church officials told Efe news agency. Alfredo del Mazo Maza, governor of the State of Mexico, said schools would be closed on Wednesday. He also ordered all public transport to operate services for free so that people could travel home. In pictures: Huge earthquake Are Mexico's two earthquakes connected? An earthquake drill was being held in Mexico City on Tuesday to mark the 32nd anniversary of a magnitude 8 quake that killed up to 10,000 people and left 30,000 others injured. The severe tremor caused serious damage to Mexico City and its surrounding areas, with more than 400 buildings collapsed and thousands more damaged. This video can not be played The strong quake was felt in the capital, Mexico City Correspondents say that residents may have mistaken earthquake alarms for part of the day of drills in the wake of the 1985 quake. Mexico City is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with more than 20 million people living in the metropolitan area. Mexico is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, sitting where three of the Earth's tectonic plates - the North American, Cocos and Pacific plates - meet. This video can not be played Mexicans were distraught as they surveyed the damage from the quake The latest tremor occurred near the boundary between the North American and Cocos plates, where the latter slides beneath the former. According to theUS Geological Survey,external, the country has seen 19 earthquakes of at least 6.5 magnitude within 155 miles of the epicentre of Tuesday's quake over the past century. Foreign leaders sent messages of support as the scale of the disaster became clear: US President Donald Trump, who has courted controversy with his plans for a border wall with Mexico, tweeted: ""God bless the people of Mexico City. We are with you and will be there for you"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also tweeted his support following the ""devastating news"" Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis, in New York for the UN General Assembly, expressed his ""solidarity"" with the Mexican people Pope Francis said his thoughts and prayers were with the families of those who had lost loved ones in the ""devastating"" quake. ""In this moment of pain I want to express my closeness and my prayer to all of the beloved Mexican population,"" the pontiff said at the Vatican The Mexican government issued the following guidance on what to do if a quake strikes in the country: stay calm find the evacuation route and meeting point stay away from windows and objects that may fall in case of emergency call 911 do not use lifts The UK Foreign Office hassaid,externalthat those travelling to Mexico should follow the advice of the local authorities.

Paddy Power 'bet on black' advert banned,"A newspaper advert featuring boxer Floyd Mayweather Jr that encouraged readers to ""always bet on black"" has been banned. The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled the Paddy Power ad was ""likely to cause serious offence on the grounds of race"". The bookmaker has been warned not to make a similar mistake in the future. Paddy Power said it did not believe the advertisement was derogatory, distasteful or offensive. The phrase used in the advert, which appeared in the Evening Standard and Metro newspapers in August, is a line from the Wesley Snipes film ""Passenger 57"". It was used ahead of American Mayweather'scontroversial fight against Irishman Conor McGregor. In itsruling,external, the ASA said: ""We acknowledged that the headline claim did not make a negative statement about Floyd Mayweather's race and had endorsed him to win the match. ""We also acknowledged that Floyd Mayweather had authorised the claim. ""However, we considered that readers would nevertheless be offended by the invitation to always bet on the outcome of a boxing match based on a boxer's race, and the message that the boxing match was a fight between two different races."" 'Sexually suggestive' TV advert banned David Coulthard safe driving app ad banned The offending slogan was embroidered on the boxer's trunks at the weigh-in Paddy Power said Mayweather had found the line funny, rather than offensive or derogatory. It also pointed out that the phrase ""always bet on black"" had been embroidered on the underwear Mayweather wore at the official weigh-in for his fight. The regulator has also banned a television advert featuring ex-Formula One star David Coulthard for encouraging dangerous driving. The extended ad for a new ""safe driving"" app from car insurance firm Aviva prompted 58 complains to the ASA. In the ad, Coulthard, wearing a false beard, plays the part of a cab driver who performs high-speed stunts on public roads with shocked passengers in the back. At the end of the journey, Coulthard asked them to pay for the ride, before revealing his true identity. A disclaimer warns viewers not to copy scenes. The ASA said:""It featured reckless driving on public roads and therefore encouraged dangerous and irresponsible driving."",external Aviva unsuccessfully argued that Coulthard's stunts ""encouraged and promoted"" safer driving.

M1 closure object 'possibly acid',"Motorists were stranded on the M1 between junctions 15 and 14 for hours A ""suspicious object"" which caused a 14-hour closure of part of the M1 was ""possibly hydrochloric acid"". Motorists were left stranded after the 11-mile (18km) stretch between junctions 15 at Northampton and 14 at Milton Keynes was shut from 07:30 BST. Thames Valley Police said the item was a five litre container in a black bin bag, which contained a ""highly corrosive"" substance. The force said it was ""keeping an open mind"" as to how it got there. Officers said there was ""no evidence to suggest that this is a terrorist-related incident"" and are appealing for anyone with information to come forward. Live updates on this story and more This video can not be played The bomb disposal unit was sent to assess the ""suspicious object"" The container was found under a southbound bridge on the road connecting Little Linford and Gayhurst. Footage showed a bomb disposal robot pulling a bin bag off the hard shoulder, which appeared to contain a yellow liquid. Insp Scott Long said: ""It is still being analysed, however, we do know the substance is a highly corrosive material, possibly hydrochloric acid, which has reacted with another substance, causing it to discharge on to [the road]. ""We are keeping an open mind as to how the object was left at the scene."" The northbound carriageway reopened at 17:00 BST, prior to which many motorists were released from the queues via Newport Pagnell services. However, the southbound side was shut until 22:30 BST. Those caught in the delays have criticised the police for poor communication. Tim Mayer, a Conservative councillor from Coventry stuck in the traffic, said: ""I don't think this is an issue about resource because the reality is you had police standing around stopping traffic from moving and you could go and ask them a question and not get an answer. ""They could have had a statement ready."" Motorists resorted to playing games and walking to service stations Some people caught up in the delays played football on the empty stretch of M1 Another motorist said: ""I don't have access to Facebook or Twitter, so for seven hours I've had nothing to drink and no information at all. ""I would have liked a policeman to somebody to come up and say, 'This is the situation and this is what we're trying to do'."" A force spokesman said: ""We apologise for the inconvenience caused to motorists who were stuck in queues yesterday but your safety, and the safety of our officers and the staff of our partner agencies, is our priority. ""There were officers/staff at the scene and we were regularly updating our website and social media channels."" In August the same stretch of road was closed for about 12 hours after eight people died in acrash between a minibus and a lorry. Earlier this month, the M1 between J14 and J15 was closed for 14 hours when a vehicle transporter crossed the central reservation into traffic,killing two people.

No baby Nigels in 2016 (despite Brexit),"Nigel Mansell, Nigel Kennedy and Nigel Farage - the last of a dying breed? Celebrities and sports stars are often credited with influencing parents' choice of baby names - but it seems that politicians rarely have the same effect. He was barely off the television in 2016 - but in the year of his greatest political triumph, it now seems there was no surge in people wanting to name their baby after Nigel Farage. Nigel as a baby name has been teetering on the brink of extinction in England and Wales for several years and has now all but disappeared, according tothe latest Office for National Statistics figures.,external At most there were two Nigels born in 2016 - the ONS doesn't keep the data to tell us whether it was two, one or zero - but we can says for sure that more people in England and Wales named their child Elvis - three - than Nigel last year. It seems unlikely to be anything personal, or to do with Brexit - there was an increase to 39 in the number of Borises, after all - but instead must just be another casualty of the mysterious forces of fashion that dictate baby names in Britain. Olivia replaces Amelia as top girl's name Do we judge people by their name? Fifth of parents 'regret baby's name' Where are all the Kevins, Trevors, Sharons, Doreens or, for that matter, Brians now? Why are names like Oliver, William, Olivia and Emily so popular? Peak Nigel occurred in 1963 - the year before the former UKIP leader was born - when 5,529 babies were given the name. Like Norman (14 babies in 2016), Clive (3), Trevor (6) and other popular baby boy names of the mid-20th Century, it has slipped steadily from use, and may have to wait a decade or two more for its inevitable revival - when it is no longer seen as a middle-aged chap's name. If it's any consolation, its decline was not as steep as that experienced by some 1970s favourites. The first Darren was elected to the House of Commons this year - Labour's Darren Jones. He might well be the last, with just 55 Darrens registered last year. The first Darren in Parliament - and the last? Sorry, your browser cannot display this content.      You can tell a lot about a politician or a public figure from their first name. Some are blessed with neutral-sounding names that can be easily adapted to any circumstance; others are not so lucky. Tony Blair - who has had children named after him in Kosovo and Sierra Leone (we're not sure about Iraq) in honour of his military interventions in those countries - was rarely Anthony, unless he was appearing as a barrister. David ""call me Dave"" Cameron was another prime minister with a classless moniker, unlike his posher-sounding Chancellor Gideon (39 babies in 2016), who changed his name to the ever-popular George (5,236) as a teenager. The current crop of party leaders are blessed with solid but rather unfashionable first names, befitting their age and background. Theresa is on the slide from an already low base - 19 babies shared their name with the prime minister last year, compared with 34 two decade ago - and Jeremy hardly fared better in 2016, with 54 newborn boys sharing the Labour leader's name, compared with 108 in 1996. Corbyn, though, is on the up as a first name - 18 in 2016 compared with less than three in 1996. There were slightly more baby Vinces (14) than Lib Dem MPs. Home Secretary Amber Rudd fares a lot better - there were 1,066 baby Ambers last year. But although Brits have long named their children after film stars and other celebrities - with the new Star Wars film apparently inspiring some choices in 2016 - politicians have rarely been a source of inspiration. Few named their children after Winston Churchill in the 1940s, although the name was popular in the Commonwealth. But one political name has undergone something of a revival in recent years, with 26 children beginning their journey in life last year as Enoch - up from none two decades earlier. It is not known how many - if any - named their offspring after controversial ""rivers of blood"" MP Enoch Powell, however.

Rouhani condemns Trump at UN,"This video can not be played Trump and Rouhani trade insults in UN podium duel President Hassan Rouhani of Iran has used a speech to the UN General Assembly to hit back at Donald Trump over the US president's criticisms of his country and its 2015 nuclear deal. In his debut speech to the UN on Tuesday, President Trump included Iran among a ""small group of rogue regimes"". He described the nuclear deal as an ""embarrassment"" to the United States. Mr Rouhani responded by referring to a ""rogue newcomer to international politics"". He denied his country would be the first to violate the agreement but said Iran would ""respond decisively and resolutely to its violation by any party"". It would be a ""great pity"", he added, if the agreement were to be destroyed by Mr Trump. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Mr Trump has long condemned the nuclear deal concluded under Barack Obama, his predecessor in the White House. The White House said last month Iran was complying with the deal, but Mr Trump has said the country is violating its spirit. This video can not be played President Rouhani's remarks On Tuesday, healso accused Iran's government of being bent on ""death and destruction"". Iran, he said, was a ""corrupt dictatorship"" and an ""economically depleted rogue state"" that exported violence. Addressing the assembly at UN headquarters in New York, Mr Rouhani deplored ""ignorant, absurd and hateful rhetoric"" which was ""unfit to be heard at the United Nations"". In 2015, Iran reached its landmark nuclear deal with the P5+1 group of world powers - the US, UK, France, China and Russia plus Germany. Crippling economic sanctions on Iran were lifted after the International Atomic Energy Agency certified Iran had restricted sensitive nuclear activities. This video can not be played Which 'rogue states' are in Trump's new axis of evil? Iran says it has the right to nuclear energy and insists its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes only. The White House said at the time the deal would prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Speaking on Wednesday, the US envoy to the UN, Nikki Haley, said President Trump's remarks were ""not a clear signal that he plans to withdraw"". ""What it is, is a clear signal that he's not happy with the deal,""she told CBS News in an interview,external. Iran's uranium stockpile will be reduced by 98% to 300kg for 15 years There are two uranium enrichment facilities in Iran - Natanz and Fordo - where uranium hexafluoride gas is fed into centrifuges to separate out the most fissile isotope, U-235. Low-enriched uranium, which has a 3%-4% concentration of U-235, can be used to produce fuel for nuclear power plants, but it can also be enriched to the 90% needed to produce nuclear weapons. In July 2015, Iran had almost 20,000 centrifuges. Under theJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA),external, it will be limited to installing no more than 5,060 of the oldest and least efficient centrifuges at Natanz for 10 years. Iran's uranium stockpile will also be reduced by 98% to 300kg (660lbs) for 15 years. It must also keep its level of enrichment at 3.67%.

What can we learn from Russia's latest war games?,"What did the joint Belarus-Russian Zapad exercises reveal about President Putin's military strategy? For all theWestern concern about Russia's Zapad military exercises, they nonetheless offer a rare insight into developments in the Russian military at a time of significant change. As one of the leading Western analysts of Russian military developments, Roger McDermott, says, ""while Russia's armed forces' leadership remain very interested in military theory, they test and rehearse new approaches to warfare in strategic exercises"". Thus, he adds, ""exercises like Zapad offer glimpses into the real level of capability and demand careful and sober assessment for outsiders"". Russia launches huge war games Ukraine fears Russia will use exercises next week to invade How much of a threat does Russia pose, and to whom? Should Russia's new Armata T-14 tanks worry Nato? Russia claims this exercise falls below a treaty threshold of 13,000 soldiers that would require invitations to be issued to observer teams from other European nations. Western analysts place the numbers involved much higher. But even without full-scale observer teams, Zapad is being monitored closely by Nato countries using satellites and aircraft with radars that can reach into western Russia to get a clear sense of how Russian and Belarussian forces perform. These exercises come at an interesting moment. The Russian military is transitioning from the old Cold-War-style Red Army into a more modern and flexible force, capable of conducting combined operations across land, sea and air, tailored to a variety of potential scenarios - just like the more sophisticated of Nato armies. Igor Sutyagin, the senior research fellow for Russian studies at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) think tank in London, describes this as an attempt to create ""a lean, fully manned, combat-ready force, fully - or to the best possible extent - equipped with the up-to-date equipment [and] supported by agile rear infrastructure"". Russia insists that the Zapad exercise involves fewer than 13,000 soldiers, the threshold for triggering the need for international observers Despite Russia's victory in the brief Georgia war of 2008, the conflict showed up many shortcomings. And Western analysts will be watching the Zapad manoeuvres closely to see how the Russian General Staff is applying the lessons learned from more recent operations in Syria and eastern Ukraine. Dr Sutyagin told me: ""Both campaigns showed the general direction in which the Russian military is moving."" But how far has Russia's military transition really gone? And, crucially, will the Russian government continue to have sufficient funds to maintain its military modernisation plans? Dr Sutyagin says the transition has passed the middle of its long path, with organisational changes nearing their completion. However, there have been some indications of backsliding, with a return to the establishment of large army divisions which, he says, are ""hard to man, thus being to a large extent 'empty shells'"". The Armata is a highly automated tank replacing much of Russia's Soviet-era armour Rearmament with modern weaponry, necessary to close - or at the minimum, narrow - the technological gap between the Russian and the best Western military forces is also gaining momentum. But Dr Sutyagin says much of the new equipment budget may now be in question, ""as completion of the rearmament programme depends on both availability of finances and access to Western technologies, which is becoming harder"". In terms of the Zapad exercises themselves, there is much to look for. In theory these are defensive exercises, organising the defence of Russia and Belarus against an external attack. Russia used the Zapad exercises to showcase its Iskander-M missile This of course has not prevented some spectacular firepower demonstrations, not least the firing of an Iskander-M missile from a range in south-west Russia against a mock target in Kazakhstan - a flight of some 480km (300 miles). But in terms of the exercises themselves, what will Nato watchers be looking for? Mr McDermott says ""it will be worth examining the use of strike systems in the exercise"" because ""since the last Zapad in 2013, Moscow has magnified the role of conventional precision strike in its set of coercive tools"". In a ground-breaking study of Russia's use of what it calls ""high-precision weapons"" (precision-guided munitions or PGMs in the West) recently published by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, Mr McDermott and his co-author, Tor Bukkvoll, set out the history and development of Russia's interest in this category of weapon. Long-range cruise missiles, both air- and sea-launched, were first used by the Russians in combat in the conflict in Syria. Su-24 bombers at Hmeimim airbase: Russia sent dozens of warplanes to help President Assad's forces It is interesting that while much of the Western media discussion of PGMs rests upon their use as air-launched weapons in bombing campaigns, intended to increase accuracy and reduce the level of civilian casualties, in Russia the weapons are viewed in a rather different light. Mr McDermott's study concludes that ""for the foreseeable future, precision-guided munitions will mainly provide Russia with what in the Russian literature is called a 'pre-nuclear' deterrence capability"". Note the Iskander-M launch in this exercise. This is basically just another layer of deterrence in addition to the nuclear weapons, but is still seen as being of vital importance by the Russian military. Another area Mr McDermott highlights is Russia's growing electronic warfare (EW) capability. This has been on display during the fighting in eastern Ukraine and has impressed many Nato commanders. They fear that while their forces have had a lengthy gap in serious training for high-intensity conflict to fight counter-insurgency campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia has been steadily improving its forces. EW is a case in point. Nato countries are keen to deter any Russian move west In a recently published study for the International Centre for Defence and Security in Estonia, Mr McDermott said: ""Russia's growing technological advances in EW will allow its forces to jam, disrupt and interfere with Nato communications, radar and other sensor systems, unmanned aerial vehicles and other assets."" This capability, he said, risked ""negating advantages conferred on [Nato] by its technological edge"". ""Many of those systems,"" he said, ""are being introduced in units across all services stationed in Russia's Western Military District adjacent to Nato's borders."" Russia sees EW as a seamless whole, ranging from kinetic combat operations on the battlefield to missions in cyber-space and the information domain. Indeed this may be the area where the Russian military is breaking the ""newest"" ground, having as it does, a far less clearly defined sense of the boundary line between war and peace. It is in this ""grey area"" of warfare that Moscow is leveraging its abilities. As such it poses fundamental political and military challenges to Nato countries, in whose strategic outlook war and peace tend to assume a far more black and white character.

Reality Check: Can the UK be part of Europol after Brexit?,"The European Cybercrime Centre is just one part of Europol The UKgovernment's ""future partnership"" paper,externalmade a strong case for ""a bespoke relationship with Europol"" after the UK leaves the European Union. It looked at the scenarios of: no agreement being reached on future cooperation with Europol current cooperation being wound down before a new arrangement was put in place It said: ""Consideration would need to be given to ensuring that any ongoing investigations would not be affected in such a way that criminals might escape prosecution or vulnerable individuals might be rendered less safe."" And it would be difficult to find anyone in the EU who would disagree with the importance of fighting cross-border crime. Europol, the European Union's law enforcement organisation, was founded in 1999 and employs more than 1,000 people at a cost of about Â£100m a year. It is an EU-funded agency, and when the UK completes the Brexit process and no longer pays into the EU budget, it will cease to be a member. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, used an article in the French newspaper Le Monde to make it clear the UK could not continue to be a member. He said: ""The British defence minister will no longer be able to sit at the council of defence ministers, London will leave the European Defence Agency and Europol."" Inside Europol Prime Minister Theresa May has previously said she wants the UK to retain its security co-operation with Europol post-Brexit. And a number of countries that are not part of the EU, such as Norway, Switzerland and the US, have operational agreements with Europol that allow access to intelligence. But Europol itself say this does not equate to formal membership, which means these countries do not have a say over operations and decisions. Europol also points out that such agreements take a number of years to negotiate. Every EU member state, plus 14 other nations, has staff in the Europol headquarters in The Hague One precedent that might act as a future model is Denmark, an EU member but no longer in Europol. In December 2015, Denmark voted in areferendum against more integration of security operations. In May this year it formally left Europol,but an agreement was reached,externalthat allowed the Danish police and Europol to continue to share information and analysis. Denmark is able to participate in Europol board meetings, but it has only ""observer status"" and no decision-making rights. Could a similar agreement be made with the UK? Europol seems to think not. In a statement, it said: ""The agreement between both Denmark and Europol is based on the fact that Denmark is a full member of Schengen [group of countries that allow passport-free travel] and has implemented all EU data protection standards. ""It therefore allows for a sufficient level of co-operation, including the exchange of operational data and the deployment of liaison officers."" Prof Alan Woodward, a British cyber-crime expert and adviser to Europol, said the issue of the UK's future relationship with Europol needed to be resolved sooner rather than later. ""I very much hope that a solution is found to allow the UK to remain active participant with Europol - simply because it is in everybody's interest,"" he said. ""Europol is the best organisation to tackle cross-border law enforcement issues, especially in cyber-crime.""

'Raging Bull' boxer Jake LaMotta dies,"'The Bronx Bull' was willing to take a beating to get close to his opponent Jake LaMotta, the uncompromising fighter portrayed by Robert De Niro in Raging Bull, has died aged 95. The former world middleweight boxing champion died in a nursing home due to complications from pneumonia, his wife told US news site TMZ. Based on LaMotta's 1970 memoir, Raging Bull depicts an emotional fighter struggling with life outside the ring. The 1980 film, directed by Martin Scorsese, earned De Niro a Best Actor award at the Oscars. ""I just want people to know, he was a great, sweet, sensitive, strong, compelling man with a great sense of humour, with eyes that danced,"" Mrs LaMotta said. He often wore a hooded leopard-print robe into the ring His rough style made him one of the most famous fighters in boxing during the 1940s and 1950s Born on 10 July 1922 to Italian parents in the Bronx area of New York City, he took up boxing after being rejected by the US military due to a medical condition. Sports commentators praised his willingness to take a severe beating in order to get close enough to land the best punches on his opponent. His stamina in the ring, which he honed during a prison sentence, earned him the nickname ""The Bronx Bull"". One writer for the Associated Press described how he fought with ""blows bouncing off him like ball bearings off a battleship"". Allow Twitter content?

LaMotta first won national recognition two years after landing on the professional boxing circuit, when he handed Sugar Ray Robinson his first ever defeat in 1943. His rough style, and strong chin, made him one of the most famous fighters in boxing during the 1940s and 1950s at a time when boxing was one of the nation's most popular sports. After resisting Mafia efforts to control him, he later admitted to intentionally losing a fight at the behest of mobsters in 1947, causing him to suffer a suspension from the sport. According tothe International Boxing Hall of Fame,external, his career record was 83 wins, 19 losses, 4 draws, and 30 knockouts. After retiring from the ring in 1954, he went on to act in several films, also touring as a stand-up comedian. ""The truth of the matter?"" hetold the Chicago Sun-Times,externalin 1996. ""The punches never hurt me. ""My nose was broken six times, my hands six times, a few fractured ribs. Fifty stitches over my eyes. But the only place I got hurt was out of the ring."" In 1949 LaMotta defeated Robert Villemain after a 12-round bout in Madison Square Garden, New York City. In the lead up to the filming for Raging Bull, LaMotta spent nearly a year personally training De Niro to box in a New York City gym,according to ESPN,external. The film's stark style may have originated in LaMotta's own autobiography, in which he wrote: ""Sometimes, at night, when I think back, I feel like I'm looking at an old black-and-white movie of myself. ""Not a good movie, either, jerky, with gaps in it, a string of poorly lit sequences, some of them with no beginning and some with no end. No musical score..."" After the film debuted, he expressed puzzlement as to why he had allowed his life to be depicted, and even worked on set as a consultant. ""When I saw the film I was upset. I kind of look bad in it,"" he told a reviewer. ""Then I realised it was true. That's the way it was... It's not the way I am now, but the way I was then.""

Take Me Out contestant 'hanged himself',"A Take Me Out contestant who lost his job because he took four days off to film the TV show later hanged himself, an inquest has heard. Charlie Watkins, 22, went on the dating show after saying he was disappointed he had been unlucky in love during his three years at the University of York. The criminology graduate lost his job at York Chocolate Story due to the filming commitments, the inquest heard. North Yorkshire Coroner Rob Turnbull concluded his death was suicide. Mr Watkins' housemate Swabir Abdul Rahmam, 24, told the inquest: ""He really loved his job at the chocolate factory, he was happy. ""But when he went to go film for the Take Me Out TV programme, he lost his job - they terminated his contract."" Mr Watkins' family and friends told the inquest he had self-harmed previously and taken anti-depressant medication in the past. But Mr Rahmam said those days were behind him and at the time ""he was cheerful and happy"". After graduating in June 2016, Mr Watkins, from Colchester in Essex, posted on social media: ""My one regret is not finding that one woman for me to spend the rest of my life with."" He also posted a picture on his Facebook account of the show's application form as he filled it in. He was then called up to join match-making host Paddy McGuinness to shoot scenes in November 2016 - and won a date. Mr Watkins' date was broadcast in April as the pair jetted off to the show's fictional Isle of Fernando's - and he said the date ""went really well"". The inquest heard he had spent the day before his death drinking with his brother in Leeds before enjoying a charity dinner with friends in York. He was found dead the following evening on 13 March after his flatmates broke down his bedroom door. The show was broadcast on 23 April after ITV was granted the go-ahead from his family. McGuinness, 43, tweeted at the time: ""Tonight's Take Me Out is in memory of Charlie. A fantastic lad who I'm sure will be greatly missed by his wonderful friends and family. RIP.""

Maria makes landfall in Puerto Rico,"This video can not be played Where has Hurricane Maria hit? Hurricane Maria, the devastating storm pushing north-west through the Caribbean, is battering Puerto Rico. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it made landfall in Yabucoa in the east of the US territory, and now has strong winds of 140 mph (225 km/h). The US territory's governor said damage was inevitable as driving rain and winds hit the Puerto Rican capital. On the island of Dominica, which was badly affected on Monday, seven people are reported to have been killed. Aerial footage over the island shows flattened houses and the death toll on Dominica is likely to rise, with details remaining scant as communication links are down. On Tuesday, Maria ploughed through St Croix in the US Virgin Islands, home to around 55,000 people. Shortly before making landfall in Puerto Rico, the storm was downgraded from category five to category four by the NHC. Footage posted on social media showed a torrent of water pouring through the streets of Guayama on the island's south coast. Palm trees were bent double in Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan In San Juan, palm trees were bent double and electricity cables were blown loose as debris was thrown through the air. As of 11:00 local time (1500 GMT) on Wednesday, the eye of the storm was around 20 miles (32km) west of San Juan. Up to 90% of island residents were without electricity, El Nuevo Dia newspaper quoted Governor Ricardo Rossello as saying. Mr Rossello earlier told the island's 3.5 million people to seek shelter. He warned residents to prepare for ""the worst storm of the last century"" as about 500 shelters were made available to accommodate tens of thousands of people. ""God is with us; we are stronger than any hurricane,""Mr Rossello said,external. ""Together we will rise again."" Puerto Rico has experienced just one category five storm since 1851 - the Okeechobee Hurricane in 1928. PM's Facebook posts detail storm drama Hurricane Maria: What to do before, during and after This video can not be played Hurricane Maria brought high winds to Guadeloupe Maria is the second storm of this strength to hit the Caribbean this hurricane season - the first being category five Irma earlier in September. Maria began moving roughly along the same track as Irma. Officials in Puerto Rico feared the debris left by Irma could prove extremely dangerous in the high winds. There were also concerns that heavy rain could cause landslides in some places, and that a predicted storm surge of up to 9ft (2.7m) could swamp low-lying areas, with ""destructive waves"" expected to pummel the coast. The NHC also warned that Maria could deliver several tornadoes over Puerto Rico on Wednesday. By Will Grant in San Juan People across Puerto Rico are just trying to ride out this storm as best they can now. From where we're hunkered down, the powerful winds are creating an incredible noise, rattling storm shutters and doors almost off their hinges. The electricity is out in our hotel and it is too dark and too dangerous to try to see what is happening outside. Like millions of others, we have little choice at present except to stay put and wait in the darkness for the huge hurricane to pass. The difficulty is, it is moving slowly - giving Maria more time to unleash its power on the island and its infrastructure. Some projections have shown the storm covering the entire island in the coming hours, hitting Puerto Rico with sustained hurricane force winds and large amounts of rainfall. Hurricane Maria is now the strongest storm to make landfall on the island in almost a century. Most are just praying that when they can eventually emerge from their places of shelter, they and their loved ones are safe and that the damage hasn't been too extensive. Are you in an area affected by Hurricane Maria? Share your experience:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Hurricane Maria early on Tuesday On Wednesday an adviser to Dominica's Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, Hartley Henry, said the full extent of the storm's damage was not yet known and that the death toll was likely to rise. ""It's difficult to determine the level of fatalities but so far seven are confirmed as a direct result of the hurricane,"" he said. As a result of the strong winds, roofs had been ripped from dozens of buildings. ""The main general hospital took a beating,"" Mr Henry said, adding: ""Patient care has been compromised."" The first aerial footage of the island confirms ""significant damage"", Ronald Jackson of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency said. This video can not be played First aerial footage from Dominica It shows flattened buildings, rivers which have burst their banks and a flooded runway. Dominica has been virtually cut off with telecommunications severed, but local amateur radio operators say more than 90% of properties have been damaged. The former British colony, which has a population of 72,000 and is less than 50km long and 25km wide, escaped Hurricane Irma two weeks ago. But on Monday the eye of the new category five storm passed directly over. The last communication from the island was from Mr Skerrit just as the storm struck late on Monday, when he said in aFacebook post,externalthat the winds had swept away the roofs of ""almost every person I have spoken to or otherwise made contact with"". This video can not be played Hurricane Maria gathers strength again The storm arrived at 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Wednesday in St Croix, where roughly half the US Virgin Islands' residents live. On Monday, the French territory of Martinique was hit by power cuts but escaped serious damage. This video can not be played Footage from Martinique shows early devastating winds There was flooding in the French territory of Guadeloupe, where one person was killed by a falling tree and another died on the seafront. At least two others were missing after their ship sank near Desirade, the easternmost island in the archipelago. About 80,000 homes lost power in Guadeloupe. There are reports of flooding, mudslides and power outages in parts of St Lucia. Some islands in Maria's path escaped the worst of Hurricane Irma and have been used as bases to distribute relief to places that were not so fortunate. Now there are concerns that this work could be jeopardised if they are badly hit, too. Puerto Ricans have been preparing in the capital, San Juan Guadeloupe has been a bridgehead for aid going to Irma-hit French territories, while Puerto Rico has also been offering crucial assistance to its neighbours.

Two seriously injured in gas explosion,"One eyewitness said they saw a tank lift off the floor and go through a fence Two men have been taken to hospital with serious injuries after a gas explosion at an industrial estate. Emergency services were called to Bio Dynamic, in Colwick, Nottingham, shortly after 10:00 BST. The fire service said there had been a gas explosion and a tank had collapsed but there was no fire. The company, which converts food waste into energy, said the ""accident was not as a result of any failure in the normal operation of our plant"". More on this and other stories from the East Midlands Paul Allen, who was delivering to the site when it happened, told the BBC: ""We heard a boom and apparently, well from what I can see anyway, a 30ft tank which was holding gas has exploded and is now laying across the road. ""Apparently, from eyewitnesses, it lifted it about 10ft off the floor. ""It must have been a hell of an explosion to lift a tank off the floor."" The fire service said a tanker had ""collapsed"" Bob Winter, medical director for East Midlands Ambulance Service, said paramedics specially trained to deal with major incidents were dispatched. ""We treated two patients on scene,"" he said. ""Both had suffered serious injury and were taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham by ambulance.""

Bin strike halted after court ruling,"Strike action began on 30 June in a row over job losses Birmingham's bin strike has been suspended after the High Court granted an interim injunction against the council's bid to make workers redundant. A trial will take place to determine if the council acted unlawfully in issuing redundancy notices. Workers have been on strike since 30 June. Union members asked the court to grant the order against the council's bid to lose staff and change working patterns. In a statement the council said it accepted the ruling. The hearing in London on Wednesday centred on former council leader John Clancy's actions after he reneged on a deal to keep workers' jobs. Hequit last weekamid widespread criticism of his U-turn. Referring to Mr Clancy and his officers, Mr Justice Fraser said: ""Neither party comes out of this sorry saga with any credit at all - I could use the words remarkable, extraordinary and more."" The cost of the Birmingham bin strikes Why are refuse workers striking? Improvement panel to remain in place Conciliation service Acas said on 16 August the council had accepted the workers' case and restored the jobs of grade three workers, who are responsible for safety at the back of refuse vehicles. However, a council report said the deal struck by Unite and the council was unaffordable. The Unite union claims restructuring plans threaten the jobs of more than 120 staff, while the council says plans will modernise the service and save Â£5m a year. Refuse workers were at the High Court for the two-day hearing Several refuse workers were at the hearing, one hailed the judge's decision as ""fantastic"" and a ""massive victory"". The judge said Mr Clancy's ""motivation was difficult to fathom"". Mr Fraser read out an email sent on 15 August from the interim chief executive Stella Manzie to ex-leader Mr Clancy saying the council could not look weak and ""as if it's being walked over"". Documents make clear there was an internal rift at the council, Mr Fraser said. A Birmingham City Council spokesperson said: ""The council wants to offer the best possible refuse service for citizens and wants to work with Unite and all the other unions to do this. ""We remain committed to resolving the dispute as quickly as possible and we hope Unite will support us in doing this."" Unite assistant general secretary Howard Beckett said refuse workers would now return to a full working day. ""As part of the ruling Unite will suspend its industrial action until the matter is put before a full court hearing at a later date,"" he said. The trial is likely to last five days and will be scheduled for the end of November. However, Judge Fraser urged all parties to come to an agreement before the prospect of an ""expensive trial"". The union is also repeating its calls for Ms Manzie, the authority's interim chief executive, to stand down. Make no mistake - today's High Court judgement to temporarily stop 106 binmen losing their jobs is a huge blow to Birmingham City Council. Mr Justice Fraser couldn't have been clearer in his scathing remarks about the ""sorry saga"" that led to this action. He dismissed the council's argument that Mr Clancy had no authority to make a deal at ACAS with Unite, saying he was more than satisfied there's enough evidence of what was referred to in court as the 'Clancy Agreement' to be tested at a full trial. He also dismissed a submission by Birmingham City Council's legal team that a trial would not be in the public interest. However, he did urge all parties to come to some kind of agreement before the prospect of an expensive five-day trial in November. Strike action has been suspended until the ""matter is put before court"" 27 June: Cabinet approves plans to modernise collection service 30 June: First day of strike action 3, 11, 19 and 27 July and 4 August: Two-hour stoppages take place 18 July: Unite announces action will continue until September after talks break down with the council 28 July: Daily two-hour stoppages are increased to three hours 11 August: Action is stepped up to three-hour stoppages spaced across the shift 16 August: Strike action is suspended amid negotiations between Unite and the city council 24 August: A report to Birmingham's cabinet warns the deal that ended the strike is unaffordable. A meeting due to be held is deferred until 1 September 31 August: The council announces it is issuing redundancy notices. Unite says the move is a ""deeply provocative act"" and warns workers are likely to resume strikes 1 September: Workers return to picket lines as the strike resumes. The union warns action could continue until the end of the year and says members will be balloted for further action 11 September: John Clancy resigns as city council leader following criticism of his handling of industrial action by refuse workers 20 September: High Court grants an interim injunction against the council's bid to make workers redundant.

Two more arrested over Tube bomb attack,"This video can not be played Newport eyewitness saw house raided and men arrested Two men have been arrested in south Wales over Friday's terror attack on a London Underground train, bringing the total number held to five. A 48-year-old man and a 30-year-old man were detained under the Terrorism Act in the early hours, after a search at an address in Newport. Police are still searching there, and at a second address in the city. Thirty people were injured when a homemade bomb partially exploded on a rush-hour Tube train at Parsons Green. The bomb - which went off in south-west London at 08:20 BST on Friday, causing burns to a number of people - had been left in a Lidl bag. A woman, who witnessed the latest arrests being made, said she had seen one man in handcuffs being led out of a house and into a marked police car at about 5:30 BST. About an hour later, a man in a hoodie on the street was put into the back of a police van, she told the BBC. The woman, who did not want to be named, said the whole operation had been carried out with very little fuss, and none of the police appeared to have been armed. Neighbours said the address being searched is used to house asylum seekers or refugees. The other arrests so far in the investigation were of: A 25-year-old man in Newport on Tuesday evening An 18-year-old man at Dover port on Saturday. The BBC has learnt he had previously been referred to an anti-extremist programme A 21-year-old man in Hounslow, west London, also on Saturday This video can not be played A man was arrested in Newport on Tuesday in connection with the attack Commander Dean Haydon, head of the Metropolitan Police counter terrorism command, said: ""This continues to be a fast-moving investigation. ""A significant amount of activity has taken place since the attack on Friday. ""Detectives are carrying out extensive inquiries to determine the full facts behind the attack."" Further searches are continuing at two addresses in Surrey and are expected to last some days, the police said. Investigators search rubbish bins in Newport for evidence BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said the latest arrests suggested detectives were developing ""an idea of a network"" of people. They might not have planned any kind of terrorist attack but were acquaintances, lived together or were family members, he said. The police were keen to get ""very close"" to people of interest, he explained, pointing out that in previous investigations, friends, acquaintances and relatives were arrested early, held for quite a long time and then released. The 18-year-old arrested man is thought to have lived in a foster home owned by Ronald and Penelope Jones, in Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey. He is thought to have moved to the UK from Iraq aged 15 when his parents died. The BBC has learnt that he had been referred to an anti-extremist programme before his arrest. It is not known who made the referral and when, or how serious the concerns were. A senior councillor in Sunbury has called for an independent inquiry into whether the 18-year-old had been referred to Prevent, the government's flagship anti-extremist programme. Spelthorne council's Ian Harvey said: ""I want an independent inquiry to make sure everything was handled properly and that there wasn't any danger to the community. ""We need to know that if any issues were flagged up, all the necessary action was taken."" Syrian-born Yahyah Farroukh is believed to be the 21-year-old suspect arrested by police The 21-year-old man, also arrested on Saturday, is believed to be Syrian-born Yahyah Farroukh. Mr Farroukh worked at Aladdins chicken shop in Hounslow, and has been described as a former foster child who had lived in the Jones's house. Mr Farroukh posted a picture on his Instagram page in May this year with a suitcase on Cavendish Road, Sunbury, almost directly outside the Jones's house.

Huge quake kills more than 200 in Mexico,"This video can not be played Moments after the earthquake hit A strong earthquake has struck central Mexico, killing more than 200 people and toppling dozens of buildings in the capital, Mexico City. At least 30 people, mostly children, died after a school collapsed in the capital, local media report. The 7.1 magnitude quake also caused major damage in neighbouring states. It struck shortly after many people had taken part in an earthquake drill, exactly 32 years after a quake killed thousands in Mexico City. The country is prone to earthquakes and earlier this month an8.1 magnitude tremorin the south left at least 90 people dead. Though it struck a similar region, Tuesday's earthquake does not appear to be connected with the quake on 7 September, which was at least 30 times more energetic, the BBC's Jonathan Amoswrites. The epicentre of the latest quake was near Atencingo in Puebla state, about 120km (75 miles) from Mexico City, with a depth of 51km, the US Geological Survey says. The prolonged tremor hit at 13:14 local time (18:14 GMT) on Tuesday and sent thousands of residents into the streets. Why did only some buildings collapse? The race to help after the quake An earlier death toll of nearly 250 was lowered to 217 by the country's national co-ordinator for civil protection: Morelos state: 71 dead Puebla state: 43 dead Mexico City: 86 dead Mexico state: 12 dead Guerrero: 4 dead Oaxaca: 1 As many as 37 people - 32 children and five adults - died when the Enrique RÃ©bsamen elementary school collapsed in Mexico City's southern Coapa district, Efe news agency reports, quoting local media. According to Mexican news site Reforma, 30 bodies have been found at the school and 22 people are missing. Elsewhere, 15 people were killed when a church near Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano collapsed during Mass, Puebla's governor is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. The volcano itself had a small eruption as a result of the tremor. Rescuers celebrated as three people were pulled alive from the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school overnight - but many are still feared trapped Alfredo del Mazo Maza, governor of the State of Mexico, said schools would be closed on Wednesday. He also ordered all public transport to operate services for free so that people could travel home. Emergency workers, aided by military personnel and volunteers, have been working through the night in the search for people trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. At the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school, three people were rescued at about midnight, Reuters reports, adding that one child trapped under the debris was saved after oxygen was supplied through a tube. At least 209 schools were affected by the quake, 15 of which have suffered severe damage, Mexico's Secretariat of Public Education says. Buildings at 44 locations collapsed or were badly damaged, Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera told TV network Televisa. These are said to include a six-storey block of flats, a supermarket and a factory. Volunteers worked frantically to find survivors beneath the rubble About two million people in the capital were left without electricity and phone lines were down. Officials warned residents not to smoke on the streets as gas mains could have been ruptured. Some 70% of the electricity supply which went down has now been restored, Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission said. Live updates In pictures: Huge earthquake Are Mexico's two earthquakes connected? In a televised address, the president said an emergency had been declared for the affected areas and the military had been drafted in to help with the response. He also urged residents whose properties were structurally sound to remain in their homes where possible to allow emergency services and those helping with rescue efforts to clear the streets. Across Mexico City, teams of rescue workers and volunteers clawed through the rubble with picks, shovels and their bare hands. Rescuers and volunteers tried to find survivors under the debris of collapsed buildings The rescue operation continued into the night ""My wife is there. I haven't been able to communicate with her,"" Juan Jesus Garcia, 33, told Reuters, choking back tears next to a collapsed building. ""She is not answering and now they are telling us we have to turn off our mobile phones because there is a gas leak."" Have you been affected by the earthquake? If it is safe to do so you can email your story tohaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external This video can not be played The strong quake was felt in the capital, Mexico City Jennifer Swaddle, a teacher at the British International School in Mexico City, told the BBC that part of her classroom had collapsed. ""As we were leaving, the outside of my classroom wall fell, so there was a big pile of rubble. Luckily, fantastically, nobody was hurt, but it was incredibly frightening,"" she said. History of deadly earthquakes Can earthquakes be predicted? An earthquake drill was being held in Mexico City on Tuesday to mark the 32nd anniversary of a magnitude 8 quake that killed up to 10,000 people and left 30,000 others injured. The severe tremor caused serious damage to Mexico City and its surrounding areas, with more than 400 buildings collapsed and thousands more damaged. Correspondents say that residents may have mistaken earthquake alarms for part of the day of drills in the wake of the 1985 quake. Mexico City is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with more than 20 million people living in the metropolitan area. Mexico is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, sitting on top of three of the Earth's largest tectonic plates - the North American, Cocos and Pacific plates. The latest tremor occurred near the boundary between the North American and Cocos plates, where the latter slides beneath the former. According to theUS Geological Survey,external, the country has seen 19 earthquakes of at least 6.5 magnitude within 155 miles of the epicentre of Tuesday's quake over the past century. Foreign leaders sent messages of support to Mexico as the scale of the disaster became clear: US President Donald Trump, who has courted controversy with his plans for a border wall with Mexico, tweeted: ""God bless the people of Mexico City. We are with you and will be there for you"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also tweeted his support following the ""devastating news"" Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis, in New York for the UN General Assembly, expressed his ""solidarity"" with the Mexican people Pope Francis said his thoughts and prayers were with the families of those who had lost loved ones in the ""devastating"" quake. ""In this moment of pain I want to express my closeness and my prayer to all of the beloved Mexican population,"" the pontiff said at the Vatican It is feared the death toll will rise further The Mexican government earlier issued the following guidance on what to do if a quake strikes in the country: stay calm find the evacuation route and meeting point stay away from windows and objects that may fall in case of emergency call 911 do not use lifts The UK Foreign Office hassaid,externalthat those travelling to Mexico should follow the advice of the local authorities.

Spain steps up raids to halt Catalan vote,"This video can not be played Catalonia's separatist government is defying a Constitutional Court order to halt the 1 October vote Spanish police have detained 14 Catalan officials and raided regional government ministries involved in organising an independence vote declared illegal by Spain's government. Tensions were already high before Josep Maria JovÃ©, number two in the Catalan vice-presidency, and others were held. Thousands of Catalans took to the streets in protest and the region's president complained of a power grab. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the state had been forced to act. The region's separatist government is defying an order by Spain's Constitutional Court to suspend the 1 October referendum law passed by the Catalan parliament last month. A sea of protesters filled the Gran Via and other streets as police searched the Catalan economy ministry Wednesday's operation targeting over 40 ministries and offices as well as three private companies was a dramatic intensification of Spain's attempt to stop the vote taking place. An estimated 10 million ballot papers were found in a warehouse outside Barcelona, reports said. There were scattered protests outside a number of buildings, but the biggest was outside the Catalan economy ministry in the heart of Barcelona. Scuffles were reported as police tried to remove documents from the foreign affairs building. In a separate move Spain's finance minister, CristÃ³bal Montoro, announced the national government was now set to take control of the Catalan regional budget, so that the state would pay for essential public services, rather than transfer the money to Barcelona. After an emergency cabinet meeting Catalan President Carles Puigdemont accused the Madrid government of ""de facto"" suspending the region's autonomy and imposing a state of emergency. Eleven days ahead of the planned vote on 1 October, the national government has made its biggest move yet to stop it happening. Spain did not stop an earlier vote taking place in November 2014, but this time the Catalan leadership plans a declaration of independence within 48 hours of a Yes vote. Scuffles broke out on Tuesday when demonstrators in Terrassa tried to stop a raid targeting voting material Mr Rajoy said the regional government had been warned that they were destroying Spain's national sovereignty, ""There's no democratic state in the world that would accept what these people are planning,"" he said. He urged the Catalan president to comply with the law and put his secessionist challenge into ""reverse gear"". Spain plays cat and mouse as Catalan vote looms Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Spain poised to seize Catalan finances Several ministries in Barcelona were raided on Wednesday, including the economy, foreign affairs, telecoms, social affairs and presidency buildings. Among those detained were officials from the economy ministry, run by Catalan Vice-President Oriol Junqueras, as well as figures from other departments. Those held are suspected of misappropriating funds for the vote and misusing confidential data on taxpayers. Police were searching for computer equipment and any documentation linked to the planned vote. The day before, they seized some 45,000 envelopes with the Catalan government's logo from a private delivery company in Terrassa, north-west of Barcelona. On Friday, the Spanish finance minister gave Oriol Junqueras a deadline to call off the vote or see funding for essential services in Catalonia taken over by Madrid. A letter was sent to Mr Junqueras late on Tuesday reminding him the deadline had passed. By James Badcock, BBC News, Madrid The spate of raids and arrests in Barcelona is a clear escalation by the Spanish state as it tries to deactivate the planned referendum. Chanting ""We will vote"", protesters blocked the Gran Via in Barcelona outside the Catalan economy ministry Previous raids have targeted sites suspected of holding electoral material. Arresting officials from an elected government risks further polarising Catalan society between those who want independence and those who do not. Although the Catalan independence movement has so far been peaceful, raids on government premises carried out by a Spanish militarised police force, the Guardia Civil, create uncomfortable echoes of the Franco dictatorship. Demonstrators are already taking to the streets to protect their ""right to decide"". And there is a risk of clashes between pro-independence activists and police forces with orders to stop the vote. As the Catalan president condemned Spain's ""anti-democratic and totalitarian actions"", another Catalan leader called for peaceful resistance to protect the buildings as the regional government met in emergency session. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont said the Spanish leadership had crossed a red line ""The time has come - let's resist peacefully; let's come out and defend our institutions,"" the president of the Catalan National Assembly, Jordi SÃ¡nchez, tweeted. He did not have to wait long. Protesters gathered outside the economy ministry as the police operation took place, chanting ""We will vote"" and surrounding the Guardia Civil cars stationed outside. The centre of Barcelona soon became a sea of Catalan flags and the city's renowned football club threw its weight behind the protests,condemning any act,externalthat threatened freedom of speech and self-determination. The Catalan vice-president accused Spanish police of attacking the region's institutions and therefore its citizens too. ""We will not allow it,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

In Madrid, Catalan separatist MP Gabriel RufiÃ¡n told the prime minister in parliament he should take his ""dirty hands"" off Catalonia's institutions, Efe news agency reported. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau warned that if Mr Rajoy ""persists with this repressive strategy, he'll find diverse, pro-Catalan voices more united than ever defending rights and freedom"". Some 7.5 million people live in Spain's well-off north-eastern region and a majority are thought to be in favour of having a vote. However,one survey,externalcommissioned by the Catalan government in July suggested that 41% of voters backed independence while 49% were opposed. Catalan nationalism has been stirred by Spain's economic crisis. While Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest regions, Catalans argue they pay more into the national budget than they get back. And a 2010 Constitutional Court ruling fuelled nationalist anger when it set limits on Catalan claims to nationhood. In the non-binding 2014 vote, branded illegal by the Madrid government, just 2.2 million voters out of a potential 5.4 million turned out. Officials said 80% of them backed independence.

Young spend 'a quarter of pay' on housing,"Young people are also living in smaller spaces, says the report Young people in Britain are spending three times more on housing than their grandparents did, according to the Resolution Foundation think tank. They also have to cope with less space and longer commutes to get to work. While their parents typically bought their own home in their 30s, young people will soon have to wait until their 40s. As a result, millennials are at the sharp end of Britain's ""housing catastrophe"", the report claims. Those now in their 70s and 80s spent just 7% of their annual income on housing at the age of 30, it says. The baby-boom generation - now in its 50s and 60s - spent 17% of income at the same age. Have baby-boomers stolen the family silver? Young suffer as pensioners prosper However, millennials - those now in their 20s and 30s - spend 23% of everything they earn on housing costs. The Resolution Foundation says youngsters are also living in smaller houses. Since 1996, the average floor space occupied by someone under 45 has fallen by 4%. For those over that age, floor space has grown by 2%. By the time the millennials reach the age of 40, they will each be spending an extra 64 hours a year commuting to work, compared with their parents, as they struggle to find housing they can afford. ""Britain's housing catastrophe has been 50 years in the making, but while its effects are widespread, it is millennials who are truly at the sharp end,"" said Lindsay Judge, one of the report's authors. ""The big danger today is that young people are having to settle for lower quality, longer commutes and less security in order to afford a place to live, despite spending a record share of their income of housing."" The Foundation - which campaigns for higher living standards - is calling on all the political parties to address the housing crisis.

More than 200 die in huge Mexico quake,"This video can not be played Moments after the earthquake hit A strong earthquake has struck central Mexico, killing more than 200 people and toppling dozens of buildings in the capital, Mexico City. At least 30 people, mostly children, died after a school collapsed in the capital, local media report. The 7.1 magnitude quake also caused major damage in neighbouring states. It struck shortly after many people had taken part in an earthquake drill, exactly 32 years after a quake killed thousands in Mexico City. The country is prone to earthquakes and earlier this month an8.1 magnitude tremorin the south left at least 90 people dead. Though it struck a similar region, Tuesday's earthquake does not appear to be connected with the quake on 7 September, which was at least 30 times more energetic, the BBC's Jonathan Amoswrites. The epicentre of the latest quake was near Atencingo in Puebla state, about 120km (75 miles) from Mexico City, with a depth of 51km, the US Geological Survey says. The prolonged tremor hit at 13:14 local time (18:14 GMT) on Tuesday and sent thousands of residents into the streets. Why did only some buildings collapse? The race to help after the quake An earlier death toll of nearly 250 was lowered to 217 by the country's national co-ordinator for civil protection: Morelos state: 71 dead Puebla state: 43 dead Mexico City: 86 dead Mexico state: 12 dead Guerrero: 4 dead Oaxaca: 1 As many as 37 people - 32 children and five adults - died when the Enrique RÃ©bsamen elementary school collapsed in Mexico City's southern Coapa district, Efe news agency reports, quoting local media. According to Mexican news site Reforma, 30 bodies have been found at the school and 22 people are missing. Elsewhere, 15 people were killed when a church near Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano collapsed during Mass, Puebla's governor is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. The volcano itself had a small eruption as a result of the tremor. Rescuers celebrated as three people were pulled alive from the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school overnight - but many are still feared trapped Alfredo del Mazo Maza, governor of the State of Mexico, said schools would be closed on Wednesday. He also ordered all public transport to operate services for free so that people could travel home. Emergency workers, aided by military personnel and volunteers, have been working through the night in the search for people trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. At the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school, three people were rescued at about midnight, Reuters reports, adding that one child trapped under the debris was saved after oxygen was supplied through a tube. At least 209 schools were affected by the quake, 15 of which have suffered severe damage, Mexico's Secretariat of Public Education says. Buildings at 44 locations collapsed or were badly damaged, Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera told TV network Televisa. These are said to include a six-storey block of flats, a supermarket and a factory. Volunteers worked frantically to find survivors beneath the rubble About two million people in the capital were left without electricity and phone lines were down. Officials warned residents not to smoke on the streets as gas mains could have been ruptured. Some 70% of the electricity supply which went down has now been restored, Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission said. Live updates In pictures: Huge earthquake Are Mexico's two earthquakes connected? In a televised address, the president said an emergency had been declared for the affected areas and the military had been drafted in to help with the response. He also urged residents whose properties were structurally sound to remain in their homes where possible to allow emergency services and those helping with rescue efforts to clear the streets. Across Mexico City, teams of rescue workers and volunteers clawed through the rubble with picks, shovels and their bare hands. Rescuers and volunteers tried to find survivors under the debris of collapsed buildings The rescue operation continued into the night ""My wife is there. I haven't been able to communicate with her,"" Juan Jesus Garcia, 33, told Reuters, choking back tears next to a collapsed building. ""She is not answering and now they are telling us we have to turn off our mobile phones because there is a gas leak."" Have you been affected by the earthquake? If it is safe to do so you can email your story tohaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external This video can not be played The strong quake was felt in the capital, Mexico City Jennifer Swaddle, a teacher at the British International School in Mexico City, told the BBC that part of her classroom had collapsed. ""As we were leaving, the outside of my classroom wall fell, so there was a big pile of rubble. Luckily, fantastically, nobody was hurt, but it was incredibly frightening,"" she said. History of deadly earthquakes Can earthquakes be predicted? An earthquake drill was being held in Mexico City on Tuesday to mark the 32nd anniversary of a magnitude 8 quake that killed up to 10,000 people and left 30,000 others injured. The severe tremor caused serious damage to Mexico City and its surrounding areas, with more than 400 buildings collapsed and thousands more damaged. Correspondents say that residents may have mistaken earthquake alarms for part of the day of drills in the wake of the 1985 quake. Mexico City is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with more than 20 million people living in the metropolitan area. Mexico is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, sitting on top of three of the Earth's largest tectonic plates - the North American, Cocos and Pacific plates. The latest tremor occurred near the boundary between the North American and Cocos plates, where the latter slides beneath the former. According to theUS Geological Survey,external, the country has seen 19 earthquakes of at least 6.5 magnitude within 155 miles of the epicentre of Tuesday's quake over the past century. Foreign leaders sent messages of support to Mexico as the scale of the disaster became clear: US President Donald Trump, who has courted controversy with his plans for a border wall with Mexico, tweeted: ""God bless the people of Mexico City. We are with you and will be there for you"" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also tweeted his support following the ""devastating news"" Costa Rican President Luis Guillermo Solis, in New York for the UN General Assembly, expressed his ""solidarity"" with the Mexican people Pope Francis said his thoughts and prayers were with the families of those who had lost loved ones in the ""devastating"" quake. ""In this moment of pain I want to express my closeness and my prayer to all of the beloved Mexican population,"" the pontiff said at the Vatican It is feared the death toll will rise further The Mexican government earlier issued the following guidance on what to do if a quake strikes in the country: stay calm find the evacuation route and meeting point stay away from windows and objects that may fall in case of emergency call 911 do not use lifts The UK Foreign Office hassaid,externalthat those travelling to Mexico should follow the advice of the local authorities.

Trump's UN 'hate speech' criticised,"This video can not be played Trump's UN audience agrees on one thing about his speech Donald Trump's first major speech at the United Nations has been denounced by some of the member nations he singled out for criticism. The US president included Iran among ""a small group of rogue regimes"", and said the US would ""totally destroy"" North Korea if forced to do so. Iran's foreign minister said: ""Trump's ignorant hate speech belongs in medieval times"", and not the UN. North Korea has yet to respond to the president's threat of destruction. Mr Trump's speech laid out a vision for a world filled with sovereign states which worked for the betterment of their citizens - but he spent large portions targeting what he called ""rogue nations"" which are ""the scourge of our planet today"".

Washington has repeatedly warned North Korea over its weapons tests, which violate UN Security Council resolutions. On Tuesday, Mr Trump criticised North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, saying: ""Rocket man is on a suicide mission."" ""If [the US] is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea,""  he added. Reuters news agency said one audience member covered his face with his hands, and that loud, startled murmurs filled the hall in response. Swedish Foreign Minister Margot Wallstrom, who was observed crossing her arms, told the BBC: ""It was the wrong speech, at the wrong time, to the wrong audience."" This video can not be played Which 'rogue states' are in Trump's new axis of evil? The American leader called on ""the righteous many"" to confront ""the wicked few"". In hisspeech,external, he called Iran ""a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy"" whose ""chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos"". He called the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers ""one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into"". By BBC Monitoring Iranian media have followed the lead of Foreign Minister Javad Zarif in denouncing President Trump's remarks. Commentators on the official TV news channel IRINN compared Mr Trump's speech to the bizarre performance of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at the same podium in 2009. They accused him of ""breaking diplomatic convention"" in an address ""full of contradictions"". IRINN broadcast the entire speech live but its translator omitted Trump's critical remarks on Iran, which prompted comment on social media. Tehran MP Mahmudi Sadeqi wrote on Twitter: ""The poor translator suffered so much trying to distort and censure Trump's baseless remarks simultaneously on IRINN!!"" Iranian TV also reported Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's description of Mr Trump as a ""new Hitler"". Pro-reform dailies heaped scorn on what the newspaper Ebtekar called the US president's ""repetitive and baseless claims"". The paper hoped that Europe would ""rein him in"", while Qanoon dubbed him a ""villain at the UN"". All eyes will now be on Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, who will address the UN General Assembly later today. This video can not be played Trump: 'Rocket Man's suicide mission' Mr Trump also targeted Venezuela, calling its government a corrupt ""socialist dictatorship"" - and warned that the US was prepared to take action against it. Venezuela's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza rejected what he called ""threats"". ""Trump is not the president of the world... he can not even manage his own government,"" he said. Clockwise from top left: Representatives from Israel, Syria, Iran, and Saudi Arabia listen to Mr Trump's speech Bolivian President Evo Morales - an ally of the Venezuelan government - tweeted: ""I am not surprised that a multi-millionaire like Trump attacks socialism. Our struggle will always be ideological and pragmatic."" French President Emmanuel Macron, also speaking to the General Assembly, defended the nuclear deal with Iran. ""Renouncing it would be a grave error,"" he said. But Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu backed Mr Trump during his speech, saying the deal with Iran should be amended or scrapped altogether, and warned against the spread of Iranian influence in the Middle East. Key messages from Donald Trump's speech Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? By Jonathan Marcus, BBC News President Trump's speech was an eloquent exposition of his ""America First"" doctrine but at the same time contained some fulsome (and perhaps unexpected) praise for the United Nations as a body that can bring together sovereign states to tackle the world's problems. In contrast to the focus on globalisation that has driven so much of foreign policy discussion since the 1990s, Mr Trump saw national sovereignty as the main pillar of the international system. There was a nod to the old axis-of-evil theme. His rogues' gallery took in a predictable cast of North Korea, Iran and Venezuela. Nonetheless Mr Trump's world view contained many contradictions. Where exactly is the boundary between national sovereignty and collective action? And does America's newfound foreign policy pragmatism extend just to calling for the return of democracy in Iran and Venezuela or actually for doing something practical about it?

Hurricane Maria bears down on Puerto Rico,"This video can not be played Where has Hurricane Maria hit? Hurricane Maria, the devastating storm pushing north-west through the Caribbean, is battering Puerto Rico. The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) said it made landfall in Yabucoa in the east of the US territory, and now has strong winds of 140 mph (225 km/h). The US territory's governor said damage was inevitable as driving rain and winds hit the Puerto Rican capital. On the island of Dominica, which was badly affected on Monday, seven people are reported to have been killed. Aerial footage over the island shows flattened houses and the death toll on Dominica is likely to rise, with details remaining scant as communication links are down. On Tuesday, Maria ploughed through St Croix in the US Virgin Islands, home to around 55,000 people. Shortly before making landfall in Puerto Rico, the storm was downgraded from category five to category four by the NHC. Footage posted on social media showed a torrent of water pouring through the streets of Guayama on the island's south coast. Palm trees were bent double in Puerto Rico's capital, San Juan In San Juan, palm trees were bent double and electricity cables were blown loose as debris was thrown through the air. As of 11:00 local time (1500 GMT) on Wednesday, the eye of the storm was around 20 miles (32km) west of San Juan. Up to 90% of island residents were without electricity, El Nuevo Dia newspaper quoted Governor Ricardo Rossello as saying. Mr Rossello earlier told the island's 3.5 million people to seek shelter. He warned residents to prepare for ""the worst storm of the last century"" as about 500 shelters were made available to accommodate tens of thousands of people. ""God is with us; we are stronger than any hurricane,""Mr Rossello said,external. ""Together we will rise again."" Puerto Rico has experienced just one category five storm since 1851 - the Okeechobee Hurricane in 1928. PM's Facebook posts detail storm drama Hurricane Maria: What to do before, during and after This video can not be played Hurricane Maria brought high winds to Guadeloupe Maria is the second storm of this strength to hit the Caribbean this hurricane season - the first being category five Irma earlier in September. Maria began moving roughly along the same track as Irma. Officials in Puerto Rico feared the debris left by Irma could prove extremely dangerous in the high winds. There were also concerns that heavy rain could cause landslides in some places, and that a predicted storm surge of up to 9ft (2.7m) could swamp low-lying areas, with ""destructive waves"" expected to pummel the coast. The NHC also warned that Maria could deliver several tornadoes over Puerto Rico on Wednesday. By Will Grant in San Juan People across Puerto Rico are just trying to ride out this storm as best they can now. From where we're hunkered down, the powerful winds are creating an incredible noise, rattling storm shutters and doors almost off their hinges. The electricity is out in our hotel and it is too dark and too dangerous to try to see what is happening outside. Like millions of others, we have little choice at present except to stay put and wait in the darkness for the huge hurricane to pass. The difficulty is, it is moving slowly - giving Maria more time to unleash its power on the island and its infrastructure. Some projections have shown the storm covering the entire island in the coming hours, hitting Puerto Rico with sustained hurricane force winds and large amounts of rainfall. Hurricane Maria is now the strongest storm to make landfall on the island in almost a century. Most are just praying that when they can eventually emerge from their places of shelter, they and their loved ones are safe and that the damage hasn't been too extensive. Are you in an area affected by Hurricane Maria? Share your experience:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Hurricane Maria early on Tuesday On Wednesday an adviser to Dominica's Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit, Hartley Henry, said the full extent of the storm's damage was not yet known and that the death toll was likely to rise. ""It's difficult to determine the level of fatalities but so far seven are confirmed as a direct result of the hurricane,"" he said. As a result of the strong winds, roofs had been ripped from dozens of buildings. ""The main general hospital took a beating,"" Mr Henry said, adding: ""Patient care has been compromised."" The first aerial footage of the island confirms ""significant damage"", Ronald Jackson of the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency said. This video can not be played First aerial footage from Dominica It shows flattened buildings, rivers which have burst their banks and a flooded runway. Dominica has been virtually cut off with telecommunications severed, but local amateur radio operators say more than 90% of properties have been damaged. The former British colony, which has a population of 72,000 and is less than 50km long and 25km wide, escaped Hurricane Irma two weeks ago. But on Monday the eye of the new category five storm passed directly over. The last communication from the island was from Mr Skerrit just as the storm struck late on Monday, when he said in aFacebook post,externalthat the winds had swept away the roofs of ""almost every person I have spoken to or otherwise made contact with"". This video can not be played Hurricane Maria gathers strength again The storm arrived at 01:00 local time (05:00 GMT) on Wednesday in St Croix, where roughly half the US Virgin Islands' residents live. On Monday, the French territory of Martinique was hit by power cuts but escaped serious damage. This video can not be played Footage from Martinique shows early devastating winds There was flooding in the French territory of Guadeloupe, where one person was killed by a falling tree and another died on the seafront. At least two others were missing after their ship sank near Desirade, the easternmost island in the archipelago. About 80,000 homes lost power in Guadeloupe. There are reports of flooding, mudslides and power outages in parts of St Lucia. Some islands in Maria's path escaped the worst of Hurricane Irma and have been used as bases to distribute relief to places that were not so fortunate. Now there are concerns that this work could be jeopardised if they are badly hit, too. Puerto Ricans have been preparing in the capital, San Juan Guadeloupe has been a bridgehead for aid going to Irma-hit French territories, while Puerto Rico has also been offering crucial assistance to its neighbours.

Manchester police still using Windows XP,"Windows XP dates back to October 2001 and was replaced by Vista five years later England's second biggest police force has revealed that more than one in five of its computers were still running Windows XP as of July. Greater Manchester Police told the BBC that 1,518 of its PCs ran the ageing operating system, representing 20.3% of all the office computers it used. Microsoftended nearly all support for the operating system in 2014,external. Experts say its use could pose a hacking risk. The figure was disclosed as part of a wider Freedom of Information request. ""Even if security vulnerabilities are identified in XP, Microsoft won't distribute patches in the same way it does for later releases of Windows,"" said Dr Steven Murdoch, a cyber-security expert at University College London. ""So, if the [police's] Windows XP computers are exposed to the public internet, then that would be a serious concern. ""If they are isolated, that would be less of a worry - but the problem is still that if something gets into a secure network, it might then spread. That is what happened in the NHS with the recent Wannacry outbreak."" The NHS and other organisations were hit by the Wannacry attack four months ago In May, ransomware malware known as Wannacry caused havoc to the National Health Service's computer systems. Infected computers' files were digitally scrambled making them inaccessible, while staff were told to switch off other PCs to stop the infection from spreading. Operations and other appointments had to be cancelled as a consequence. Greater Manchester Police said it was reducing its reliance on XP ""continually"". ""The remaining XP machines are still in place due to complex technical requirements from a small number of externally provided highly specialised applications,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""Work is well advanced to mitigate each of these special requirements within this calendar year, typically through the replacement or removal of the software applications in question."" Most of the UK's police forces refused to disclose their numbers in response to the Freedom of Information request, citing security concerns. Several suggested revealing a large figure might lead them to become a target, while revealing a low tally could put others at greater risk of attack. However, eight forces that had fewer than 10 PCs using XP were willing to confirm the fact. Of the other forces that shared their numbers: Cleveland Police said it had seven computers running XP, representing 0.36% of the total the Police Service of Northern Ireland said it had five PCs still running XP, representing 0.05% of the total the Civil Nuclear Constabulary said it had fewer than 10 computers in operation running Windows XP, representing less than 1% of the total, but it added none of them was on its live network Gwent Police, North Wales Police, Lancashire Constabulary, Wiltshire Police and City of London Police all said they had no computers running XP The UK's biggest force - London's Metropolitan Police Service - was among those that refused to share an up-to-date figure. But in June it said about 10,000 of its desktop computers were still running XP. ""Disclosing further information would reveal potential weaknesses and vulnerability,"" the force's information manager, Paul Mayger, said. ""This would be damaging as criminals/terrorists would gain a greater understanding of the MPS's systems, enabling them to take steps to counter them."" Microsoft says computers that still use XP should not be considered ""secure"" The Met had, however, answered a Freedom of Information request on the subject in October 2015, when it said 35,640 of its desktop and laptop computers were running XP. The BBC has appealed against its refusal to provide an update. Police Scotland was among those to refuse to provide any numbers at all. ""The requested information could be used by a hostile party to plan and execute an attack,"" said Colette McGloan, its lead disclosure officer. ""Such attacks could take the form of data theft, denial of service or other deliberate disruptions."" Cumbria Police indicated the Wannacry attack had caused it to refuse the request. ""Taking into account the recent cyber-attacks within the United Kingdom, no information... which may aid cyber-attacks should be disclosed,"" said disclosure and compliance officer Sarah Pearce. ""The more information disclosed over time will give a more detailed account of the ICT [information and communications technology] infrastructure of not only a force area but also the country as a whole."" However, one computer security expert took issue with these excuses. ""We should be praising police forces that have made good progress in upgrading to a newer operating system and calling those who haven't to account,"" said Ken Munro from Pen Test Partners. ""Surely it's in everyone's interests for us not to have an incident with the police like we did with the NHS, where we only discover the scale of the problem after an attack."" Dr Murdoch said it would not be difficult for skilled attackers to identify vulnerable systems anyway. ""There is probably not much harm in disclosure, since if someone can get access to the computers, it's relatively easy to work out which ones are running Windows XP,"" he said. ""There are standard toolkits that adversaries use to run all the exploits they are aware of, and if anything works, then they will go with that."" Manchester's police force says it is trying to reduce its reliance on Windows XP For its part, Greater Manchester Police said that it saw no problem in complying with the request. ""The decision to share the figures on this has been made as the simple numerical response would not pose a significant increase to our organisational risks,"" said a spokeswoman.

Life-extending lung cancer drug approved,"A life-extending lung cancer drug will be made immediately available to NHS patients in England, say advisers. Campaigners, including the late Sunday Times restaurant critic AA Gill, have repeatedly called for access to the immunotherapy, which can add months to life. Scotland already offers nivolumab to people with advanced disease who have also tried chemotherapy. England's drugs watchdog had originally said nivolumab was too expensive. In new draft guidance, theNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence,external(NICE) has approved nivolumab through the fast-trackCancer Drugs Fund,externalwhile more evidence is gathered on its cost-effectiveness. That means some patients - about 1,300 people with advanced squamous and non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (whose tumours express a molecule called PD-L1) - will now be eligible for the drug. It is not the first immunotherapy drug available for advanced lung cancer - pembrolizumab was approved for use in December 2016 - but nivolumab hit the headlines during AA Gill's final weeks. He described nivolumab as ""more life spent on Earth - but only if you can pay"". Research has shown that nivolumab increases the number of patients still alive after three years of treatment by two- or three-fold, depending on the type of lung cancer they have. AA Gill, pictured with his partner of 23 years Nicola Formby The former smoker was diagnosed with lung cancer that had spread to his neck and pancreas, with tumours that were inoperable and unsuitable for radiotherapy. Gill said he had been denied a drug - costing about Â£5,000 a month - that may have helped him live ""considerably"" longer and was the weapon of choice for ""every oncologist in the First World"". Nivolumab (brand name Opdivo) is a type of immunotherapy that stimulates the body's immune system to fight cancer cells. It works by interrupting the chemical signals that cancers use to convince the immune system they are healthy tissue. Patients can have nivolumab into a vein as a drip. It is used to treat advanced melanoma, blood cancer (Hodgkin lymphoma), kidney cancer and the most common type of lung cancer - non small-cell lung cancer. It is also used in clinical trials for other types of cancer. Prof Carole Longson, from NICE, said: ""We know that nivolumab is clinically effective for some people with lung cancer, but the full extent of its benefit is not clear. ""This new deal means that we can give patients access to what we know is a promising treatment whilst more evidence is gathered on its value."" Prof Paul Workman, from the Institute of Cancer Research, in London, said: ""Immunotherapies are currently very expensive, but one of the ways to make them more cost-effective is to direct them to patients most likely to respond. Today's decision is a welcome step in the right direction.""

Spanish police target Catalan government,"This video can not be played Catalonia's separatist government is defying a Constitutional Court order to halt the 1 October vote Spanish police have detained 14 Catalan officials and raided regional government ministries involved in organising an independence vote declared illegal by Spain's government. Tensions were already high before Josep Maria JovÃ©, number two in the Catalan vice-presidency, and others were held. Thousands of Catalans took to the streets in protest and the region's president complained of a power grab. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the state had been forced to act. The region's separatist government is defying an order by Spain's Constitutional Court to suspend the 1 October referendum law passed by the Catalan parliament last month. A sea of protesters filled the Gran Via and other streets as police searched the Catalan economy ministry Wednesday's operation targeting over 40 ministries and offices as well as three private companies was a dramatic intensification of Spain's attempt to stop the vote taking place. An estimated 10 million ballot papers were found in a warehouse outside Barcelona, reports said. There were scattered protests outside a number of buildings, but the biggest was outside the Catalan economy ministry in the heart of Barcelona. Scuffles were reported as police tried to remove documents from the foreign affairs building. In a separate move Spain's finance minister, CristÃ³bal Montoro, announced the national government was now set to take control of the Catalan regional budget, so that the state would pay for essential public services, rather than transfer the money to Barcelona. After an emergency cabinet meeting Catalan President Carles Puigdemont accused the Madrid government of ""de facto"" suspending the region's autonomy and imposing a state of emergency. Eleven days ahead of the planned vote on 1 October, the national government has made its biggest move yet to stop it happening. Spain did not stop an earlier vote taking place in November 2014, but this time the Catalan leadership plans a declaration of independence within 48 hours of a Yes vote. Scuffles broke out on Tuesday when demonstrators in Terrassa tried to stop a raid targeting voting material Mr Rajoy said the regional government had been warned that they were destroying Spain's national sovereignty, ""There's no democratic state in the world that would accept what these people are planning,"" he said. He urged the Catalan president to comply with the law and put his secessionist challenge into ""reverse gear"". Spain plays cat and mouse as Catalan vote looms Does Catalonia want to leave Spain? Spain poised to seize Catalan finances Several ministries in Barcelona were raided on Wednesday, including the economy, foreign affairs, telecoms, social affairs and presidency buildings. Among those detained were officials from the economy ministry, run by Catalan Vice-President Oriol Junqueras, as well as figures from other departments. Those held are suspected of misappropriating funds for the vote and misusing confidential data on taxpayers. Police were searching for computer equipment and any documentation linked to the planned vote. The day before, they seized some 45,000 envelopes with the Catalan government's logo from a private delivery company in Terrassa, north-west of Barcelona. On Friday, the Spanish finance minister gave Oriol Junqueras a deadline to call off the vote or see funding for essential services in Catalonia taken over by Madrid. A letter was sent to Mr Junqueras late on Tuesday reminding him the deadline had passed. By James Badcock, BBC News, Madrid The spate of raids and arrests in Barcelona is a clear escalation by the Spanish state as it tries to deactivate the planned referendum. Chanting ""We will vote"", protesters blocked the Gran Via in Barcelona outside the Catalan economy ministry Previous raids have targeted sites suspected of holding electoral material. Arresting officials from an elected government risks further polarising Catalan society between those who want independence and those who do not. Although the Catalan independence movement has so far been peaceful, raids on government premises carried out by a Spanish militarised police force, the Guardia Civil, create uncomfortable echoes of the Franco dictatorship. Demonstrators are already taking to the streets to protect their ""right to decide"". And there is a risk of clashes between pro-independence activists and police forces with orders to stop the vote. As the Catalan president condemned Spain's ""anti-democratic and totalitarian actions"", another Catalan leader called for peaceful resistance to protect the buildings as the regional government met in emergency session. Catalan President Carles Puigdemont said the Spanish leadership had crossed a red line ""The time has come - let's resist peacefully; let's come out and defend our institutions,"" the president of the Catalan National Assembly, Jordi SÃ¡nchez, tweeted. He did not have to wait long. Protesters gathered outside the economy ministry as the police operation took place, chanting ""We will vote"" and surrounding the Guardia Civil cars stationed outside. The centre of Barcelona soon became a sea of Catalan flags and the city's renowned football club threw its weight behind the protests,condemning any act,externalthat threatened freedom of speech and self-determination. The Catalan vice-president accused Spanish police of attacking the region's institutions and therefore its citizens too. ""We will not allow it,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

In Madrid, Catalan separatist MP Gabriel RufiÃ¡n told the prime minister in parliament he should take his ""dirty hands"" off Catalonia's institutions, Efe news agency reported. Barcelona Mayor Ada Colau warned that if Mr Rajoy ""persists with this repressive strategy, he'll find diverse, pro-Catalan voices more united than ever defending rights and freedom"". Some 7.5 million people live in Spain's well-off north-eastern region and a majority are thought to be in favour of having a vote. However,one survey,externalcommissioned by the Catalan government in July suggested that 41% of voters backed independence while 49% were opposed. Catalan nationalism has been stirred by Spain's economic crisis. While Catalonia is one of Spain's wealthiest regions, Catalans argue they pay more into the national budget than they get back. And a 2010 Constitutional Court ruling fuelled nationalist anger when it set limits on Catalan claims to nationhood. In the non-binding 2014 vote, branded illegal by the Madrid government, just 2.2 million voters out of a potential 5.4 million turned out. Officials said 80% of them backed independence.

Nearly 250 die in huge Mexico quake,"This video can not be played Moments after the earthquake hit A strong earthquake has struck central Mexico, killing more than 200 people and toppling dozens of buildings in the capital, Mexico City. At least 30 people, mostly children, died after a school collapsed in the capital, local media report. The 7.1 magnitude quake also caused major damage in neighbouring states. It struck shortly after many people had taken part in an earthquake drill, exactly 32 years after a quake killed thousands in Mexico City. The country is prone to earthquakes and earlier this month an8.1 magnitude tremorin the south left at least 90 people dead. Though it struck a similar region, Tuesday's earthquake does not appear to be connected with the quake on 7 September, which was at least 30 times more energetic, the BBC's Jonathan Amoswrites. The epicentre of the latest quake was near Atencingo in Puebla state, about 120km (75 miles) from Mexico City, with a depth of 51km, the US Geological Survey says. The prolonged tremor hit at 13:14 local time (18:14 GMT) on Tuesday and sent thousands of residents into the streets. Why did only some buildings collapse? The race to help after the quake An earlier death toll of nearly 250 was lowered to 217 by the country's national co-ordinator for civil protection: Morelos state: 71 dead Puebla state: 43 dead Mexico City: 86 dead Mexico state: 12 dead Guerrero: 4 dead Oaxaca: 1 As many as 37 people - 32 children and five adults - died when the Enrique RÃ©bsamen elementary school collapsed in Mexico City's southern Coapa district, Efe news agency reports, quoting local media. According to Mexican news site Reforma, 30 bodies have been found at the school and 22 people are missing. Elsewhere, 15 people were killed when a church near Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano collapsed during Mass, Puebla's governor is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. The volcano itself had a small eruption as a result of the tremor. Rescuers celebrated as three people were pulled alive from the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school overnight - but many are still feared trapped Alfredo del Mazo Maza, governor of the State of Mexico, said schools would be closed on Wednesday. He also ordered all public transport to operate services for free so that people could travel home. Emergency workers, aided by military personnel and volunteers, have been working through the night in the search for people trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. At the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school, three people were rescued at about midnight, Reuters reports, adding that one child trapped under the debris was saved after oxygen was supplied through a tube. At least 209 schools were affected by the quake, 15 of which have suffered severe damage, Mexico's Secretariat of Public Education says. Buildings at 44 locations collapsed or were badly damaged, Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera told TV network Televisa. These are said to include a six-storey block of flats, a supermarket and a factory. Volunteers worked frantically to find survivors beneath the rubble About two million people in the capital were left without electricity and phone lines were down. Officials warned residents not to smoke on the streets as gas mains could have been ruptured. Some 70% of the electricity supply which went down has now been restored, Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission said. Live updates In pictures: Huge earthquake Are Mexico's two earthquakes connected? In a televised address, the president said an emergency had been declared for the affected areas and the military had been drafted in to help with the response. He also urged residents whose properties were structurally sound to remain in their homes where possible to allow emergency services and those helping with rescue efforts to clear the streets. Across Mexico City, teams of rescue workers and volunteers clawed through the rubble with picks, shovels and their bare hands. Rescuers and volunteers tried to find survivors under the debris of collapsed buildings The rescue operation continued into the night ""My wife is there. I haven't been able to communicate with her,"" Juan Jesus Garcia, 33, told Reuters, choking back tears next to a collapsed building. ""She is not answering and now they are telling us we have to turn off our mobile phones because there is a gas leak."" Have you been affected by the earthquake? If it is safe to do so you can email your story tohaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external This video can not be played The strong quake was felt in the capital, Mexico City Jennifer Swaddle, a teacher at the British International School in Mexico City, told the BBC that part of her classroom had collapsed. ""As we were leaving, the outside of my classroom wall fell, so there was a big pile of rubble. Luckily, fantastically, nobody was hurt, but it was incredibly frightening,"" she said. History of deadly earthquakes Can earthquakes be predicted? An earthquake drill was being held in Mexico City on Tuesday to mark the 32nd anniversary of a magnitude 8 quake that killed up to 10,000 people and left 30,000 others injured. The severe tremor caused serious damage to Mexico City and its surrounding areas, with more than 400 buildings collapsed and thousands more damaged. Correspondents say that residents may have mistaken earthquake alarms for part of the day of drills in the wake of the 1985 quake. Mexico City is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with more than 20 million people living in the metropolitan area. Mexico is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, sitting on top of three of the Earth's largest tectonic plates - the North American, Cocos and Pacific plates. The latest tremor occurred near the boundary between the North American and Cocos plates, where the latter slides beneath the former. According to theUS Geological Survey,external, the country has seen 19 earthquakes of at least 6.5 magnitude within 155 miles of the epicentre of Tuesday's quake over the past century.

QE2: The 50-year journey of a British style icon,"This video can not be played QE2 launch remembered The QE2, which was launched 50 years ago, was a British ""style icon"" that became one of the most famous liners in the world - but it also marked the end of generations of large passenger ships being produced on the Clyde. The marketing for the new liner made bold claims about propelling cruise liners two decades into future. Adverts from the time proclaimed: ""The only thing QE2 has in common with other ships is that she floats."" The QE2 was launched by the Queen at John Brown's ship yard in Clydebank in September 1967 The QE2 enters the Firth of Clyde past Cumbrae Elbow lighthouse for the final time in October 2008 After early teething problems, the liner lived up to the hype, serving as shipping company Cunard's flagship for 35 years and becoming a by-word for luxury and elegance. The famous ship also played a crucial role in the Falklands War when it was pressed into action as a troop ship. But despite its success, the shipyards of the upper Clyde never again produced a passenger ship of its scale, as other countries around the world cashed in on the boom in cruise liners. The QE2 was built at the Upper Clyde Shipbuilding yard 963ft (293m) long 65,863 gross register tonnage 1,892 passengers and 1,040 crew Â£29m cost to build (approx Â£490m in today's money) Five restaurants and two cafes, three swimming pools, a 481-seat cinema, a hospital and a casino Almost six million nautical miles sailed 2.5 million passengers in total More than 800 transatlantic crossings completed The QE2 taking to the water at Clydebank after being named by the Queen on 20 September 1967 More than 30,000 people lined the streets of Clydebank on 20 September 1967 as the Queen and Prince Philip made their way to the launch at John Brown's shipyard. The ship was known to the yard as No 736 and to the Cunard as Q4. It was not until the Queen spoke that people discovered what the new liner was to be called. Thousands turned out at the shipyard in Clydebank as the QE2 was launched She named the ship ""Queen Elizabeth the Second"" but that caused Cunard a headache as she was the first Elizabeth to rule over Scotland. In order not to upset the nation that built her, they changed the name to QE2, using the Arabic numeral ""2"" instead of the Roman ""II"" the Queen uses. The interior of the ""Queen's Room"" on the QE2 Peter Kemp, who was a 19-year-old apprentice at the time, told BBC Scotland: ""The Queen announced the name and then there was a long pause. ""It seemed a long time before the ship actually moved. ""Somebody cried out 'give it a shove'. ""One of the gaffers with a bowler hat jumped up and gave it a kiddy-on shove and then the thing moved off down the river."" The QE2 at night in 1969 Mr Kemp says: ""The chains were rattling and the dust was flying about and everything. It was an amazing sight."" Shipyard history expert and author Ian Johnston says: ""It is such a definitive moment when a ship takes to the sea for the very first time, to see this mass of steel sliding into the river, right here on the Clyde and all the noises and atmospherics that go with it, the clouds of dust that are thrown up, just the sheer bulk of something of the scale of the QE2 going into the river. ""It was just a stunning, moving experience."" The QE2 moored alongside Southampton's Ocean terminal in 1969 1967- Launched from John Brown's yard in Clydebank on 20 September 1969- The QE2 made its maiden voyage to New York on 2 May 1971- The liner rescued passengers from another ship, the Antilles, after it ran aground 1972- While travelling from New York to Southampton, the ship was the subject of a bomb threat mid-Atlantic. An SAS-led team parachuted into the water next to the ship but no bomb was found 1982- The QE2 was requisitioned as a troop carrier for the Falklands War 1987- The ship was converted from steam power to diesel electric 2004- After 35 years, the QE2's reign as flagship of the Cunard fleet drew to a close when the title was handed over to the French-built sister ship, Queen Mary 2 2007- Cunard announced it had sold the QE2 to the Dubai government investment company, Isthimar, for Â£50m 2008- After a trip around the UK, including a final trip to the Clyde, the ship sailed to Dubai on 11 November 2008 2012- Plans for a luxury hotel on the QE2 are announced but they have never proceeded 2017- The QE2 remains moored in Dubai with no decision on its future The QE2 anchored in the harbour at Marseille for a stopover in 1996 Despite the liner's rise to fame, its early days were dogged by teething problems. Soon after being launched, its engines were beset with problems. The QE2 arrives in Sydney Harbour on its final voyage to Australia in 2008 Further hitches meant its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in January 1969 had to be cancelled and it did not make the journey until four months later. Mr Johnston said early headlines such as ""ship of shame"" were harsh and there was nothing fundamentally wrong with the liner, as it went on to prove over the next four decades. The QE2 passes the Isle of Arran on its final trip around the UK in 2008 The historian says: ""She became a favourite with cruising people all over the world. Her reputation was well-earned. She was an unusual and stylish ship, very handsome and with the best of British design. ""She also had a long history of service during which her reputation grew."" The QE2 in Sydney, shortly before it was taken out of service The liner also served the UK in a different way during the Falklands War in 1982. The QE2 had its fittings stripped out and three helicopter pads built. The lounges were turned into dormitories and the liner carried more than 3,000 troops to the South Atlantic. Crowds wave from the quayside as the QE2 sets out on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York on 2 May 1969 After almost 70 years, the QE2 was the last of the great Cunard liners to be launched on the Clyde. Ian Johnston says the liner was a ""style icon"". He told BBC Scotland the ship was part of the British design renaissance of the Sixties. In the words of Prime Minister Harold Wilson, it was forged in the ""white heat of technology"". The QE2 carrying British troops from Southampton during the Falklands War in 1982 ""People came to realise she was a leader in design terms, bringing together the best of British design excellence,"" said Mr Johnston. ""She embodied what was the best of British at the time and she stood the test of time in that respect."" In 35 years of service, the QE2 became a destination rather than a carrier, carrying about 2.5 million passengers including the Queen, Nelson Mandela, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, and astronaut Buzz Aldrin. The QE2 in Melbourne in 2008 Building the most famous ship in the world should have secured the future for John Brown's, but the shipyard was in trouble. Partly to keep its skilled workforce together before the Q4 order came in, it had built the Swedish liner Kungsholm and there was no profit from the new Cunarder. John Brown's put in a tender that barely covered costs, just to make sure it got the contract. There were also fears at the time that the QE2 itself was already obsolete in the new age of transatlantic jet travel. Ian Johnston says: ""She was designed to go across the Atlantic in the heavy swell at speed but principally she was designed to be a cruising ship and in that sense she was reading the future."" Mr Johnston says that in 1967 no-one foresaw the boom in cruise ships which has meant more are being built now that at any other point in history. He says: ""It is ironic that the Clyde yards that produced this beautiful ship is no longer in the market to build these liners. ""The sad thing is that none of the great shipbuilders of the Clyde survived into the era when they could have capitalised on the boom because that was their expertise, fitting out luxury ships and passengers ships was one of the things they did so well on the Clyde. ""It would have been very nice to think we could have been building some of these great cruise liners that are being built in Germany and Italy and Finland."" As for the QE2 itself, it is currently berthed in Dubai. The QE2 in Liverpool during its farewell tour of the UK in 2008 It went there in 2008 after it was sold to an investment company that wanted to turn it into a luxury hotel. Those plans have been on hold and the ship remains in Dubai awaiting its fate. Residents of Dubai wave the British and Emirati flags as the famous cruise liner arrives at its final destination For Peter Kemp there is sadness that the ship he worked on as an apprentice is no longer in use but he says that is often the way. ""If, like me, you spend your life working with ships, they come to the end of their working life,"" he says. ""It's sad to say but they go to the scrappers. ""Lots of ships don't have the longevity of the QE2. ""It's a shame it's been left lying out in Dubai. It would be nice to see it brought back up the Clyde.""

More than 248 die in huge Mexico quake,"This video can not be played Moments after the earthquake hit A strong earthquake has struck central Mexico, killing more than 200 people and toppling dozens of buildings in the capital, Mexico City. At least 30 people, mostly children, died after a school collapsed in the capital, local media report. The 7.1 magnitude quake also caused major damage in neighbouring states. It struck shortly after many people had taken part in an earthquake drill, exactly 32 years after a quake killed thousands in Mexico City. The country is prone to earthquakes and earlier this month an8.1 magnitude tremorin the south left at least 90 people dead. Though it struck a similar region, Tuesday's earthquake does not appear to be connected with the quake on 7 September, which was at least 30 times more energetic, the BBC's Jonathan Amoswrites. The epicentre of the latest quake was near Atencingo in Puebla state, about 120km (75 miles) from Mexico City, with a depth of 51km, the US Geological Survey says. The prolonged tremor hit at 13:14 local time (18:14 GMT) on Tuesday and sent thousands of residents into the streets. Why did only some buildings collapse? The race to help after the quake An earlier death toll of nearly 250 was lowered to 217 by the country's national co-ordinator for civil protection: Morelos state: 71 dead Puebla state: 43 dead Mexico City: 86 dead Mexico state: 12 dead Guerrero: 4 dead Oaxaca: 1 As many as 37 people - 32 children and five adults - died when the Enrique RÃ©bsamen elementary school collapsed in Mexico City's southern Coapa district, Efe news agency reports, quoting local media. According to Mexican news site Reforma, 30 bodies have been found at the school and 22 people are missing. Elsewhere, 15 people were killed when a church near Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano collapsed during Mass, Puebla's governor is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. The volcano itself had a small eruption as a result of the tremor. Rescuers celebrated as three people were pulled alive from the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school overnight - but many are still feared trapped Alfredo del Mazo Maza, governor of the State of Mexico, said schools would be closed on Wednesday. He also ordered all public transport to operate services for free so that people could travel home. Emergency workers, aided by military personnel and volunteers, have been working through the night in the search for people trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. At the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school, three people were rescued at about midnight, Reuters reports, adding that one child trapped under the debris was saved after oxygen was supplied through a tube. At least 209 schools were affected by the quake, 15 of which have suffered severe damage, Mexico's Secretariat of Public Education says. Buildings at 44 locations collapsed or were badly damaged, Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera told TV network Televisa. These are said to include a six-storey block of flats, a supermarket and a factory. Volunteers worked frantically to find survivors beneath the rubble About two million people in the capital were left without electricity and phone lines were down. Officials warned residents not to smoke on the streets as gas mains could have been ruptured. Some 70% of the electricity supply which went down has now been restored, Mexico's Federal Electricity Commission said. Live updates In pictures: Huge earthquake Are Mexico's two earthquakes connected? In a televised address, the president said an emergency had been declared for the affected areas and the military had been drafted in to help with the response. He also urged residents whose properties were structurally sound to remain in their homes where possible to allow emergency services and those helping with rescue efforts to clear the streets. Across Mexico City, teams of rescue workers and volunteers clawed through the rubble with picks, shovels and their bare hands. Rescuers and volunteers tried to find survivors under the debris of collapsed buildings The rescue operation continued into the night ""My wife is there. I haven't been able to communicate with her,"" Juan Jesus Garcia, 33, told Reuters, choking back tears next to a collapsed building. ""She is not answering and now they are telling us we have to turn off our mobile phones because there is a gas leak."" Have you been affected by the earthquake?

""As we were leaving, the outside of my classroom wall fell, so there was a big pile of rubble. Luckily, fantastically, nobody was hurt, but it was incredibly frightening,"" she said. History of deadly earthquakes Can earthquakes be predicted? An earthquake drill was being held in Mexico City on Tuesday to mark the 32nd anniversary of a magnitude 8 quake that killed up to 10,000 people and left 30,000 others injured. The severe tremor caused serious damage to Mexico City and its surrounding areas, with more than 400 buildings collapsed and thousands more damaged. Correspondents say that residents may have mistaken earthquake alarms for part of the day of drills in the wake of the 1985 quake. Mexico City is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with more than 20 million people living in the metropolitan area. Mexico is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, sitting on top of three of the Earth's largest tectonic plates - the North American, Cocos and Pacific plates. The latest tremor occurred near the boundary between the North American and Cocos plates, where the latter slides beneath the former. According to theUS Geological Survey,external, the country has seen 19 earthquakes of at least 6.5 magnitude within 155 miles of the epicentre of Tuesday's quake over the past century.

Will the government accept 'No Deal'?,"Traffic jam at Port of Dover One slightly baffling element of the government's Brexit strategy is that it insists it is working on preparing for a ""No Deal"" scenario. But I am not sure that they really are. A lot of memos are being circulated, but not a lot beyond that. Britain does not seem to be taking the idea of No Deal very seriously. The government is not currently behaving like it is plausible. There is good sense to the objective of being ready for a collapse in the talks: there is inherent risk in a negotiation of this type with 27 partners.  Furthermore, in a negotiation, one of the simplest ways to improve one's position would be to improve what is known as ""the outside option"". That is, in layman's terms, ""what we get if we cannot cut a deal"". Think of it like this: if No Deal is so awful that we can never countenance it, we have a very weak position in terms of asking for concessions from the EU. So preparing for the consequences of No Deal situation is a good idea. It is true that we cannot mitigate a lot of the risks inherent in a No Deal exit. For example, on aviation. Parts of financial services, the car-makers and big pharma companies will regard the whole idea as a living nightmare. That is why a lot of people regard the government's ""No Deal is better than a Bad Deal"" rhetoric as bluster. But take it seriously. Imagine you were an EU27 negotiator trying to work out whether Britain was really countenancing No Deal - or whether this was just cheap talk. What would our government be doing if they were really serious about No Deal? I would suggest ministers are not doing very much of it. David Davis, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union Here is a small list of the stuff in ports we need to have sorted in March 2019 if we are to walk away from a negotiation: We would need to buy actual space in ports for immigration officers, customs facilities and sanitary checks to make sure imported food meets whatever standards we set. Dover should be humming - soon, at least - with bulldozers and cement mixers as we prepare for a new world with an independent customs policy. There have been estimates of a need for 3,000 to 5,000 extra customs officers to cope with the extra traffic inherit in Brexit. Defra will also need to increase staffing and capacity at ports, to allow for the testing of agricultural products and livestock entering the country. We will need new border agents. All these people need recruiting and training. The new customs computer system - CDS - is going to need to work. We will also need to replace the EU's Trade Control and Expert System (known as TRACES), the tool for tracking livestock and animal products - a new IT system. And you need both of these things to be in place in time before Brexit, so we can demonstrate it works. There are decisions we could make to reduce some of that workload. But not by much - and this would not actually make much difference to the disruption inherent in walking away. It would certainly do nothing to fix things like aviation. Even staying within the domain of ports, if our farmers are going to keep selling into Europe, we need west European states to have capacity to perform the checks on our produce - which they currently lack. It would also cost money. But, if the government were really serious about having the option of walking away, this is stuff they would be doing. It is the section of No Deal that is in our government's power to deal with. And some of that preparation is actually stuff which we might need to do anyway for whenever transition ends. Border Force checks in Portsmouth One of the strongest arguments for the idea that the government should have waited before triggering Article 50 is that it could have used the extra time to do work on what a new customs or immigration system should look like, for example, and work out answers to dull questions like ""what land will we need to house new facilities?"". We are where we are, though. And the big point is this: ministers keep talking about being ready to take ""No Deal"". I keep hearing about the terrifying No Deal memos emerging in Whitehall. Ministers keep denying that the problems they cannot avoid - like those aviation treaties or the potential delays in French ports - are putting them off from countenancing such an outcome. But, at the same time, our government is not behaving like it is really preparing for No Deal - and the EU27 can surely see it. Unless the government starts allocating resources to prepare for the parts of a clean exit in 2019 that it can control, no-one will seriously believe they're considering it. It makes a transition of some kind - on whatever terms it is offered - much more likely.

At least 224 die in huge Mexico quake,"This video can not be played Moments after the earthquake hit A strong earthquake has struck central Mexico, killing more than 200 people and toppling dozens of buildings in the capital, Mexico City. At least 30 people, mostly children, died after a school collapsed in the capital, local media report. The 7.1 magnitude quake also caused major damage in neighbouring states. It struck shortly after many people had taken part in an earthquake drill, exactly 32 years after a quake killed thousands in Mexico City. The country is prone to earthquakes and earlier this month an8.1 magnitude tremorin the south left at least 90 people dead. Though it struck a similar region, Tuesday's earthquake does not appear to be connected with the quake on 7 September, which was at least 30 times more energetic, the BBC's Jonathan Amoswrites. The epicentre of the latest quake was near Atencingo in Puebla state, about 120km (75 miles) from Mexico City, with a depth of 51km, the US Geological Survey says. The prolonged tremor hit at 13:14 local time (18:14 GMT) on Tuesday and sent thousands of residents into the streets. Why did only some buildings collapse?

Elsewhere, 15 people were killed when a church near Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano collapsed during Mass, Puebla's governor is quoted by Reuters news agency as saying. The volcano itself had a small eruption as a result of the tremor. Rescuers celebrated as three people were pulled alive from the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school overnight - but many are still feared trapped Alfredo del Mazo Maza, governor of the State of Mexico, said schools would be closed on Wednesday. He also ordered all public transport to operate services for free so that people could travel home. Emergency workers, aided by military personnel and volunteers, have been working through the night in the search for people trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. At the Enrique RÃ©bsamen school, three people were rescued at about midnight, Reuters reports, adding that one child trapped under the debris was saved after oxygen was supplied through a tube. At least 209 schools were affected by the quake, 15 of which have suffered severe damage, Mexico's Secretariat of Public Education says. Buildings at 44 locations collapsed or were badly damaged, Mexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera told TV network Televisa. These are said to include a six-storey block of flats, a supermarket and a factory. Volunteers worked frantically to find survivors beneath the rubble About two million people in the capital were left without electricity and phone lines were down. Officials warned residents not to smoke on the streets as gas mains could have been ruptured.

History of deadly earthquakes Can earthquakes be predicted? An earthquake drill was being held in Mexico City on Tuesday to mark the 32nd anniversary of a magnitude 8 quake that killed up to 10,000 people and left 30,000 others injured.

Correspondents say that residents may have mistaken earthquake alarms for part of the day of drills in the wake of the 1985 quake. Mexico City is one of the most densely populated cities in the world, with more than 20 million people living in the metropolitan area. Mexico is one of the most seismically active regions in the world, sitting on top of three of the Earth's largest tectonic plates - the North American, Cocos and Pacific plates.

Are US police too quick to shoot knife-wielding suspects?,"A police officer aims his gun at Scout Schultz, moments before the student died The shooting of a student at Georgia Tech has raised questions over when and why police resort to deadly force. In some cities, including one of America's poorest and most violent, officers are trying a different approach. On 17 November 2015, Sergeant Mickey White was driving home in his patrol car, his shift over, when a call went out about a man harassing customers at Jerry's Country Meat and Catering, a local grocery store in Arlington, Georgia. The employee who dialled 911 said the man was behaving oddly, accosting people and singing a hymn - ""Great is Thy Faithfulness"" - as he walked up and down the aisles. Sgt White took the call. When he arrived, the man was outside sitting in his car, the door open and hazard lights on. He was Derry Eugene Touchtone, a 58-year old white man from Headland, just over the state border in Alabama. He was unarmed. As Sgt White pulled up behind Touchtone, the dashboard camera in his patrol car was recording. In the video, the officer can be heard telling Touchtone to leave the vehicle. Touchtone complies but then ignores repeated instructions to put his hands on the car. Instead he walks slowly out of shot, towards White, and begins to sing. Sgt White fires his Taser but it fails to stop Touchtone. Off camera, a tussle can be heard, followed by two gunshots. Thirty-five seconds after Sgt White had arrived, Touchtone was dead. The dashcam kept recording as other officers arrived on the scene, and it overheard Sgt White talking to another deputy. ""You know the bad thing about it, Brent?"" White says, ""I could've fought him."" ""Don't second guess yourself,"" Brent replies. ""You did what Mickey had to do."" Sergeant Mickey White pictured after the shooting Two years later, and 200 miles north, another controversial police shooting in Georgia has raised questions over exactly what officers have to do to protect themselves against suspects who threaten them with fists, knives, bats or other non-firearm weapons. Scout Schultz, a 21-year-old Georgia Tech student who had battled depression, was reported to police on Sunday after being seen on campus with a knife. When officers arrived on scene, Schultz approached them holding the knife - in reality a multi-tool with a small blade, which a family lawyer says was closed. In an amateur video of the incident, Schultz can be heard saying ""Shoot me!"" while walking towards the officers. ""Drop the knife, man, come on,"" a police officer responds. ""Nobody wants to hurt you,"" another officer says. This video can not be played The final moments before Scout Schultz was shot Schultz ignores repeated requests to drop the knife, then takes a few steps towards one of the officers. The officer opens fire, hitting Schultz in the chest. The student was transported to the Grady Memorial Hospital but died from the gunshot wound. At a press conference, Schultz's father was asked what he would like to say to the officer who pulled the trigger. ""Why did you have to shoot?"" Bill Schultz said. ""That's the question, I mean that's the only question that matters right now. Why did you kill my son?"" It's question that goes to the heart of a shift in policing tactics that is taking place in some parts of the country - an attempted move away from the use of deadly force and towards de-escalation. A series of highly publicised police shootings have drawn national attention to so-called officer-involved shootings, but the vast majority of police officers in the US still have little or no training in how to recognise and engage with a suspect suffering from a mental health crisis, or de-escalate a threat from a knife without resorting to a gun. On 9 November 2015, about a week before Sgt Mickey White pulled up at Jerry's Country Meat, a 48-year-old man walked into a Crown Fried Chicken in Camden City, New Jersey, and pulled out a steak knife. High on PCP, and with a history of mental health problems, he was acting wildly, threatening customers. Outside, he jabbed the knife in the direction of two police deputies before setting off down the street. He was soon surrounded by a dozen or so officers, but he continued to swing the knife and move forward. At this point, the situation could so easily have played out the way it did at Georgia Tech on Sunday. The officers could have stood their ground, as they had the right to do. They could have followed a decades-old policing rule that anyone with a knife within 21ft presents an immediate threat to life. They could have shot him dead. But in Camden, one of the poorest and most violent cities in the country, police have for the past few years been taking a new approach. ""We stress to our officers that you do not have to rush in and rapidly resolve every scenario,"" said Lieutenant Kevin Lutz, who has overseen the shift in tactics. ""It's OK to slow down, it's OK to take a step back. Sometimes the best thing is to holster your weapon and talk."" The Camden officers following the knife-wielding suspect slowed down. They formed a loose group around the man, clearing the street ahead and walking alongside him. One spoke to him, periodically asking him to drop the knife. They waited. Most of the officers had their guns holstered, a few held them subtly at their sides. About 45 minutes after police arrived they were able to Taser the man, and he was arrested. This video can not be played Police in Camden City, NJ, resorted to patience instead of guns ""Those officers would 100% have been legally justified to use deadly force,"" said Lt Lutz. ""Had they stood their ground a deadly encounter would have been forced at that point. By allowing it to unfold, it ended with an arrest and the suspect is alive. Five or 10 years ago, he wouldn't be."" But the Georgia Tech shooting on Sunday shows that similar incidents still end fatally today. Of the 40,000 or so serving police officers in the state, about 10,000 have received some kind of mental health and de-escalation training over the past decade, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. The gold standard is a 40-hour course run in conjunction with the National Alliance for Mental Illness, but the majority of those 10,000 officers - and the vast majority of police officers across the country - will have received significantly less than that. And a proportion of those 10,000 officers have retired or moved on to desk jobs, leaving no clear picture of how many current frontline officers in Georgia have had some form of de-escalation training. It is not known whether the officers that confronted Scout Schultz had had any. According to a 2015 national survey by the Police Executive Research Forum (Perf), police officers received on average 58 hours of firearms training, 49 hours on defensive tactics, and just eight hours on mental health and de-escalation. There are no states which mandate de-escalation training. Camden police worked closely with Perf in developing its new approach. Perf in turn took inspiration from officers in Scotland. In late 2014 - shortly after the police shooting of Michael Brown sparked violent unrest in Ferguson, Missouri - Perf director Chuck Wexler was in Scotland for a leadership training programme. Looking around him at a graduation ceremony, Mr Wexler was struck by the fact that none of the officers were carrying guns. ""What hit me was the fact that these officers deal with similar knife situations that we deal with,"" he said. ""A knife in Glasgow is the same as a knife in downtown Washington DC, so why are they able to do it without shooting?"" Mr Wexler returned to the US armed with the UK's National Decision Model - a framework that emphasises communication, patience, and minimal force. He took note of interesting tactics, like a police officer removing his hat to appear more open and less confrontational. Perf now works with police departments across the country to train officers in looking for alternatives to firing their gun. Scout Schultz at an LGBT pride march Those alternatives can present themselves in any number of small decisions before a final, momentous one, said Greg Ridgeway, a statistician at the University of Pennsylvania who has studied police shootings. ""Often you look at the three seconds before the shooting and it looks like a good shoot,"" he said. ""Suspect comes at officer with knife, officer shoots. Fine. But step back five minutes, even a minute, and you start questioning how the officer got themselves into that situation where they had no option but to shoot. And you see that a little bit of patience, a little bit of distance, could have resolved some of those incidents peacefully."" The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) declined to comment on the incident at Georgia Tech, but the video suggests that crisis intervention tactics - and the kind of patience exhibited by the officers in Camden County - might have resolved that incident peacefully. GBI director Vernon Keenan acknowledged that the amount of mental health and de-escalation training currently given to most officers was ""minimal"". He said the state was in the process of reviewing the amount of training on offer and recruiting 12 new permanent staff to oversee more. Even those who bang the drum loudest for a rethink over the use of deadly force acknowledge that it is still sometimes the only option, and the 300 million or so guns in America put it in a vastly different position to countries like Scotland. ""Make no mistake, there are times when force is going to be immediate and required,"" said Lt Lutz. But in places like Camden, they are trying to shift the emphasis. Officers are taught to put an ""absolute value on the life of the person they encounter, regardless of what behaviour they are exhibiting at the time,"" said Lt Lutz. ""If our officers value life, and they are morally sound, and they are responding to the call and thinking through why they are there, then we believe some of the more controversial shootings that have taken place across the country, right or wrong, can be avoided.""

Zapad: What can we learn from Russia's latest military exercise?,"What did the joint Belarus-Russian Zapad exercises reveal about President Putin's military strategy? For all theWestern concern about Russia's Zapad military exercises, they nonetheless offer a rare insight into developments in the Russian military at a time of significant change. As one of the leading Western analysts of Russian military developments, Roger McDermott, says, ""while Russia's armed forces' leadership remain very interested in military theory, they test and rehearse new approaches to warfare in strategic exercises"". Thus, he adds, ""exercises like Zapad offer glimpses into the real level of capability and demand careful and sober assessment for outsiders"". Russia launches huge war games Ukraine fears Russia will use exercises next week to invade How much of a threat does Russia pose, and to whom? Should Russia's new Armata T-14 tanks worry Nato? Russia claims this exercise falls below a treaty threshold of 13,000 soldiers that would require invitations to be issued to observer teams from other European nations. Western analysts place the numbers involved much higher. But even without full-scale observer teams, Zapad is being monitored closely by Nato countries using satellites and aircraft with radars that can reach into western Russia to get a clear sense of how Russian and Belarussian forces perform. These exercises come at an interesting moment. The Russian military is transitioning from the old Cold-War-style Red Army into a more modern and flexible force, capable of conducting combined operations across land, sea and air, tailored to a variety of potential scenarios - just like the more sophisticated of Nato armies. Igor Sutyagin, the senior research fellow for Russian studies at the Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies (RUSI) think tank in London, describes this as an attempt to create ""a lean, fully manned, combat-ready force, fully - or to the best possible extent - equipped with the up-to-date equipment [and] supported by agile rear infrastructure"". Russia insists that the Zapad exercise involves fewer than 13,000 soldiers, the threshold for triggering the need for international observers Despite Russia's victory in the brief Georgia war of 2008, the conflict showed up many shortcomings. And Western analysts will be watching the Zapad manoeuvres closely to see how the Russian General Staff is applying the lessons learned from more recent operations in Syria and eastern Ukraine. Dr Sutyagin told me: ""Both campaigns showed the general direction in which the Russian military is moving."" But how far has Russia's military transition really gone? And, crucially, will the Russian government continue to have sufficient funds to maintain its military modernisation plans? Dr Sutyagin says the transition has passed the middle of its long path, with organisational changes nearing their completion. However, there have been some indications of backsliding, with a return to the establishment of large army divisions which, he says, are ""hard to man, thus being to a large extent 'empty shells'"". The Armata is a highly automated tank replacing much of Russia's Soviet-era armour Rearmament with modern weaponry, necessary to close - or at the minimum, narrow - the technological gap between the Russian and the best Western military forces is also gaining momentum. But Dr Sutyagin says much of the new equipment budget may now be in question, ""as completion of the rearmament programme depends on both availability of finances and access to Western technologies, which is becoming harder"". In terms of the Zapad exercises themselves, there is much to look for. In theory these are defensive exercises, organising the defence of Russia and Belarus against an external attack. Russia used the Zapad exercises to showcase its Iskander-M missile This of course has not prevented some spectacular firepower demonstrations, not least the firing of an Iskander-M missile from a range in south-west Russia against a mock target in Kazakhstan - a flight of some 480km (300 miles). But in terms of the exercises themselves, what will Nato watchers be looking for? Mr McDermott says ""it will be worth examining the use of strike systems in the exercise"" because ""since the last Zapad in 2013, Moscow has magnified the role of conventional precision strike in its set of coercive tools"". In a ground-breaking study of Russia's use of what it calls ""high-precision weapons"" (precision-guided munitions or PGMs in the West) recently published by the Norwegian Defence Research Establishment, Mr McDermott and his co-author, Tor Bukkvoll, set out the history and development of Russia's interest in this category of weapon. Long-range cruise missiles, both air- and sea-launched, were first used by the Russians in combat in the conflict in Syria. Su-24 bombers at Hmeimim airbase: Russia sent dozens of warplanes to help President Assad's forces It is interesting that while much of the Western media discussion of PGMs rests upon their use as air-launched weapons in bombing campaigns, intended to increase accuracy and reduce the level of civilian casualties, in Russia the weapons are viewed in a rather different light. Mr McDermott's study concludes that ""for the foreseeable future, precision-guided munitions will mainly provide Russia with what in the Russian literature is called a 'pre-nuclear' deterrence capability"". Note the Iskander-M launch in this exercise. This is basically just another layer of deterrence in addition to the nuclear weapons, but is still seen as being of vital importance by the Russian military. Another area Mr McDermott highlights is Russia's growing electronic warfare (EW) capability. This has been on display during the fighting in eastern Ukraine and has impressed many Nato commanders. They fear that while their forces have had a lengthy gap in serious training for high-intensity conflict to fight counter-insurgency campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan, Russia has been steadily improving its forces. EW is a case in point. Nato countries are keen to deter any Russian move west In a recently published study for the International Centre for Defence and Security in Estonia, Mr McDermott said: ""Russia's growing technological advances in EW will allow its forces to jam, disrupt and interfere with Nato communications, radar and other sensor systems, unmanned aerial vehicles and other assets."" This capability, he said, risked ""negating advantages conferred on [Nato] by its technological edge"". ""Many of those systems,"" he said, ""are being introduced in units across all services stationed in Russia's Western Military District adjacent to Nato's borders."" Russia sees EW as a seamless whole, ranging from kinetic combat operations on the battlefield to missions in cyber-space and the information domain. Indeed this may be the area where the Russian military is breaking the ""newest"" ground, having as it does, a far less clearly defined sense of the boundary line between war and peace. It is in this ""grey area"" of warfare that Moscow is leveraging its abilities. As such it poses fundamental political and military challenges to Nato countries, in whose strategic outlook war and peace tend to assume a far more black and white character.
