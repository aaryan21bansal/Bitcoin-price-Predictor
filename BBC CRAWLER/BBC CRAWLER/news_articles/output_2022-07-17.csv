M&S scraps 'best before' dates on fruit and veg,"Marks & Spencer is taking ""best before"" dates off more than 300 fruit and vegetable items to tackle food waste. They will be replaced by a code that M&S staff can use to check freshness and quality. Tesco, Morrisons and Co-op are among supermarkets that have scrapped ""use by"" dates on some of their products. Waste & Resources Action Programme (Wrap) said 70% of the UK's food waste is binned in homes, mounting up to4.5 million tonnes of edible food a year.,external Catherine David, director of collaboration and change at the charity, added: ""We urge more supermarkets to get ahead on food waste by axing date labels from fresh produce, allowing people to use their own judgment."" Morrisons scraps 'use by' date on milk in favour of sniff test Co-op supermarket scraps yoghurt use-by dates in bid to cut food waste Tesco ditches 'best before' dates on more fruit and veg Use by labels are the dates until which perishable food can be cooked and consumed safely. Best before guidance, meanwhile, is for when the product should be consumed to get the best quality, taste and texture. The Food Standards Agency says it isup to manufacturers to decide whether to apply a use by or best before date,externalon their products. It will depend on factors such as how the food is made and how risky it is, it said. The move away from best before dates could also help supermarket profits as they battle to keep the cost of everyday essentials down as food prices soar. Tesco scrapped best before dates on more than100 fruit and vegetable products in 2018. In January this year, Morrisons announced its plan to remove use by dates from 90% of its own brand milk and encouraged customers to use a ""sniff test"" instead before throwing products away. And in April the Co-op announced plans to ditch use by dates on its own-brand yoghurtin favour of a best before date as guidance. M&S has committed to halve food waste by 2030 as part of its sustainability roadmap, with all of its edible surplus to be redistributed by 2025. Andrew Clappen, director of food technology at M&S, said it needed to ""do all we can to make sure none of it gets thrown away"" and encouraged customers to ""get creative with leftovers"".

Tribute to 'sunshine boy' killed in tractor crash,"Albie Speakman was described as a ""little ray of sunshine"" by his mother Leah A three-year-old child who died after a tractor crash has been described as a ""little sunshine boy"" by his mother. Albie Speakman was fatally injured in the collision on a farm in Bury at about 12:45 BST on Saturday, Greater Manchester Police said. His family flagged down an ambulance as they drove him to hospital but he died before they arrived. The Greater Manchester force previously said the tractor driver was helping with inquiries. The driver is understood to be known to Albie and police said no one else is being sought in connection with his death. Police added that officers were investigating with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) following the crash on farmland off Bentley Hall Road. Police said the ""heart-breaking incident"" happened on a farm in Tottington ""I will miss absolutely everything about Albie,"" his mother Leah wrote in a tribute. ""His voice, his smile, the smell of his skin and the feel of his little hands on my face when he would say 'I love you mummy girl'. ""I'll especially miss going on adventures with Albie, anywhere and everywhere we could have fun. Nothing will ever fill the hole that he has left in our hearts, we are broken beyond repair."" Albie's happiest days were at the beach, his mother said She said he ""brought so much light into my life and he is my little ray of sunshine"". ""He was so sensitive and wanted everyone to be OK, especially the people that he loved."" Chief Inspector Ian Partington said he could not imagine how distressing the incident was for those involved. ""We are working to ensure that a full investigation is carried out,"" he said. ""The farmland remains cordoned off to allow our investigators and partners from the HSE to conduct thorough inquiries to establish exactly what has occurred here.""

Tory candidates clash on tax and exchange barbs in debate,"All five candidates to be the new prime minister took part in their second TV debate They were all quizzed on the cost of living - Rishi Sunak said he would deliver tax cuts, but only ""responsibly"" He said ""something for nothing economics"" is socialism, not conservatism Liz Truss accused Sunak of raising taxes to their highest level in 70 years while chancellor Sunak, meanwhile, asked Truss which one she regretted being most - ""a Lib Dem"" or a ""remainer"" Penny Mordaunt and Kemi Badenoch again clashed on past policies on trans rights The candidates were asked to raise their hand if they would have Boris Johnson in their cabinet - none did so And all five candidates said they would not hold an immediate general election if they became PM The upcoming week is decisive - one candidate will be knocked out each day, after votes by Tory MPs, leaving the final two on Wednesday The winner will then be decided by a vote of Conservative Party members Edited by Brian Wheeler That's your lot for this evening. Do join us again on Monday for further live page coverage of the latest twists in the Conservative Party leadership contest as it enters a critical phase, with the next round of voting by MPs.      Former safeguarding minister Rachel Maclean says her favoured candidate Kemi Badenoch is the only one who can ""break from the past"" with a fresh approach that the country needs to tackle the cost of living crisis. Maclean says Badenoch is right to call for the party to move on from Brexit and to focus on the opportunities it presents. Nobody knew who Badenoch was, says Maclean, when the contest started. Now, she adds, Tories are really responding to her telling the truth and ""shaking up"" politics. Digital Minister Caroline Dinenage, who is backing Penny Mordaunt in the leadership contest, says allegations she has changed her stance on gender ideology are ""nonsense"". The MP for Gosport says Baroness Williams, who worked with Mordaunt at the time, agrees ""Penny's account of what happened in the equalities department is the correct one"". She added: ""I have every reason to believe Baroness Williams as she is an incredibly credible source."" MP Claire Coutinho is backing Rishi Sunak. She says his economic approach is ""responsible"" and ""honest"", and would also not stoke inflation. She says the former chancellor knows the detail and is ""credible"". She adds he's protected jobs during the pandemic and had to increase taxes afterwards to protect public services. But now, she says, cuts ion national insurance and business taxes are under way - and an income tax cut will follow. As supporters rush to the TV cameras to talk up their candidates, armed forces minister James Heappey, who voted for Liz Truss, says she ""knows her stuff"", has talent, conviction and a ""bold"" economic plan that will deliver growth evenly around the country. Cutting taxes will bring people relief and stimulate economic growth, he adds. She acknowledged she's not the most entertaining or fluent political speaker, but instead says what she means and means what she says. Tom Tugendhat supporter Aaron Bell, MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, tells BBC News candidates spent too much time ""squabbling over who said what around the Cabinet table"" in tonight's TV debate. In contrast, Tugendhat's decision to not serve under Johnson had been ""vindicated"", leaving him as the candidate for ""a clean start"" says Bell. He added Tugendhat nonetheless had plenty of experience of political leadership, for example as Foreign Affairs Committee chairman on major issues such as China.  MP Aaron Bell is backing Tom Tugendhat for next leader Reacting to tonight's debate, shadow Labour minister Conor McGinn says the candidates seemed ""out of touch and out of ideas"". He says: ""As
the contenders deny their own records in government and squabble over their
fantasy economic plans, what families across the country who are really
struggling with the cost-of-living crisis need is a fresh start. ""Only
a Labour government led by Keir Starmer can offer Britain the fresh start it
needs.""  Leadership candidates ahead of the ITV debate So the second of three TV debates involving the Tory leadership candidates is over. The final one will be shown on Sky on Tuesday. By then, a third round of voting by Conservative MPs will have taken place - tomorrow. The existing five candidates will be whittled down to four, with the one finishing in fifth place eliminated. Further rounds of voting by MPs will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday, after which the final two will go to the party membership in the country. Their final decision will be announced on 5 September, and the new leader will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister the following day. The debate is now over, but in the interests of balance, here is what Kemi Badenoch had to say in her closing statement. The former minister said she's standing to become PM to create a ""strong UK that's confident in itself"" for her three children. She says she wants to build a future that's ""confident, bright, strong, secure, with  a wealthy economy"". Kemi Badenoch in the ITV debate Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The key feature of these debates so far has been how willing
the candidates are to tear lumps out of each other. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are regularly going into
battle - strongly criticising each others economic plans. If they get
into the final two, the next few weeks look likely to be just as heated for the
Tories. Tonight we also saw Kemi Badenoch go for the former
chancellor. Tom Tugendhat too was critical of the other candidates for lending
credibility to Boris Johnson's government. This is proving to be a brutal and bloody battle to be prime
minister. It might not be easy to heal some of the wounds. In her closing remarks, Liz Truss says the Tories have only two years - before a general election - to show the public they can deliver. She says she has shown what she can do on Brexit, trade deals and Ukraine. Truss during the ITV leadership debate Liz Truss says she isn't the ""slickest presenter on the stage"" but has a good parliamentary record. Credit: Britainâs Next Prime Minister: The ITV Debate This video can not be played Calling on his military credentials, Tom Tugendhat says he ""ready to serve"" and his priority would be rebuilding trust and confidence. ""The real answer is we need a clean start,"" he says. Tom Tugendhat during the debate In her closing statement, Penny Mordaunt says she wishes the debate had been more about the British people and less about the candidates. The model for politics is broken, she says, but she can fix it. Mordaunt during the ITV leadership debate Rishi Sunak finished the debate punchily, saying he's the ""only candidate who can take the fight to Labour"". His economic experience, ""honesty and determination"" set him apart from the rest, he says, claiming ""Britain's potential is limitless"". Rishi Sunak during the ITV debate Cop 26 climate summit president Alok Sharma has threatened to quit the Cabinet if the new Tory leader waters down the government's promise to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2050. The contenders are asked where they stand on Net Zero. Tom Tugendhat says he is committed to it - but more needs to be done on nuclear and carbon capture. Penny Mordaunt says she is committed to the climate target, but it must not ""clobber people"". Kemi Badenoch says she believes in climate change, but Net Zero must not bankrupt the country or make people poorer - it must be sustainable. Liz Truss says she backs the Net Zero targets, but they need to be taken out of general taxation. Rishi Sunak also backs the targets but says they need to be met through green energy and by increasing economic growth. Kemi Badenoch has said it is time to move on from Brexit, and that it's time to take advantage of the opportunities of leaving the EU.

Truss has spoken a number of times about the dozens of post-Brexit trade deals
she had secured for the UK. Itâs correct that the UK has dozens of deals in place.
However the vast majority are ""rollover"" deals - copying the terms of
deals the UK already had when it was an EU member, rather than creating new
benefits. Since leaving the EU, the UK has negotiated two new deals
from scratch â with Australia and New Zealand. The UK has also negotiated several deals that build on
existing EU deals, such as the one with Japan.  Â·What

Burn fear as parents struggle with sun cream cost,"This video can not be played Are you applying sun cream properly? There are fears children could be left with severe burns amid concerns some parents may stop buying sunscreen to afford food. Cancer charity Tenovus said they were seeing more parents struggling to pay for food and bills and the protection may ""be left off the list"". It comes as a nurse said children were being treated for burns and urged parents not to use expired sunscreen. Wales is expecting temperatures of up to 38C (100F) on Monday. An amber alert warning for extreme heathas come into force in parts of Wales on Sunday, as the UK braces for record temperatures over the next few days. According toCancer Research,external, there are almost 17,000 new melanoma skin cancer cases in the UK every year. A survey for the charity Melanoma Focus suggested that one in eight people are not wearing sunscreen because it is too expensive, while charities said some foodbanks were being asked for sun cream as people made ""impossible choices"". How does sun cream work? Sun cream: 'It takes two to do it properly' Burns unit nurse Louise Scannell said children were being admitted with serious burns in the hot weather At the burns unit at Morriston Hospital, in Swansea, nurse Louise Scannell said children were already being admitted with severe burns in the hot weather. ""Last year our temperatures peaked around 29C and over one weekend we had five children admitted with severe sunburns,"" she said. ""We are already seeing children being admitted and our colleagues in A&E are referring to us for advice."" Child's skin left blistered in the sun Keep children out of sun as heatwave hits - NHS She said it was important those struggling did not use old or expired cream, which she said was not effective and put children at risk. ""It is a big decision to pick between [skin care] and food, but once you have turned 18 and had a significant sunburn the damage is done,"" she said. ""It increases your risk later on so it is really important to apply it."" She added that the burns could be ""excruciating"" for children so parents need to reapply the sun cream throughout the day. Headteacher Matt Gilbert says he worries the poorest children will be affected the most At Barry Island Primary School, in Vale of Glamorgan, headteacher Matt Gilbert said the cost of living crisis had hit parents hard, and he feared many children would not be protected during the hottest days of the year. Around 18% of the school's pupils receive free school meals, and Mr Gilbert said he was worried sun cream may take a backseat to parents' lists of priorities. Mr Gilbert said while sun cream may only cost a few pounds in some shops, for people already struggling with rising costs, it could be the difference between skipping a meal. What does hot weather do to the body and who is at risk? He said it was ""integral for all children to understand about sun safety,"" and that schools were in a prime position to educate and help parents keep children safe. ""The cost pressures of weekly shopping is quite horrendous for families of all backgrounds,"" he said, adding a lot of parents did not want to ask for help. ""I think its beginning to sink in, particularly with the new curriculum that children are not only living in classroom settings but outside, it is more important than ever than ever children are protected and parents are supported."" The school receives free sunscreen after signing up to the #SunPoverty campaign, supported by a retailer, which also wants pupils to learn about sun safety in the curriculum and for VAT to be scrapped, with sun lotion seen an essential item. The Welsh government said: ""Schools and childcare settings have a responsibility to ensure children are not exposed to risks to their health and safety. ""We have produced guidance for schools and childcare settings on learning outdoors, which includes planning outdoor activities and protection from the sun."" Lowri Griffiths from Tenovus says sun poverty isn't really spoken about Tenovus has said high UV ray exposure in the first 10 years of life significantly increases the risk of developing melanoma. But Lowri Griffiths, from the charity, said many could not afford to buy sun cream, especially during the cost of living crisis. ""Sun cream, is like many other things that may be left off the list, and we need to see action so that parents can protect their children,"" she said. She said sun cream should be classified as a health essential, with VAT scrapped, as well as more education from a young age that ""no tan is a safe tan"". ""We know that people getting skin cancer is the on the increase, it is a common cancer but it can be deadly,"" she said. ""It is a particular concern for us because when children are not getting the protection they need because their parents can not afford to buy it when they are the most vulnerable."" Dermatologist Dr Avad Mughal said skin care was another aspect of health that could fall short for those with lower incomes Consultant dermatologist for Swansea University Health Board Dr Avad Mughal said the early years of childhood were important in skincare and said attitudes needed to change around sun exposure. ""It's a well-known fact that doesn't matter what health disease you suffer with whether it is a skin disease, whether it's skin cancer or any other disease, lower socio-economic groups tend to fare worse,"" the trustee for charity Skincare Cymru said. Dr Mughal said this could be down to the cost of sun cream and education around health. He urged people to keep children out of peak sun at peak times during the hot weather, wear full coverage clothing, and sun hats. Beth Ellis says supermarket own branded sunscreen is a good alternative to people on a budget Beth Ellis, from Barry, said that own branded sunscreen is cheaper and is vital to protecting her children. ""It's very important its protection and when you're out you want to feel comfortable that your child is protected. ""I've not worried about the cost because own brands still have the five UVA protection and I don't find them that expensive. ""It's not fun to put on your child on a sunny day but you've got think long term about it."" Susan Lloyd-Selby, of the Trussell Trust, said some foodbanks in Wales were also requesting donations of sun cream, with parents making ""impossible decisions"". Meanwhile Kirsty Wild at Llangollen food share said a lot of parents struggled to cope in summer months, due to the cost of extra meals, and often having to take time off work during the school break. ""I think we're at the point where [sun cream] is being considered more of a luxury item, which it shouldn't be,"" she said. ""Especially in the temperatures that we've had recently and that are expected to carry on for some time, so it is a great concern is really worrying."" A spokesperson for HM Treasury, which controls VAT on products, said financial support is in place to help with rising costs and high-factor sunscreen is available on prescription to people with certain conditions.

Tory race gets personal in latest TV debate,"This video can not be played Watch: Tory leadership rivals step up their attacks in second debate Tory leadership rivals stepped up their attacks on each other's records and policies in their latest TV debate. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss told ex-chancellor Rishi Sunak tax rises he introduced would ""choke off"" growth. Mr Sunak accused Ms Truss of peddling ""something-for-nothing economics"". Other flashpoints were trans rights, Brexit and trust in politics. All five ruled out an early general election if they became prime minister in seven weeks' time. At one point, the candidates were asked to raise their hands if they would give departing Prime Minister Boris Johnson a job in their cabinet. None of them did. MPs will vote for a third time on Monday as they whittle down the field eventually to two, who will then face postal ballot of Tory members to decide who will be the next prime minister. As it happened: Tory rivals clash in second TV debate Who could be the next prime minister? Truss and Mordaunt in bitter fight to stay in Tory race What taxes would Tory leadership rivals cut? In the hour-long ITV debate, some of the fiercest clashes were between Mr Sunak and Ms Truss, whose divisions over how to bring rising living costs under control while growing the economy were laid bare. The record of Mr Sunak - who won the first two rounds of MPs' voting - as chancellor has come under sustained attack during the leadership campaign. Mr Sunak has been forced to defend tax rises introduced during his time as chancellor, including April's hike in National Insurance to pay for social care and the NHS. In the debate, Ms Truss said Mr Sunak had ""raised taxes to the highest level in 70 years"", arguing that this was ""not going to drive economic growth"". ""The fact is that raising taxes at this moment will choke off economic growth, it will prevent us getting the revenue we need to pay off the debt,"" Ms Truss. Mr Sunak responded that the pandemic damaged the economy and the money has to be paid back. ""There's a cost to these things and the cost of higher inflation, higher mortgage rates, eroded savings,"" Mr Sunak said. ""And you know what? This something-for-nothing economics isn't Conservative. It's socialism."" Mr Sunak and Ms Truss had some testy exchanges over tax policy and Brexit Trade minister Penny Mordaunt - the bookmakers' favourite to win the race - said the limited tax cuts she advocated were not inflationary and people need help now with the cost of living. ""I don't understand why Rishi doesn't understand that,"" she said. But Mr Sunak hit back, accusing Ms Mordaunt of a ""dangerous"" plan to scrap his economic rule of only borrowing to invest. The former chancellor said even Jeremy Corbyn - the left-wing former Labour leader - did not advocate such a loosening of the public finances. There were also sharp exchanges between Ms Mordaunt and former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch over a row about the self-identification for transgender people. Ahead of the debate,Ms Mordaunt told the BBCthere were a ""number of smears going on in the papers"" and dismissed claims she had backed gender self-identification when she was an equalities minister in 2019. ""I think this whole thing is unedifying,"" Ms Mordaunt said. ""I know why this is being done. What I would say to you is, all attempts to paint me as an out of touch individual will fail."" Ms Badenoch said she was the candidate for the future whose honesty could ""change things for the better"". Other key moments in the debate included: Mr Sunak defended his wife Akshata's previous non-domiciled tax status and her family's wealth, arguing theirs was ""an incredibly Conservative story"" Pointing out Ms Truss had been a Liberal Democrat and a Remain supporter in the past, Mr Sunak asked her which one she regretted most. Ms Truss said she had ""been on a political journey"" Ms Badenoch accused Mr Sunak of not taking her seriously when she raised concerns about Covid loan fraud, which he denied When asked if they would sit next to Russia President Vladimir Putin at a G20 summit, all but Ms Truss said they would not. Ms Truss said she would ""call Putin out"" All candidates said they would back the UK's commitment to curb carbon emissions to net zero by 2050 You had to keep reminding yourself these were five people who are actually in the same party. And the two of them taking the greatest lumps out of each other sat around the same cabinet table a fortnight ago. Changing leaders between elections can offer a party a chance to renew in office. It also offers plentiful opportunity for it to rip itself to shreds in public. Read more from Chris here. Tom Tugendhat - chairman of the foreign affairs select committee - said those who had been ministers under Mr Johnson ""lent credibility to the chaos"" of his government. Grilling Ms Mordaunt, Mr Tugendhat challenged the trade minister to give the ""details of the plans you are laying out"". In reply Ms Mordaunt said: ""I think there's a couple of things we need in order to win the next general election: one of them is me as the prime minister because the polling shows that I'm the only one that can beat Keir Starmer and take the fight to Labour."" The five remaining candidates are vying to succeed Mr Johnson as Tory leader and prime minister after a cabinet mutiny forced him to resign. In a sign of how close the race has become, a survey of party members for the Conservative Home website on Saturday suggested Ms Badenoch was leading the pack, with Truss in second and Mordaunt - currently the bookmakers' favourite - dropping to third. But Mr Sunak is still in pole position after coming top in the first two rounds of voting among Tory MPs. Labour shadow minister Conor McGinn said the debate showed how ""out of touch"" the Tories were, accusing them of squabbling over ""fantasy economic plans"" while households struggle with living costs. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said none of the Tory candidates have ""a plan to get our country out of the crisis that they have caused"" and urged the party's new leader to call a general election as soon as they are in post. SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsten Oswald MP said Scotland was ""lucky to get a cursory mention in a debate where the candidates failed to escape the Westminster bubble for the public at home"" while people were hit by the cost of living crisis.

Do join us again on Monday for further live page coverage of the latest twists in the Conservative Party leadership contest as it enters a critical phase, with the next round of voting by MPs.      Former safeguarding minister Rachel Maclean says her favoured candidate Kemi Badenoch is the only one who can ""break from the past"" with a fresh approach that the country needs to tackle the cost of living crisis. Maclean says Badenoch is right to call for the party to move on from Brexit and to focus on the opportunities it presents. Nobody knew who Badenoch was, says Maclean, when the contest started. Now, she adds, Tories are really responding to her telling the truth and ""shaking up"" politics. Digital Minister Caroline Dinenage, who is backing Penny Mordaunt in the leadership contest, says allegations she has changed her stance on gender ideology are ""nonsense"". The MP for Gosport says Baroness Williams, who worked with Mordaunt at the time, agrees ""Penny's account of what happened in the equalities department is the correct one"". She added: ""I have every reason to believe Baroness Williams as she is an incredibly credible source."" MP Claire Coutinho is backing Rishi Sunak. She says his economic approach is ""responsible"" and ""honest"", and would also not stoke inflation. She says the former chancellor knows the detail and is ""credible"". She adds he's protected jobs during the pandemic and had to increase taxes afterwards to protect public services. But now, she says, cuts ion national insurance and business taxes are under way - and an income tax cut will follow. As supporters rush to the TV cameras to talk up their candidates, armed forces minister James Heappey, who voted for Liz Truss, says she ""knows her stuff"", has talent, conviction and a ""bold"" economic plan that will deliver growth evenly around the country. Cutting taxes will bring people relief and stimulate economic growth, he adds. She acknowledged she's not the most entertaining or fluent political speaker, but instead says what she means and means what she says. Tom Tugendhat supporter Aaron Bell, MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, tells BBC News candidates spent too much time ""squabbling over who said what around the Cabinet table"" in tonight's TV debate. In contrast, Tugendhat's decision to not serve under Johnson had been ""vindicated"", leaving him as the candidate for ""a clean start"" says Bell. He added Tugendhat nonetheless had plenty of experience of political leadership, for example as Foreign Affairs Committee chairman on major issues such as China.  MP Aaron Bell is backing Tom Tugendhat for next leader Reacting to tonight's debate, shadow Labour minister Conor McGinn says the candidates seemed ""out of touch and out of ideas"". He says: ""As
the contenders deny their own records in government and squabble over their
fantasy economic plans, what families across the country who are really
struggling with the cost-of-living crisis need is a fresh start. ""Only
a Labour government led by Keir Starmer can offer Britain the fresh start it
needs.""  Leadership candidates ahead of the ITV debate So the second of three TV debates involving the Tory leadership candidates is over. The final one will be shown on Sky on Tuesday. By then, a third round of voting by Conservative MPs will have taken place - tomorrow. The existing five candidates will be whittled down to four, with the one finishing in fifth place eliminated. Further rounds of voting by MPs will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday, after which the final two will go to the party membership in the country. Their final decision will be announced on 5 September, and the new leader will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister the following day. The debate is now over, but in the interests of balance, here is what Kemi Badenoch had to say in her closing statement. The former minister said she's standing to become PM to create a ""strong UK that's confident in itself"" for her three children. She says she wants to build a future that's ""confident, bright, strong, secure, with  a wealthy economy"". Kemi Badenoch in the ITV debate Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent The key feature of these debates so far has been how willing
the candidates are to tear lumps out of each other. Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss are regularly going into
battle - strongly criticising each others economic plans. If they get
into the final two, the next few weeks look likely to be just as heated for the
Tories. Tonight we also saw Kemi Badenoch go for the former
chancellor. Tom Tugendhat too was critical of the other candidates for lending
credibility to Boris Johnson's government. This is proving to be a brutal and bloody battle to be prime
minister. It might not be easy to heal some of the wounds. In her closing remarks, Liz Truss says the Tories have only two years - before a general election - to show the public they can deliver. She says she has shown what she can do on Brexit, trade deals and Ukraine. Truss during the ITV leadership debate Liz Truss says she isn't the ""slickest presenter on the stage"" but has a good parliamentary record.

""The real answer is we need a clean start,"" he says. Tom Tugendhat during the debate In her closing statement, Penny Mordaunt says she wishes the debate had been more about the British people and less about the candidates. The model for politics is broken, she says, but she can fix it. Mordaunt during the ITV leadership debate Rishi Sunak finished the debate punchily, saying he's the ""only candidate who can take the fight to Labour"". His economic experience, ""honesty and determination"" set him apart from the rest, he says, claiming ""Britain's potential is limitless"". Rishi Sunak during the ITV debate Cop 26 climate summit president Alok Sharma has threatened to quit the Cabinet if the new Tory leader waters down the government's promise to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2050. The contenders are asked where they stand on Net Zero. Tom Tugendhat says he is committed to it - but more needs to be done on nuclear and carbon capture. Penny Mordaunt says she is committed to the climate target, but it must not ""clobber people"". Kemi Badenoch says she believes in climate change, but Net Zero must not bankrupt the country or make people poorer - it must be sustainable. Liz Truss says she backs the Net Zero targets, but they need to be taken out of general taxation. Rishi Sunak also backs the targets but says they need to be met through green energy and by increasing economic growth. Kemi Badenoch has said it is time to move on from Brexit, and that it's time to take advantage of the opportunities of leaving the EU.

Truss has spoken a number of times about the dozens of post-Brexit trade deals
she had secured for the UK. Itâs correct that the UK has dozens of deals in place.
However the vast majority are ""rollover"" deals - copying the terms of
deals the UK already had when it was an EU member, rather than creating new
benefits. Since leaving the EU, the UK has negotiated two new deals
from scratch â with Australia and New Zealand. The UK has also negotiated several deals that build on
existing EU deals, such as the one with Japan.  Â·What

'I've got ice in my hat',"A couple seen working on their laptops under the shade on a hot and sunny day London Across the UK and elsewhere in Europe people are definitely feeling the heat. But while many of us have the option to seek cover in the shade, others are tasked with spending their working week under the glare of the sun, leading to some innovative ways of keeping cool. At the Tower of London, Yeoman Warder Spike Abbott is fully prepared for the hordes of tourists still wanting guided tours in the heat. ""Our uniform is from the Tudor period, and the Tudors would not have anticipated operating in temperatures like today. I think it is 32C in central London. ""As soon as you put on a Tudor bonnet the heat builds because the hat is quite heavy and insulated. Then you're wearing dark trousers and formal shoes. That's why I put a small ice block under my hat during tours. ""I use a small ice block that you put in a freezer and into your lunch box. They fit perfectly into the hat. But I don't do a full tour with it because it's not particularly safe to have an ice block sitting on top of your head. ""Between tours I take the ice block out and then if you've got it in your hand and put it around your face and that it certainly helps if you're holding something that's cold. ""We have picked this up from many previous Yeoman Warders that have done this. It worked today anyway."" Stephen Barnes has looked after bees for 23 years. There's only one way to avoid bee stings - cover up. ""My father was a beekeeper, and he showed me how to care for them as a teenager, but I wasn't interested. But he must have had a long-term plan, because now I'm hooked, and I look after 40 colonies dotted over Cumbria. ""Beekeeping requires a thick suit to limit the risk of being stung. In this weather, wearing a thick suit is far from ideal. During visits at the moment, I press a damp towel to my neck and I have bought a ventilated suit. ""The suits are a new invention. They started appearing on the market last year in places like India, so I prepared myself and bought one at the start of this season. ""It's made up of three layers. The outer has the vents, then there's a thin membrane of material in the middle, with a third layer that wicks the moisture out, then the bees can't get their stings through. ""I've found there has to be a slight breeze for it to work, which has been a bit challenging at the moment.  If there's no air, you get pretty warm and sweaty. ""I'll take on the heat if it means I can look after the bees."" Performing in a costume holding a puppet panda is hot work but Luke Ansley and his colleagues at Chessington World of Adventures have found a way to face it. ""We perform to up to 600 people in an outdoor arena where the actors wear full body suits, capes, masks and wigs, and some have puppets. Shows are really high energy, with lots of dancing and stage combat, with the characters weaving in and out of the audience. ""The shows range from 15 to 25 minutes, so we're not onstage for too long, but it does get pretty boiling. ""A couple of years ago I had the idea that we should install some paddling pools for the actors to jump into after the show. We can take our costumes off and climb into the pool, and it is an instant relief. ""Luckily for the kids, we have a character that sprays a water pistol around the audience. They love it, and in weather like this, it has the added bonus of keeping them cool.""

LiveLiveTory leader contenders set for second TV debateLess than a minute ago,"All five candidates to be the new prime minister took part in their second TV debate They were all quizzed on the cost of living - Rishi Sunak said he would deliver tax cuts, but only ""responsibly"" He said ""something for nothing economics"" is socialism, not conservatism Liz Truss accused Sunak of raising taxes to their highest level in 70 years while chancellor Sunak, meanwhile, asked Truss which one she regretted being most - ""a Lib Dem"" or a ""remainer"" Penny Mordaunt and Kemi Badenoch again clashed on past policies on trans rights The candidates were asked to raise their hand if they would have Boris Johnson in their cabinet - none did so And all five candidates said they would not hold an immediate general election if they became PM The upcoming week is decisive - one candidate will be knocked out each day, after votes by Tory MPs, leaving the final two on Wednesday The winner will then be decided by a vote of Conservative Party members Edited by Brian Wheeler That's your lot for this evening. Do join us again on Monday for further live page coverage of the latest twists in the Conservative Party leadership contest as it enters a critical phase, with the next round of voting by MPs.      Former safeguarding minister Rachel Maclean says her favoured candidate Kemi Badenoch is the only one who can ""break from the past"" with a fresh approach that the country needs to tackle the cost of living crisis. Maclean says Badenoch is right to call for the party to move on from Brexit and to focus on the opportunities it presents. Nobody knew who Badenoch was, says Maclean, when the contest started. Now, she adds, Tories are really responding to her telling the truth and ""shaking up"" politics. Digital Minister Caroline Dinenage, who is backing Penny Mordaunt in the leadership contest, says allegations she has changed her stance on gender ideology are ""nonsense"". The MP for Gosport says Baroness Williams, who worked with Mordaunt at the time, agrees ""Penny's account of what happened in the equalities department is the correct one"". She added: ""I have every reason to believe Baroness Williams as she is an incredibly credible source."" MP Claire Coutinho is backing Rishi Sunak. She says his economic approach is ""responsible"" and ""honest"", and would also not stoke inflation. She says the former chancellor knows the detail and is ""credible"". She adds he's protected jobs during the pandemic and had to increase taxes afterwards to protect public services. But now, she says, cuts ion national insurance and business taxes are under way - and an income tax cut will follow. As supporters rush to the TV cameras to talk up their candidates, armed forces minister James Heappey, who voted for Liz Truss, says she ""knows her stuff"", has talent, conviction and a ""bold"" economic plan that will deliver growth evenly around the country. Cutting taxes will bring people relief and stimulate economic growth, he adds. She acknowledged she's not the most entertaining or fluent political speaker, but instead says what she means and means what she says. Tom Tugendhat supporter Aaron Bell, MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme, tells BBC News candidates spent too much time ""squabbling over who said what around the Cabinet table"" in tonight's TV debate. In contrast, Tugendhat's decision to not serve under Johnson had been ""vindicated"", leaving him as the candidate for ""a clean start"" says Bell. He added Tugendhat nonetheless had plenty of experience of political leadership, for example as Foreign Affairs Committee chairman on major issues such as China.  MP Aaron Bell is backing Tom Tugendhat for next leader Reacting to tonight's debate, shadow Labour minister Conor McGinn says the candidates seemed ""out of touch and out of ideas"". He says: ""As
the contenders deny their own records in government and squabble over their
fantasy economic plans, what families across the country who are really
struggling with the cost-of-living crisis need is a fresh start. ""Only
a Labour government led by Keir Starmer can offer Britain the fresh start it
needs.""  Leadership candidates ahead of the ITV debate So the second of three TV debates involving the Tory leadership candidates is over. The final one will be shown on Sky on Tuesday. By then, a third round of voting by Conservative MPs will have taken place - tomorrow. The existing five candidates will be whittled down to four, with the one finishing in fifth place eliminated. Further rounds of voting by MPs will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday, after which the final two will go to the party membership in the country. Their final decision will be announced on 5 September, and the new leader will replace Boris Johnson as prime minister the following day.

Many schools already have the devices however the government says it aims to ""plug the gaps"" by funding about 20,000 kits. It followsa campaign by the parents of Oliver King, who died when his heart stopped in a swimming lesson in 2011. Education Secretary James Cleverly said he hoped the move ""goes some way to preventing more tragic stories"". ""Access to funding must not stand in the way of every school having on-site access to a life-saving defibrillator, "" he added. This video can not be played How to use a defibrillator and save a life Oliver's father, Mark King, said the family and their supporters had ""fought with tenacity to make defibrillators mandatory in all schools"" after the 12-year-old's death. He believes his son, who attended school in Liverpool, ""would still be alive today"" if there had been an on-site defibrillator. Mr King said: ""I'm therefore delighted that, after our decade-long fight, the government has finally listened and schools will now be equipped with them."" The scheme follows a meeting between Mark King (left) and Jamie Carragher (right) with former Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi The pundit and former footballer Jamie Carragher, who has backed the Oliver King Foundation, said he was ""delighted that the government has committed to installing this lifesaving kit in all schools"". ""This is fantastic news and is testament to the relentless and unwavering campaigning of Mark and Joanne King who've fought so hard for this moment."" The devices provide ahigh-energy electric shock,externalto restore the heart's normal rhythm. A recent study,externalfound that swift use of a defibrillator could lead to better survival rates, but that devices had been ""disproportionately placed in more affluent areas with a lower residential population density"". Researchers recommended that locations with higher deprivation should be be given preference for public defibrillators. Defibrillators have been installed in many public spaces in the past decade A Department for Education spokeswoman said a survey would be sent to all state-funded schools to determine the number of devices required, which is estimated to be more than 20,000. The government said it was committed to providing funds so that all premises have at least one kit on-site, adding that they would also help schools teach first aid as part of the curriculum. There has been increased availability of defibrillators in the UK after the devices were used to treat footballers Fabrice Muamba and Christian Eriksen, who survived on-pitch cardiac arrests in 2012 and 2021 respectively.

Tories. Tonight we also saw Kemi Badenoch go for the former
chancellor. Tom Tugendhat too was critical of the other candidates for lending
credibility to Boris Johnson's government. This is proving to be a brutal and bloody battle to be prime
minister. It might not be easy to heal some of the wounds. In her closing remarks, Liz Truss says the Tories have only two years - before a general election - to show the public they can deliver. She says she has shown what she can do on Brexit, trade deals and Ukraine.

""The real answer is we need a clean start,"" he says. Tom Tugendhat during the debate In her closing statement, Penny Mordaunt says she wishes the debate had been more about the British people and less about the candidates. The model for politics is broken, she says, but she can fix it. Mordaunt during the ITV leadership debate Rishi Sunak finished the debate punchily, saying he's the ""only candidate who can take the fight to Labour"". His economic experience, ""honesty and determination"" set him apart from the rest, he says, claiming ""Britain's potential is limitless"". Rishi Sunak during the ITV debate Cop 26 climate summit president Alok Sharma has threatened to quit the Cabinet if the new Tory leader waters down the government's promise to achieve Net Zero emissions by 2050. The contenders are asked where they stand on Net Zero. Tom Tugendhat says he is committed to it - but more needs to be done on nuclear and carbon capture. Penny Mordaunt says she is committed to the climate target, but it must not ""clobber people"". Kemi Badenoch says she believes in climate change, but Net Zero must not bankrupt the country or make people poorer - it must be sustainable. Liz Truss says she backs the Net Zero targets, but they need to be taken out of general taxation. Rishi Sunak also backs the targets but says they need to be met through green energy and by increasing economic growth. Kemi Badenoch has said it is time to move on from Brexit, and that it's time to take advantage of the opportunities of leaving the EU.

Mordaunt and Tugendhat both cite delivering manifesto commitments. Badenoch says people are tired of broken promises and need stability. Truss focuses on delivery and Sunak on prioritising the economy. Reality Check Conservative leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Liz
Truss has spoken a number of times about the dozens of post-Brexit trade deals
she had secured for the UK. Itâs correct that the UK has dozens of deals in place.
However the vast majority are ""rollover"" deals - copying the terms of
deals the UK already had when it was an EU member, rather than creating new
benefits. Since leaving the EU, the UK has negotiated two new deals
from scratch â with Australia and New Zealand. The UK has also negotiated several deals that build on
existing EU deals, such as the one with Japan.  Â·What
trade deals has the UK done so far? Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
