'Huge mess' as exams appeal guidance withdrawn,"The exams regulator is reviewing its guidance on how to appeal against A-level and GCSE grades using mock exam results - hours after publishing it. On Saturday Ofqualset out what constituted a ""valid"" mock exam for students appealing against A-level results in England. But the regulator has now suspended those criteria, and further information will be published ""in due course"". One Tory MP described it as a ""huge mess"" that was ""unacceptable"". A Department for Education statement on Sunday evening said that Ofqual ""continues to consider how to best deliver the appeals process to give schools and pupils the clarity they need"". The statement added that it had been working with Ofqual to achieve an appeals process that was as fair as possible. Neither A-level nor GCSE students were able to sit public exams this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, and almost 40% of A-level grades weremarked down from teachers' predictionsby an Ofqual algorithm. The Conservative chairman of the education select committee, Robert Halfon, said the decision to review appeals guidance only announced on Saturday left students and schools in confusion. ""That is a huge mess. Goodness knows what is going on at Ofqual. It is the last thing we need at this time. This is just unacceptable in my view,"" he said. ""Students and teachers are incredibly anxious - particularly the students who are worried about their future. This has got to be sorted out. ""Ofqual shouldn't put things on websites, take them away, sow confusion. This is just not on and it has got to be changed."" Meanwhile, the statistical model used by Ofqual to determine grades faces two legal challenges, which argue students were unfairly judged on the school they attend. Student tells schools minister: 'You've ruined my life' Free exam appeals for schools in England Why did the A-level algorithm say no? Ofqual said earlier on Saturday that, where a written mock exam was not taken, it would consider other teacher assessments instead. However, a statement published late on Saturday night on the regulator's website read: ""Earlier today we published information about mock exam results in appeals. ""This policy is being reviewed by the Ofqual Board and further information will be published in due course."" Hundreds of students have held a demonstration in central London, demanding clarity over the appeals procedure. This video can not be played Demonstrating students said they feel ""very let down"" and that the grading is unfair Holding placards - many of which called for the education secretary's resignation - they made their way through Westminster to the Department for Education. Dozens of protesters sat on the front steps while others shouted ""come out Gavin"" and ""justice for the working class"". Many of the demonstrators have called the downgrading of results ""classist"". ""Baffling, mind-boggling, inadequate, shell-shocked"" - these are the politer responses from school leaders, trying to make sense of Ofqual's bizarre retraction of its own rules over A-level appeals. An early morning email from an otherwise respectable head teacher was titled: ""WTF?"" Ofqual is meant to be an independent exams watchdog, but assuming it didn't overrule itself, who did pull the plug on what they'd announced for appeals over mock exams? The non-decision still leaves students anxiously waiting to find out if they can appeal and claim their university places. There is also irritation that ministers didn't head off this chaos in advance, or even when problems emerged in Scotland. In the end, whether it's by Ofqual or the Department for Education or Number 10, a decision will have to be made. Do they stick with the current grades and retro-fit them with a functioning appeals system? And will that withstand the unpicking of the fairness of results and legal challenges? Or do they take the political hit - and the risk of creating other types of unfairness - by switching to teachers' predictions, as eventually happened in Scotland? For ministers, it's time to turn over the exam paper and start their answers. BBC political correspondent Jonathan Blake said the Department for Education appeared to be unaware of the change and the review of the criteria was likely to draw further criticism of the government's handling of the exams process in England. The criteria under which Ofqual would accept a ""valid mock assessment"", set out on Saturday and then suspended hours later, had been stipulated as: Supervised, unseen and undertaken in conditions intended to secure the work as the student's own Either past assessments produced by the relevant exam board, or assessments developed by teachers Taken under timed conditions Completed before 20 March 2020, when schools and colleges were closed Marked using a mark scheme provided by the relevant exam board Graded in line with the exam board's examination standard Before results were released, the Department for Education announced a ""triple-lock"", which meant that students could accept the grade calculated by Ofqual, appeal to receive a ""valid mock result"" or sit autumn exams. However, Labour said that, under the new Ofqual criteria, some students would not be able to use their mock results as the basis for an appeal. Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner said Education Secretary Gavin Williamson had presided over a ""complete and utter fiasco"" and the prime minister was ""watching from the sidelines while a generation of young people are being robbed of their future"". ""No student should be worse off because of government failure,"" she said. The government should return to teacher assessments and take ""urgent action"" to avoid repeating the issue with GCSEs on Thursday, Ms Rayner said. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said Boris Johnson had been ""invisible"" during the results period. ""He needs to take personal responsibility and fix it,"" he said. Ofqual also faces two judicial review cases, with students challenging what they say is an ""irrational, arbitrary"" approach. Student Curtis Parfitt-Ford was awarded his predicted grades but told the BBC he wants to challenge the ""completely ridiculous"" system. Student Curtis Parfitt-Ford intends to challenge Ofqual in the courts He said his lawyers, from Leigh Day and Foxglove, believe Ofqual acted outside its statutory responsibilities in basing judgements on schools' prior performance not ""individual achievement and attainment"". Six students are also being supported by campaigning legal group the Good Law Project. One of the pupils, named only as Michael, saw his grades fall from a predicted three Bs to three E grades. ""It is abysmal to think that the government, whose job it is to lead this country in the right direction, has allowed an algorithm to determine the futures of thousands of students,"" he said. Oxford college 'will honour UK A-level offers' Labour call for urgent U-turn over 'exams fiasco' Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, told BBC Breakfast that way results have been handled this year is ""simply not good enough"". He added that universities needed to stop being ""insular and self-protective"" and to ""step up"", offering places to disadvantaged students who had been downgraded. This video can not be played Nina Bunting-Mitcham: ""My first thought was, my life is completely over"" He also called for Ofqual to re-examine extreme cases, such as students downgraded from a teacher-assessed C to a failing U grade. ""Young people, after two years on a course, should really not be coming out with a fail when they haven't had the chance to sit the exam,"" Mr Barton said. He said the ""really big issue"" is what has gone wrong with the statistical model used to determine results and how it might affect GCSEs, where there are larger numbers of disadvantaged students waiting for grades. The government announced on Friday thatschools would not have to pay to appeal against exam grades. PANORAMA:Has lockdown changed what we eat? FORT SALEM:Fancy some escapism?

A-level grades 'drop below three-year average',"A-level grades awarded in sixth form colleges this year fell below the average of the last three years in England, new analysis suggests. The Sixth Form Colleges Association said its research is evidence that students in larger institutions have been failed by this year's system. The government has defended the approach it used to determine grades. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland has announced GCSE students will be awarded the grades assessed by their teachers. NI Education Minister Peter Weir said ahead of GCSE results day on Thursday it would scrap an algorithm that would have taken into account the past performance of schools. It comes after almost 40% of A-level grades awarded on Thursday in England were lower than teachers' predictions. Students, who were not able to sit exams this year because of the coronavirus pandemic, had 280,000 A-level results downgraded. Exam regulator Ofqual has faced criticism over the statistical model it used to decide the grades. Many students are expected to appeal, although there has been confusion over the appeals process afterOfqual withdrew its guidance for challenging resultswithin hours of publishing it on Saturday. New guidelines are still being drawn up by Ofqual, the Department for Education said on Sunday evening. Why did the A-level algorithm say no? 'Huge mess' as exams appeal guidance withdrawn Anger over 'unfair' A-level results Hundreds of students held a demonstration in central London on Sunday to demand clarity over the appeals procedure. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been told by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer that he needs to take ""personal responsibility"" and ""fix"" the situation. The Sixth Form Colleges Association (SFCA) said it looked at 65,000 exam entries in 41 subjects from sixth form colleges and found that grades were 20% lower than historic performances for similar students in those colleges. It said that this equated to ""12,048 missing grades"" in those colleges alone. For example, in Biology, it found that 24% of sixth form college students were awarded a grade lower than similar students in recent years. The SFCA said its analysis of 41 subjects had not found a single one where the results were above the three-year average. Ofqual states that itsobjective for A-level results,externalthis year was to ensure ""national results are broadly similar to previous years"". SFCA said its research showed that Ofqual had ""failed"" to meet that ""fundamental objective"" and the model it used had ""not only failed to produce broadly similar results, but has in fact produced worse results in every single subject"". Bill Watkin, chief executive of the SFCA, said Ofqual should ""immediately recalibrate and rerun the model to provide all students with an accurate grade"". ""Should this still fail to produce results that are broadly similar to previous years, students should be awarded the grades predicted by teachers (known as centre assessed grades),"" he said. Dr Mark Fenton, chief executive of the Grammar School Heads Association, said the results had also been unfair to some of its students. He told the BBC that ""a great injustice has been done"" with ""utterly baffling"" results for some students. He said the ""only fair outcome"" available would be to revert to the grade predicted by teachers and for the limit of 5% extra university places in England to be lifted. The cap on increasing student numbers for each university was put in place by ministers to prevent academically selective universities recruiting heavily to make up for a fall in international students. ""Natural justice must surely now trump the understandable desire to maintain national standards in this, the most exceptional of years,"" Dr Fenton added. Three of Oxford University's colleges -Worcester, Wadham and, as of Sunday evening, St Edmund Hall - have confirmed that all places offered to UK students will be secured irrespective of their A-level results. This video can not be played Nina Bunting-Mitcham: ""My first thought was, my life is completely over"" After exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, grades were awarded using a controversial modelling system, with the key factors being the ranking order of pupils and the previous exam results of schools and colleges. Ahead of GCSE results due to be released on Thursday, former Conservative Education Secretary Lord Kenneth Baker urged the government to delay the publication of grades until the situation surrounding A-levels had been resolved. ""If you are in a hole, stop digging,"" Lord Baker said. The statistical model used by Ofqual faces two legal challenges, with students arguing they were unfairly judged on the school they attend. Before results were released, the Department for Education announced a ""triple-lock"", which meant that students could accept the grade calculated by Ofqual, appeal to receive a ""valid mock result"" or sit autumn exams. The government announced on Friday thatschools would not have to pay to appeal against exam grades. In England, 36% of entries had grades lower than their teachers predicted and 3% were down two grades. A similar situation in Scotland sawa U-turn by the government,which agreed to accept teacher estimates of scores.

Your results questions answered,"A-level and GCSE students in England will be given grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm, after a government U-turn. Experts Eddie Playfair and Catherine Sezen, senior policy managers at theAssociation of Colleges,,externalare answering your questions. Williamson 'incredibly sorry' for exam distress U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs as teacher grades used How have exam results been decided this year? Catherine Sezen and Eddie Playfair offer personalised advice on what to do next Now that we know that the grades predicted by teachers - also known as centre assessment grades, or CAGs for short - will stand, this means that there will be a five-point increase in A* grades and a 10-point increase in A grades or above. University courses may well be able to manage the increased demand for high tariff courses, particularly if there is a relaxation of the cap on growth - called the student number controls. Health Secretary Matthew Hancock has saidthe government is also considering lifting the cap on medical places. I'm so sorry you missed your firm offer. First of all it may be worth revisiting this with Durham in case the position has changed. Universities are working hard to honour the offers they've made, whether UK or international, and Covid-19 has disrupted education for students across the world. UK and international applicants are not really competing for the same places though, as the admissions and funding systems are different. For example, the removal of Student Number Controls means that many universities could now offer more places to their UK students, and this does not apply to international students. I'm afraid the triple lock system has been overtaken by events and your son's D will stand, since it is higher than the CAG. There may be some grounds for an appeal and it's worth discussing this with his college or school. There's no reason to expect that this year's higher-than-usual grades will impact the opportunities for next year's students. Universities will be aware of the different grade profiles in different years and are likely to adjust their offers and decision-making accordingly. If your daughter's offer has been confirmed this shouldn't be withdrawn. Students may have some opportunity to change their minds but confirmed offers should stand. The government's announcement thatit is considering lifting the cap on the number of medical student placesmay also help. As far we are aware, students awaiting their GCSE grades on Thursday will receive their CAG from their school or college - and students who received their A or AS-level results last Thursday will be reissued their CAG. If students' calculated grades were higher than the CAG, their calculated grade will stand. If you received results last Thursday, the best thing to do is to contact your school or college. If you are expecting results this week, your school or college should confirm the process. Schools and colleges have very thorough quality assurance systems in place to ensure that results are not biased. The grades given by teachers are moderated at department and centre level to ensure that they are as fair as possible. Pupils protesting outside Education Secretary Gavin Williamson's constituency office BTecs are structured very differently to A-levels, and so the approach to awarding them is also different. BTecs were not subject to the same statistical moderation process as A-levels. They comprise modular units that students complete and are assessed at regular stages during their course of study, so prior to March 2020, students had already ""banked"" graded units for their qualification. These formed part of the evidence used to award grades for the externally assessed units and the final overall qualification grade. If you have individual concerns about BTec or other technical and vocational qualifications, the best thing to do is to contact your school or college. Universities are used to dealing with fluctuations in numbers between years but at this stage it's impossible to tell whether the number of university places in 2021 will be affected at all. Students taking exams next summer will certainly have been impacted by the disruption this year - and of course further disruption can't be ruled out. There have been some adaptations made to assessment and content for 2021 but the assumption is that public exams will go ahead next summer - the public health situation permitting. If exams take place next year, the grading system should be more like a normal year, but there will be a case for some ""leniency"" to allow for disruption. You are absolutely right - this summer's Centre Assessed Grades are separate from the predicted grades used for UCAS or other purposes and they may not be the same. The process for producing CAGs was careful and rigorous, and was subjected to internal moderation. It is these CAGs and rankings which were submitted to awarding organisations as part of this summer's process. The ""calculated"" grades which were issued last week had been statistically adjusted resulting in 39% of them being downgraded. These have now mostly been superseded by the original CAGs where they are higher. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster - but no one will have lower A-level grades than they got last week and many will have higher grades. If your son has accepted this place and is happy with it he doesn't need to do anything more except perhaps confirm that decision with the university concerned. We can't give a legal opinion on that, but universities are doing their best to honour all the offers they made - including where a student's grade has now changed. They will need a few days to sort this out but they will have been helped by the lifting of student number controls which would have limited how many places they could fill. As far as we know, the autumn series is still going ahead so students will have the opportunity to take exams this autumn as well as next summer - so the ""resit"" option is still available where it makes sense. These are questions which should be raised directly with the IB Organisation. We know that Ofqual has asked it to scrutinise the grades awarded this summer to ensure they have been delivered in line with Ofqual's new process. I'm sure that receiving universities will want to be as flexible and helpful in responding to candidates with IB Diplomas as they were with A-level candidates. We gather that there have been some delays with some BTec awards and we know that Pearson - the company which runs BTecs - is working to resolve this. We think that only 0.5% of BTec centre assessed grades were adjusted downwards and it's not clear whether they will now be moved up. Will BTec students have their grades changed? Ofqual has just published an update on vocational and technical qualifications. Although calculated results have been issued for many vocational and technical qualifications, in only a very few cases has the same kind of statistical standardisation process of CAGs been used and so Monday's announcement shouldn't impact on the majority of vocational qualifications. You can findmore information on the Ofqual website.,externalIf you still have any questions about your result I would suggest that you speak to your school or college. It's possible that more students with Scottish Highers might have a small impact on places available in English universities, but the difference in scale between the two countries probably means this will not be significant overall. I am sure universities will want to honour the offers they've made. This was the year of the results without any exams being taken It's been clear from the start that unfortunately some private candidates would not be able to receive CAGs, and this is obviously far from ideal. It may be possible for them to progress on to the course they want if they can be assessed by the institution they wish to join. There is also the option of taking exams in the autumn which will result in grades which can be used for progression. You will need to discuss this with both your firm and insurance universities as soon as possible, now that you know that your CAG will be your final grade. Now that your son knows what his final grade is, he should discuss this with both his first choice university and also with the university he applied to through clearing. Calculated grades were higher than CAGs for 2.3% of all entries, and these will be honoured. Yes, it is possible to accept an offer and take the exam. Your school or college will be able to advise you on the best option. If your son or daughter is 18 then the college cannot share information with you unless your child agrees, as they are now classified as an adult. They should be able to tell you how results will be sent out, or whether your son or daughter can collect them from the college. The college will be able to provide information, advice and guidance to your son or daughter to help them think about next steps. This might help as the basis of a chat with your child. The best thing to do is to ask the university how long they will keep the place open while you weigh up the options. Universities are being very flexible this year. The alternative offer from your firm choice, including a foundation year, is of course an extra year. If you really want to go to that university it is a good option, but the other university course may also be right for you. Give the university a call and then you will know how long you have got to consider both. Your daughter might get results if the school or college that was going to enter her had sufficient evidence (course work for example) to give her a centre assessed grade. If not there will be an opportunity for your daughter to take an exam in the autumn. The school or college will have more details about that. You need to discuss this with the college or school you attended in 2019-20 to consider the various options open to you. Simply repeating a year is not generally recommended unless there are exceptional circumstances - but of course 2020 has been pretty exceptional! If you have the possibility of progressing to a higher level - for example university - that might be the best option, but don't make any final decisions without getting support and advice from your college or school first. When producing CAGs, centres will have predicted how a student would have performed assuming they had received all the additional support and access arrangements which they require because of a disability. Hopefully, any mock processes would also have included that additional support and this is definitely worth discussing with your centre. The system this year was designed to make sure that the class of 2020 was not disadvantaged, and to produce outcomes which are broadly similar to previous years. So we expect the national grade profile to reflect this. This should provide reassurance for employers, universities and colleges that this year's grades have an equivalent value to those of previous years. How can I find a new job? The autumn exams are an opportunity for students entered this summer to take an exam. The grade they are awarded will have equal value and so this can inform any applications they are making to university in 2021. The current plan is for exams next summer to go ahead as normal, with a few alterations, and they should be seen as equivalent to any other year. In the future this is certainly worth exploring, but given the timeframe this year it would have been very difficult to ensure that all students would have been adequately prepared to undertake exams online. Not all students will have had appropriate equipment or spaces to undertake exams. Do you have a question about your exam results? Use the form to send it to us.

Fears of 'homelessness wave' when eviction ban ends,"England could see ""a new wave of homelessness"" when a ban on evictions ends later this month, MPs have warned. The ban was introduced in March as part of emergency legislation to protect those hit financially by the pandemic. Amid fears that evictions may lead to more homeless, 21 MPs have urged the government to guarantee council funds to house rough sleepers for a year. The government said it would ""continue to provide appropriate support"" to those affected. New evictions in England and Wales had initially been suspended until 25 June, but the pause was extended to 23 August. The Labour-led Welsh government has doubled the notice period required for evictions issued on or after 24 July to six months, excluding cases relating to anti-social behaviour. The Scottish government has proposed extending its ban on evicting renters until March 2021. Charities welcome extended Scottish eviction ban Coronavirus ban on evicting renters extended Emergency fund for rough sleepers' scheme to end With the 23 August deadline now approaching , MPs have urged the government to do more to protect the homeless and those at risk of becoming homeless in England ""given the ongoing threat of coronavirus and the risk of a potential second wave"". In a letter to rough sleeping minister Luke Hall, the MPs called on him to guarantee all local authorities in England can fund accommodation for the homeless ""for at least a year"" . ""Some local authorities are in the process of confirming and funding accommodation for rough sleepers for another year, however it is so important that all councils are able to provide this. ""We cannot put a cut-off on showing all those in need compassion at this time,"" the letter said. The MPs also urged the minister to scrap the Vagrancy Act - which still stands in England and Wales, having been repealed in Scotland. The Act allows police to arrest and fine people caught begging in public. It was signed by nine Labour MPs, one DUP MP and 10 Lib Dem MPs, including the two party leadership candidates Sir Ed Davey and Layla Moran. There are an estimated 8.7m renters in England. In March, as the lockdown began, councils were told to move homeless people off the streets and out of communal shelters. The government says about 14,500 people were found emergency accommodation across England. In England, ministers have said allowing eviction hearings to resume is an important step towards protecting landlords' rights. The government has said new repossession rules will provide appropriate protection for renters after eviction court hearings resume. Labour has branded the new rules ""toothless"" and called for emergency legislation to strengthen protection for renters. Paddy says his life ""spiralled out of control"" and he ended up sleeping rough following eviction by his landlord. He had lost his job in a timber yard at the start of the pandemic, and was unable to find work to replace it. Unaware of the ban on new evictions, he says he told his landlord he had nowhere to go but his landlord told him that was ""not my problem"". ""I remember walking down the stairs and through the gate, thinking 'where am I going to go?'"" he says. He is now back in a home and retraining to be a lorry driver, but says sleeping on the streets was the ""worst experience of my life"". ""The way it came, a hundred miles an hour is how I would explain it,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Ross Hawkins. ""I went from the top to the bottom in a matter of days"". Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell has gone further, and called for the evictions ban in England and Wales to be extended for at least another year. Hetold the Mirror,externalit would be ""premature"" to end the ban this month ""with so many jobs being lost and incomes drying up"". ""The ban on evictions must be extended for as long as the risk of Covid persists,"" he added. The National Residential Landlords Association has, however, called on ministers to resist calls for another extension of the evictions ban in England and Wales. The UK-wide body says its research indicates the vast majority of tenants are either paying rent or have made an arrangements with their landlord to avoid arrears. It called for ministers to offer financial help to renters in England similar to Wales, where aÂ£8m loan schemeis being set up for private tenants in arrears. A Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government spokesperson said it had taken ""unprecedented action to support the most vulnerable people in our society during the pandemic"". They added that new repossession rules in England for after eviction hearings restart will require landlords to provide more information about their tenants' situation when seeking an eviction. Judges will be able to ""adjourn a case if this information isn't provided,"" they added. Landlords in England and Wales can evict their tenants without giving a reason by issuing a Section 21 notice. Normally, this can only be done when the initial fixed term has ended. This notice might be ruled invalid if the landlord hasfailed to stick to certain rules,external, for instance by failing to properly protect a tenant's deposit. The normal notice period for this type of eviction is two months, but this has been extended to three months in England because of the Covid-19 crisis. In Wales this period is now six months, except for cases relating to anti-social behaviour. To evict a tenant who has fallen behind on rent, landlords must issue a Section 8 notice. If the tenant does not leave by the specified date, landlords can then apply to a court to enforce it. The government has put new rules in place for when new repossession proceedings are allowed to start again after 23 August. Under the new rules,external, landlords will have to say how the pandemic has affected their tenants financially when applying for a hearing.

Claims open for second self-employed support grant,"Millions of self-employed people whose trade has been hit by coronavirus can now apply for a second support grant from the government. More than three million people may be eligible for the payment of up to Â£6,570 each, which Chancellor Rishi Sunak said would be the final hand-out. HMRC said it was pleased with the positive start the scheme made when it opened on Monday morning. By early Monday 39,000 people had successfully made claims, HMRC said. Angela MacDonald, deputy chief executive at the HMRC, told BBC Breakfast that those claims were made within the first hour-and-a-half after the scheme opened. The claims window is initially open for a four-day period but anyone who thinks they may be eligible and hasn't been contacted by HMRC has until October to make a claim, she said. ""We are trying very hard to contact all those people who are eligible in order to help them to understand when they can make their claim."" If you think you are eligible and haven't been contacted by HMRC, you can go onto the online system which will tell you if you are eligible, and when it is you can make a claim. ""People shouldn't worry about needing to do everything too much in a rush,"" said Ms MacDonald. ""If you don't manage it in those first four days the claims systems is actually open until the 19th October, so therefore everybody's got the time to do it to suit their working situation at the moment."" The first grant, launched in May, saw Â£7.8bn claimed by 2.7 million people. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) has admitted thousands were paid too much, but it will not be demanding repayment. Some 15,000 payments - less than 0.6% of the total - were miscalculated in the first tranche of support, the tax authority said. ""The vast majority of grants were paid correctly, but in a very small number of cases, not all the information held on a tax return was taken into account when calculating eligibility and grants,"" said a spokesman for HMRC. ""Our top priority has been ensuring self-employed people receive grants quickly while protecting public money from deliberate fraudsters."" Legal services firm Integrated Dispute Resolution, which highlighted the error, said the scale of it was still not ""fully understood"". To be eligible for the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme, more than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment. The scheme is open to those with a trading profit of less than Â£50,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than Â£50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. Under the first payment, self-employed workers who qualified had been in line for a grant of 80% of their average profits, up to Â£2,500 a month for three months. This was paid in one instalment, of up to Â£7,500. Applications for this first payment closed on 13 July. As of Monday, those eligible can claim the second, slightly less generous, grant covering 70% of the applicant's average monthly trading profits. It will also be made in a single payment, covering three months and capped at Â£2,190 a month, or Â£6,570 in total. Applicants will need to confirm their business has been affected by the virus on or after 14 July, but they would not need to have taken the first grant to be eligible for the second. A number of self-employed people, such as directors who pay themselves in dividends, freelancers, and the newly self-employed, are unhappy at missing out on the government's self-employment support package. The Treasury Select Committeecalled on ministers to plug the gapsto fulfil the government's promise of ""doing whatever it takes"", but Mr Sunak defended ""the right policies for the first phase of the crisis"". The system is the alternative to theextended furlough schemefor employed workers. The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed welcomed the second round of grants. But it said the government must be ready to reopen and ""extend it to the desperately struggling forgotten self-employed"" in the event of a second wave of the coronavirus.

'Reckless scenes' at Dublin venue criticised,"This video can not be played The footage was shot on Saturday afternoon Ireland's health minister has condemned ""reckless scenes"" at a venue in Dublin which appeared to breach social distancing regulations. Footage from Berlin D2 on Saturday showed a man standing on the bar pouring drinks into people's mouths. Guidelines say people must sit at tables in such venues,externalunless they are paying, leaving or going to the toilet. Jay Bourke, a restaurateur who is involved with the venue, told RTÃ he was ""not happy"" with what had happened Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said the ""vast majority of Irish people have sacrificed a huge amount to help suppress this virus"". He added: ""They've shown huge solidarity. People are rightly sickened by these scenes. ""The reckless actions of a small few can have huge repercussions on everyone else."" The person who took the video told RTÃ that when he arrived at the venue with his wife, some social distancing measures were being applied. He said tables were being kept 2m apart and food was being served to the tables. However, he said people stopped following the measures at a certain point, and the music was turned up. Mr Bourke told RTÃ he was ""absolutely mortified"". But he said having reviewed the CCTV from the venue he believed the footage did not fully reflect what happened. Mr Bourke said footage from inside the premises showed that for the majority of the time people were complying with public health guidelines. He said 51 people had attended a brunch event, which was fully ticketed. He said Berlin D2 was operating at less than 20% capacity at the time, was ""spotlessly clean"" and that food was served, temperature checks and details for contact tracing were taken on arrival and social distancing was maintained. However he said Berlin D2 would stay closed until an internal investigation into the incident is completed. Irish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly condemned the scenes Restaurants Association of Ireland CEO Adrian Cummins described the scenes as ""deplorable and despicable"" and a ""slap in the face to front-line workers who are putting their life on the line during this pandemic"". Mr Cummins said gardaÃ­ (Irish police) should take immediate action ""to stamp out this kind of behaviour"". Mr Donnelly's predecessor as health minister, Simon Harris, said the video was a ""kick in the gut"" and a ""middle finger"" to everyone who had suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. ""To everyone who has lost a loved one or been sick with Covid-19, to every frontline worker and to every responsible business owner who have suffered so much. Shameful,"" he wrote. It comes as the number of cases in the Republic of Irelandhas risen in recent days. On Saturday, the state reported 200 new confirmed cases of coronavirus, which was the largest daily increase since May. The Irish Acting Chief Medical Officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the situation was ""deeply concerning"" and that there were ""multiple clusters"" across the country, as well ""secondary spread"" of the disease. On Sunday, Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin echoed these concerns, and said the government would ""continue to monitor the situation closely"".

Public Health England 'to be replaced',"Public Health England is to be replaced by a new agency that will specifically deal with protecting the country from pandemics, according to a report. The Sunday Telegraph claims,externalHealth Secretary Matt Hancock will this week announce a new body modelled on Germany's Robert Koch Institute. Ministers have reportedly been unhappy with the way PHE has responded to the coronavirus crisis. The government was contacted by the BBC but declined to comment on the report. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Public Health England have played an integral role in our national response to this unprecedented global pandemic. ""We have always been clear that we must learn the right lessons from this crisis to ensure that we are in the strongest possible position, both as we continue to deal with Covid-19 and to respond to any future public health threat."" The Telegraph reports that Mr Hancock will merge theNHS Test and Trace schemewith the pandemic response work of PHE. A leaked memo seen by the BBC, written by the head of Public Health England Duncan Selbie to staff said the aim of the new national institute for health protection was to boost expertise with ""much needed new investment"". Covid death recount reduces UK toll by 5,000 PM: We could have done things differently The paper said the new body could be called the National Institute for Health Protection and would become ""effective"" in September, but the change would not be fully completed until the spring. The Robert Koch Institute,,externalwhich the new body will reportedly be based on, is an independent agency that has taken control of Germany's response to the pandemic. Earlier this month, the government brought in a new way of counting daily coronavirus deaths in Englandfollowing concerns that the method used by PHE overstated them. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also said the country's response to Covid-19 could have been done ""differently"" and the government needed to learn lessons. Public Health England has been seen by some at Westminster as a convenient scapegoat for flawed decision making in the early weeks of the coronavirus crisis. Blame for a failure to have put in place a mass testing capability as the pandemic virus began to spread has been laid partly at PHE's door. But decisions at the time and in the months before the crisis were made across Government, with input from the advisory body SAGE. PHE's critics will argue that a shake-up is now needed. But supporters will feel that blaming PHE is diverting attention from others in Whitehall and Westminster. There is a logic to moving PHE's coronavirus functions, including testing and surveillance, into a new health protection agency which also takes in the test and trace network and management. But shaking up the defences with the virus threat still present is risky. Ministers will need to demonstrate they are doing so for the right reasons and not just playing to a political gallery. John Ashton, a former regional director of public health in north-west England, said PHE had had ""a bad pandemic"" but criticised the government's reported plans to scrap the organisation. He told the BBC News Channel: ""You don't deal with the problem of an over-centralised, dysfunctional organisation by creating another over-centralised organisation which is what is being proposed. ""You don't change horses mid-stream - this pandemic has still got a long way to run,"" he said, adding that PHE should be strengthened rather than ditched. PHE was created in 2013 - as part of an overhaul of the NHS in England under former health secretary Jeremy Hunt - with responsibilities including preparing and responding to health-related emergencies such as pandemics. It currently employs around 5,500 full-time staff, made up mostly of scientists, researchers and public health professionals. Its website says it was established to bring together public health specialists from more than 70 organisations into a single public health service. PANORAMA:Has lockdown changed what we eat?

Mediterranean cruise sails after five-month pause,"MSC Cruises says all passengers and crew have been tested for coronavirus before boarding The first major cruise ship to set sail in the Mediterranean in almost five months has left from the Italian city of Genoa. The MSC Grandiosa will stop at three Italian ports and the Maltese capital Valletta in a seven-day voyage. Operator MSC Cruises, say all passengers and crew have been tested for coronavirus before boarding. It comes as virus cases continue to rise around Italy, with more than 600 reported by authorities yesterday. In response, Italian authorities have ordered the closure of all dance halls and night clubs from Monday. Face masks will also be mandatory from 18:00 to 06:00 local time in public spaces where social distancing isn't possible. MSC Cruises said it will also be operating the MSC Grandiosa at around 70% of its normal operations, with approximately 2,500 passengers onboard, to ensure safety protocols. Its launch is seen as a first step towards rebooting an industry that generates an estimated $150bn (Â£114bn) for the world economy, according to the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA). How the UK's ghost cruise ships became a summer hit Pandemic limbo angers crew on 'nightmare' cruises For Italy, badly hit by coronavirus, it is particularly important. It ranks seventh among the cruise ship operating nations, carrying more than 800,000 passengers in 2018. Last week Italy's government gave permission for cruise lines to resume operations in the country from 15 August. MSC Cruises, which operates the MSC Grandiosa, will launch another cruise from the Italian port of Bari on 29 August, but has otherwise suspended its Mediterranean cruises until mid-October. The international cruise industry has taken huge financial losses due to the pandemic. Several carriers have also been criticised for leaving thousands of passengers stranded aboard ships in Asia and the US in the early months of the pandemic. As of 11 June, 3,047 people were infected and 73 died while aboard 48 cruise ships affiliated with CLIA, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The company said its new security protocols - including daily temperature checks for those onboard - exceed national and industry standards. But the sailing of MSC Grandiosa represents a key test for the industry amid lingering concerns over passenger safety. At the end of July, a small Norwegian operator, Hurtigruten, was forced to suspend its newly restarted service afterdozens of passengers and crew tested positive for coronavirus.

New Zealand delays election over coronavirus fears,"The prime minister of New Zealand, Jacinda Ardern, has postponed the country's general election by a month amid a spike in coronavirus cases. The vote was due to take place on 19 September but will now be held on 17 October instead. Ms Ardern said on Monday that the new date would allow parties ""to plan around the range of circumstances we will be campaigning under"". Earlier this week, the country's largest city went back into lockdown. ""This decision gives all parties time over the next nine weeks to campaign and the Electoral Commission enough time to ensure an election can go ahead,"" Ms Ardern said, adding that she had ""absolutely no intention"" of allowing any further delays to the vote. The opposition National Party has argued the election should be delayed as restrictions on campaigning mean Ms Ardern had an unfair advantage. New Zealand extends Auckland lockdown for 12 days How New Zealand went 'hard and early' to beat Covid-19 Restrictions were imposed on Auckland on Wednesday after a number of new infections were identified in the city. Nine new coronavirus cases were confirmed on Monday, bringing the number of active cases linked to the Auckland cluster to 58. The outbreak was initially traced back to members of one family, although Ms Ardern later said that subsequent contact-tracing had found an earlier case involving a shop worker who became sick on 31 July. A health official who knew the family told the New Zealand Herald that the family were ""shell-shocked"" and ""a little embarrassed that it had happened to them"". The announcement that new cases had been discovered shocked the country, which had recorded no locally transmitted cases for more than three months. This video can not be played Epidemiologist Prof Michael Baker: ""New Zealand will get rid of the virus again"" There are four ""alert levels"" in New Zealand, and Auckland has been on Level 3 since the new measures were announced. The rest of the country is on Level 2. Before the new cluster was identified, the government had lifted almost all of its lockdown restrictions, which were first imposed in March. New Zealand has reported more than 1,600 infections and 22 deaths since the pandemic began, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University. An early lockdown, tough border restrictions, effective health messaging and an aggressive test-and-trace programme had all been credited with virtually eliminating the virus in the country.

Lake District rubbish 'makes me want to cry',"Camping equipment and discarded food and drink have been found across the Lake District Volunteers carrying out a Lake District litter pick have described the mounds of rubbish as heartbreaking. Discarded camping equipment, cans of nitrous oxide, cutlery and leftover food have been collected, while some areas have had trees cut down. The lakes have proved popular with visitors following the recent easing of coronavirus lockdown measures. Charity Friends of the Lake District had appealed for people to take part in the two-day clean-up across Cumbria. Engagement officer Ruth Kirk, who paddled out to an island at Thirlmere on a kayak, said: ""It just breaks my heart. It makes me want to cry. ""It's been replicated right across the Lake District, particularly around the lake shores. ""It's understandable people want to spend time here, but it has created quite a problem with the amount of litter left behind. ""It's difficult for communities. They live here and want it to be a lovely place. They don't want to have to go out as volunteers to collect litter every week."" Ruth Kirk, of Friends of the Lake District, is urging people to follow the Countryside Code The organisation is urging visitors not to camp at lakesides or on nearby islands and to ""enjoy the landscape responsibly"" by taking all rubbish home. Some of the larger items found as part of the pick will need to be collected by rangers in boats, Ms Kirk added. During the months in lockdown, police and park authority rangerssent home hundreds of people found illegally camping and holding parties. Problems have continued after the easing of restrictions, though, andsome locals have set up their own group to collect rubbish.

Harbour closed to swimmers as E. coli levels rise,"Swimmers have been told not to enter the water Dover Harbour has been closed to swimmers and water-based activities as ""above normal"" levels of E. coli bacteria have been found in the water. The Port of Dover tweeted at about 21:30 BST on Saturday to say the closure decision had been taken following ""routine water sample tests"". Customers' health and safety was ""of utmost importance"", it said, adding there were no reports of ill health. One woman contacted the BBC to say she became ill after swimming on Wednesday. Further water sampling is due to take place later and on Monday, the port added. The woman, who wishes to remain anonymous, said she swam in the sea at Dover with her family on Wednesday and became unwell that evening. ""Both my husband and I have had diarrhoea since Wednesday night,"" she said. ""The friends we were with have also been poorly. None of us thought anything of it until Dover port put out their tweet last night."" In an earlier statement, the port said that when ""water standards were not met"" it consulted with Dover District Council and the Environment Agency. ""The advice was to close the harbour to swimming and water-based activities until the situation is better understood"", it explained. ""The health and safety of our customers and community is of the utmost importance to us and therefore we have taken these measures as a precaution. ""There are no reports of ill health. We are working with external agencies in order to lift the restriction at the earliest opportunity."" Results from further water testing are expected to be known on Tuesday. Some local residents remain concerned however. Phil Smith complained about the limited information on Saturday night: ""To give so little information to the people of Dover is an utter embarrassing shambles on your part Port Of Dover...""

Backpacker's family welcomes Thai king's clemency,"British backpackers Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were killed in September 2014 The family of a British backpacker killed in Thailand have welcomed a decision tocommute his murderers' death sentences to life in prison. Two Burmese workers were sentenced to death in 2015, after being found guilty of killing David Miller, 24, of Jersey, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, of Norfolk. Their sentences have been reviewed to commemorate King Vajiralongkorn's birthday and to show his ""clemency"". Mr Miller's family said they were ""grateful"" to the Thai king. The bodies of Mr Miller and Miss Witheridge were found on a beach on the Thai island of Koh Tao in 2014. Lin and Phyo (also known asÂ Win Zaw Htun)Â were sentenced to death for the murder of Mr Miller and the murder and rape of Ms Witheridge. Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were convicted of the murders in a Thai court and originally sentenced to death In a statement, Ian and Sue Miller, who have campaigned against the death penalty, said: ""We are grateful to His Majesty the King of Thailand for showing his clemency to the murderers of our son David. ""Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo finally admitted to the rape and murder of Hannah Witheridge and the murder of our son."" ""The final admittance of their guilt has allowed this act of clemency to become possible,"" they continued. The family said it had brought to a close a ""lengthy and disturbing period"" where activists on social media had attempted to influence justice in Thailand and public opinion elsewhere. ""But in the end the truth has been revealed,"" the couple added. However, a lawyer for Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo told the BBC that the pair had not admitted their guilt when their death sentences were commuted. They still maintain their innocence, as they did throughout the trial. A royal commutation does not require an admission of guilt, says the BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok. The bodies of Mr Miller and Miss Witheridge were found on a beach on the Thai island of Koh Tao Miss Witheridge, a University of Essex student from Hemsby in Norfolk, and Mr Miller, a civil and structural engineering graduate, from Jersey, were bludgeoned to death. A post-mortem examination showed she had been raped. Mr and Mrs Miller, from St Helier, said: ""Every moment we miss our son. ""Our thoughts are also with the Witheridge family and the tragic loss of their daughter. ""We hope that these two murderers will now spend a very, very long time in jail where they cannot harm other families and will have time to reflect on the consequences of their acts."" The two men were convicted and sentenced in 2015 and the verdict was upheld by an appeals court in 2017 and theSupreme Court in August 2019. The convictions were mired in controversy, with supporters of the two men arguing they had been framed because their initial confessions were made under duress. A royal decree said the sentences had been reviewed to commemorate King Vajiralongkorn's birthday on 28 July and to ""illustrate the king's clemency"".

Two held in India for teen's rape and murder,"Rapes have continued unabated despite a change of India's rape laws A 13-year-old girl has been raped and murdered in India. Her body was found in a sugarcane field in northern Uttar Pradesh state, police said on Saturday. Two neighbours in the village have been arrested. Police have denied the father's account that his daughter had had her eyes gouged out and her tongue cut. Rape and sexual violence have been under the spotlight in India since the 2012 gang rape and murder of a young woman on a bus in the capital, Delhi. That attack led to huge protests and changes to the country's rape laws, but there has been no sign of crimes against women and girls abating. According to recent crime figures, every fourth rape victim in India is a child. In an overwhelming number of rape cases, the victims know the perpetrators. Four men executed for 2012 Delhi bus rape Why India's rape crisis shows no signs of abating Raped for money 'by her father's friends' The pregnant child caught in a media storm The latest incident occurred late on Friday in Pakaria village in the Lakhimpur Kheri district, police said. The family went searching for their daughter after she failed to return from a toilet break out in the fields. They say they found her body mutilated. But police said the post-mortem examination had concluded that she had died from strangulation after being raped - but not that her eyes had been gouged out or that her tongue had been cut. ""There were scratches near the eyes, likely due to the sharp sugarcane leaves where the body was found,"" police spokesman Satendra Kumar said. A senior member of the Opposition Congress Party, Jitin Prasada, condemned the attack as ""saddening"". ""The inhuman act with a girl has put humanity to shame,"" he said, according to the Times of India newspaper. The incident comes months after the case of a six-year-old girl who was abducted outside her home in Madhya Pradesh state and raped. The attacker inflicted severe injuries to the child's eyes, in an apparent attempt to stop her identifying him. In February, a 25-year-old man was arrested forallegedly raping a five-year-old girlon the premises of the US embassy in Delhi. In November last year,the gang rape and murder of a 27-year-old vetin the southern city of Hyderabad also made global headlines and triggered protests. Why is India passing more death sentences?

Minute's silence to remember rail crash victims,"Brett McCullough, Donald Dinnie and Chris Stuchbury died in the crash near Stonehaven A one-minute silence will be held on Wednesday to remember three people killed in a train derailment in Aberdeenshire. Train stations across Scotland will fall silent at 09:43 - exactly a week after the crash near Stonehaven was reported to the emergency services. Driver Brett McCullough, conductor Donald Dinnie and Christopher Stuchbury, a passenger, died. The train derailed after hitting a landslip following heavy rain. Crash investigators confirm train struck landslip Tributes paid to three killed in train derailment How did the Stonehaven train derailment happen? ScotRail said the one-minute silence would be observed at all train stations in Scotland and many stations elsewhere in the UK. Alex Hynes, the managing director of Scotland's Railway, said: ""Our hearts remain broken and will do for a long time. ""We hope that by coming together as a railway family, along with the local community and people across the country, we can support one another through this horrendous time. ""The strength of support and offers of help from railway colleagues across the rest of Britain has been a real source of comfort."" The three men were on board the 06:38 Aberdeen to Glasgow service when it crashed near Stonehaven following a night of heavy rain and thunderstorms. An initial report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch,externalsaid the train turned back towards Aberdeen after reports of a landslip further down the track. It had travelled more than a mile when it was derailed after hitting a separate landslip. An off-duty rail worker, who was travelling on the train, has been widely praised for raising the alarm after walking some distance to the nearest signal box. The first police officers on the scene - PC Liam Mercer and PC Eilidh McCabe - were also thanked for their bravery during a visit to the scene by Prince Charles. The prince met emergency responders who were among the first on the scene UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps has asked Network Rail to produce an interim report by 1 September. Network Rail said it would carry out detailed inspections of high-risk trackside slopes with similar characteristics to the site of the Aberdeenshire crash. Dozens of sites across Britain will be assessed using in-house engineers, specialist contractors and helicopter surveys. Scotland's Lord Advocate has asked Police Scotland, British Transport Police and the Office of Rail and Road, the independent regulator, to conduct a joint investigation into the accident. This will run in parallel with the independent safety investigation being carried out by the RAIB. Crash investigators confirm train struck landslip Three dead after ScotRail passenger train derails.

Covid funding boost saves 200 National Trust jobs,"The Battle of Culloden site near Inverness normally attracts thousands of visitors every year Almost 200 jobs have been saved at the National Trust for Scotland after it was awarded Â£3.8m by the Scottish government. The money is designed to help the charity, which looks after places such as Culloden and Brodick Castle, recover from the impact of Covid-19. It will also help NTS open 33 buildings this year - five more than planned. Despite the windfall, 232 redundancies are still expected to be made by the organisation. The conservation group lost almost Â£30m - half its expected income - as a result of lockdown and the subsequent restrictions. It had to close its properties and saw revenue from membership,investments and fundraising plummet. In May,the trust said its future was in doubtand it would look to sell off non-heritage land and property, and making 429 staff redundant. The NTS says the new funding, combined with Â£2.5m raised by donors and members, has saved 197 jobs, including all its ecologists and 20 out of 35 countryside ranger roles. As part of the new deal the trust has been told it must work with the Scottish government to consider the long-term sustainability of its operations and review its business model for future challenges. Brodick Castle on Arran features a interactive visitor experience, including a Victorian arcade Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the lockdown has been a ""deeply difficult"" time for the trust and vowed any government support was designed to support staff. She said: ""The severe impact of the pandemic means that unfortunately not all jobs can be saved but this funding will go far to protect as many critical roles across the National Trust for Scotland estate as we can. ""The funding will also ensure that some sites proposed for long-term closure by National Trust for Scotland can instead be reopened, and enjoyed once again by communities."" Ms Hyslop said the organisation is responsible for promoting and protecting many of Scotland's most important natural and built sites, which are crucial to the heritage and tourism sectors. And she pledged to work with itsnew leadershipso it is in a position to continue its ""vital work"" in the future. The conservation organisation manages or owns about 130 properties in Scotland, including St Kilda, which is Unesco world heritage site. Almost all of its gardens and estates have reopened to the public and the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum was one of its first buildings to reopen last week. Smaller venues likeBroughton House in Kirkcudbright remain closed. NTS is expected to make 188 compulsory redundancies and 44 people have requested voluntary redundancies. It has also had a recruitment freeze. St Kilda, which is managed by the NTS, is a protected Unesco World Heritage site NTS chief executive Phil Long welcomed the funding which comes during the ""worst crisis"" in the charity's 90-year history. But he added: ""My joy at this announcement is tempered by the fact that the devastating effects of Covid-19 mean we still must say goodbye to friends and colleagues. ""I wish it were not so, but redundancies are unavoidable, although this support helps keep them to the absolute minimum."" Mr Long said the organisation has been left with a ""resilient operating model to weather continuing uncertainty"". Richard Hardy, of Prospect union, paid tribute to those who had campaigned for government intervention and welcomed the funding. But he added: ""At the end of the day however, we cannot and should not lose sight of the fact that over 200 people are still losing their jobs and this is bad news for the economy, for heritage and for Scotland."" The money is part of the Â£97m in UK government consequentials for the culture and heritage sector.

Pub outbreak puts '100 customers' at virus risk,"Tracers are attempting to contact a number of people who visited the Empire Club More than 100 people are at risk of having contracted coronavirus after four positive tests were linked to a pub in County Durham. Anyone who visited Stanley's Empire Club between Sunday 9 and Tuesday 11 August is asked to isolate for 14 days. Health chiefs are working to trace everyone who was there. The pub has closed, along with the town's Ball Alley, Phoenix Club and East Stanley Workingmen's Club, which have also been linked to virus cases. Amanda Healy, Durham County Council's director of public health, said her concerns were ""predominantly"" with the Empire Club. ""We're asking people to self-isolate because it's deemed they've been in close contact with someone who has tested positive. ""We think there's over 100 people who have been in the Empire over those three days. ""The club is working really closely with us and have gathered the addresses and telephone numbers of some of the people and we passed them on to NHS Test and Trace. ""However, it may take a little while for them to be contacted so we want to make an appeal for people to isolate to stop the spread of the virus as quickly as possible.""

Lake District rubbish 'makes me want to cry'A charity describes mounds of discarded camping equipment and litter as heartbreaking.,"Camping equipment and discarded food and drink have been found across the Lake District Volunteers carrying out a Lake District litter pick have described the mounds of rubbish as heartbreaking. Discarded camping equipment, cans of nitrous oxide, cutlery and leftover food have been collected, while some areas have had trees cut down. The lakes have proved popular with visitors following the recent easing of coronavirus lockdown measures. Charity Friends of the Lake District had appealed for people to take part in the two-day clean-up across Cumbria. Engagement officer Ruth Kirk, who paddled out to an island at Thirlmere on a kayak, said: ""It just breaks my heart. It makes me want to cry. ""It's been replicated right across the Lake District, particularly around the lake shores. ""It's understandable people want to spend time here, but it has created quite a problem with the amount of litter left behind. ""It's difficult for communities. They live here and want it to be a lovely place. They don't want to have to go out as volunteers to collect litter every week."" Ruth Kirk, of Friends of the Lake District, is urging people to follow the Countryside Code The organisation is urging visitors not to camp at lakesides or on nearby islands and to ""enjoy the landscape responsibly"" by taking all rubbish home. Some of the larger items found as part of the pick will need to be collected by rangers in boats, Ms Kirk added. During the months in lockdown, police and park authority rangerssent home hundreds of people found illegally camping and holding parties. Problems have continued after the easing of restrictions, though, andsome locals have set up their own group to collect rubbish.

"Public Health England 'to be replaced'Health Secretary Matt Hancock is to announce a new body this week, according to the Sunday Telegraph.Health","Public Health England is to be replaced by a new agency that will specifically deal with protecting the country from pandemics, according to a report. The Sunday Telegraph claims,externalHealth Secretary Matt Hancock will this week announce a new body modelled on Germany's Robert Koch Institute. Ministers have reportedly been unhappy with the way PHE has responded to the coronavirus crisis. The government was contacted by the BBC but declined to comment on the report. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Public Health England have played an integral role in our national response to this unprecedented global pandemic. ""We have always been clear that we must learn the right lessons from this crisis to ensure that we are in the strongest possible position, both as we continue to deal with Covid-19 and to respond to any future public health threat."" The Telegraph reports that Mr Hancock will merge theNHS Test and Trace schemewith the pandemic response work of PHE. A leaked memo seen by the BBC, written by the head of Public Health England Duncan Selbie to staff said the aim of the new national institute for health protection was to boost expertise with ""much needed new investment"". Covid death recount reduces UK toll by 5,000 PM: We could have done things differently The paper said the new body could be called the National Institute for Health Protection and would become ""effective"" in September, but the change would not be fully completed until the spring. The Robert Koch Institute,,externalwhich the new body will reportedly be based on, is an independent agency that has taken control of Germany's response to the pandemic. Earlier this month, the government brought in a new way of counting daily coronavirus deaths in Englandfollowing concerns that the method used by PHE overstated them. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also said the country's response to Covid-19 could have been done ""differently"" and the government needed to learn lessons. Public Health England has been seen by some at Westminster as a convenient scapegoat for flawed decision making in the early weeks of the coronavirus crisis. Blame for a failure to have put in place a mass testing capability as the pandemic virus began to spread has been laid partly at PHE's door. But decisions at the time and in the months before the crisis were made across Government, with input from the advisory body SAGE. PHE's critics will argue that a shake-up is now needed. But supporters will feel that blaming PHE is diverting attention from others in Whitehall and Westminster. There is a logic to moving PHE's coronavirus functions, including testing and surveillance, into a new health protection agency which also takes in the test and trace network and management. But shaking up the defences with the virus threat still present is risky. Ministers will need to demonstrate they are doing so for the right reasons and not just playing to a political gallery. John Ashton, a former regional director of public health in north-west England, said PHE had had ""a bad pandemic"" but criticised the government's reported plans to scrap the organisation. He told the BBC News Channel: ""You don't deal with the problem of an over-centralised, dysfunctional organisation by creating another over-centralised organisation which is what is being proposed. ""You don't change horses mid-stream - this pandemic has still got a long way to run,"" he said, adding that PHE should be strengthened rather than ditched. PHE was created in 2013 - as part of an overhaul of the NHS in England under former health secretary Jeremy Hunt - with responsibilities including preparing and responding to health-related emergencies such as pandemics. It currently employs around 5,500 full-time staff, made up mostly of scientists, researchers and public health professionals. Its website says it was established to bring together public health specialists from more than 70 organisations into a single public health service. PANORAMA:Has lockdown changed what we eat?

"Sea search for missing brothers called offEmergency crews call off an air and sea search for the pair missing off the Lancashire coast.Leeds & West YorkshirePublic Health England 'to be replaced'Health Secretary Matt Hancock is to announce a new body this week, according to the Sunday Telegraph.Health","Muhammad Azhar Shabbir, left, and his brother Ali Athar Shabbir are still missing at sea A search for two teenagers missing off the Lancashire coast since Saturday night has been called off. The boys have been named as brothers Muhammad Azhar Shabbir, aged 18, and Ali Athar Shabbir, aged 16, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. The coastguard, RNLI and police were called to reports of three youths in difficulty in the water at St Annes at 18:40 BST on Saturday. Their cousin, aged 15, managed to swim ashore and was treated for hypothermia. Lancashire Police said the searches by HM Coastguard and the RNLI continued well into Saturday night, and the force's helicopter joined the search in daylight. Officers said the search had been stood down by lunchtime on Sunday, but ""may reconvene later"". In a statement the force said: ""Sadly, despite searching for a number of hours, our colleagues at HM Coastguard and the RNLI have been unable to find [the missing brothers], who got into difficulty in water close to St Anne's Pier yesterday evening."" More stories across Yorkshire The weather was beautiful yesterday and hundreds of families like mine were enjoying their day out on the beach. At about 18:00 BST we saw lots of activity outside the RNLI station - people being moved out of the way as crews, ambulances and police cars arrived. The family, from Yorkshire, was on a day trip, when the three males, aged 15, 16 and 18, went out into the water. Luckily the 15-year-old managed to swim to safety - the family tell me he is a really good swimmer - but the other two couldn't get out. When I left at about 23:00 the search was still continuing with a helicopter and two boats out. So many people were still stood on the promenade, hoping for some good news. This morning, police have said the search has resumed and the family has told me the 15-year-old boy has hypothermia and is in hospital. He is clearly shocked by what has happened.

Channel swimmer 'given quarantine all-clear',"Chloe McCardel has now completed 35 cross-Channel swims A swimmer has broken the men's record for the number of cross-Channel crossings - and been assured her fears of falling foul of the UK-France quarantine rules are unfounded. Australian Chloe McCardel took 10 hours and 40 minutes to complete her 35th Channel crossing, after setting off from Kent on Saturday evening. She was worried arriving in Calais would require her to self-isolate. But she said UK and French coastguards have given her the all-clear. ""I'm in great spirits,"" Ms McCardel said. ""I would like to have a little celebration this evening in England. I'm extremely lucky to be surrounded by so much love and support, from my English host to my support boat captains and crew, and I'm excited to celebrate this achievement together with them."" The 35-year-old started her 21-mile swim from Abbot's Cliff beach near Folkestone at 20:00 BST on Saturday, and arrived in France just before 07:00. She intended to spend only a few moments on the French shore before swimming back out to her support boat for the return journey. ""We don't go anywhere near the border officials or passport control, so I'm hoping technically the quarantine thing won't apply,"" she had said ahead of the swim. A history of swimming the English Channel Woman first to swim Channel four times non-stop How an 11-year-old came to swim the Channel Ms McCardel is now second on the list of the most Channel swims, passing the men's record of 34 held by Briton Kevin Murphy. Equalling the women's record will be a greater task, however - Alison Streeter, the ""Queen of the English Channel"", has swum the distance 43 times. The Department of Transport had advised Ms McCardel to seek legal advice ahead of the swim. She said she has been advised by the Channel Swimming Association that her swim could go ahead. ""They said Channel swims are allowed as long as you observe social distancing when you land and don't stay on the shore for more than 10 minutes, which is standard practice for us,"" Ms McCardel told the BBC shortly before embarking on the swim. She said there was little risk of coming into contact with someone in France because her swims usually end in an area of boulders near Cap Gris-Nez. ""I usually finish where there are large boulders and it's inaccessible to people on land because you can't walk through the boulders. There's no sand,"" she said. Ms McCardel holds multiple world records for endurance swimming Ms McCardel already negotiated special dispensation from the Australian government to travel to the UK for her record attempt. In recent weeks she has completed three Channel crossings, taking her level with British swimmer Mr Murphy, on 34 crossings. She told the Daily Telegraph that she hopes that her latest feat can help to raise awareness about domestic violence, revealing that she is a survivor who has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. Speaking after completing her feat, Ms McCardel said: ""It's a very momentous occasion and I'm very proud to be able to represent Australia. ""I've also been thinking a lot about the people in lockdown, particularly women facing domestic violence, and I'm proud to be able to be a voice for those who don't have one."" Ms McCardel holds multiple records for endurance swimming, including the longest ratified unassisted ocean swim in 2014, when she covered 77.3 miles (124.4km) in 41.5 hours in the waters around the Bahamas. In 2017, she became the first person to attempt a quadruple non-stop crossing of the English Channel, but she was not successful in completing the 84-mile journey. The feat wasfinally achieved by Sarah Thomas, from the United States, last year- one year after she was treated for breast cancer.

Donald Trump's younger brother dies,"Robert Trump, pictured here after his brother's election win in 2016, used to manage Trump's real-estate investments President Donald Trump has paid tribute to his ""best friend"" and youngest brother following his death at 71. ""It is with [a] heavy heart I share that my wonderful brother, Robert, peacefully passed away tonight,"" he said in a statement on Saturday. The president had visited his brother in hospital in New York the day before his death, telling reporters: ""He's having a hard time."" It is unclear what caused Robert Trump's death. A number of US media reports suggested he had been seriously ill. ""He was not just my brother, he was my best friend,"" Donald Trump said in a statement on Saturday. ""His memory will live on in my heart forever."" President Trump's son Eric described his uncle as an ""incredible man - strong, kind and loyal to the core"". ""He will be deeply missed by our entire family,"" he wrote on Twitter. Trump's parents and siblings: What do we know of them? Robert was the youngest of Fred and Mary Anne Trump's five children, and was born two years after his brother Donald. The eldest of the children, Fred Jr, died in 1981. An undated photo of the Trump siblings, from left to right: Robert, Elizabeth, Fred, Donald and Maryanne Robert Trump spent much of his career with the family real-estate firm, becoming a top executive. Unlike his brother, however, he was said not to court publicity and lived semi-retired in New York state. In his 1987 book The Art of the Deal, Donald Trump wrote that ""Robert gets along with almost everyone, which is great for me since I sometimes have to be the bad guy"". In a 2016 interview with the New York Post ahead of the presidential election, the younger brother said ""I support Donald one thousand percent"". He recently went to court in a failed bid to stop publication of his niece Mary Trump's tell-all book about the president, How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man. He divorced his first wife Blaine over a decade ago and married Ann Marie Pallan in March this year. Five claims in Trump niece's tell-all book According to the Post, Robert spent more than a week in the intensive-care unit of Manhattan's Mount Sinai Hospital in June.

Eat out scheme causing 'hostility towards staff',"The Tavern Inn says the scheme has ""brought us nothing but negativity"" Some restaurants and pubs are withdrawing from the Eat Out to Help Out scheme because of ""hostility towards staff"". Under the scheme the government pays half of the bill on meals served from Monday to Wednesdays throughout August. Owners says a surge in demand on these days has led to staff being shouted at, and ""physical and mental stress"". In tourist-heavy areas like the South West many say the scheme is not helping at an already busy time of year. Some say fewer customers are dining on other weekdays as a result. The Treasury said the scheme was working. UK Hospitality, which represents the industry, said generally the feedback had been ""very positive for businesses who were staring ruin in the face"". However, The Tavern Inn in Newquay is one venue that has pulled out of the discount scheme, which iscapped at Â£10 per diner and does not include alcoholic drinks.,external Nina Eyles is frustrated that the scheme has left her restaurant quiet on other days of the week Owner Kelly Hill said: ""It has brought us nothing but negativity due to the huge demand, causing long waits on food, tables over-running and hostility towards our staff. ""People are ordering big, big meals; they are not willing to wait for their food; our staff are being shouted at for having no tables, or for the service being slow. It's put an awful lot of strain on our waiting staff and kitchen staff."" The Heron Inn in Truro has also opted out, saying on Facebook: ""Safety is our main priority, and with the increased amount of people visiting us, it is making it difficult for us to manage with social distancing rules in place. ""We have received unpleasant comments and general unwelcome behaviour from customers when they are unable to find a table due to us having reached capacity"". Steph Dyer and Pete Kenwood own the Westleigh Inn and have opted out of the Eat Out to Help Out scheme The Westleigh Inn near Bideford in Devon has also withdrawn because of the ""physical and mental stress it has put us and all our staff under"". Landlady Steph Dyer said that ""the idea is brilliant, but just not in August. Do it in October. Everybody I have spoken to is finding it difficult to maintain standards of service"". In Crantock near Newquay, the C-Bay bistro says the scheme has led to a loss of business because people are not booking for the days when it is not running. Owner Nina Eyles said: ""In July we were full every day, but now Mondays to Wednesdays are absolutely manic and we are much quieter than normal on the other days. ""If it was in winter we would be so grateful and it would have been amazing."" The Treasury said the scheme was designed to protect jobs. ""Sales for pubs and restaurants were up by a third for the first week of the scheme, compared with the week before,"" it said.

Mass protest eclipses Belarus leader's rally,"This video can not be played Large crowds of anti-government demonstrators rallied in the capital Tens of thousands of opponents of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko have gathered in Minsk to protest against disputed elections. The ""March for Freedom"" in the centre of the capital comes amid growing anger over alleged poll-rigging and police violence at subsequent protests. Meanwhile, in an address to a smaller crowd of several thousand, Mr Lukashenko blasted opponents as ""rats"". He called on supporters to defend their country and independence. The rival rallies were taking place after Russia agreed to offer security assistance in the case of external military threats to Belarus. It emerged that Mr Lukashenko had twice spoken to President Vladimir Putin over the weekend. The long-time Belarus leader also voiced concerns over Nato military exercises taking place in neighbouring Poland and Lithuania and launched into a tirade against the Western military alliance. A pro-government demonstration in central Minsk has so far been small Nato - which sent four battle groups led by Britain, Canada, Germany and the US to the Baltic countries after Moscow's annexation of Crimea in Ukraine - rejected allegations of a build-up in the region. The unrest in Belarus erupted after Mr Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory in last Sunday's election, the result of which has been condemned amid widespread allegations of vote-rigging. 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change 'If you croak we don't care': Brutality in Belarus Five things you may not know about the country Watch: Opposition leader speaks from exile The Central Election Commission says Mr Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, won 80.1% of the vote and the main opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya 10.12%. But Ms Tikhanovskaya insists that where votes were properly counted, she won support ranging from 60% to 70%. Russian TV news bulletins have been making ominous parallels between Belarus 2020 and Ukraine 2014. Ukraine's pro-Western revolution led to Moscow sending in its special operations forces to annex Crimea and Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Six years on, could Russia's military intervene in Belarus? On paper, at least, such a move would appear counter-productive. The opposition movement in Belarus is not anti-Russia/pro-Europe - it is anti-Lukashenko. If Russia were to send in troops to shore up the Belarusian leader, it risks alienating the Belarusian people and creating anti-Moscow sentiment. True, Moscow is determined to keep Belarus within what it sees as Russia's sphere of influence. The Kremlin's ultimate goal is deeper integration with its neighbour - a fully-fledged union state (with Vladimir Putin at the helm). It could still achieve this through political leverage. The Kremlin has a pathological fear of ""coloured revolution"" on its doorstep. But Minsk 2020 is not Kyiv 2014. Belarus is not choosing between East and West. The Belarusian people are outraged by the brutality of their security forces. So much so that even Mr Lukashenko's traditional base - including the state factory workers - are deserting him. Local media reports suggest that around 31,000 people took part in the pro-government rally, though the Ministry of Internal Affairs estimated that the number was closer to 65,000. Speaking to supporters, Mr Lukashenko said he did not like rallies and did not need anyone to defend him. He said it was not his fault that he had to ask for their help. Rejecting calls for a re-run of the presidential election he said Belarus would ""die as a state"" if that happened. Mr Lukashenko described the opposition as rats ""You came here so that for the first time in a quarter-century you could defend your country, your independence, your wives, sisters and children,"" he said. He added that the opposition would ""crawl like rats out of a hole"" if they were not suppressed this time. ""This will be the beginning of your end - you will go down on your knees like in Ukraine and other countries and pray, God knows to whom."" What's happening in Belarus? There were reports of state sector workers being forced to attend or face the threat of losing their jobs. For days, workers at state-run factories have staged walkouts and many have joined street marches against the president. As the president spoke, around 220,000 of anti-Lukashenko protesters gathered near the Stela Minsk Hero City World War Two memorial in central Minsk,according to news website Tut.by,external. They had answered a call for weekend rallies from Ms Tikhanovskaya. The opposition leader had gone into exile in Lithuania after she registered a complaint with electoral authorities and spent seven hours in detention. Maria Kolesnikova, a former member of Ms Tikhanovskaya's team, addressed the crowds. ""You are incredible, I love you"", she said,before appealing to officials, security officials and judges. ""Guys, this is the last chance. Take the side of the good and the people. We are in the majority. We are power."" Supporters also turned out in other cities. The mayor of Brest was booed by protesters when he tried to speak to crowds. In Gomel, demonstrators removed the official flag of Belarus from the city's flagpole and replaced it with the red and white flag of the opposition. Thousands complained that the state broadcaster gave a skewed picture of the protests Belarusian footballer Ilya Shkurinannounced he would not play for his country until President Lukashenko stepped down,externaland then scored his first goal for Russian premier league team CSKA Moscow. As the unrest continued, Mr Lukashenko sought help from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Lukashenko said President Putin had promised to provide what he called comprehensive assistance in the event of external military threats to Belarus. The two leaders had a second conversation on Sunday, in which the Kremlin said they discussed ""the situation in Belarus, taking into consideration the pressure the republic was being put under from outside"".

"A-levels: 22,000 sign grade change petition","Students gathered outside the Senedd to protest against the grading system A petition calling for students to receive teacher predicted exam grades has been signed by 22,000 people. It was set up after 42% of A-level grades predicted by teachers were lowered by the exams watchdog. Students wearing masks and holding placardsprotested against the systemoutside the Senedd on Sunday. Education Minister Kirsty Williams has confirmedappeals will be allowedif ""there is evidence"" pupils should have received higher grades. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, who addressed protesters outside the Welsh Parliament, said he was considering legal action against the exam watchdog, Qualifications Wales, and the Welsh Government over the system, which he said had ""stolen"" young people's futures. In England, the exam watchdog, Ofqual is facing two judicial review cases, and Mr Price said Plaid was in talks to bring similar legal action in Wales. ""We can win and must win this fight,"" he said. Jo Maugham QC, of the Good Law Project which is supporting students launching a judicial review in England, said the group was ""very keen"" to do the same in Wales. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, exams were cancelled this year with students' final grades based on teachers' estimations. Results overall improved on 2019 figures for the very top grades and at grades A* to C. 'Unfair' A-level results claim as grades lowered Lower grades than estimated 'not the best' Ofqual reviewing exam appeals guidance in England Senedd committee recalled over A-level results But 42% were downgraded by exams watchdog Qualifications Wales after it judged the grades were ""too generous"". On Wednesday, hours before students found out their results, the education minister guaranteed that no-one would get a lower grade in their A-level than they achieved in their AS result. The petition wants all students receiving grades this year to be given those predicted by teachers, with GCSE results due on Thursday. It said the grades process ""does not treat Welsh students as individuals"". ""This will disadvantage Welsh young people in their future life chances, which is unfair,"" it said. Students heard speeches from Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price Sally Holland, Children's Commissioner for Wales, has called for universities to honour offers given to students, based on personal statements, assessments, references, and interviews prior to the pandemic. In an open letter to Universities UK, the body representing universities, Prof Holland, alongside the UK's three other children's commissioners, said ""rights to an education and to fair and equal treatment have been severely compromised"". ""Many students have had little chance to progress their education since those offers were made,"" they write. ""It is unfair to now reject individuals whose results have been arrived at by a system that is likely to have produced individual anomalies."" Happy students in Swansea on Thursday but not all A-level pupils got the grades they expected Plaid education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian told BBC Radio WalesSunday Supplementprogramme that GCSE students ""must be really worried now, looking forward to Thursday and thinking gosh, you know, am I gonna be downgraded too?"" Some A-level students have spoken of getting results up totwo grades lower than predicted, and being rejected by universities after not meeting required grades. Ms Gwenllian, who represents Arfon in the Senedd, said: ""It's quite obvious that this moderation system has thrown up all this chaos."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price was one of the speakers at the protest at the Senedd steps First year A-Level student Cai Parry, from Cardiff, who has organised the protest in Cardiff Bay on Sunday, said the grades appeals process was ""too little too late"" for those trying to secure university places in September. ""I hope that teacher assessed grades will be fully instated,"" he said. Student Chris Wheatley said he had been on the phone to universities for hours Chris Wheatley had planned to go to the University of Southampton to study Aeronautics and Astronautics in the autumn. He told BBC Wales he had been predicted an A* in maths the whole way through his studies, but when he opened his results he had been given a C. ""I applied to Southampton and Warwick, and they have seen that C, and they have declined both of my offers,"" he said. ""I've been on the phone to them for hours on end, for days now, just reassuring them, these aren't my grades, there is something happening about this."" The Welsh Parliament is on its summer break, but the Children, Young People and Education Committee has beenrecalledand will meet on Tuesday. The exam board WJEC is set to outline further details on the process to submit appeals early in the week. Students gathered outside the Senedd on Sunday to protest against the system The Welsh Government said more than 4,000 students would benefit from the guarantee that no final grade would be lower than an AS grade. ""This is around 15% of all A-level students and makes a significant difference to the overall impact of variations between final grades and centre assessed grades,"" said a spokesperson. ""Even before the AS floor, 94% of the grades are the same as or within one grade of the centre assessed grades."" The spokesperson said Qualification Wales and the WJEC would share the full details but appeals could now be made where there was evidence of internal assessments judged by the school or college to be at a higher grade than the grade awarded.

Pupils can appeal 'lower than predicted' A-levels,"This video can not be played Bradley Desmier was predicted a B, C and a merit but got a D, E and a pass Pupils can appeal A-level grades if they are lower than what was predicted by teachers following an outcry over results. Pupils had accused the Welsh Government of ""abandoning them"" after 42% of grades were lowered by the exams watchdog. Education Minister Kirsty Williams has confirmed appeals will be allowed if ""there is evidence"" pupils should have received higher grades. She said it gave ""clarity"" to students. Ms Williams said the broadening of appeals by Qualifications Wales, meant students could now appeal if there was ""evidence of internal assessments that has been judged by the school or college to be at a higher grade than the grade they have been awarded"". Students receiving results at Ysgol Glan Clwyd on Thursday The Welsh Government had faced backlash from students, teachers, education bodies, and some of its own backbenchers, following the publication of A-level results on Thursday. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, exams were cancelled this year, with students' final grades based on teachers' estimations. Unfair results claim after grades lowered A-level results in Wales: Senedd committee recalled But the exam watchdog, Qualifications Wales, lowered more than 40% of grades in a standardisation process after finding some teachers had been ""too generous"". The detail of the results also showed more pupils on free school meals saw their A-levels downgraded - 48.1% - compared to 45.3% for pupils not eligible. On Wednesday, hours before students found out their results, the education minister guaranteed that no-one would get a lower grade in their A-level than they achieved in their AS result. Ms Williams had said she had to act to stop Welsh students being ""disadvantaged"" following changes to results in England, and Scotland. But with the last-minute intervention coming after results had already been sent to schools and colleges, there are concerns that universities may judge applications on the grades already issued, before that revision takes effect. Some students have spoken of getting results up to two grades lower than predicted, and being rejected by universities after not meeting required grades. The latest guidance from Qualifications Wales now states: An appeal can now be made on the grounds that there is evidence of internal assessment that has been judged by the school or college to be at a higher grade than the calculated grade awarded. Internal assessment evidence will need to meet specific criteria ""which is being finalised and will be published shortly"". If the appeal is successful, the learner's grade will be revised ""to be the same as their internal assessment grade"" but no higher than the centre assessment grade. The watchdog said: ""We have worked closely with WJEC [exam board] and considered the changes being introduced in England to find the best way forward for Welsh learners. As a result, it said, it was extending the grounds for appeal for this summer's GCSE, AS and A levels, and the Welsh Bacc qualifications. This does not go as far as saying pupils who are unhappy will get the grade estimated for them by teachers. But it does allow appeals to be based on some of the evidence used by schools and colleges to decide those grades. The big difference is that before this change, appeals could only be pursued on administrative grounds - for example, concerns that the exam board had used the wrong data. There'll be more information in the next couple of days but there are some immediate questions about the practicalities of it all. In view of the uproar since grades were published, it is inevitable there will be a huge number of appeals now the criteria has been opened up. But how quickly can those be dealt with, when in many cases places at university depend on the result. Some will still argue that it would be more straightforward and fairer to issue the original grades submitted by teachers, as happened in Scotland. The Welsh Government's, WJEC and Qualifications Wales handling of the exam results process is set to be examined by a Senedd committee next week. Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price has urged the Welsh Government to ensure pupils in Wales are awarded lower grades received their predicted results instead. ""I would rather trust in teachers than an algorithm when it comes to a fair assessment of how a pupil would perform in an exam,"" he said. Reacting to the development he tweeted: ""Instead of adding yet more complexity and uncertainty, Welsh Govt should simply admit the failure and accept the teacher assessed grades."" Conservative MS Darren Millar earlier had called the situation ""a mess"" and urged a review. ""There have been A-grades downgraded to D's and B's to U's without any explanation or justification as to why these decisions have been made, and without regard to evidence provided by teachers on the progress of their students."" The Conservatives' education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said while she was pleased the Welsh Government had changed the appeals process, there needed to be guarantees the system would ""not collapse under the demand"". ""If that guarantee can't be given then today's announcement may still not allay concerns. I look forward to those guarantees being given swiftly and with confidence or this will not be going away,"" she said.

'Unfair' A-level results claim as grades lowered,"This video can not be played Bradley Desmier was predicted a B, C and a merit but got a D, E and a pass A-level results day in Wales has been overshadowed by claims that results for some pupils are ""utterly unfair and unfathomable"". Top grades have risen despite a chaotic summer when exams were cancelled. But more than 42% of final grades were lowered from those estimated by teachers, after the exams watchdog called them ""too generous"". The education minister has pledgedgrades would be no lower than pupils' earlier AS results. Up to 4,500 may now be given improved grades, which exam board officials have promised to do as soon as possible. There has still been strong criticism by teaching unions and some head teachers, who claim pupils were being ""short changed"" and the calculations had placed an over-emphasis on last year's AS-levels. One further education organisation has called for a review of the process. But Education Minister Kirsty Williams said she was confident the system was fair and ""very robust"". ""In any year under normal circumstances, sometimes the grades of a student... do not meet the expectations of maybe the teacher, or maybe the student and that's not different this year,"" she said. ""Clearly, I wish we had not been in a position to make last-minute changes but [students] can be absolutely confident that the exams that they have achieved today are as good as exams that were taken last year."" A pupil from Swansea looks at her results, a situation experienced by thousands around Wales How it happened: Students receive their coronavirus-hit A-level results Heads warn of 'unfair' grades for A-level students The late intervention by Ms Williams on Wednesday followed an outcry in Scotland after thousands of results were initially downgraded,sparking changes in other parts of the UK. WJEC chief executive, Ian Morgan, said he thought the system had been ""fair and balanced."" ""We probably looked at a dozen different models and it was felt, from a WJEC perspective, and signed off by Qualifications Wales, that the approach we took was the fairest in the circumstances,"" he said. Mr Morgan said there would ""inevitably"" be appeals. ""It's about ensuring that we are fair and consistent in that appeals process,"" he said. He said his organisation had done ""the best that we possibly can in the circumstances."" A record proportion of A and A* grades - 29.9%, up 2.9 percentage points from 2019. But this is less than the 40.4% estimated after the initial teacher assessments 42.2% of final A-level grades are lower than the predicted grades based on assessment, 53.7% are the same and 4.1% are higher The proportion achieving A* is 10.8% - adjusted downwards from the original estimate of 15.4% More pupils on free school meals saw their A-levels downgraded - 48.1%, compared to 45.3% for pupils not eligible 98.6% achieved passes A*-E, up 1% on 2019 The gap between boys and girls is slightly wider than last year - with A* to C grades for 76.5% of boys and 82.3% of girls 22.2% achieved an A* or A for AS-levels, up 1.9 percentage points from last year. Education Minister Kirsty Williams meets students at Merthyr College The qualifications watchdog found that the estimated grades by teachers had been too generous in Wales. If you look at the last 10 years, usually about a quarter of grades are at the very top -last year it was around 27%, when record numbers of pupils got A and A*s. But Qualifications Wales found if it had gone along with the estimates for this summer then more than 40% would have been A and A* grades. Results day rituals put on hold How will I get my exam results this year? Following the revision, the majority of students (53.7%) have been given their original assessment grade while the remainder (42.2%) get a lower grade. A small proportion get a higher grade. Altogether, 37% were downgraded by a single grade and 5% were dropped two grades. But once ministers in England and Scotland had stepped in to overrule the usual exam moderation practices it was inevitable that Wales would have to follow suit. Students who get their grades today are being told if their results are lower than their earlier AS-level grades, they will be issued with revised ones by the WJEC as soon as possible. Student's 'terrifying experience' during pandemic Paralympic ambitions for injured horse-riding teen Student's grief and Ramadan in lockdown Education expert Gareth Evans, from the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, said some students would still wonder if they might have performed better than expected. ""While it will doubtless be of some comfort to those who performed well at the halfway stage of their A-levels, it will be of scant consolation to those pinning their hopes on boosting scores at the end of the course,"" he said. ""Issues with the artificial moderation of grades allocated by teachers remains. The right of pupils to challenge their grades as appropriate is absolutely essential."" Eithne Hughes, director of theÂ ASCL Cymru union said:  ""We have received many calls from school leaders expressing their frustration, confusion, and disappointment at the results awarded to their students. ""They report that grades have been pulled down in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable, and they are extremely concerned about the detrimental impact on the young people concerned.""Â Â Neil Foden, a north Wales-based member of the national executive of the National Education Union, said that from his contact with schools, more than 90% of headteachers were unhappy with the grades. ""There is real concern in schools about the number of learners whose results have been downgraded from the teacher estimates,"" he said. Dilwyn Roberts-Young, of Welsh teaching union Ucac, said: ""There remains serious concern that there are many discrepancies at individual and centre level, in spite of the education minister's pledge last night. ""The last-minute changes and the results of individuals are inevitably going to create anxiety and we hope we will not see this repeated next week."" Colegau Cymru - an education charity representing further education providers - has called for an urgent review of the awarding process. It said there had been ""considerable inequalities"" in the results of individual learners. Director of development Kelly Edwards said: ""We must ensure that the grades awarded are fair and accurate so that learners can progress on their chosen path."" Qualifications Wales chief executive Philip Blaker said this year's process had not disadvantaged particular groups of pupils and the grades were ""meaningful and robust"". ""We have analysed attainment gaps this year relative to previous years - looking at aspects such as gender, age and eligibility for free school meals"", he said. ""Our analysis shows no statistically significant differences this year relative to other years."" The results show Wales has proportionately more pupils with top grades and grades A* to C than in England, but fewer than in Northern Ireland. There had also been a 3.3% rise in the proportion of A* to C grades in Wales, higher than elsewhere. And the performance at both A* to C and A*-A grades in Wales is higher than in all regions of England, apart from the south east, which is only slightly higher. Sophie Price, 18, from Bassaleg, Newport, is aiming to start a fashion buying course in London but was told online that she did not have the right grades. ""I was freaking out, I didn't know what to do,"" she said.Â ""There's not a lot of guidance on what to do - you're just left there. You can't really ring them, you have to email them and then you're waiting for an email back.Â ""Quite a lot of people I know have got lower than they were predicted.Â  Lots of people have been predicted Cs and got Us."" Sophie passed her Welsh Bac and got a D in business and E in art; she was predicted two Cs. Her art mark will be upgraded because of her AS grade last year but she will now need to appeal against her business grade, although her university said it will keep her place open for now. ""I don't have a back-up plan - I was so set on the one thing.Â ""It's a bit heart-breaking, you don't really know what else to do.Â  It's hard when your future's in the hands of other people and you have no control over it."" Caitlyn Foley said she had a ""faint idea but it went better than I was expecting"" At Merthyr College, Caitlyn Foley got an A* and three As. ""It's been a bit weird having to deal with all the changes so last minute,"" she said. ""We thought the teacher's predicted grades were final but then we found out that there was a bit more than that,"" she said. ""Obviously the announcement last night that we wouldn't get less than what we got in AS, that was a bit reassuring."" Fellow student Tom Bush, who got an A and two Bs, added: ""I've actually got lower now than I had at AS in Psychology which is odd but hopefully I'll go up."" Zac Evans may appeal his design and technology grade Zac Evans, a pupil at Ysgol Glan Clwyd, St Asaph, said he got Cs in art, design and technology, and an E in PE. ""I'm going to look into an appeal with the hope of getting a higher grade in DT because I was hoping for a B but it will all be OK in the long run. ""I've just had advice from the headmaster and they'll be releasing how the application process works on Monday because they say it's changing and I'll be looking into it."" The Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC) in Cardiff is the main exam board and will handle appeals Qualifications Wales has been asked to quickly make any relevant adjustments to the appeals process and liaise with other exam regulators. The advice to pupils getting results is: If your A-level grade is the same or higher than your AS-level, then no action is required. If the grade is lower it will be replaced with the same grade as that received for the AS-level - and revised grades will be issued by WJEC as soon as possible. It is believed this could involve between 3,000 and 4,500 grades. If needed, students can contact their prospective university to advise them of the change. As things stand, appeals have to be made through a school or college, rather than direct to the WJEC exam board - and there are limited grounds. These are restricted to the process - such as the exam board using the wrong data to calculate a final grade. It will not allow schools and colleges to rethink their estimated grades or ranking of pupils. If other mistakes are highlighted through an appeal, the other pupils affected will not see their grades lowered, the exam board has said. Students pose for a photograph with their A-level results at Ffynone House School in Swansea Jackie Parker, head of Crickhowell School in Powys said: ""We will all be working to look through every individual child's performance data to look at what results they've achieved and to ensure if appeals are necessary they are going forward positively. ""I think the WJEC and others have tried to be as fair as they can but I personally think there's more work to do here. ""For me, the moral purpose of leadership is to ensure that our young people are not disadvantaged in any way."" Lisa Thomas, principal of Merthyr College, said it had been a very unsettling time and results would now be closely scrutinised. ""If we feel that there are learners that have been disadvantaged in any way then we would be looking to use the appeals process,"" she said. Exams were cancelled after schools were closed in March Is there a fair way to award grades without exams? Even exams can be unfair. Some of us perform badly under exam pressure, and two people marking the same paper can give different grades. But this year's assessment had left many people feeling their future chances have been harmed by a computer model. The awarding body put in place a system that led to more than 40% of grades being downgraded to stop grade inflation. But on the eve of results day thousands of students were rescued when the Welsh Government announced students that achieved higher AS grades are entitled to have their A-level result upgraded to match. Information available to calculate grades differs across the UK: like in Northern Ireland, AS results contribute to overall A-level results in Wales and therefore can be taken into account. However, this doesn't happen in England - where AS grades have no bearing to A-level results. Research suggests that using AS performance can improve the overall accuracy of grades. It still means that if a school has a stronger year group than last year, or if teaching has improved, that might not be fully recognised this year. Grades could be calculated using a range of evidence including work to date, mock exams and teacher assessed grades, but even experts can't agree on a perfect way to navigate yet another difficult problem caused by the coronavirus. There has been concern about how the ""standardisation"" process looks at schools and colleges' previous results. In Wales, this does not apply to the process for A-levels, the Welsh Bacc and some GCSEs where you already have a lot of hard data from previous assessment - such as AS-levels - to work from. But average results from 2017-19 are taken into account when standardising most GCSEs. Schools could appeal to the WJEC if they think there were significant circumstances or events in those previous years which might bring the average down. However, currently there is no scope for pupils to appeal against the grade they were given by their school or college - the Centre Assessment Grade (CAG). If pupils have concerns about bias or discrimination in allocating those grades, they can appeal to the WJEC and a process similar to a malpractice complaint would be followed, but those are expected to be rare. In other years there can be requests for exam scripts to be reviewed, but this is obviously not an option when no exams have been taken. The minister has announced, however, that the appeal process will be free for all students. Qualifications Wales has set a 17 September deadline for initial reviews andthen a 42-day deadline for appeals to be dealt with by the WJEC exam board,external. A further independent review is possible.

Wrecked Mauritius oil spill ship breaks in two,"This video can not be played Aerial footage showed the remains of the MV Wakashio A Japanese bulk carrier that has leaked hundreds of tonnes of fuel oil off the Mauritius coast has broken apart, authorities in the island nation say. The MV Wakashio ran aground on a coral reefon 25 July with 4,000 tonnes of the fuel, causing an ecological emergency. Most of the fuel had already been pumped out, officials said, but on Saturday the ship's condition worsened. Mauritius is home to world-renowned coral reefs, and popular with tourists. The MV Wakashio ran aground at Pointe d'Esny, a known sanctuary for rare wildlife. The area also contains wetlands designated as a site of international importance by the Ramsar convention on wetlands. ""At around 4.30pm [12:30 GMT], a major detachment of the vessel's forward section was observed,"" the Mauritius National Crisis Committee said in a statement on Saturday. Satellite images showed the moment the MV Wakashio began breaking up on Saturday About 90 tonnes of the fuel were believed to be still on board when the vessel split. The committee said booms had been reinforced near the vessel to absorb any more oil that leaked out. Coast guard vessels have been positioned in the area. Mauritius has said it will seek compensation for the leak from ""the owner and the insurer"". Japanese firm Nagashiki Shipping has pledged to respond to requests for compensation. Africa Live: News and views from the continent Why the Mauritius oil spill is so serious What is Mauritius like? Mauritian Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth said in recent days that more than 3,000 of the 4,000 tonnes of oil from the ship's fuel reservoirs had been pumped out. This video can not be played More than 1,000 tonnes of oil has leaked into waters near Mauritius The removed fuel has been transferred to shore by helicopter and to another ship owned by the same Japanese firm. One of the best assessments of the spill has come via Earth observation assets. The US analytics company Ursa Space Systems looked at the situation using radar data from the Finnish Iceye satellites, which are especially effective at picking out oil on water. It found a 27 sq km spill by 11 August. BBC World Service environment correspondent Navid Singh Khadka says a spill three times the size of this was averted. Nevertheless a uniquely biodiversity-rich marine ecosystem has been polluted with nearly 1,000 tonnes of fuel oil. Last week, Mr Jugnauth declared a state of emergency and appealed for international help. Since then, volunteers have also been collecting straw from fields and filling sacks to make barriers against the oil. Others have made their owntubes with tights and hair to add to the effort,external, and some have been cleaning up the island's beaches. Their actions went against an order from the government asking people to leave the clean-up to local authorities. Communities have rallied together to protect their island Greenpeace Africa has warned that ""thousands"" of animal species were ""at risk of drowning in a sea of pollution, with dire consequences for Mauritius's economy, food security and health"". An oceanographer and environmental engineer in Mauritius, Vassen Kauppaymuthoo, told the BBC that local residents were now ""breathing heavy vapours of oil"", and there was a ""mixture of sadness and anger"" over the spill. Police in Mauritius say they have been granted a search warrant, allowing them to board the vessel to take away items of interest such as the ship's log book in order to help with an investigation. The ship's captain will assist officers with their search.

Climber 'critical' after nine-hour rescue bid,"A climber is in a critical condition in hospital after being found unconscious and with serious injuries by a mountain rescue team investigating a rock fall. Skye Mountain Rescue Team said the man had suffered a significant fall near Sgurr Dubh na Da Bheinn on Friday. He was airlifted to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary during a nine-hour operation.

Sea search for missing brothers called off,"Muhammad Azhar Shabbir, left, and his brother Ali Athar Shabbir are still missing at sea A search for two teenagers missing off the Lancashire coast since Saturday night has been called off. The boys have been named as brothers Muhammad Azhar Shabbir, aged 18, and Ali Athar Shabbir, aged 16, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. The coastguard, RNLI and police were called to reports of three youths in difficulty in the water at St Annes at 18:40 BST on Saturday. Their cousin, aged 15, managed to swim ashore and was treated for hypothermia. Lancashire Police said the searches by HM Coastguard and the RNLI continued well into Saturday night, and the force's helicopter joined the search in daylight. Officers said the search had been stood down by lunchtime on Sunday, but ""may reconvene later"". In a statement the force said: ""Sadly, despite searching for a number of hours, our colleagues at HM Coastguard and the RNLI have been unable to find [the missing brothers], who got into difficulty in water close to St Anne's Pier yesterday evening."" More stories across Yorkshire The weather was beautiful yesterday and hundreds of families like mine were enjoying their day out on the beach. At about 18:00 BST we saw lots of activity outside the RNLI station - people being moved out of the way as crews, ambulances and police cars arrived. The family, from Yorkshire, was on a day trip, when the three males, aged 15, 16 and 18, went out into the water. Luckily the 15-year-old managed to swim to safety - the family tell me he is a really good swimmer - but the other two couldn't get out. When I left at about 23:00 the search was still continuing with a helicopter and two boats out. So many people were still stood on the promenade, hoping for some good news. This morning, police have said the search has resumed and the family has told me the 15-year-old boy has hypothermia and is in hospital. He is clearly shocked by what has happened.

Rival rallies as Belarus leader fights back,"This video can not be played Large crowds of anti-government demonstrators rallied in the capital Tens of thousands of opponents of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko have gathered in Minsk to protest against disputed elections. The ""March for Freedom"" in the centre of the capital comes amid growing anger over alleged poll-rigging and police violence at subsequent protests. Meanwhile, in an address to a smaller crowd of several thousand, Mr Lukashenko blasted opponents as ""rats"". He called on supporters to defend their country and independence. The rival rallies were taking place after Russia agreed to offer security assistance in the case of external military threats to Belarus. It emerged that Mr Lukashenko had twice spoken to President Vladimir Putin over the weekend. The long-time Belarus leader also voiced concerns over Nato military exercises taking place in neighbouring Poland and Lithuania and launched into a tirade against the Western military alliance. A pro-government demonstration in central Minsk has so far been small Nato - which sent four battle groups led by Britain, Canada, Germany and the US to the Baltic countries after Moscow's annexation of Crimea in Ukraine - rejected allegations of a build-up in the region. The unrest in Belarus erupted after Mr Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory in last Sunday's election, the result of which has been condemned amid widespread allegations of vote-rigging. 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change 'If you croak we don't care': Brutality in Belarus Five things you may not know about the country Watch: Opposition leader speaks from exile The Central Election Commission says Mr Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, won 80.1% of the vote and the main opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya 10.12%. But Ms Tikhanovskaya insists that where votes were properly counted, she won support ranging from 60% to 70%. Russian TV news bulletins have been making ominous parallels between Belarus 2020 and Ukraine 2014. Ukraine's pro-Western revolution led to Moscow sending in its special operations forces to annex Crimea and Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Six years on, could Russia's military intervene in Belarus? On paper, at least, such a move would appear counter-productive. The opposition movement in Belarus is not anti-Russia/pro-Europe - it is anti-Lukashenko. If Russia were to send in troops to shore up the Belarusian leader, it risks alienating the Belarusian people and creating anti-Moscow sentiment. True, Moscow is determined to keep Belarus within what it sees as Russia's sphere of influence. The Kremlin's ultimate goal is deeper integration with its neighbour - a fully-fledged union state (with Vladimir Putin at the helm). It could still achieve this through political leverage. The Kremlin has a pathological fear of ""coloured revolution"" on its doorstep. But Minsk 2020 is not Kyiv 2014. Belarus is not choosing between East and West. The Belarusian people are outraged by the brutality of their security forces. So much so that even Mr Lukashenko's traditional base - including the state factory workers - are deserting him. Local media reports suggest that around 31,000 people took part in the pro-government rally, though the Ministry of Internal Affairs estimated that the number was closer to 65,000. Speaking to supporters, Mr Lukashenko said he did not like rallies and did not need anyone to defend him. He said it was not his fault that he had to ask for their help. Rejecting calls for a re-run of the presidential election he said Belarus would ""die as a state"" if that happened. Mr Lukashenko described the opposition as rats ""You came here so that for the first time in a quarter-century you could defend your country, your independence, your wives, sisters and children,"" he said. He added that the opposition would ""crawl like rats out of a hole"" if they were not suppressed this time. ""This will be the beginning of your end - you will go down on your knees like in Ukraine and other countries and pray, God knows to whom."" What's happening in Belarus? There were reports of state sector workers being forced to attend or face the threat of losing their jobs. For days, workers at state-run factories have staged walkouts and many have joined street marches against the president. As the president spoke, around 220,000 of anti-Lukashenko protesters gathered near the Stela Minsk Hero City World War Two memorial in central Minsk,according to news website Tut.by,external. They had answered a call for weekend rallies from Ms Tikhanovskaya. The opposition leader had gone into exile in Lithuania after she registered a complaint with electoral authorities and spent seven hours in detention. Maria Kolesnikova, a former member of Ms Tikhanovskaya's team, addressed the crowds. ""You are incredible, I love you"", she said,before appealing to officials, security officials and judges. ""Guys, this is the last chance. Take the side of the good and the people. We are in the majority. We are power."" Supporters also turned out in other cities. The mayor of Brest was booed by protesters when he tried to speak to crowds. In Gomel, demonstrators removed the official flag of Belarus from the city's flagpole and replaced it with the red and white flag of the opposition. Thousands complained that the state broadcaster gave a skewed picture of the protests Belarusian footballer Ilya Shkurinannounced he would not play for his country until President Lukashenko stepped down,externaland then scored his first goal for Russian premier league team CSKA Moscow. As the unrest continued, Mr Lukashenko sought help from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Lukashenko said President Putin had promised to provide what he called comprehensive assistance in the event of external military threats to Belarus. The two leaders had a second conversation on Sunday, in which the Kremlin said they discussed ""the situation in Belarus, taking into consideration the pressure the republic was being put under from outside"".

Home working and local lockdowns 'more popular',"The public's appetite for working from home and local lockdowns if a Covid-19 vaccine cannot be found appears to be growing, research suggests. King's College London (KCL) has been tracking attitudes during the pandemic. Results from a survey reveal that 86% believe that, until a vaccine is found, workers should be able to decide whether they returned to the office. Experts said the results show people are prioritising public health over the economy and their social lives. A total of 87% of people questioned said that they would accept local lockdowns being imposed in the future, with 85% saying they would accept their own local area being subject to such limitations. Campaign aims to reassure parents on pupil safety Ofqual 'reviewing' exam appeals guidance Areas of England and Scotland which have seen a spike in casesare currently subject to local lockdowns to help stop the spread of Covid-19. Prof Bobby Duffy, director of the policy institute at KCL, said the public seemed ""more convinced"" of the need for local lockdowns ""reflecting the extent to which people are still prioritising public health over the economy and their own social lives"". The live entertainment industry is one of many to have taken a hit while restrictions have been in place. How will the world vaccinate seven billion people? How close to developing a vaccine are we? Encouraging results in coronavirus vaccine trials Yet some 68% of those surveyed said they would accept a ban on major sporting or cultural events with a live audience. And as the governmentprepares to launch a campaign to persuade parentsin England that it will be safe for children to return to the classroom next month, attitudes towards home schooling remain almost unchanged since May. Some 49% of those surveyed said home schooling for most children long-term would be acceptable, compared to 51% a few months earlier. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area STRESS:How to look after your mental health Of those surveyed, 56% said they would accept parents being able to decide whether or not to send their children back to school - down from 63% in May. Gideon Skinner, research director at Ipsos MORI, which carried out the survey, said results show that few Britons expect a return to life as normal any time soon, with ""many prepared to undertake a wide range of measures over a longer period of time to reduce the risk of spread"". A total of 2,237 interviews were carried out online with UK residents aged 16-75 last month. Meanwhile,as the end to the furlough scheme approaches, the percentage of workers who feel certain or think it is likely they will lose their job has dropped from 29% to 25%, while 29% feel they are certain or likely to face significant financial difficulties - a decrease from 34%.

The boys have been named as brothers Muhammad Azhar Shabbir, aged 18, and Ali Athar Shabbir, aged 16, from Dewsbury, West Yorkshire. The coastguard, RNLI and police were called to reports of three youths in difficulty in the water at St Annes at 18:40 BST on Saturday. Their cousin, aged 15, managed to swim ashore and was treated for hypothermia. Lancashire Police said the searches by HM Coastguard and the RNLI continued well into Saturday night, and the force's helicopter joined the search in daylight. Officers said the search had been stood down by lunchtime on Sunday, but ""may reconvene later"". In a statement the force said: ""Sadly, despite searching for a number of hours, our colleagues at HM Coastguard and the RNLI have been unable to find [the missing brothers], who got into difficulty in water close to St Anne's Pier yesterday evening."" More stories across Yorkshire The weather was beautiful yesterday and hundreds of families like mine were enjoying their day out on the beach. At about 18:00 BST we saw lots of activity outside the RNLI station - people being moved out of the way as crews, ambulances and police cars arrived. The family, from Yorkshire, was on a day trip, when the three males, aged 15, 16 and 18, went out into the water. Luckily the 15-year-old managed to swim to safety - the family tell me he is a really good swimmer - but the other two couldn't get out. When I left at about 23:00 the search was still continuing with a helicopter and two boats out. So many people were still stood on the promenade, hoping for some good news. This morning, police have said the search has resumed and the family has told me the 15-year-old boy has hypothermia and is in hospital. He is clearly shocked by what has happened. Crews searched late into the night for the men and resumed their efforts on Sunday Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Four bars close after positive virus tests,"Tracers are attempting to contact a number of people who visited the Empire Club More than 100 people are at risk of having contracted coronavirus after four positive tests were linked to a pub in County Durham. Anyone who visited Stanley's Empire Club between Sunday 9 and Tuesday 11 August is asked to isolate for 14 days. Health chiefs are working to trace everyone who was there. The pub has closed, along with the town's Ball Alley, Phoenix Club and East Stanley Workingmen's Club, which have also been linked to virus cases. Amanda Healy, Durham County Council's director of public health, said her concerns were ""predominantly"" with the Empire Club. ""We're asking people to self-isolate because it's deemed they've been in close contact with someone who has tested positive. ""We think there's over 100 people who have been in the Empire over those three days. ""The club is working really closely with us and have gathered the addresses and telephone numbers of some of the people and we passed them on to NHS Test and Trace. ""However, it may take a little while for them to be contacted so we want to make an appeal for people to isolate to stop the spread of the virus as quickly as possible.""

Campaign aims to reassure parents on pupil safety,"An organised learning environment is vital to a child's development, the government will stress A campaign aimed at persuading parents in England it will be safe for children to return to the classroom in September is being launched by the government. Under the #backtoschoolsafely slogan, it will highlight the various measures being implemented to minimise the risk of coronavirus transmission. Boris Johnson said there was a""moral duty""to get pupils back to school. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was the PM's ""moral responsibility"" to ensure that schools reopen. Writing in theMail on Sunday,external, Sir Keir said he expected children to be back in the classroom in September ""no ifs, no buts, no equivocation"". ""It is the prime minister's responsibility to guarantee children get the education they need and the benefit of being back with their teachers and classmates,"" Sir Keir added. ""My offer to help the government reopen schools still stands, but responsibility for making it happen lies squarely at the door of Number 10."" Will pupils do a full school day next term? Moral duty to get all children back in school - PM Schools 'should be first to open, last to close' Last week, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson apologised to pupils who have missed out on several months of classes. The campaign, which will involve newspaper, digital, radio and billboard adverts, will strive to emphasise the importance of organised learning to children's development. Some families remain concerned about the potential risks to children when they start the new school year. Many will be starting at a new school altogether. The government initiative will point to guidance, endorsed by Public Health England, that ensures schools are Covid-secure. Some primary school children returned to school in June This guidance includes the introduction of staggered break times, increased hygiene and hand-washing, plus keeping pupils in consistent groups. At the same time, staff and pupils are being encouraged to walk or cycle to school whenever possible. The majority of pupils have been away from the classroom since March. Getting schools up and running in September is being seen as a key test for Mr Williamson, already under pressureafter thousands of students had their A-levels downgraded. The saga over the exams process continued on Saturday night, after exams regulator Ofqualsuspended its criteria for students wishing to appeal against A-level results- just hours after the guidance was published. Speaking ahead of the campaign launch on Monday, Mr Williamson said: ""All children deserve to be back in school as it is the best place for their education and well-being. ""As the start of term approaches, now is the time for families to think about the practicalities of returning to school in September, whether that's reassuring themselves that school is the best place for their child to be, or planning the school run to avoid public transport where possible."" LOCKDOWN EASING:All you need to know about the measures TRAVEL:Where can I go on holiday and not quarantine? BEAUTY SALON:Can I get a facial yet? WEDDINGS:What are the rules on weddings? However, shadow education secretary Kate Green said it was essential the government had a fully effective test and trace programme in place if parents were to have the confidence to send their children back. ""Labour has repeatedly called for every child to be safely back in school by September, but it has taken the government until now to realise that it has failed to reassure parents and teachers,"" she said. ""Their slow and chaotic handling of school reopening puts the education and well-being of a generation of children at risk. ""We need to see a credible plan for getting children back next month, which includes getting test, trace and isolate up to scratch, and ensuring pupils and staff are safe and feel confident,"" Ms Green said. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT head teachers' union, welcomed the announcement of a public information campaign. ""Everyone wants to see children back in schools as soon as possible, but the success of this will depend largely on what happens in wider society and will be a gigantic national team effort,"" he said. ""It is very important that everyone understands the part they will play, what their responsibilities are and what to expect in September."" PANORAMA:Has lockdown changed what we eat?

Rival rallies as Belarus stand-off continues,"This video can not be played Large crowds of anti-government demonstrators rallied in the capital Tens of thousands of opponents of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko have gathered in Minsk to protest against disputed elections. The ""March for Freedom"" in the centre of the capital comes amid growing anger over alleged poll-rigging and police violence at subsequent protests. Meanwhile, in an address to a smaller crowd of several thousand, Mr Lukashenko blasted opponents as ""rats"". He called on supporters to defend their country and independence. The rival rallies were taking place after Russia agreed to offer security assistance in the case of external military threats to Belarus. It emerged that Mr Lukashenko had twice spoken to President Vladimir Putin over the weekend. The long-time Belarus leader also voiced concerns over Nato military exercises taking place in neighbouring Poland and Lithuania and launched into a tirade against the Western military alliance. A pro-government demonstration in central Minsk has so far been small Nato - which sent four battle groups led by Britain, Canada, Germany and the US to the Baltic countries after Moscow's annexation of Crimea in Ukraine - rejected allegations of a build-up in the region. The unrest in Belarus erupted after Mr Lukashenko claimed a landslide victory in last Sunday's election, the result of which has been condemned amid widespread allegations of vote-rigging. 'Breathing freedom' - Belarusians hope for change 'If you croak we don't care': Brutality in Belarus Five things you may not know about the country Watch: Opposition leader speaks from exile The Central Election Commission says Mr Lukashenko, who has been in power since 1994, won 80.1% of the vote and the main opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya 10.12%. But Ms Tikhanovskaya insists that where votes were properly counted, she won support ranging from 60% to 70%. Russian TV news bulletins have been making ominous parallels between Belarus 2020 and Ukraine 2014. Ukraine's pro-Western revolution led to Moscow sending in its special operations forces to annex Crimea and Russian military intervention in eastern Ukraine. Six years on, could Russia's military intervene in Belarus? On paper, at least, such a move would appear counter-productive. The opposition movement in Belarus is not anti-Russia/pro-Europe - it is anti-Lukashenko. If Russia were to send in troops to shore up the Belarusian leader, it risks alienating the Belarusian people and creating anti-Moscow sentiment. True, Moscow is determined to keep Belarus within what it sees as Russia's sphere of influence. The Kremlin's ultimate goal is deeper integration with its neighbour - a fully-fledged union state (with Vladimir Putin at the helm). It could still achieve this through political leverage. The Kremlin has a pathological fear of ""coloured revolution"" on its doorstep. But Minsk 2020 is not Kyiv 2014. Belarus is not choosing between East and West. The Belarusian people are outraged by the brutality of their security forces. So much so that even Mr Lukashenko's traditional base - including the state factory workers - are deserting him. Local media reports suggest that around 31,000 people took part in the pro-government rally, though the Ministry of Internal Affairs estimated that the number was closer to 65,000. Speaking to supporters, Mr Lukashenko said he did not like rallies and did not need anyone to defend him. He said it was not his fault that he had to ask for their help. Rejecting calls for a re-run of the presidential election he said Belarus would ""die as a state"" if that happened. Mr Lukashenko described the opposition as rats ""You came here so that for the first time in a quarter-century you could defend your country, your independence, your wives, sisters and children,"" he said. He added that the opposition would ""crawl like rats out of a hole"" if they were not suppressed this time. ""This will be the beginning of your end - you will go down on your knees like in Ukraine and other countries and pray, God knows to whom."" What's happening in Belarus? There were reports of state sector workers being forced to attend or face the threat of losing their jobs. For days, workers at state-run factories have staged walkouts and many have joined street marches against the president. As the president spoke, around 220,000 of anti-Lukashenko protesters gathered near the Stela Minsk Hero City World War Two memorial in central Minsk,according to news website Tut.by,external. They had answered a call for weekend rallies from Ms Tikhanovskaya. The opposition leader had gone into exile in Lithuania after she registered a complaint with electoral authorities and spent seven hours in detention. Maria Kolesnikova, a former member of Ms Tikhanovskaya's team, addressed the crowds. ""You are incredible, I love you"", she said,before appealing to officials, security officials and judges. ""Guys, this is the last chance. Take the side of the good and the people. We are in the majority. We are power."" Supporters also turned out in other cities. The mayor of Brest was booed by protesters when he tried to speak to crowds. In Gomel, demonstrators removed the official flag of Belarus from the city's flagpole and replaced it with the red and white flag of the opposition. Thousands complained that the state broadcaster gave a skewed picture of the protests Belarusian footballer Ilya Shkurinannounced he would not play for his country until President Lukashenko stepped down,externaland then scored his first goal for Russian premier league team CSKA Moscow. As the unrest continued, Mr Lukashenko sought help from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Mr Lukashenko said President Putin had promised to provide what he called comprehensive assistance in the event of external military threats to Belarus.

Pupils can appeal 'lower than predicted' A-levelsStudents can appeal grades if there is evidence from the school their results should have been better.Wales,"This video can not be played Bradley Desmier was predicted a B, C and a merit but got a D, E and a pass Pupils can appeal A-level grades if they are lower than what was predicted by teachers following an outcry over results. Pupils had accused the Welsh Government of ""abandoning them"" after 42% of grades were lowered by the exams watchdog. Education Minister Kirsty Williams has confirmed appeals will be allowed if ""there is evidence"" pupils should have received higher grades. She said it gave ""clarity"" to students. Ms Williams said the broadening of appeals by Qualifications Wales, meant students could now appeal if there was ""evidence of internal assessments that has been judged by the school or college to be at a higher grade than the grade they have been awarded"". Students receiving results at Ysgol Glan Clwyd on Thursday The Welsh Government had faced backlash from students, teachers, education bodies, and some of its own backbenchers, following the publication of A-level results on Thursday. Due to the coronavirus pandemic, exams were cancelled this year, with students' final grades based on teachers' estimations. Unfair results claim after grades lowered A-level results in Wales: Senedd committee recalled But the exam watchdog, Qualifications Wales, lowered more than 40% of grades in a standardisation process after finding some teachers had been ""too generous"". The detail of the results also showed more pupils on free school meals saw their A-levels downgraded - 48.1% - compared to 45.3% for pupils not eligible. On Wednesday, hours before students found out their results, the education minister guaranteed that no-one would get a lower grade in their A-level than they achieved in their AS result. Ms Williams had said she had to act to stop Welsh students being ""disadvantaged"" following changes to results in England, and Scotland. But with the last-minute intervention coming after results had already been sent to schools and colleges, there are concerns that universities may judge applications on the grades already issued, before that revision takes effect. Some students have spoken of getting results up to two grades lower than predicted, and being rejected by universities after not meeting required grades. The latest guidance from Qualifications Wales now states: An appeal can now be made on the grounds that there is evidence of internal assessment that has been judged by the school or college to be at a higher grade than the calculated grade awarded. Internal assessment evidence will need to meet specific criteria ""which is being finalised and will be published shortly"". If the appeal is successful, the learner's grade will be revised ""to be the same as their internal assessment grade"" but no higher than the centre assessment grade. The watchdog said: ""We have worked closely with WJEC [exam board] and considered the changes being introduced in England to find the best way forward for Welsh learners. As a result, it said, it was extending the grounds for appeal for this summer's GCSE, AS and A levels, and the Welsh Bacc qualifications. This does not go as far as saying pupils who are unhappy will get the grade estimated for them by teachers. But it does allow appeals to be based on some of the evidence used by schools and colleges to decide those grades. The big difference is that before this change, appeals could only be pursued on administrative grounds - for example, concerns that the exam board had used the wrong data. There'll be more information in the next couple of days but there are some immediate questions about the practicalities of it all. In view of the uproar since grades were published, it is inevitable there will be a huge number of appeals now the criteria has been opened up. But how quickly can those be dealt with, when in many cases places at university depend on the result. Some will still argue that it would be more straightforward and fairer to issue the original grades submitted by teachers, as happened in Scotland. The Welsh Government's, WJEC and Qualifications Wales handling of the exam results process is set to be examined by a Senedd committee next week. Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price has urged the Welsh Government to ensure pupils in Wales are awarded lower grades received their predicted results instead. ""I would rather trust in teachers than an algorithm when it comes to a fair assessment of how a pupil would perform in an exam,"" he said. Reacting to the development he tweeted: ""Instead of adding yet more complexity and uncertainty, Welsh Govt should simply admit the failure and accept the teacher assessed grades."" Conservative MS Darren Millar earlier had called the situation ""a mess"" and urged a review. ""There have been A-grades downgraded to D's and B's to U's without any explanation or justification as to why these decisions have been made, and without regard to evidence provided by teachers on the progress of their students."" The Conservatives' education spokeswoman Suzy Davies said while she was pleased the Welsh Government had changed the appeals process, there needed to be guarantees the system would ""not collapse under the demand"". ""If that guarantee can't be given then today's announcement may still not allay concerns. I look forward to those guarantees being given swiftly and with confidence or this will not be going away,"" she said.

Vicar's story of Covid shock and grief in parish,"This video can not be played ""There was a real sense of shock. Suddenly everything that was familiar had stopped."" ""I just used to lock myself in my car and cry after every funeral."" For Canon Jan Gould, of the Church of the Resurrection in Ely, Cardiff, the pandemic has been an intensely emotional and challenging time. She has ministered about 60 funerals since it began, with a third due to Covid-19 and several suicides. ""Coping with that, with the numbers that we were dealing with, was very, very difficult,"" she said. Parts of Ely are among the poorest 10% of areas in theWelsh Index of Multiple Deprivation,external. 'Enormous impact' And Canon Gould said in the early days of the pandemic there was a ""real sense of shock"" in the community, with four suicides in the first week. ""Suddenly everything that was familiar had stopped. ""Many people had stopped working, some were on furlough, some just lost their jobs and had nothing coming in at all. There was a huge impact on people's mental wellbeing, which I think is common in many areas of poor income. ""Funerals went up anyway. But we had quite a few suicides early on, and they were all young men who lost their jobs and couldn't be furloughed because they hadn't been in their jobs long enough. ""Normally we'd probably expect four or five suicides a year. So to get four in the first week just spoke volumes really about just what an enormous impact this was having on people's lives."" Information and support is available via BBC Action Line The Samaritans says suicide is very complex and not generally connected to a single factor or event, with a wide range of psychological, social, economic and cultural risk factors interacting to increase an individual's level of risk. And there is no evidence to suggest the rise Canon Gould has seen locally has been reflected across the UK. But the Samaritans said this week that its most recent studyfound 42% of the 2,000 men they questioned,externalsaid coronavirus has had a negative impact on their mental health. ""As time has gone on it has got easier for people, and word has started to get out there that the support is there. So hopefully you know people are turning to that support now,"" Canon Gould said. Canon Gould said the church would normally have been full for funerals, with hundreds from Ely attending There have been numerous cruel consequences of the pandemic but for Canon Gould, the limit on the number of mourners at funerals and cremations has been among the toughest to bear in a community so closely knit. Wales' poorest areas 'hit hardest' by coronavirus 'We never really had dinner together before Covid' Half a million access suicide prevention course After lockdown began, the numbers of mourners was restricted to fiveand then 10, although up to 30 people are now able to attend outdoor, graveside funerals in parts of Wales. ""Normally, for funerals of young people we would expect several hundred people to be coming to the service and we were only allowed 10 - and that was really, really difficult,"" said the canon. ""It was absolutely horrific, really, to go through that trying to support people through it. ""I had one funeral and the lady who died had 12 children. And we could only have 10 of them at the funeral, because that was the rules. And so that family had to decide which two were not going to go say goodbye to their mother."" Canon Jan Gould has been at the Church of the Resurrection in Ely for 14 years Public services in places of worshipwere cancelled in Wales from the end of March, forcing churches such as Canon Gould's to embrace online services and even print copies of sermons to be posted through the doors of parishioners. The amount of time spent on the computer - including meetings with families on Zoom and hosting services from her home via Facebook Live - has affected the minister's sleep patterns and exacerbated pre-existing issues she has with her memory. ""Everything has been about screens in these last four months and it has been really tough coping with that,"" she said. But after the Church of the Resurrection and others reopened their doors for services last month, Canon Gould said she has been left looking back on lockdown as a time when the light outweighed the dark. Church in Wales is told organs can be played again Opening the doors for public worship Church members 'miss companionship' of singing ""I think this pandemic has really brought out the best in so many people and we've seen such an amazing community spirit here,"" she said. ""The things that people have been getting up to, it's been really wonderful - supporting their neighbours, even neighbours they've maybe never spoken to. ""I know for a lot of people it has been a really tough time, a lot of people have lost loved ones. And that's something that you never get over. ""But I think there have been some really good things, and I think those are the things that give us hope for the future.""

Campaign aims to reassure parents on pupil safetyThe government initiative will stress the importance of organised learning to children's development.,"An organised learning environment is vital to a child's development, the government will stress A campaign aimed at persuading parents in England it will be safe for children to return to the classroom in September is being launched by the government. Under the #backtoschoolsafely slogan, it will highlight the various measures being implemented to minimise the risk of coronavirus transmission. Boris Johnson said there was a""moral duty""to get pupils back to school. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was the PM's ""moral responsibility"" to ensure that schools reopen. Writing in theMail on Sunday,external, Sir Keir said he expected children to be back in the classroom in September ""no ifs, no buts, no equivocation"". ""It is the prime minister's responsibility to guarantee children get the education they need and the benefit of being back with their teachers and classmates,"" Sir Keir added. ""My offer to help the government reopen schools still stands, but responsibility for making it happen lies squarely at the door of Number 10."" Will pupils do a full school day next term? Moral duty to get all children back in school - PM Schools 'should be first to open, last to close' Last week, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson apologised to pupils who have missed out on several months of classes. The campaign, which will involve newspaper, digital, radio and billboard adverts, will strive to emphasise the importance of organised learning to children's development. Some families remain concerned about the potential risks to children when they start the new school year. Many will be starting at a new school altogether. The government initiative will point to guidance, endorsed by Public Health England, that ensures schools are Covid-secure. Some primary school children returned to school in June This guidance includes the introduction of staggered break times, increased hygiene and hand-washing, plus keeping pupils in consistent groups. At the same time, staff and pupils are being encouraged to walk or cycle to school whenever possible. The majority of pupils have been away from the classroom since March. Getting schools up and running in September is being seen as a key test for Mr Williamson, already under pressureafter thousands of students had their A-levels downgraded. The saga over the exams process continued on Saturday night, after exams regulator Ofqualsuspended its criteria for students wishing to appeal against A-level results- just hours after the guidance was published. Speaking ahead of the campaign launch on Monday, Mr Williamson said: ""All children deserve to be back in school as it is the best place for their education and well-being. ""As the start of term approaches, now is the time for families to think about the practicalities of returning to school in September, whether that's reassuring themselves that school is the best place for their child to be, or planning the school run to avoid public transport where possible."" LOCKDOWN EASING:All you need to know about the measures TRAVEL:Where can I go on holiday and not quarantine? BEAUTY SALON:Can I get a facial yet? WEDDINGS:What are the rules on weddings? However, shadow education secretary Kate Green said it was essential the government had a fully effective test and trace programme in place if parents were to have the confidence to send their children back. ""Labour has repeatedly called for every child to be safely back in school by September, but it has taken the government until now to realise that it has failed to reassure parents and teachers,"" she said. ""Their slow and chaotic handling of school reopening puts the education and well-being of a generation of children at risk. ""We need to see a credible plan for getting children back next month, which includes getting test, trace and isolate up to scratch, and ensuring pupils and staff are safe and feel confident,"" Ms Green said. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT head teachers' union, welcomed the announcement of a public information campaign. ""Everyone wants to see children back in schools as soon as possible, but the success of this will depend largely on what happens in wider society and will be a gigantic national team effort,"" he said. ""It is very important that everyone understands the part they will play, what their responsibilities are and what to expect in September."" PANORAMA:Has lockdown changed what we eat?

"BBC presenter recovering from brain haemorrhageRadio 3 star Clemency Burton-Hill says music helped her ""to live"" after she underwent emergency surgery.","BBC presenter Clemency Burton-Hill has spoken about how music has helped her recover from a major brain haemorrhage. The 39-year-old Radio 3 host underwent emergency brain surgery after she collapsed in New York in January. Months later, she says music has played a key role, as she re-learns how to speak and walk. ""Sometimes it is the thing that gives me solace,"" she says. ""And sometimes it's the thing that helps me to get up, and fight, and to live."" ""It is the ultimate motivation,"" Clemmie - as she is known by her friends and colleagues - told friend and journalist Sophie Elmhirst. The presenter, who is behind Radio 3's award-winning Classical Fix programme, as well as a regular face on the BBC's Proms coverage, is currently living in New York where she is creative director at WQXR, the New York public radio classical music station. At the start of the year, she suffered a massive brain haemorrhage caused by a previously undiagnosed condition: an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an uncommon and abnormal cluster of blood vessels meshing the arteries and veins in her brain. It could have been fatal. As it is, doctors removed half of her skull during emergency surgery at Mount Sinai West hospital in Manhattan, and she was unconscious for 17 days. No one was certain how much of her brain would recover. Throughout those early days, music played on a speaker by her hospital bed - the playlist compiled by her loved ones. Before she showed any sign of consciousness, British opera singer Andrew Staples - a close friend who was performing in New York when the presenter collapsed - recalls her left foot tapping along to some Brahms. ""I remember it struck me as a non-typical piece to inspire toe-tapping,"" Staples recalls. Clemmie, photographed in July 2020 in downtown Manhattan A week or so later, just as doctors were removing the tubes that had initially aided her breathing, one of Burton-Hill's favourite pieces of music, Richard Strauss's Morgen, happened to play through the speaker. ""With her good hand she grabbed my wrist as I leant over her shaven head, and I sang the words to her,"" says Staples. ""We both cried a lot. I wasn't worried from then on about whether she was 'in there' anymore."" While she can't remember that moment, Burton-Hill recalls how she seemed to make a choice of whether to give up or to live just as she was regaining consciousness. ""It was literally: I can do this, I'm going to get through this,"" she says now. ""Music is the opposite of despair. It was going to be worth the fight."" As her recovery stepped up, friend and renowned violinist Nicola Benedetti came to visit and together they play Bach, with Burton-Hill - herself a violin soloist - playing the left hand on the violin and Benedetti bowing. Astonishingly, the broadcaster still recalled all the notes. ""It's a clichÃ©d idea that music is beyond language,"" she says, ""but from what I've experienced in my own brain, I truly know that now."" Gradually, language and movement have begun to return despite the obstacles to recovery thrown up by the coronavirus pandemic. ""I really believe music is a part of my recovery because it uses both sides of the brain,"" says Burton-Hill. ""It's as though it trains your brain to be ambidextrous.""

Shielding ends but hugging child 'could kill dad',"This video can not be played Richard Bluck says he may not be able to hug his daughter until a vaccine is found People with underlying health conditions say they have mixed emotions as shielding ends for about 130,000 in Wales. Those most vulnerable to Covid-19 had been asked to stay inside since the beginning of the pandemic. Richard Bluck, 37, is so vulnerable he says he may not be able to hug his daughter until a vaccine is found. People who were shielding are advised to pay strict attention to physical distancing and good hand hygiene. And the Welsh Government has said the situation could change again in future if cases begin to rise. But some groups are concerned pausing shielding from Sunday is too much of a risk, with transplant patients told by the Renal Association and Kidney Care UK to ""ignore government advice"" about ceasing to shield. The Welsh Government advised those people to speak to their doctor. Gething sorry shield letters went to wrong address Transplant patients told 'keep shielding' 'Isolation felt like a parallel universe, but I'm scared to leave' Two-thirds shielding happy to return to work Mr Bluck, who has cystic fibrosis (CF) and underwent a double lung transplant in 2018, has been shielding since early March. His eight-year-old daughter Evelyn lives with his ex-wife, who is a nurse. ""It might be when a vaccine is found that'll be the next time I'll hug my daughter,"" he said. ""The hardest part of the initial lockdown was not being able to see my daughter at all for quite a long time."" Richard Bluck, pictured with his daughter before the pandemic, says Evelyn mostly understands the situation He added: ""Even when the lockdown finished, Evelyn came over to visit me in the garden but that was still at a distance and that's a really unnatural thing, no hugs and playing and talking at a distance. ""When she turned eight in July, it was really strange not giving your daughter a cuddle on her birthday. So that's been the toughest part of all this."" Mr Bluck said his daughter mostly understands why their contact is so limited. ""It's so hard to say but it could cost me my life. ""A child's mind won't think forward in time like an adult does and there are tears and emotions from both of us. ""I'm just honest with her and explain what would happen to daddy if I caught the virus. ""Because she's seen me close to death before, she knows I've had a second chance of life. ""She'd never forgive herself if she thought she could be responsible for her father's death, is basically what it comes down to. So I don't want to put her in that situation."" Richard Bluck's only chance of survival was a transplant Mr Bluck, from Llysworney in Vale of Glamorgan, has lived with CF from birth and is on immunosuppressive therapy - which lowers his immune response to stop it from damaging or rejecting transplanted organs. He almost died before his transplant, with his lung function decreasing as his CF worsened throughout his 30s. By March 2018, he was hospitalised at Llandough in Cardiff and remained there for six months until he was taken to the Harefield Hospital in London, the largest specialist heart and lung centre in the UK. ""My left lung had started to disintegrate and the infection was leaking out of the lungs and into the blood stream which caused sepsis. ""I also suffered a small heart attack. My only chance of survival was a transplant."" Richard Bluck almost died but was lucky he was able to receive a double lung transplant quickly Mr Bluck was only on the waiting list for two weeks before a suitable set of lungs became available and he was able to have the transplant. ""It gave me a second chance of life, so for me to be impetuous and say let's forget about this virus for a moment isn't worth the risk. ""I know some people find it very difficult and they will take that risk, but what I've experienced, I feel this is the only sensible option, so Evelyn can have her father around for a lot longer."" Mr Bluck has been working from home and will continue to do so after shielding ends - meaning he can choose to continue to shield. ""I know a lot of people will think 'thank god for that, I'm off on holiday, maybe even abroad', which is fair enough but for me personally the risk is still there, the virus is still out there."" Badges with the image of a yellow shield are being distributed across the NHS in Wales Age Cymru is conducting a survey on how older people feel about ceasing to shield, and said it had received a mixed response. Chief executive Victoria Lloyd said: ""Many older people are looking forward to coming out of shielding so they can visit more places and see more people. ""However, we know that many are concerned about re-engaging with their communities. This concern seems to be fuelled by reports of people gathering in large numbers or not following government guidance. ""Others have told us that they have lost their self-confidence and are worried about mixing with others in shopping centres or on public transport."" People who are shielding are being sent letters updating them on the latest situation The charity is urging supermarkets to retain designated times for vulnerable people so they can continue shopping during quieter times, and that priority food and pharmaceutical deliveries should remain. Frank Atherton, Wales' Chief Medical Officer, said: ""At the moment we're seeing very few new cases in Wales and that means we have scope now to say to the most vulnerable people... they can start to reengage with society, start to get back to their normal lives."" He said anybody coming out of shielding had a very low chance of coming into contact with coronavirus - and there was a window of opportunity in the warm weather while transmissions were low. ""I'm very grateful to those people who have been in the shielding group, they've been protecting themselves and they've been protecting the NHS by not getting sick. ""They will naturally be very anxious about coming out, we need to make sure that we support people in their ability to do that. ""We mustn't underestimate the mental health consequences of being tucked away and not able to engage with people."" He said the situation may change as winter approaches.

China restaurant apologises for weighing customersThe policy was introduced after a national campaign against food waste was launched.,"Hashtags about the restaurant have been viewed more than 300 million times on Weibo A restaurant in central China has apologised for encouraging diners to weigh themselves and then order food accordingly. The policy was introduced after a national campaign against food waste was launched. The beef restaurant in the city of Changsha placed two large scales at its entrance this week. It then asked diners to enter their measurements into an app that would then suggest menu items accordingly. Signs reading ""be thrifty and diligent, promote empty plates"" and ""operation empty plate"" were pinned up. China's Xi tells people to stop wasting food The policy caused uproar on Chinese social media. Hashtags about the restaurant have been viewed more than 300 million times on the social platform Weibo. The restaurant said it was ""deeply sorry"" for its interpretation of the national ""Clean Plate Campaign"". ""Our original intentions were to advocate stopping waste and ordering food in a healthy way. We never forced customers to weigh themselves,"" it said in an apology posted online. President Xi Jinping ignited the campaign this week, calling the levels of national food wastage ""shocking and distressing"". Following Mr Xi's message, the Wuhan Catering Industry Association urged restaurants in the city to limit the number of dishes served to diners - implementing a system where groups have to order one dish fewer than the number of diners.

China restaurant apologises for weighing customersThe policy was introduced after a national campaign against food waste was launched.China,"Hashtags about the restaurant have been viewed more than 300 million times on Weibo A restaurant in central China has apologised for encouraging diners to weigh themselves and then order food accordingly. The policy was introduced after a national campaign against food waste was launched. The beef restaurant in the city of Changsha placed two large scales at its entrance this week. It then asked diners to enter their measurements into an app that would then suggest menu items accordingly. Signs reading ""be thrifty and diligent, promote empty plates"" and ""operation empty plate"" were pinned up. China's Xi tells people to stop wasting food The policy caused uproar on Chinese social media. Hashtags about the restaurant have been viewed more than 300 million times on the social platform Weibo. The restaurant said it was ""deeply sorry"" for its interpretation of the national ""Clean Plate Campaign"". ""Our original intentions were to advocate stopping waste and ordering food in a healthy way. We never forced customers to weigh themselves,"" it said in an apology posted online. President Xi Jinping ignited the campaign this week, calling the levels of national food wastage ""shocking and distressing"". Following Mr Xi's message, the Wuhan Catering Industry Association urged restaurants in the city to limit the number of dishes served to diners - implementing a system where groups have to order one dish fewer than the number of diners. State TV also criticised livestreamers who filmed themselves eating large amounts of food.

Campaign aims to reassure parents on pupils return,"An organised learning environment is vital to a child's development, the government will stress A campaign aimed at persuading parents in England it will be safe for children to return to the classroom in September is being launched by the government. Under the #backtoschoolsafely slogan, it will highlight the various measures being implemented to minimise the risk of coronavirus transmission. Boris Johnson said there was a""moral duty""to get pupils back to school. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was the PM's ""moral responsibility"" to ensure that schools reopen. Writing in theMail on Sunday,external, Sir Keir said he expected children to be back in the classroom in September ""no ifs, no buts, no equivocation"". ""It is the prime minister's responsibility to guarantee children get the education they need and the benefit of being back with their teachers and classmates,"" Sir Keir added. ""My offer to help the government reopen schools still stands, but responsibility for making it happen lies squarely at the door of Number 10."" Will pupils do a full school day next term? Moral duty to get all children back in school - PM Schools 'should be first to open, last to close' Last week, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson apologised to pupils who have missed out on several months of classes. The campaign, which will involve newspaper, digital, radio and billboard adverts, will strive to emphasise the importance of organised learning to children's development. Some families remain concerned about the potential risks to children when they start the new school year. Many will be starting at a new school altogether. The government initiative will point to guidance, endorsed by Public Health England, that ensures schools are Covid-secure. Some primary school children returned to school in June This guidance includes the introduction of staggered break times, increased hygiene and hand-washing, plus keeping pupils in consistent groups. At the same time, staff and pupils are being encouraged to walk or cycle to school whenever possible. The majority of pupils have been away from the classroom since March. Getting schools up and running in September is being seen as a key test for Mr Williamson, already under pressureafter thousands of students had their A-levels downgraded. The saga over the exams process continued on Saturday night, after exams regulator Ofqualsuspended its criteria for students wishing to appeal against A-level results- just hours after the guidance was published. Speaking ahead of the campaign launch on Monday, Mr Williamson said: ""All children deserve to be back in school as it is the best place for their education and well-being. ""As the start of term approaches, now is the time for families to think about the practicalities of returning to school in September, whether that's reassuring themselves that school is the best place for their child to be, or planning the school run to avoid public transport where possible."" LOCKDOWN EASING:All you need to know about the measures TRAVEL:Where can I go on holiday and not quarantine? BEAUTY SALON:Can I get a facial yet? WEDDINGS:What are the rules on weddings? However, shadow education secretary Kate Green said it was essential the government had a fully effective test and trace programme in place if parents were to have the confidence to send their children back. ""Labour has repeatedly called for every child to be safely back in school by September, but it has taken the government until now to realise that it has failed to reassure parents and teachers,"" she said. ""Their slow and chaotic handling of school reopening puts the education and well-being of a generation of children at risk. ""We need to see a credible plan for getting children back next month, which includes getting test, trace and isolate up to scratch, and ensuring pupils and staff are safe and feel confident,"" Ms Green said. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT head teachers' union, welcomed the announcement of a public information campaign. ""Everyone wants to see children back in schools as soon as possible, but the success of this will depend largely on what happens in wider society and will be a gigantic national team effort,"" he said. ""It is very important that everyone understands the part they will play, what their responsibilities are and what to expect in September."" PANORAMA:Has lockdown changed what we eat?

Tea at the Ritz soured by credit card scammersScammers posed as hotel staff to trick customers into handing over payment information.Technology,"Diners at the luxury Ritz hotel in London have been targeted by ""extremely convincing"" scammers who posed as hotel staff to steal payment card details. The scammers phoned people with exact details of their restaurant bookings, asking them to ""confirm"" card details. They then tried to spend thousands of pounds at the catalogue retailer Argos. The Ritz told the BBC it was investigating a ""potential data breach"" and said it had alerted the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). The fraudsters phoned people who had already made a restaurant reservation at the Ritz, pretending to be hotel staff. How they got this information is still unknown. One woman, who had made an online booking for afternoon tea at the Ritz as part of a celebration, received a call the day before her reservation. The scammers asked her to ""confirm"" the booking by providing her payment card details. The call was convincing because it appeared to have come from the hotel's real phone number, and the scammers knew exactly when and where her reservation was. One cyber-security expert told the BBC that caller ID spoofing in this way was ""quite easy"". The scammers told the woman that her payment card had been ""declined"", and asked her for a second bank card. After they had taken the payment card details, the scammers tried to make several transactions in excess of Â£1,000 at the catalogue retailer Argos. When her bank spotted the suspicious transactions, the scammer phoned again - this time pretending to be from her bank. He told the victim that somebody was trying to use her credit card, and in order to cancel the transaction she should read out a security code sent to her mobile phone. In reality, this would have authorised the transaction. A second woman, who made her original booking over the telephone rather than online, told the BBC that the exact same tricks had been tried on her. She later felt suspicious that the scammer had not been able to correctly answer questions about the hotel's facilities. ""People tend to trust caller ID, which is perfectly understandable because in theory it appears to authenticate the caller,"" said Dr Jessica Barker, co-founder of the cyber-security company Cygenta. ""On top of that, when a scam like this involves insider information it adds an air of legitimacy and authority."" The Ritz said it had been made aware of a potential data breach within its ""food and beverage reservation system"" on 12 August. It is continuing to investigate how the scammers accessed customer information. It said it had emailed customers that may have been affected, warning them: ""After a reservation has been made at the Ritz London, our team will never contact you by telephone to request credit card details to confirm your booking with us."" It has not revealed how many people were affected. Restaurants should never phone you asking for payment information to ""confirm"" your booking. If you receive a suspicious call, you could hang up and call the venue back later - or from a different phone - using the number on their official website. Dr Barker warns against giving card details to somebody who had called you, and suggests always calling the company back yourself. If a bank believes a transaction has been fraudulent, they will not ask you for security codes in order to cancel the transaction. If you receive a suspicious call you think is pretending to be from your bank, hang up and call your bank back later - or from a different phone - using the number on the back of your payment card.
