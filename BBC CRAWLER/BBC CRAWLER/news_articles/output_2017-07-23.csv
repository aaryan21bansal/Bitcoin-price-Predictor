Backlash over Gard hospital threats,"Connie Yates and Chris Gard want Charlie to receive an experimental therapy called nucleoside The parents of Charlie Gard say they have been victims of a ""backlash"" afterGreat Ormond Street Hospital revealed staff had received death threats. The hospital said,externalpolice were called after families and staff were harassed. The hospital and Charlie's parents are in alegal battle over continuing life support,externalfor the 11-month-old, who has a rare genetic disorder. Connie Yates and Chris Gard said they had suffered ""the most hurtful comments from the public"". In a statement, Mr Gard said: ""Without the excellent care of the doctors at GOSH [Great Ormond Street Hospital] our son would not even be alive and not a day goes by when we don't remember that."" Ms Yates said: ""We do not, and have not ever, condoned any threatening or abusive remarks towards any staff member at GOSH."" However, she criticised the hospital for not asking the public ""not to say anything hurtful to us as well as their doctors and other members of staff"". Responding to Charlie's parents' statement on Sunday night, a spokesperson for GOSH said: ""We are grateful for what Charlie's parents have said, and agree wholeheartedly that any abuse of anybody involved in this case is unacceptable. ""This is a heartbreaking time for Charlie's loving parents when they should be given every support."" Great Ormond Street Hospital said ""unacceptable behaviour"" had been recorded ""within the hospital"" Charlie, who was born on 4 August 2016, has a form of mitochondrial disease, a condition that causes progressive muscle weakness and irreversible brain damage. His parents want to take him to the US for pioneering treatment. They have lost a succession of court cases to overturn the hospital's decision that it would be in the best interest of Charlie to be allowed to die with dignity. The latest court battle involves new testimony from a US neurologist who hasvisited Charlie in hospitalto decide whether he should travel to America for therapy. Charlie's parents want to take him to New York for experimental treatment, which the US doctor said might give him a10% chance of improving his health. The case is due back before a High Court judge on Monday.

Blood found on items in Needham hunt,"Ben Needham vanished on the Greek island of Kos in July 1991 Signs of blood have been found on part of a sandal and on soil inside a toy car recovered by police searching for missing Sheffield toddler Ben Needham. Ben was 21 months old when he disappeared on the Greek island of Kos in July 1991. South Yorkshire Police said forensic work was being carried out in Aberdeen to try to extract DNA from the items. Det Insp Jon Cousins said it was still his ""professional belief"" Ben died in an accident at the farmhouse. Live updates and more stories from Yorkshire Details of the findings have been released on the 26th anniversary of Ben's disappearance. The car found in Kos is thought to be similar to this one Ben was last seen playing near to a farmhouse his grandfather was renovating Ben went missing while playing near a farmhouse, which was being renovated by his grandfather in Iraklis. An extensive21-day searchof land around the building and a second site 750m (820 yards) away took place in October after it emerged the toddlermay have been crushed to death by a diggerworking on the site. About 60 items discovered during the search were brought back to the UK for analysis, some of which were sent for testing at the James Hutton Institute in Aberdeen. South Yorkshire Police were assisted by members of the Hellenic Rescue Team and Red Cross The search of the two sites was carried out over 21 days in October Professor Lorna Dawson, head of the soil forensics group, said the team of scientists had discovered the ""profile indicative of human blood decomposition on a fragment of a sandal."" The profile had also been found on soil from inside a toy car, however, the stronger signal had been found on the footwear sandal, she said. Professor Dawson said the discovery was the ""chemical finger print"" of compounds left behind ""when there has been decomposition or decay"". ""There's a strong indication from this chemical profile that this was present on those items as a result of blood decomposition,"" she said. ""It's significant in identifying that there had been a human who had bled in contact with those items. ""The biologist has to come in now and identify who left that blood on that item by extracting the DNA."" Professor Lorna Dawson was part of the team responsible for analysing the items Det Insp Cousins said: ""Based on the facts and the information obtained, as previously stated it is still my professional belief that Ben died as a result of a tragic incident at the farmhouse involving heavy machinery. ""It's my belief that [the findings] corroborate and strengthen that theory."" The Needham family has been informed and the force would continue to assist the Greek authorities with any ongoing enquiries, South Yorkshire Police said.

Man charged with teen's rape and murder,"Police found the body of the 19-year-old at this property in Kingston Upon Thames A man has been charged with the kidnap, rape and murder of a 19-year-old woman. The Metropolitan Police said the 33-year-old had also been charged with the rape, attempted murder and kidnap of a woman in her 20s. Another man, 28, has been charged with the kidnap of both women. The teenager's body was found at an address in Coombe Lane West, in Kingston Upon Thames, on Wednesday night, three hours after she had been reported missing, police said. The second woman had earlier been treated for stab or slash wounds at a south London hospital. Police had visited the women's addresses in Sutton and Merton following a concerned call about their safety at about 17:00 BST on Wednesday. The teenager's name has not yet been released, but her next of kin have been informed. A post-mortem examination revealed the cause of death was a neck wound. The two men, who have not been named by police, will appear at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Monday.

Girl trapped by falling logs dies,"Kayla MacDonald died after logs fell on her A ""precious and fun-loving"" eight-year-old girl who died after logs fell on her in an Argyll forest has been named by police. Kayla MacDonald, from Dunbeg, had become trapped by the logs near the village of Benderloch, north of Oban, at about 14:40 BST on Sunday. Her family said Kayla was fluent in Gaelic and her smile would ""light up a room"". A 12-year-old girl was also injured and is in a stable condition in hospital. She was airlifted to Lorn and Islands Hospital in Oban but was then transferred to the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow. Kayla was pronounced dead at the scene. This video can not be played The incident happened near the village of Benderloch on Sunday afternoon In a statement her family said: ""Kayla was a precious fun loving eight-year-old who was loved by everyone around her. Kayla's smile would light up a room. She attended Rockfield's Gaelic Medium where she was fluent in Gaelic. ""Our wee girl loved music and dance as well as doing hair, nails and make up. Kayla has two younger brothers who, along with the rest of her family and friends, will miss her dearly."" A joint investigation between Police Scotland and the Health and Safety Executive will take place to establish the full circumstances surrounding the death, however, it is not being treated as suspicious. The area where the incident happened is part of the Barcaldine Forest, where there has been logging activity recently. Margaret Adams, convenor of the local community council, toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programmethat the tragedy would have a ""massive"" impact on the community. ""Even if people don't know the child they will know the family, in a small community,"" she said. ""It really will have quite an affect on the locals."" Ms Adams said logging had been going on in the area for several months, with signs up warning of the dangers. She added: ""The signs make it very clear that they don't want people to go up because there will be heavy machinery and logs stacked."" Local resident Elaine Walton told BBC Scotland there had been plenty of warnings about forestry operations but it was possible to access the area by avoiding the fenced-off tracks. ""The Forestry (Commission) sent every household in the area a letter telling us the plans for the works, that the place would be sealed off and that there were other walks down at Sutherland's Grove,"" she said. ""But if you live in the area you know that there are little ways to get up on the hill if you want to and young people explore and find these ways."" A spokesman for Forest Enterprise Scotland said: ""Our thoughts are with the family and their friends at this very difficult time and we offer them our deepest condolences. ""We will now focus on working with the site contractor, Tilhill Forestry, and the Health and Safety Executive as investigations into this tragic incident continue.""

"Man, 20, dies after police pursuit","This video can not be played CCTV shows Rashan Jermaine Charles being apprehended by police inside a shop, as the BBC's Andy Moore reports. A 20-year-old man has died after being apprehended by a police officer in an east London shop. The Met Police said the man, named by his family as Rashan Jermaine Charles, was followed on foot after officers tried to stop a car in Kingsland Road, Hackney, at 01:45 BST on Saturday. Mr Charles was taken ill after trying to swallow an object and was pronounced dead in hospital, police said. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is investigating. Footage apparently showing the incident has been shared on social media, along with the hashtag #JusticeForRash. The film, recorded by a security camera, shows Mr Charles entering a shop pursued by a uniformed police officer. In the footage, there is a struggle on the floor, and Mr Charles appears to put his hand to his mouth. Another man in plain clothes is seen helping the officer. Mr Charles is seen handcuffed with his hands behind his back. Members of the local community have been laying flowers and lighting candles at the scene of the incident Scotland Yard said the officer ""intervened and sought to prevent the man from harming himself"". A force medic provided first aid at the scene before London Ambulance Service paramedics arrived. Mr Charles was taken to the Royal London Hospital in east London and pronounced dead at 02:55 BST. Police said next of kin had been informed and a post-mortem examination would be held. A makeshift memorial to Mr Charles has sprung up by the scene of the incident as members of the local community have laid flowers and lit candles outside the shop. Simon Laurence, the Met's borough commander for Hackney, said: ""There is likely to be speculation over the next few days regarding what led to this man becoming ill, so I would encourage people to keep up-to-date with the IPCC's statements, as and when they are released. ""All police officers are fully aware that they will be asked to account for their actions - officers are not exempt from the law and we would not wish to be."" The IPCC confirmed it had begun an independent investigation, taking evidence from eyewitnesses and police officers. It said CCTV footage from inside the shop and police body-worn video evidence had been gathered and viewed. ""The IPCC has obtained evidence which indicates an object was removed from [Mr Charles's] throat at the scene,"" a spokesman said. He appealed for information from witnesses who were in the Kingsland Road and Middleton Road area of Hackney. Campaigners from Hackney Stand Up To Racism have announced a vigil for Mr Charles outside Stoke Newington police station on Monday evening.

Texas truck death toll rises to nine,"This video can not be played Migrant deaths: How one Texas county is struggling to cope Police in the US state of Texas have arrested a truck driver whose vehicle was found in a Walmart car park with dozens of people in the back of it. Nine men had died inside, and 28 others, including children, were taken to hospital. They were inside the trailer in San Antonio without access to air conditioning or water while outside temperatures hit 38C (100F). Police say they believe the incident is linked to people smuggling. The truck's driver, named by authorities as James Mathew Bradley Jr, 60, of Clearwater, Florida, is expected to appear in court later. Video footage from the store reportedly showed a number of vehicles arriving to pick up some of the survivors. Several others may have managed to escape on foot into the woods nearby. One person found in the woods was being treated, local officials said. Mexico's government said it was working closely with US authorities to identify the nationalities of the victims. San Antonio is a few hours' drive from the border with Mexico, and the US immigration department is trying to establish the victims' legal status. San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg told the BBC that caring for the victims was the authorities' first aim. ""Our most important focus right now is to deliver compassionate care,"" he said. ""You know our first responders immediately were on the scene, delivering first aid, transporting - sometimes by air - critical condition patients to local hospitals, and trying to prevent more loss of life than what had already occurred."" ""We are working with authorities, we are working with... witnesses to understand the magnitude of these crimes. ""But in this case, where we are witnesses to a human tragedy in our city, our first response and our response as local officials is to render aid."" Eight people were found to be dead at the scene while another died in hospital, immigration officials said. This video can not be played Police Chief William McManus and Fire Chief Charles Hood told reporters about the discovery Officials were brought to the trailer by a man who had approached an employee of the Walmart and asked for water. The driver would be charged in connection with the ""horrible tragedy"", said San Antonio police chief William McManusin a press briefing,external. He said the people ranged from school age to in their 30s. Local fire chief Charles Hood said the survivors had heart rates of over 130 beats per minute and were very hot to touch. In addition to the 20 people in a critical condition, eight others were taken to hospital in a less severe state. The fire chief confirmed at least two of the victims were school-age children. Their condition is not clear. ""We're very fortunate that there weren't 38 of these people who were all locked inside this vehicle dead,"" he added. The truck was towed away from the scene hours after the discovery The US attorney for the Western District of Texas, Richard Durbin, said the authorities were working to identify those responsible for the incident. ""These people were helpless in the hands of their transporters. Imagine their suffering, trapped in a stifling trailer in 100-plus degree heat,"" he said in a statement. They were victims of ""ruthless human smugglers indifferent to the wellbeing of their fragile cargo"", he added. Thirty-three migrants were found in a trailer in the same part of Texas earlier this month Experts say people smuggling is a serious issue in southern Texas, and there have been a number of similar cases in the area just in this past month. On 7 July, US Border Patrol agents found 72 undocumented immigrants from Central American countrieslocked inside a trailer,external""with no means of escape"".

World's first floating wind farm emerges,"This video can not be played World's first floating offshore wind farm in Scotland. The world's first full-scale floating wind farm has started to take shape off the north-east coast of Scotland. The revolutionary technology will allow wind power to be harvested in waters too deep for the current conventional bottom-standing turbines. The Peterhead wind farm, known as Hywind, is a trial which will bring power to 20,000 homes. Manufacturer Statoil says output from the turbines is expected to equal or surpass generation from current ones. It hopes to cash in on a boom in the technology, especially in Japan and the west coast of the US, where waters are deep. ""This is a tech development project to ensure it's working in open sea conditions. It's a game-changer for floating wind power and we are sure it will help bring costs down,"" said Leif Delp, project director for Hywind. The huge turbines are currently being moved into place So far, one giant turbine has already been moved into place, while four more wait in readiness in a Norwegian fjord. By the end of the month they'll all have been towed to 15 miles (25km) off Peterhead, Aberdeenshire, where they'll float upright like giant fishing floats. While the turbines are currently very expensive to make, Statoil believes that in the future it will be able to dramatically reduce costs in the same way that manufacturers already have for conventional offshore turbines. ""I think eventually we will see floating wind farms compete without subsidy - but to do that we need to get building at scale,"" said Mr Delp. The turbines can operate in water up to a kilometre deep The tower, including the blades, stretches to 175m (575ft), dwarfing Big Ben Each tower weighs 11,500 tonnes The box behind the blades - the nacelle - could hold two double-decker buses Each blade is 75m - almost the wing span of an Airbus The turbines can operate in water up to a kilometre deep The blades on the towers have been a particular focus for innovation. Statoil says the blades harness breakthrough software - which holds the tower upright by twisting the blades to dampen motions from wind, waves and currents. The operation to begin shifting the first of the 11,500 tonne giants happened dramatically in the half-light of a Norwegian summer night. Crews secured thick cables to tug boats and used remote-controlled submarines to check for obstacles. Finally the giant was on the move, floating on a sealed vase-like tube 78m deep, its bottom filled with iron ore to weight the base and keep it upright in the water. The price of energy from bottom-standing offshore wind farms has plummeted 32% since 2012 - far faster that anyone predicted. The price is now four years ahead of the government's expected target, and another big price drop is expected, taking offshore wind to a much lower price than new nuclear power. The Hywind project is being run in collaboration with the Abu Dhabi firm Masdar. The Â£190m cost was subsidised by bill-payers under the UK government's Renewable Obligation Certificates. The bird charity RSPB Scotland opposed the project - not because it dislikes the technology but because it believes too many offshore turbines in the area have already been approved. Thick mooring lines will tether the towers to the sea base It fears thousands of sea birds may be killed by the offshore wind farms, although it admits that estimates are hugely uncertain because it is impossible to count bird corpses at sea. The RSPB's Aidan Smith told BBC News: ""Generally we are very enthusiastic about floating wind technology because it allows turbines to be placed far offshore - away from seabird nesting sites, and it helps us tackle climate change. ""We oppose the Hywind project because it adds to a situation we already believe is a problem."" Floating turbines may create a new frontier for energy - but scientists on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warn far more investment in additional new technologies is urgently needed for governments to keep promises on reducing emissions.

Stars urge BBC 'to sort gender pay gap',"Signatories include Emily Maitlis, Victoria Derbyshire, Sue Barker, Alex Jones, Fiona Bruce and Clare Balding (clockwise, from top left) Some of the BBC's most high-profile female personalities have called on the corporation to ""act now"" to deal with the gender pay gap. Presenters Clare Balding, Victoria Derbyshire and Emily Maitlis are among those who have signedan open letter,externalto director general Tony Hall. They urge him to ""correct"" the disparity over gender pay, which they say has been known ""for years"". Lord Hall said ""work is already well under way"" to resolve the pay gap. On Wednesday, the BBC revealed the salaries of stars earning more than Â£150,000. The salaries,published in the corporation's annual report, revealed two-thirds of its stars earning more than Â£150,000 are male, with Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans the top-paid on between Â£2.2m and Â£2.25m. Claudia Winkleman - whose name was not on the original letter - was the highest-paid female celebrity, earning between Â£450,000 and Â£500,000 last year. Education Secretary Justine Greening said the BBC's gender pay gap was ""hard to justify"", while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said discrepancies were ""astronomical"". How much do BBC stars earn? What else did we learn? What will the industry make of star pay? Reality Check : The gender pay gap More than 40 signatories include BBC Sport's Sue Barker, BBC Radio 4 Today programme journalists Mishal Husain and Sarah Montague, BBC News and Antiques Roadshow presenter Fiona Bruce and The One Show's Alex Jones. The report shows ""what many of us have suspected for many years... that women at the BBC are being paid less than men for the same work,"" the letter says. This video can not be played BBC presenter Jane Garvey says she would be ""delighted"" if high-earning men took a pay cut Pay disparities continue ""beyond the list"" of those earning more than Â£150,000, they add, including in areas of production, engineering, and regional and local media. The letter continues: ""Compared to many women and men, we are very well compensated and fortunate. ""However, this is an age of equality and the BBC is an organisation that prides itself on its values. ""You have said that you will 'sort' the gender pay gap by 2020, but the BBC has known about the pay disparity for years. We all want to go on the record to call upon you to act now."" The women say they are ""prepared to meet"" Lord Hall to ensure ""future generations of women do not face this kind of discrimination"". Woman's Hour presenter Jane Garvey - who organised the letter and is not on the list of top earners - told BBC Radio 4's BH programme the BBC should ""set a standard"" when it comes to fair pay. ""We are not after pay parity,"" she said, ""it is fairness that we are in pursuit of here, not enormous pay rises."" ""I love what the BBC is meant to stand for - let's show the rest of Britain what this incredible institution can do."" Clare Balding said she became concerned about the gender pay gap in 2010, when after presenting Woman's Hour she realised her pay for the show was ""40% lower"" than similar programmes. ""We are the high earners, that's why we are on the list, but don't tell me that isn't reflected all the way down [the BBC],"" she told the programme. ""It is right through and that's where I think we have got to stand up as the ones who are on the list and say 'hang on, enough, we can help you with this'."" Education Secretary Ms Greening, who is also responsible for women and equalities, told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday it was ""impossible not to be shocked"" by the BBC gender pay gap. She said it was a ""reputational issue"" for the BBC, adding that it was ""very hard to justify"" some of the pay discrepancies. Labour leader Mr Corbyn told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show he would be happy to sign the letter, saying the BBC ""needs to look at itself"". But he said problem was broader than just the BBC and discrimination remained a ""serious"" issue in the UK. Marr, who is paid between Â£400,000 and Â£449,999 a year by the BBC, said if he was a woman he would have been removed from the TV ""10 years ago"". ""There's a real lack of older women on the screen,"" the 57-year-old said. Claudia Winkleman was the BBC's top female earner in 2016-17 Claudia Winkleman, Strictly Come Dancing co-host and Radio 2 presenter - Â£450,000-Â£499,999 Alex Jones, presenter of The One Show - Â£400,000-Â£449,000 Fiona Bruce, BBC News and Antiques Roadshow presenter - Â£350,000-Â£399,999 Vanessa Feltz, BBC radio presenter - Â£350,000-Â£399,999 Tess Daly, Strictly Come Dancing co-host - Â£350,000-Â£399,999 Sue Barker, BBC Sport and Question of Sport presenter - Â£300,000-Â£349,999 Lauren Laverne, BBC Radio 6 Music presenter - Â£300,000-Â£349,999 Responding to the letter, Lord Hall said there would be a ""wider consultation"" over the next two months to address the issue and that he would value the contributions of those who signed the letter. ""When figures are published next year I am confident they will look very different. ""When other organisations publish their gender pay data by next April, I want the BBC to be one of the best performers when comparisons are made. ""But beyond that, over the next three years I want the BBC to be regarded as an exemplar on gender and diversity.""

Skegness 'slur' woman won round by resort,"Gina Parkin said she only made the off-the-cuff comment as a joke, but it was then featured in the Lotto advert A woman featured in a TV advert saying she would holiday ""anywhere but Skegness"" has been won over by the resort after a VIP tour with the mayor. In the Lotto ad, people were asked where they would go on a getaway if they won a large sum of money, with Gina Parkin then making the comment. After apologising for the off-the-cuff remark, she was invited to see what the Lincolnshire seaside town had to offer. After an extensive tour, Ms Parkin described it as ""the best of British"". Ms Parkin fed tigers at Lincolnshire Wildlife Park On her only previous trip, she said the town's nightlife had been ""a bit too boozy and raucous for my liking"". Town mayor Danny Brookes accompanied Ms Parkin, her boyfriend and a group of friends as they ticked off some of Skegness's top attractions. Meeting the donkeys on the beach Helter skelter ride on the pier Water zorbing Behind the scenes tour of Skegness Aquarium Feeding the tigers at Lincolnshire Wildlife Park Overnight stay in a converted ex-control tower at RAF Wainfleet The 40-year-old from Leeds said: ""I've had an absolutely amazing weekend, they did everything to try and win me over and they have. ""It was all first class; we were treated like royalty and everyone was so lovely and just super friendly."" Gina Parkin was given a grand tour by Skegness mayor Danny Brookes Ms Parkin recently returned from 18 months of travelling the world, visiting 21 countries, but said feeding the tigers at Lincolnshire Wildlife Park rivalled the best things she had experienced on the trip. She said: ""When I got back from travelling I had a renewed sense of respect for Britain in general, it was like I was seeing everything again with new eyes. ""I felt a bit bad; Skegness is a beautiful, traditional seaside town with its bright colours, deck chairs - it's the best of British, we should be very proud of it."" Ms Parkin and her boyfriend Simon Saintly gave the resort the thumbs up The pair dressed up as pirates at Skegness Aquarium TheLonely Planet travel guidedescribed the resort as ""the ABC of the English seaside - amusements, bingo and candy-floss, and added that ""culture vultures will probably run a mile"".

Rugby ref reveals ongoing bulimia battle,"Rugby union referee Nigel Owens reveals his struggle with eating disorder bulimia nervosa is not over and remains an ongoing battle. There have been a number of 'firsts' in my life. As a referee in world-class rugby, one of the most macho sports on the planet, I was the first in the sport to come out as being gay. In the hope of reaching out to other young people struggling with mental health, I was also one of the first sportsmen to speak openly about the biggest regret of my life - a suicide attempt. Early one morning at the age of 26, I left a note for my mum and dad, both of whom had been hugely supportive of me, explaining I couldn't carry on, that I desperately wanted to bring it all to an end. I took an overdose, laid down on a Welsh mountainside and waited to die. Doctors later told me I was just 20 minutes from death when I was airlifted to hospital by a police helicopter. So I got a second chance. I was determined not to waste it and using my experience to help someone else is a pretty good way of ensuring that. Which brings me onto another 'first'; I've spoken about dealing with bulimia in the past but have never before revealed that to this day I continue to struggle with an eating disorder. Since the age of 18, I have had bulimia nervosa. Refereeing a local game not long after first picking up the whistle It is a disorder of overeating followed by fasting or self-induced vomiting or purging. It was a secret I was still battling to control as I stepped on to the pitch to referee the Rugby World Cup in 2015. And I'm not alone. Eating disorders have the highest death rate of any mental health illness and are estimated to affect 1.6 million people in the UK. Around 400,000 are thought to be men and boys. And that number is growing. The reasons vary from person to person; body image, obsessive exercise, sporting achievement and the relentless bombardment of ripped physiques on social media and so on. When I was growing up in a small village in rural Carmarthenshire, west Wales, over 30 years ago, social media didn't exist. I enjoyed a happy childhood with loving, supportive parents, grandparents, uncles and aunties. I had a good time at school and loved to go fishing and, of course, play rugby. So far, so normal. But when I reached my late teenage years, things changed. I started to realise that I was different, that ""something was wrong"". In the world I grew up in, you get a girlfriend, you get married, you have children, become grandparentsâ¦ and that's the way the world turns. But I was finding myself attracted to men and couldn't figure out what on earth was going on. Nigel was a teenager when depression over his sexuality began No one around him had any idea about the dark secret behind his weight loss (Nigel, left) It was totally alien to me. I had no idea what being gay was, I'd never even met a gay person before. Desperate not to become this person, I struggled to suppress him. I felt I was lying to my parents, the people that mattered the most to me, which went against everything I'd been taught. I became very depressed. Add to the burden the fact that I was overweight, about 16.5 stone (105 kg). In my eyes I was obese and thought ""no-one who I find attractive was ever going find me attractive while I'm fat"". So, I started making myself sick.

I'd eat all I wanted then go the loo and make myself sick. I suffered from mild colitis, a bowel condition, so would use that as an ideal excuse to friends when I had to slip off to the toilet all the time. I was lying and being sly which only exacerbated my depression. Before long I was bringing up every meal I ate. Over a period of four months, I'd lost five stone. No-one suspected a thing. I was running and training a lot and my friends and family could see me scoffing food every mealtime, so as far as they were concerned I was eating well. I was training hard so outwardly I looked fit and healthy. An eating disorder wouldn't have crossed anyone's mind. There wasn't much awareness back then and if there was it was associated with young girls. Meanwhile, I was about to get sucked even further into the vortex of self-harm and depression. Nigel as a teenager with his mother in the family home in Mynyddcerrig, Carmarthenshire In my eyes, I was now too thin and now thought ""no-one I find attractive is ever going to find me attractive while I'm skinny"". So I went to the gym and began using steroids. I became hooked on them for the next seven, eight years. Mental health issues, depression over my sexuality, bulimia and steroids - my life was an unrelenting nightmare. I was broken. I'll never forgive myself for what I put my parents through. Imagine getting up in the morning and finding that goodbye letter, the sheer panic that they're never going to see their son again. But if there was any consolation from this dreadful event, it was while recovering in hospital that my life began to turn around. Nigel with his father and late mother whom he describes as ""pillars of strength"" I tried to come to terms with who I was, I stopped taking the steroids and tried to fight against the bulimia. After years of struggling with an eating disorder it was when my beloved mother was diagnosed with cancer and given a year to live that I finally vowed to stop. I was 36 then. It stopped for a few years. I never sought professional help but I took advice from a professional nutritionist and followed a food plan. I cut a lot of carbohydrates from my diet and trained differently and I was in the best shape I'd ever been in, physical and mentally. The bulimia had stopped and I was doing the right thing to keep my weight down by eating sensibly. I would have treats but in moderation, I'm a big believer in that. Trouble can rear its head when you totally deny yourself some pleasures in life like chocolate or the odd pint of beer. In 2015 I reached the pinnacle of my career - I refereed a World Cup Final - in a memorable match between New Zealand and Australia. Ben Smith of New Zealand is shown the yellow card during the 2015 Rugby World Cup final at Twickenham I'm known for being a steely, authoritative and, I hope, fair referee. As I walked onto the pitch that day, no-one would have believed that I was battling the creeping return of my bulimia. In the run up to the Rugby World Cup, I'd been under huge pressure to reach certain fitness levels - you have to reach an advanced level on the Yo-Yo Endurance Test (a variation on the bleep test used to measure physical fitness). Fitness expectations are extremely high, particularly for somebody who was 44 years of age. Bear in mind international athletes in their prime, in their 20s, are expected to reach that level and I was expected to do the same. I was training hard but knew that if I could only shed four to five kilos my chances of passing the fitness test would improve - I'd be carrying less weight and my body would take longer to get tired. I remember looking at the mirror and thinking: ""Damn. I could get rid of this quite quickly."" And so the bulimia returned. Refereeing demands fitness to keep up with elite athletes half his age Once I'd passed the test, I resumed a good routine of fitness and nutrition and went into the Rugby World Cup in peak condition. What an incredible honour and experience that was. I'm not blowing my own trumpet but you're refereeing the world cup final, you're considered the best in the world. Not bad going for a former farm worker from west Wales eh? And a world away from the first time I'd picked up a whistle as a 16-year-old having accepted I was never going to make it as a player. But the following year, the pressure was off and I notice I was putting on weight and so the bulimia returned. It might have been twice a week then nothing for months and months. I know it does more harm than good so why do I still do it from time to time? I don't know. But what I do know is that unless I control what I eat and I'm sensible about it, there's going to come a time when I'm going to put on weight and I'm going to end up making myself sick again. So I do everything I can to prevent getting to that stage. Referee of the Year Award at the World Rugby Awards in London 2015 Awarded an MBE for services to sport in 2016 For those who are caught up in eating disorders and say there's nothing they can do about it, I understand what they are saying because it takes you over and you feel there is nothing you can do. But I would urge anyone suffering to do something - seek professional advice, tell people about it, don't hide it, don't lie about it, that's a great first step. I thought I was in control but since making the Panorama programme, I've realised I'm not. I came back from refereeing the England summer tour in Argentina a few weeks ago. While I was out there, I made myself sick three to four times - I think because I was eating more food than I needed. It's been a reality check. Speaking to experts I acknowledge now that I need to do something, to sit down and speak to someone and try and get this out of my life forever. People who've never had an eating disorder can try to imagine what it's like but they will never know. It's not as bad as 30 years ago but even today there's an attitude towards conditions like anorexia of 'oh for God's sake, don't be silly, eat some food!'. If only it was that easy. After all I've experienced in my life and having to deal with the pressure out in the field of making split-second decisions in front of millions of people, you would think I'd be strong enough to stop my bulimia. Boxer Bradley Pryce talks on Panorama about how he resorted to making himself sick to get his weight down I'm speaking openly about it because I know that men and boys can view it as a sign of weakness by admitting there's a problem that you can't sort out yourself. But it's not a sign of weakness; it's a sign of great strength to do that. On the programme I speak to professional boxer Bradley Pryce who made himself in the past sick to lose weight. You see these guys in the ring and think they embody mental toughness and physical strength. It goes to show that everybody can suffer from it - a world cup rugby referee, young teenage boys and professional boxers. If men can find it within themselves to open up about their own experiences of eating disorders, you would find them in all walks of life and in every sport in the world. One of the experts I've spoken to highlights how much body image has changed for men. A generation ago manliness would have been seen as being good at sport, providing for the family. Now there's so much more emphasis on being muscular, having a ripped body with a six-pack. And if you don't have a six-pack you're not going to be happy and no-one's going to like you. That's complete rubbish. And for the majority of us this is a totally unrealistic expectation. So the more men do open up and talk about eating disorders, then the easier it's going be to bust the stigma that this is only a female problem and, more importantly, raise awareness of the help needed to tackle this and ensure the funding is in place to provide it. As for me, I'm focusing on passing the fitness test for the 2019 world cup. What the challenges will be when I finish refereeing and I won't have to train for something specific, I really don't know. But one thing I absolutely do know is that the bulimia can't carry on. And I just hope that by speaking about my experience I can help many others reach the same conclusion. It's not always easy to get the help you need when you need it so the sooner you start talking to people the better. Don't be in my situation; 27 years on and still suffering from it.

Princes regret brief last call with Diana,"Prince William and Prince Harry have spoken of their regret that their last conversation with their mother was a ""desperately rushed"" phone call. Prince Harry, who was 12 when Princess Diana died, said: ""All I do remember is probably regretting for the rest of my life how short the phone call was."" In an ITV documentary to mark 20 years since their mother's death, the princes also spoke of her ""fun"" parenting. Diana encouraged them to be ""naughty"" and smuggled them sweets, they said. The princes added that she was a ""total kid through and through"", who understood the ""real life outside of palace walls"". This video can not be played ""She was one of the naughtiest parents"": Prince Harry and Prince William on their memories of their mother Unpublished photos of the princes with their mother feature in the programme. Prince Harry and Prince William are seen looking through Diana's personal album as they talk about how their childhood memories of their mother sat alongside her global image and influence as a campaigner for the homeless, Aids victims, and banning landmines. Princess Diana was killed in a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997 when Prince William was 15 and Prince Harry was 12. Prince William said taking part in the programme initially seemed ""quite daunting"" but had been ""a healing process as well"". He said they wanted ""her legacy to live on in our work and we feel this is an appropriate way of doing that"". Princess Diana was pregnant when photographed with Prince William here. ""Believe it or not, you and I are both in this photograph,"" the Duke of Cambridge tells his brother in the programme But the Duke of Cambridge said the last conversation with their mother weighs ""quite heavily"" on his mind. It took place while the brothers were having a ""very good time"" with their cousins at Balmoral, the Queen's home in Scotland. ""Harry and I were in a desperate rush to say goodbye, you know 'see you later'... if I'd known now obviously what was going to happen, I wouldn't have been so blasÃ© about it and everything else,"" he said. Prince William says in the interview he remembers what his mother said - but does not reveal details of the conversation. Prince Harry said: ""It was her speaking from Paris, I can't really necessarily remember what I said but all I do remember is probably regretting for the rest of my life how short the phone call was."" Recalling Princess Diana's sense of humour, Prince Harry said: ""Our mother was a total kid through and through. ""When everybody says to me 'so she was fun, give us an example' all I can hear is her laugh in my head."" He added: ""One of her mottos to me was, you know, 'you can be as naughty as you want,  just don't get caught'. ""She was one of the naughtiest parents.  She would come and watch us play football and, you know, smuggle sweets into our socks."" The photos shown in the programme were taken from Princess Diana's personal album Prince William said his mother was ""very informal and really enjoyed the laughter and the fun"". She could be ""sort of the joker"", he added, and ""loved the rudest cards you could imagine"". He said: ""I would be at school and I'd get a card from my mother. Usually she found something, you know, very embarrassing, you know, a very funny card, and then sort of wrote very nice stuff inside. ""But I dared not open it in case the teachers or anyone else in the class had seen it."" Prince Harry and Prince William, now aged 32 and 35 respectively, say Diana was ""the best mother ever"" He also talked about the ""very funny memory"" of coming home from school to find his mother had invited supermodels Cindy Crawford, Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell to their home in Kensington Palace. ""I was probably a 12 or 13-year-old boy who had posters of them on his wall,"" he told Monday's documentary, Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy. ""I went bright red, and didn't know quite what to say and sort of fumbled and I think pretty much fell down the stairs on the way up. I was completely and utterly awestruck."" Earlier this month, theprinces attended a service to re-dedicate their mother's graveat Althorp House in Northamptonshire, on what would have been her 56th birthday. Prince Harry said he had only cried twice for his mother - one of the times was at the funeral service at Althorp in 1997. ""So there's a lot of grief that still needs to be let out,"" he said. Peter Hunt on the princes taking control of Diana's memory Prince William, who was accompanied at the re-dedication service by the Duchess of Cambridge, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, said he keeps the memory of his mother alive for his children by ""constantly talking about granny Diana"". ""She'd be a lovely grandmother, she'd absolutely love it, she'd love the children to bits,"" he said. And he joked: ""She'd be a nightmare grandmother, absolute nightmare... She'd come, probably at bath time, cause an amazing... scene, bubbles everywhere bath water all over the place and then leave."" The princes, pictured here with their mother in 1992, recall their last conversation with her Reflecting on the anniversary of Princess Diana's death, Prince Harry told ITV: ""To myself and William she was just the best mother ever."" He said: ""It has been hard and it will continue to be hard, there's not a day William and I don't wish that she was still around and we wonder what kind of mother she would be now, and what kind of a public role she would have and what a difference she would be making."" The princes have also both agreed to take part in a forthcomingBBC documentaryabout their mother. They were were speaking to ITV from their home at Kensington Palace where they will unveil a statue of their mother in its public gardens on the 20th anniversary of her death. Prince William said: ""We won't be doing this again - we won't speak as openly or publicly about her again, because we feel hopefully this film will provide the other side from close family friends you might not have heard before, from those who knew her best and from those who want to protect her memory, and want to remind people of the person that she was."" Thedocumentary will be broadcast on ITV,externalandSTV,externalat 21:00 BST on Monday, 24 July.

Shooting at Israeli embassy in Jordan,"Security forces have closed roads in the area An Israeli guard has shot dead a Jordanian who attacked him with a screwdriver next to the Israeli embassy in Jordan, Israeli officials say. A second Jordanian was inadvertently killed in the gunfire, Israel says. The guard was reportedly wounded. The attacker was a carpenter working in a residential building used by the embassy, an Israeli statement said. It is one of the most serious incidents between the two countries since they signed a peace treaty in 1994. The second Jordanian, who died from his wounds in hospital, was identified as the building's landlord. Jordanian police have sealed off the area around the heavily protected embassy in the Rabiyeh neighbourhood, an affluent part of the capital city. According to the Vienna Convention of 1961 the security man has immunity from investigation and arrest, the Israeli foreign ministry said. The incident came at a time of heightened tension in the region over a Jerusalem holy site. On Friday, thousands of Jordanians protested in Amman against Israel over the installation of metal detectors outside a site sacred to both Muslims and Jews in East Jerusalem. Jordan, which occupied East Jerusalem from 1949 to 1967, is the custodian of the site, which is known to Muslims as Haram al-Sharif and Jews as the Temple Mount. Tensions between Israelis and Palestinians over the site have surged in recent days in response to the metal detectors, which were put in place following the killing nearby of two Israeli policemen. Security cameras have nowalso been installed at a gateway leading to the site.

Corbyn: I didn't promise debt write-off,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I did not make a commitment that we would write it off"" Jeremy Corbyn has insisted he did not promise to write off all student debt while appealing to young voters during the general election. During the campaign, the Labour leader said he would ""deal with"" the issue of graduates burdened with debt since tuition fees rose to Â£9,000. He told the BBC he had never promised to abolish all debt as Labour ""were unaware of the size of it at the time"". Tory MPs have accused him of misleading students and said he should apologise. Historical levels of student debt in England since tuition fees were introduced rose to Â£76.3bn last year and senior Labour figures have said an across the board debt moratorium could cost in the region of Â£100bn. Student loan debt up for private sale Labour 'aim' to wipe Â£100bn student debt Many believe Labour's pledge to scrap university tuition fees for future undergraduates and help existing students was one of the factors behind its better-than-expected election performance last month. An unexpectedly large turnout among students helped Labour win seats such as Canterbury, which it took for the first time in 100 years, and increase its majority in cities such as Cambridge, Bristol and Leeds. Mr Corbyn has been accused of using students as ""election fodder"" after he claimed during the campaign that he would also look at ways to lengthen the period of paying existing debt off or ""some other means of reducing that debt burden"". He told the music and lifestyle title NME he didn't see ""why those that had the historical misfortune to be at university during the Â£9,000 period should be burdened excessively compared to those that went before or those that come after"". In recent weeks, senior Labour figures have distanced themselves from talk of a debt amnesty, saying that while it remains a long-term ambition, they do not yet know how it could be funded. Speaking on the Andrew Marr show, Mr Corbyn said his remarks during the election did not amount to a ""commitment"" to erase student debt and the party would be expanding on its position in the near future. ""I did not make a commitment we would write it off because I couldn't at that stage,"" he said. ""I pointed out we had written the manifesto in a short space of time because there was a surprise election but that we would look at ways of reducing that debt burden, recognising that a lot of it is never going to be collected anyway and try and reduce that."" ""We never said we would completely abolish it because we were unaware of the size of it at the time,"" he added. Universities minister Jo Johnson said Labour was abandoning what he called ""a welter of outlandish promises"" made to young people during the election. ""It is becoming ever clearer that Jeremy Corbyn is looking to walk away from a host of undeliverable pre-election promises to students, making this the most blatant example of switch and bait in recent political history,"" he said. Under the current system, loans that are not repaid after 30 years are written off for graduates who began their degree courses after 2012 and after 25 years for those who studied from 2006 to 2012. Recent research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggested students in England are set to graduate with average debts of Â£50,800, with many poorer students incurring much higher sums.

Scot shot hours before Philippines wedding,"Tarek Naggar was outside a shop with his fiancee when he was shot in the chest A Scottish man has been shot during a robbery hours before he was due to get married in the Philippines. Tarek Naggar, 44, was outside a shop in Cebu City when three men demanded he hand over his wallet. When he refused to give it up, one of the men pulled out a gun and shot him in the chest. Mr Naggar, who is from Milngavie in East Dunbartonshire, has undergone surgery and remains seriously ill in hospital. The joiner, who recently had been working in Sweden, was due to get married this weekend to his fiancÃ©e Angie, who is from the Philippines. He was standing outside a convenience store in her home city of Cebu in the early hours of Thursday when a motor scooter with three men clinging to it pulled up. His best man Chris McLaughlin, who had flown out bringing his friend a kilt for the wedding, was a short distance away when the attack happened. Mr McLaughlin, 40, from Bearsden, East Dunbartonshire, said: ""I heard a commotion and ran over to see what was happening. A guy pulled a gun out and shot Tarek in the chest. Then he pointed the gun at myself."" He said an ambulance was called but failed to show up and they had to travel to hospital in a rickshaw. ""Tarek's fiancee was trying to call taxis but there was none stopping. I was on the floor with Tarek. He was conscious. After about 10 minutes or so a guy stopped in a rickshaw,"" he told BBC Scotland. Mr Naggar was treated at a nearby emergency room, then transferred to a larger hospital for surgery. ""The surgeon said the bullet went in the right side but ricocheted and travelled over to the left lung. Miraculously it didn't go through his heart, it actually went behind his heart. ""He seems to be recovering well. He's conscious and awake - and has been talking the last couple of days. He's out of the ICU and has been moved to a recovery room."" He said he did not believe Mr Naggar had any health insurance, and the family have already had to make payments for his treatment. Another friend has begun a crowdfunding appeal to raise money for his medical costs.

Man held for 'trying to open plane door',"The incident happened on board a flight from Poland A plane passenger was tackled by fellow travellers as he tried to open an emergency door on board a flight. Police were called to London's Luton Airport shortly before 23:00 BST on Saturday to deal with a ""disruptive passenger"" on a flight from Poland. He was prevented from opening the door by passengers who ""wrestled him to the floor"", a witness said. He was arrested on suspicion of endangering an aircraft, police said. The incident happened on board Wizz Air flight W61005 from Katowice International Airport in southern Poland. About 30 minutes before landing the man ""walked from the front of the plane and sat next to a woman by the emergency exit over the wing"", passenger David Salon said. ""Suddenly he lunged across her and tried to open the door. She was terrified. ""Luckily there were three big Polish men in the row behind and they and some other passengers wrestled him to the floor and sat on him,"" Mr Salon, 44 said. Air crew then restrained his hands using seatbelts used in safety demonstrations. The man was arrested at the airport when the flight landed Mr Salon, originally from Poland but now working as a chef in Oxford, said the man was Polish and in his 20s. He had been ""acting weirdly on the bus on the way to the plane in Poland"", he added. Passengers were asked to remain on board once the flight landed until police had taken the suspect away. Bedfordshire Police confirmed the arrested man was initially taken to hospital to be treated for minor injuries and was now being questioned. Wizz Air confirmed an incident had taken place on the flight, saying a passenger had ""become unruly and abusive"". ""The Wizz crew on duty followed standard procedures to ensure the continued safe operation of the flight.

Eight teak carriages on the North Yorkshire Moors Railway in Pickering had windows smashed overnight, with furniture and fixings also ruined. The carriages, dating from 1930 to 1950, have regularly been featured in films and television, the railway said. North Yorkshire Police is investigating the attack. Fire extinguishers were also set off throughout the carriages, soaking the furniture and wall fittings. Fire extinguishers were sprayed inside the carriages, with furniture and fittings damaged The railway said the full extent of the damage was not yet known, but repair costs would run ""into the thousands if not more"". Chris Price, general manager at the railway, said: ""We were absolutely devastated to discover that the carriages had been damaged overnight, obviously all the staff and volunteers are extremely upset. ""I doubt very much that the set will run again in the 2017 season."" The railway had been holding a 1960s themed event on Saturday On Saturday, thousands of people attended a live music event at the railway called '60s Fest' - held metres away from where the carriages were vandalised. The railway warned there would be service disruptions on the line due to the damage caused. North Yorkshire Police said the carriages were vandalised at some point between 22:00 BST on Saturday and 07:00 on Sunday. Insp Martin Dennison said: ""What has been a busy and enjoyable weekend for all those involved in the North Yorkshire Moors Railway, has now been overshadowed by this mindless act of vandalism.

Everything Marvel unleashed at Comic-Con,"The Marvel panel at Comic-Con is traditionally one of the biggest events of the convention and this year was no exception. Despite a lot of news coming out of Disney's D23 last week, the studio still saved some of the big guns for San Diego. Fans were sent into meltdown as they were bombarded with announcements and sneak peeks during the 90-minute session, as stars across the Marvel universe attended to support their films. Here's everything that was revealed. The former Catwoman will join Paul Rudd and play Janet Van Dyne - the original Wasp and first wife of original Ant-Man Dr Henry Pym - played by Michael Douglas - and mother to Hope Pym, the new Wasp, played by Evangeline Lily. Marvel boss Kevin Feige said: ""She was our dream choice."" Laurence Fishburne also joins the cast as scientist Bill Foster, who worked alongside Pym and became superhero Giant-Man. Relatively obscure Marvel villain The Ghost will also appear. Fans tweeted the concept art for Captain Marvel and the Skrulls shown in Hall H Brie Larson's film - the first Marvel movie to be focused around a female lead - will be set before Iron Man in the Marvel timeline. Samuel L Jackson will reprise his role as Nick Fury and will have two eyes as it takes place before he loses one and adopts his famous eye patch. The villains in the film will be The Skrull - green alien shape-shifters.

Jeff Goldblum confirmed his character, the Grandmaster, is the brother of Benicio del Toro's Marvel universe character universe The Collector, as seen in Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor: The Dark World. Anew trailer,externalwas unveiled giving a closer look at Hela, the first look at Bruce Banner, lots of explosions and featuring some of the more comedy moments from the film. A new poster for Marvel's first black superhero to be brought to the big screen was unveiled. New footage was also played, showing a fierce battle in a casino, receiving a standing ovation. Director Ryan Coolger revealed the origin of his love for the hero: ""I wanted to find a comic book character who looks like me. The shop owner gave me Black Panther."" After fans at D23 were given the chance to see the first footage from the highly anticipated film which sees every Marvel superhero unite on screen, 6,000 Comic-Con fans were given the same luxury. Unfortunately Marvel are still keeping it a closely guarded secret so it hasn't been put online anywhere yet - much to the annoyance of fans not in San Diego. But the reaction from the crowd suggests something close to Beatlemania. It's likely we'll have to wait until November when Thor: Ragnarok is released before the rest of the world will see it.

RAF ace honoured at German supermarket,"This video can not be played James Lacey is thought to have downed 28 enemy planes during WW2 World War Two fighter pilot James Harry ""Ginger"" Lacey is being honoured with a blue plaque this weekend at his birthplace - now the site of a German-owned supermarket. While WW2 pilots like Douglas Bader and Guy Gibson became household names, Lacey's story is less well known. With a nickname straight out of a Biggles adventure book, and a life story to match the fictional pilot, Ginger Lacey went from learning to fly to becoming one of the heroes of the Battle of Britain in just three years. One of ""The Few"", Lacey downed at least 28 enemy planes during World War Two and was a rare example of someone who served in the RAF on both the first and final day of the war. Due to both skill and luck, in his own words, he survived nine crash landings and famously shot down a German plane that had just bombed Buckingham Palace. Lacey died in 1989 and his achievements have been honoured with a blue plaque on the land where his childhood home once stood in Wetherby, West Yorkshire. The site is now home to an Aldi supermarket, with the plaque displayed at the store's entrance. ""Dad would have enjoyed the irony,"" said his daughter Min Lacey. This video can not be played Ginger Lacey was one of the pilots described as the ""backbone of RAF Fighter Command"" Born on 1 February 1917 at Fairfield Villas in Wetherby, West Yorkshire, Lacey had a rural upbringing, with his father adamant he would join the family business. Ms Lacey, 57, said: ""He desperately wanted to join the RAF, but his dad wanted him to be a farmer - it wasn't until his father died that he managed to convince his mum. ""He was a pale and skinny kid and his mum thought he would fail the medical, but of course he didn't."" While working as a trainee pharmacist in Leeds, Lacey learnt to fly with the RAF Volunteer Reserve at weekends and became an instructor at the Yorkshire Flying School in Yeadon in 1938. As war broke out in 1939, he had amassed 1,000 hours of flight time and was sent to France as an RAF flight sergeant to support the British troops. Lacey attended Crossley Street Primary School, seen in this photograph sitting in the front row second from the left Flying a Hurricane with Number 501 Squadron, on the morning of 13 May 1940, he shot down two German planes over the Ardennes region. Ms Lacey said: ""When he landed, no-one believed him. He later shot down another in the afternoon - three in his first combat of World War Two."" For his bravery during the Battle of France, he was awarded the French Croix de Guerre medal, but was not presented with it until the 1980s. ""The Germans marched into Paris on the day he was due to collect it, so they had to put that on hold,"" his daughter said. Ginger Lacey was stationed at Gravesend Airport during the Battle of Britain Lacey, seen on the left, served in the RAF for the duration of World War Two By the summer of 1940, France had surrendered to Germany, and Adolf Hitler had turned his attention to Britain, but the Nazi leader needed the Luftwaffe to take control of the skies above the south of England before he could contemplate a ground invasion. Gordon Leith, curator at the Royal Air Force Museum, said: ""It was a critical time. Following the defeat at Dunkirk they must have been aware that invasion was impending and a lot depended on their efforts."" As the Luftwaffe started to bomb airfields and factories, Lacey was ordered back to Britain and was stationed at Gravesend Airport for the majority of the Battle of Britain. Ginger Lacey's thoughts on the Luftwaffe, from a 1978BBC radio interview We called them bandits... which meant either unidentified or enemy aircraft. It was never meant to describe the people in it or anything like that. I much preferred to kill someone without them even knowing I was there - the first indication he was being shot at was when bullets were coming out of his chest. You were there to get rid of his aeroplane, it didn't cross your mind that it was a man You were firing at an aeroplane of a different kind wearing the wrong markings and flying in our sky. We had been told to get rid of them, so we got rid of them; there was no feeling about it. I didn't go round hating Germans or liking Germans. I had never met a German in my life so I couldn't have any preconceived opinion of what one looked like, acted like or sounded like. In a 1978 BBC interview, he recalled waking up in a hut by the runway as the pilots waited for the phone to ring. ""You would have a cup of tea, some breakfast, you would go out to your aircraft, a couple of hundred yards, check the aircraft, get our parachutes out, fit our helmets in the aircraft, hang them over the control column and make ourselves as comfortable as possible waiting for the first call,"" Lacey said. Number 501 Squadron lost 17 men during the Battle of Britain, with Lacey's roommates regularly changing as comrades were killed. Asked by the BBC's Norman Tozer how he ended up still alive and holding one of Britain's highest ""scores"" of the battle, Lacey said it was down to experience and ""an awful lot of luck"". ""I was shot down nine times in 16 weeks. Twice I got out with my aeroplane burning from end to end, once with no tail on it,"" he said. ""When someone has done that to your plane, you've got to have had a lot of luck to have avoided the bullets which mangled the aeroplane."" Battle of Britain: July to October 1940 In July 1940 the RAF deployed 640 planes while the Luftwaffe could call on 2,600 fighters and bombers Although Fighter Command was initially outnumbered, Britain ramped up factory production and by October had more fighter planes than the Luftwaffe Nearly 3,000 aircrew served with RAF Fighter Command The average age of a pilot was 20 The RAF lost 1,023 planes and the Luftwaffe lost 1,887 planes His daughter thinks his survival and hit rate was down to his shooting skills, with ammunition in short supply at the time. She said: ""He was a very good marksman, he brought down aircraft with five shots, so he was never going to run out of ammunition, was he? ""He was also able to conquer sheer terror day after day: can you imagine being in that tiny cockpit, frozen, terrified, doing seven flights a day and not knowing if you were going to come back from any of them?"" During the Blitz, Lacey was scrambled to stop a Heinkel He 111 plane that had flown above the capital and bombed Buckingham Palace. ""He was injured when the rear gunner fired back at him and he had to crash land. He was actually forced to glide the aircraft back to Gravesend,"" Mr Leith said. Lacey was presented with the first parachute to be manufactured in Australia in 1941 Despite still being in his early 20s, Lacey was one of the more experienced pilots of the Battle of Britain. Mr Leith said: ""He was one of the famous sergeant pilots which made up the backbone of RAF Fighter Command. ""He isn't as well known as some of the officer pilots, but for those who study it he is given the respect he deserves as one of the leading pilots of the battle."" He added: ""Not many survived the entire war, most were either killed, injured or taken prisoner, so for an aircrew member to have a record like that, it must have been pretty scarce."" Lacey was asked to be a technical adviser on the 1969 film Battle of Britain Bianca Jagger and Michael Caine, pictured on the set of the film After the Battle of Britain, Lacey was promoted to flight lieutenant and awarded a Bar to his Distinguished Flying Medal. He continued flying fighter missions until the end of the war, including a transfer to India where he took on the Japanese. At the end of World War Two, he was credited with having shot down 28 confirmed planes, four ""probables"" and nine damaged - one of the highest tallies of all the RAF's British fighter pilots. Lacey, pictured on the left, returned to Yorkshire to be a flying instructor after he left the RAF Married with three children, Lacey went full circle after the conflict and started to teach flying again in Yorkshire. His daughter recalls a particularly memorable 16th birthday present, after he had told her he had not planned anything special. ""He flew a plane up and I jumped out of it with a parachute,"" Ms Lacey said. ""It's the third scariest thing I've done in my life, behind going on Mastermind and showing my dog around the Crufts arena."" Ginger took his daughter Min for a parachute jump on her 16th birthday Lacey was asked to be a technical adviser on the 1969 film Battle of Britain, starring Michael Caine, as director Guy Hamilton -who had a distinguished war record himself- wanted the movie to be as true to real life as possible. Living in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, Ginger later became an instructor at Hull Aero Club, helping more than 4,000 flyers attain a private pilot's licence. Peter Spencer, club secretary, said: ""His style was unorthodox but very accomplished on account of his experience flying RAF fighter aircraft in the war. ""In 2016, we dedicated our new training facility at Beverley Airfield in his memory."" The plaque has been installed at the site where Lacey was born in Wetherby Peter Catton, of the Wetherby Civic Society, which was behind the move to award the blue plaque, said: ""It sounds like he had a very wry sense of humour and was a practical joker, so I think that he would have found it quite funny that he was being commemorated in a German-owned supermarket. ""I get the impression that he loved flying, and I think he was a genuine hero, but I doubt that he would have recognised himself as one."" A Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Lancaster bomber performed a flypast above the plaque-unveiling ceremony in Wetherby The blue plaque was officially unveiled on Sunday, with the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight performing a flypast. Clare Vause, store manager at Aldi in Wetherby, said the team were pleased to ""play our part in marking this important historical milestone"". Attempting to sum up Lacey's legacy, Mr Leith said: ""He was a very popular, influential person who served his country, was keen to get people into flying and a real RAF enthusiast.""

Eight dead in truck in Texas car park,"This video can not be played Migrant deaths: How one Texas county is struggling to cope Police in the US state of Texas have arrested a truck driver whose vehicle was found in a Walmart car park with dozens of people in the back of it. Nine men had died inside, and 28 others, including children, were taken to hospital. They were inside the trailer in San Antonio without access to air conditioning or water while outside temperatures hit 38C (100F). Police say they believe the incident is linked to people smuggling. The truck's driver, named by authorities as James Mathew Bradley Jr, 60, of Clearwater, Florida, is expected to appear in court later. Video footage from the store reportedly showed a number of vehicles arriving to pick up some of the survivors. Several others may have managed to escape on foot into the woods nearby. One person found in the woods was being treated, local officials said. Mexico's government said it was working closely with US authorities to identify the nationalities of the victims. San Antonio is a few hours' drive from the border with Mexico, and the US immigration department is trying to establish the victims' legal status. San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg told the BBC that caring for the victims was the authorities' first aim. ""Our most important focus right now is to deliver compassionate care,"" he said. ""You know our first responders immediately were on the scene, delivering first aid, transporting - sometimes by air - critical condition patients to local hospitals, and trying to prevent more loss of life than what had already occurred."" ""We are working with authorities, we are working with... witnesses to understand the magnitude of these crimes. ""But in this case, where we are witnesses to a human tragedy in our city, our first response and our response as local officials is to render aid."" Eight people were found to be dead at the scene while another died in hospital, immigration officials said. This video can not be played Police Chief William McManus and Fire Chief Charles Hood told reporters about the discovery Officials were brought to the trailer by a man who had approached an employee of the Walmart and asked for water. The driver would be charged in connection with the ""horrible tragedy"", said San Antonio police chief William McManusin a press briefing,external. He said the people ranged from school age to in their 30s. Local fire chief Charles Hood said the survivors had heart rates of over 130 beats per minute and were very hot to touch. In addition to the 20 people in a critical condition, eight others were taken to hospital in a less severe state. The fire chief confirmed at least two of the victims were school-age children. Their condition is not clear. ""We're very fortunate that there weren't 38 of these people who were all locked inside this vehicle dead,"" he added. The truck was towed away from the scene hours after the discovery The US attorney for the Western District of Texas, Richard Durbin, said the authorities were working to identify those responsible for the incident. ""These people were helpless in the hands of their transporters. Imagine their suffering, trapped in a stifling trailer in 100-plus degree heat,"" he said in a statement. They were victims of ""ruthless human smugglers indifferent to the wellbeing of their fragile cargo"", he added. Thirty-three migrants were found in a trailer in the same part of Texas earlier this month Experts say people smuggling is a serious issue in southern Texas, and there have been a number of similar cases in the area just in this past month. On 7 July, US Border Patrol agents found 72 undocumented immigrants from Central American countrieslocked inside a trailer,external""with no means of escape"". The next day33 people,externalwere found locked inside a trailer at a checkpoint on the road to San Antonio.

Injured walker 'crawled for hours',"Dundonnell Mountain Rescue Team said the Fisherfield Forest was one of the most remote areas of the UK A woman has been rescued from one of the UK's most remote areas after crawling for hours with an injured ankle. The woman was attempting the ""Fisherfield Five"" Munros near Dundonnell with her partner when she slipped and was unable to walk further. After a ""lengthy crawl"", Dundonnell Mountain Rescue Team said the pair had spent the night on the mountain. The woman was airlifted on Saturday, about 20 hours after her slip. The pair, who are in their late 20s, initially set out on Friday to tackle the five Munros in the Fisherfield Forest, an area south-west of Ullapool known as the ""Great Wilderness"". A spokesman for the rescue team said the woman had injured her ankle at about 15:00 on Friday. She crawled for several hours before they decided to ""bed down"" for the night, the spokesman said. Neither of them had a mobile phone signal so the woman's uninjured partner set off on a five-hour walk in the early hours of Saturday morning to raise the alarm. The Coastguard rescue helicopter from Stornoway airlifted the woman to Raigmore Hospital for treatment at about 10:00 on Saturday. Fifteen members of Dundonnell Mountain Rescue Team were also involved in the rescue. The team also collected the couple's camping gear from the Shenavall bothy. Team leader Donald MacRae said: ""The couple did the right thing and were both well equipped. ""We were very grateful for the air assistance received as it would otherwise have resulted in over a 10-hour stretcher carry given the truly remote location.""

Fox wants EU transition over by election,"This video can not be played Fox sets 2022 deadline for EU transition Any transitional arrangement with the EU after Brexit must end by the time of the next election, Liam Fox has said. The international trade secretary told the BBC he had no ideological objection to interim arrangements to minimise disruption after the UK's exit in 2019. But he said he did not want them to ""drag on"" beyond the date of the next general election, scheduled for 2022. The cabinet is said to be united behind a transition although reports it could last four years have been downplayed. Chancellor Philip Hammond is reported to support a lengthy transitional period to bring certainty to business, which is concerned about the impact on trade and employment of a ""cliff-edge"" departure. Cabinet 'united' over EU transition deal UK and EU at odds on Brexit 'bill' Analysis: Pragmatism taking hold? Brexit: All you need to know Newspaper reports on Friday suggested ministers had accepted it could last anywhere between two and four years. Mr Fox, who is in Washington for discussions on future trade relations with the US, told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that it was ""perfectly reasonable"" for there to be a transition period to ensure the process was as ""smooth as possible"" for British business and foreign investors. But he suggested that voters would want any ""voluntary"" arrangement to end by the time of the next general election, due to take place in May 2022. And he said he would want the UK to be able to negotiate its own trade deals during that period so it could take ""full advantage"" of its new status. ""Having waited over 40 years to leave the EU, 24 months would be a rounding error. ""Whether that is 23 or 25 is not a huge deal and neither is it an ideological one. German car manufacturers have said the UK must put pragmatism ahead of ideology ""It is about the practical issues we would face, such as getting any new immigration system into place, getting any new customs system into place."" However, he made clear there would have to be clarity not only on the duration of any transitional phase but what limitations it would place on the UK. Several Conservative MPs have suggested that any deal which required the UK to accept continued free movement for a limited period of time or the  jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice in return for continued temporary membership of the single market would be unacceptable. Mr Fox added: ""I think we would want to get it out of the way before the election. ""I don't think people would want to have it dragging on. I think we would have to be very clear it was time-limited and limited in its scope."" ""It is imperative that we leave the EU first and that any implementation period is done ""voluntarily"" alongside the EU to minimise any disruption."" The head of the powerful trade body representing German car manufacturers has told the BBC there will be a threat to jobs and investment in Britain if the UK leaves both the single market and the customs union. Matthias Wissman, whose members include Volkswagen, BMW and Porsche, said his preferred option was for the UK to adopt a Norwegian-style membership of the European Economic Area but, failing that, a lengthy transitional period was a bare minimum. ""You need a transition period,"" he told Radio 4's The World This Weekend. ""We hope that on the British side that gets deeper and deeper into the intellectual capabilities of those who decide."" Urging British politicians to put pragmatism ahead of ideology, he said a tariff-free trade deal with the EU was possible but only if ""the UK understands what the preconditions are"". ""Any kind of unwise, dramatic changes would have an effect on investment and jobs in the automotive industry. Hard Brexit would mean barriers, control of goods."" Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said he accepted the UK would be leaving the single market, as it was in his words ""inextricably linked"" with EU membership, but suggested he had not reached a final view on whether it would be better to remain within the customs union. He also suggested future trade deals should be linked to commitments on environmental protection and human rights. ""What is interesting is that the EU has said quite clearly, and rightly in my view, that they would only do new trade agreements with countries that sign up to the Paris climate change accord,"" he said. ""The US has said it wants to leave... so it calls into question the whole of the UK government's strategy on a one-off trade deal with the US.""

Eight dead in truck in Walmart car park,"This video can not be played Migrant deaths: How one Texas county is struggling to cope Police in the US state of Texas have arrested a truck driver whose vehicle was found in a Walmart car park with dozens of people in the back of it. Nine men had died inside, and 28 others, including children, were taken to hospital. They were inside the trailer in San Antonio without access to air conditioning or water while outside temperatures hit 38C (100F). Police say they believe the incident is linked to people smuggling. The truck's driver, named by authorities as James Mathew Bradley Jr, 60, of Clearwater, Florida, is expected to appear in court later. Video footage from the store reportedly showed a number of vehicles arriving to pick up some of the survivors. Several others may have managed to escape on foot into the woods nearby. One person found in the woods was being treated, local officials said. Mexico's government said it was working closely with US authorities to identify the nationalities of the victims. San Antonio is a few hours' drive from the border with Mexico, and the US immigration department is trying to establish the victims' legal status. San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg told the BBC that caring for the victims was the authorities' first aim. ""Our most important focus right now is to deliver compassionate care,"" he said. ""You know our first responders immediately were on the scene, delivering first aid, transporting - sometimes by air - critical condition patients to local hospitals, and trying to prevent more loss of life than what had already occurred."" ""We are working with authorities, we are working with... witnesses to understand the magnitude of these crimes. ""But in this case, where we are witnesses to a human tragedy in our city, our first response and our response as local officials is to render aid."" Eight people were found to be dead at the scene while another died in hospital, immigration officials said. This video can not be played Police Chief William McManus and Fire Chief Charles Hood told reporters about the discovery Officials were brought to the trailer by a man who had approached an employee of the Walmart and asked for water. The driver would be charged in connection with the ""horrible tragedy"", said San Antonio police chief William McManusin a press briefing,external. He said the people ranged from school age to in their 30s. Local fire chief Charles Hood said the survivors had heart rates of over 130 beats per minute and were very hot to touch. In addition to the 20 people in a critical condition, eight others were taken to hospital in a less severe state. The fire chief confirmed at least two of the victims were school-age children. Their condition is not clear. ""We're very fortunate that there weren't 38 of these people who were all locked inside this vehicle dead,"" he added. The truck was towed away from the scene hours after the discovery The US attorney for the Western District of Texas, Richard Durbin, said the authorities were working to identify those responsible for the incident. ""These people were helpless in the hands of their transporters. Imagine their suffering, trapped in a stifling trailer in 100-plus degree heat,"" he said in a statement. They were victims of ""ruthless human smugglers indifferent to the wellbeing of their fragile cargo"", he added. Thirty-three migrants were found in a trailer in the same part of Texas earlier this month Experts say people smuggling is a serious issue in southern Texas, and there have been a number of similar cases in the area just in this past month. On 7 July, US Border Patrol agents found 72 undocumented immigrants from Central American countrieslocked inside a trailer,external""with no means of escape"".

Refunds as Pokemon fest beset by glitches,"Organisers did a valiant job of keeping attendees upbeat despite the issues As many as 20,000 attendees at a Pokemon Go festival in Chicago are being offered refunds after technical glitches meant fans were mostly unable to catch anything - let alone âthem allâ. Disappointed fans will also be offered $100 in the form of the appâs in-game currency, Pokecoins. The event on Saturday had been touted as a chance for fans to come together and catch some of the rarest monsters on the hugely successful app. But fans booed and chanted âfix our game!â and âwe canât play!"" as executives from Niantic, the gameâs creator, attempted to explain the problems. At one point a bottle was thrown at a presenter on stage - it missed. Pokemon Go was launched last summer and has since been downloaded over 750 million times, reportedly making more than $1bn in revenue. The game required players to walk around the real world in order to find monsters in different locations. Fans had hoped to catch rare Pokemon at the event in Chicago's Grant Park On Saturday, in Chicagoâs Grant Park, fans had hoped to find some species of Pokemon that were otherwise not available or extremely rare. Tickets to the event sold out within around 10 minutes of going on sale, leading to many tickets being resold at almost 10 times their face value. But the festival succumbed to a combination of overwhelmed mobile networks, and several bugs that Niantic admitted were âon our sideâ. âWe know that this is not the day that we had all envisioned,â Mike Quigley, the firmâs chief marketing officer, told angry attendees. âBut we appreciate your patience.â As well as the technical problems, long lines prevented many ticket holders from getting into the event for more than three hours. âThis is the worst time I have ever had doing anything,âtweeted one fan,external, who later left. In an attempt to fix the issues, the company increased the radius of the event by a further two miles, meaning players could leave Grant Park in order to try and connect to the game and get access to the rare creatures. And just before 6pm local time, attendees were told they would all get a Lugia - a Pokemon that had not been available on the game before, an announcement that drew big cheers from an otherwise dejected crowd. ___________ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Pokemon Go or Pokemon Gone?
