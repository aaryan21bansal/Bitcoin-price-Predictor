Dad's colleagues do overtime for cancer son,"Andreas Graff was able to take a year off work to care for his son suffering from cancer Employees of a German company donated almost 3,300 hours in overtime so a colleague could look after his son with leukaemia, local media report. Single dad Andreas Graff has taken almost a year off being an assembly worker at a design company in Hesse. After four-year-old son Julius's cancer diagnosis, more than 700 colleagues responded to a manager's appeal. ""Without this great support, I would be unemployed,"" Mr Graff told local paper, Oberhessische Presse.

Germans win work-life balance dispute Mr Graff did not know how to prepare for a future of long hours in hospital. The first nine weeks of Julius' treatment required the then three-year-old to be confined to a bed. Mr Graff, 36, feared losing his job once he had exhausted his unpaid leave. But an HR manager stepped in. More than 700 colleagues responded to Pia Meier's (r) call for overtime donations to support Mr Graff (centre) and his son. With the support of senior management and the workers union, Pia Meier called on employees of Seidel and its subsidiary Carus in Fronhausen in central Germany to contribute to an overtime fundraiser. ""The reaction of our employees was incredible,"" she told Oberhessische Presse. Within two weeks of posting sign-up sheets, a total of 3,264.5 hours were collected. ""There is no-one who has not donated,"" Ms Meier added. Overwhelmed by the generosity of his colleagues, including trainees who had never met him, Mr Graff cried with joy at the thought he could take more than a year off work to care for Julius. But after nine months by his son's side in hospital, Mr Graff was about to bring Julius home when the family suffered another blow - the death of Mr Graff's wife and Julius's mother from heart disease.

Reddit bans fake porn videos and photos,"Reddit has blocked all content in affected forums, including posts that did not contain images Reddit has banned ""fake porn"" - imagery and videos that superimpose a subject's face over an explicit photo or video without the person's permission. The move follows,externalthe development of artificial intelligence software that made it relatively easy to create clips featuring computer-generated versions of celebrities' faces. Reddit had become one of the most popular places to share and discuss so-called deepfake videos. It also reworded itspolicy for minors,external. The discussion site had been under growing pressure to act after other platforms - including Twitter, Gfycat and Pornhub - introduced their own deepfake bans. This image of Natalie Portman was computer-generated from hundreds of stills and featured in an explicit video However, it may cause unease among some Reddit users who already feared the platform was becoming less ""open"" after its closure of two alt-right forums in 2017. The move coincided with anannouncement that Reddit's co-founder Alexis Ohanian,externalwas stepping aside from a hands-on role and would instead dedicate most of his time to a venture capital firm. He did not comment on the new policies but toldthe Wall Street Journal,externalthat he intended to focus on opportunities related to emerging technologies. ""There are clearly things around security and privacy and identity that are going to be dramatically changed through technology, just because it's now possible,"" he said. Mr Ohanian will remain a Reddit board member. Deepfakes involve the use of artificial intelligence software to create a computer-generated version of a subject's face that closely matches the original expressions of another person in a video. Several deepfake clips had been made to resemble the actress Gal Gadot The algorithm involved is believed to have been developed last year. To work it requires a selection of photos of the subject's face taken from different angles - about 500 different images are suggested for a good result - and a video clip to merge the results with. The practice was brought to the wider public's attention in December, when the news site Motherboard reported how it had been used to create fake videos of the Wonder Woman actress Gal Gadot. But it became much more common after January's release of a software tool called FakeApp, which made it possible to carry out the process with a single button press. FakeApp made it easier for users to make use of the face-swapping algorithm Not all of the clips generated have been pornographic in nature - many feature spoofs of US President Donald Trump, and one user has specialised in placing his wife's face in Hollywood film scenes. But much of the material generated has merged female pop singers and actresses' faces with footage of women engaged in sexual acts. Reddit's new involuntary pornography policy states that it ""prohibits the dissemination of images or video depicting any person in a state of nudity or engaged in any act of sexual conduct apparently created or posted without their permission, including depictions that have been faked"". The Deepfakes subreddit - which had more than 91,000 subscribers - was among the first forums to be deleted after its publication. But the site has also taken down the Celebfakes forum, whose focus was faked static images. It had been in existence for about seven years.

In recent days, there had been concern among the Deepfakes community itself that some users had been using the technology to create clips that featured the faces of under-16s - in effect child abuse imagery. Reddit has also clarified its policy over this practice. ""Reddit prohibits any sexual or suggestive content involving minors or someone who appears to be a minor,"" it said. ""Depending on the context, this can in some cases include depictions of minors that are fully clothed and not engaged in overtly sexual acts. If you are unsure about a piece of content involving a minor or someone who appears to be a minor, do not post it."" Reddit still allows posts featuring non-explicit videos created by the FakeApp software, and a forum dedicated to the tool itself remains online. But comments by its users indicate they are split over its decision to ban the other material. ""Good. It was empathetically and morally bankrupt trash,"" wrote one users. Another added: ""So many people think Reddit is crossing the line and going too far with this when they should be crossing the line... You don't want to be anywhere remotely close to this line. No company should be faulted for wanting a sizable buffer between them and child pornography,"" wrote one user. But someone else suggested the move would backfire: ""You realise that this precedent sets you up for an eventual removal of all not-safe-for-work content... You have no way to make sure that NSFW content adheres to your new standards or not. This is going to be seen as a mistake in time."" Others suggested that the move would merely drive pornographic deepfakes to other sites more willing to tolerate them. ""They're not going away just because the Reddit admins threw a tantrum,"" wrote one.

Briton who fought IS faces terror charge,"Jim Matthews appeared in a Channel 4 documentary in 2015 A British man who fought against so-called Islamic State is to be charged with a terror offence. Ex-soldier Jim Matthews, 43, of London, travelled to Syria and fought with the Kurdish forces, the YPG. Mr Matthews will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on 14 February to be charged with one count of attending a place used for terrorist training. He appeared in a Channel 4 documentary - The Brits battling Isis - about his fight against the jihadist group. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said Mr Matthews was alleged to have attended ""a place or places in Iraq and Syria where instruction or training was provided for purposes connected to the commission or preparation of terrorism on or before 15 February 2016"". The offence comes under section 8 of the Terrorism Act 2006. By BBC News correspondent Emma Vardy This is believed to be the first charge of its kind in the UK. It is estimated that since 2015 dozens of Britons have fought as volunteers with the Kurds in Syria. The YPG have been important allies of the West in helping to defeat so-called Islamic State. But terrorism laws in the UK prohibit engaging in violence for a political or ideological cause. It has so far been unclear how the actions of Britons fighting against Islamic State would be treated by the British courts. The government has long repeated warnings that fighting with any group could lead to legal consequences.

Robin Williams death 'suicide rise link',"Robin Williams was famous for films such as Good Morning,Vietnam and won an Oscar for his role in Good Will Hunting US suicide rates spiked in the months after Robin Williams killed himself in 2014, according to researchers. In the five months after the actor's death there were 10% more suicides than might be expected, or 1,841 extra cases, PLOS One journal reports. The potential risk of copycat incidents after celebrity cases is known to public health bodies. It cannot be known for certain if his death led to the spike but it appeared to be connected, the new study said. Experts say ""irresponsible"" media coverage of suicides can play a big part in copycat cases. Williams, who starred in films such as Good Morning, Vietnam and Good Will Hunting,was found dead in August 2014. At the time of his death,the Samaritans warned about a large number of news articles giving too much detail about the nature of his suicide,external, against media guidelines. Guidance from the World Health Organization, the Independent Press Standards Organisation's editors' code of practice, the Ofcom broadcasting code and the BBC's editorial guidelines all advise against going into explicit detail about the methods used. However, researchers said there was ""substantial evidence"" that many media outlets had tended to deviate from these guidelines. Williams won an Oscar for his role in Good Will Hunting For the latest study, they looked at the monthly suicide rates from the US government Centers for Disease Control and Prevention between January 1999 and December 2015 to see if there had been a spike. They found there were 18,690 suicides between August and December 2014 compared with the 16,849 cases they would have expected. In the weeks after Williams's death, there was a ""drastic"" increase in references to suicide and death in news media reports, as well as more posts on an internet suicide forum researchers monitored, the study found. David Fink, one of the study's authors, from Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, said research had previously shown that suicide rates increased following a high-profile celebrity suicide, but this was a first time such a study had been done within the era of the 24-hour news cycle. He told the BBC: ""By other people being aware of this person that they saw and can relate to having this experience, they gained the ability to take this action that otherwise wouldn't have been possible. ""That is where the press comes in. ""The more people hear and learn about the specific details of it, the more they can relate to it, potentially."" The researchers said it was possible another event also capable of increasing suicide rates had occurred during the same period as Williams's death but ""unlikely"". Netflix added an extra warning to a TV series called 13 Reasons Why Last year,Netflix added an extra warning to a TV series called 13 Reasons Whyamid concerns that viewers might copy its depiction of suicide. Lorna Fraser, from the Samaritans' media advisory service, said: ""This study builds on a strong body of research evidence that shows that irresponsible or overly detailed depictions of suicide can have a devastating impact. ""In the case of celebrities, the potential for someone at risk to make an emotional connection and over-identify with them is greater, in some cases even to interpret their death as affirmation that they could take their own life."" The influence celebrities can have on the public, whether positive or negative, should not be underestimated, said Robert Music, chief executive of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust. When British reality TV star Jade Goody was diagnosed with cervical cancer, in 2008, and died, in 2009, research showed about an extra 400,000 women attended cervical screening appointments. Goody had spoken out publicly about her disease and the importance of screening. Mr Music said the ""Jade Goody"" effect had since faded and screening attendance in England was now at a 20-year low.

Bus firm first to be fined over pensions,"Stotts Tours did not set up pensions for staff A bus company has become the first UK firm to be sentenced for failing to enrol staff on a pension scheme. Stotts Tours of Oldham, Greater Manchester, should have begun pension contributions for staff from 2015, The Pensions Regulator (TPR) said. The firm and its managing director Alan Stott previously admitted wilful failure to comply with pensions law. They were ordered to pay more than Â£39,000 at Brighton Magistrates' Court. District Judge Teresa Szagun said: ""Initially Mr Stott's attitude was to bury his head in the sand. This later left him in a position where he was out of his depth."" The fines and court costs come on top of Â£14,400 in civil fines already owed for failing to comply with the law on automatic pension enrolment. Stotts Tours must also pay an estimated Â£10,000 in backdated pension contributions for its staff, as well as ongoing contributions. Magistrates fined the company Â£27,000 and ordered it to pay Â£7,400 in costs and a Â£120 victim surcharge on Wednesday. Stott, 69, was ordered to pay a Â£4,455 fine and a Â£120 victim surcharge. According to the Pensions Act 2008,,externalevery employer in the UK, where appropriate, must contribute towards a pension scheme for their staff in a process known as automatic enrolment. Auto-enrolment has been phased inby the government since 2012, so that workers can save to top-up their state pension on retirement. Unless they are already signed up to a workplace pension, a slice of a worker's pay packet is automatically diverted to a pension savings pot, which is invested until retirement Their employer also makes a contribution, as does the government Individuals have the option to opt out if they wish, although that will mean losing the employer's contribution Anyone on a short-term contract, working where an agency pays their wages, or who is on maternity, adoption or carer's leave should still be eligible The total minimum contribution is currently set at 2% of earnings (0.8% from the worker, 1% from an employer, and 0.2% as tax relief from the government) From April 2018, it will increase to 5% of earnings (2.4% from the worker, 2% from the employer, and 0.6% as tax relief) From April 2019 onwards, it will rise to 8% of earnings (4% from the individual, 3% from the employer, and 1% as tax relief) In the first prosecution of its kind, TPR found 36 staff from Stotts Tours should have been put on a pension scheme from June 2015. TPR director Darren Ryder said ""automatic enrolment is not an option, it is the law"". He said: ""It's extremely disappointing that a tiny minority of employers continue to flout the law by denying their staff the pensions they are entitled to.""

Japanese firms in Downing Street talks,"Theresa May has told Japanese business leaders that Brexit will allow the UK to strike a free trade deal with Japan. In the Downing Street meeting she told bosses, including from Nissan, Mitsubishi, Panasonic, and Honda, that Brexit was ""no small undertaking"". The prime minister also said the government's modern industrial strategy made the UK ""more attractive"". The meeting comes amidconcern over estimates of the impactof Brexit on economic growth. Chancellor Phillip Hammond, Business Secretary Greg Clark, and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox also attended the meeting. ""I recognise that the UK's forthcoming exit from the European Union is no small undertaking, but importantly it does present the opportunity to strike free trade deals around the world and build on our already very strong relationship that we have with Japan,"" Mrs May told the assembled bosses. ""As we look to the relationship between the UK and Japan we see already year-on-year trade between our two countries continues to increase, with Japans's investment in the UK reaching Â£46.5bn in 2016."" ""Just today we have seen the Bank of England raise its forecast for UK growth compared with its estimates three months ago,"" Mrs May added. Representatives from Japanese banks and drug companies also attended the meeting. Japanese firms have spent billions of pounds in Britain over the past decades, encouraged to set up in the country by successive governments promising a business-friendly base from which to trade across the continent. EU 'seeks single market sanction power' Pressure on May to choose over Brexit Nissan, Toyota and Honda began their UK operations in Britain in the 1980s and now build nearly half of all of Britain's 1.67 million cars. The big majority of these are exported. The motor industry has expressed concern that their exports could face tariffs of up to 10% and be subject to customs delays after Britain leaves the European Union. Japanese drug companies have also made Britain their European base. Some are concerned about future drug regulations, with any divergence with the EU likely to pose regulatory challenges. London is also home to Japanese banks, such as Nomura, Daiwa Securities and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial. Like other foreign banks, they are keen to know about trading and so-called ""passporting"" arrangements for access to the EU. In 2016 Nissan chief executiveCarlos Ghosn met prime minister Theresa May amid fears over the future of its production plant in Sunderland. Nissan sought assurances over post-Brexit arrangements ahead of future investment in the Sunderland plant, Britain's biggest car factory.

Row over 'gay cure' film screeningCriticism prompts Vue cinema to cancel a private viewing of the film a day before the screening.1han hour agoUK,"A row has broken out over the screening of a film that advocates therapy to ""cure"" people from being gay. Christian group Core Issues Trust had hired a screen at Vue Piccadilly, London, to show the film ""Voices of the Silenced"" on Thursday.

Britons win legal step in EU rights casePost-Brexit citizenship will be discussed at the European court following a landmark ruling.3h3 hours agoEurope,"Stephen Huyton, left, with his family, is among those behind the legal action in the Netherlands The European Court of Justice (ECJ) is to be questioned on whether British people have rights to EU citizenship after Brexit. A Dutch judge has agreed to take the issue to the court following a landmark case brought by five British nationals. Netherlands-based Stephen Huyton is among the group that has been campaigning for ECJ intervention. If the ECJ does make a ruling, it might guarantee post-Brexit rights, such as freedom of movement. Mr Huyton, a director of a US firm who has lived in The Netherlands for the past 24 years, co-launched the action in Amsterdam. He said he was delighted with the Dutch judge's decision, but added that this was only the ""first step to clarity about what Brexit means for our EU citizenship"". He and his family maintain that they hold independent rights as EU citizens, above those of any specific member state. More than a million British nationals live in EU countries and about 42,500 live in the Netherlands. ""You cannot play with the lives of 1.2 million people as if they are pieces on a chess board,"" said Mr Huyton, who was not eligible to vote in the UK's EU referendum in 2016 as he had been living outside the UK for more than 15 years. EU citizenship is described in Article 20 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and includes the rights to: Travel and live anywhere in the EU Vote and stand as a candidate in European and local elections in another EU country Get diplomatic protection and consular help from any other EU country in another part of the world Read more: Brexit: Could UK get âassociate EU citizenshipâ? Would Brexit violate UK citizens' rights? The Netherlands is among a number of countries that restricts dual citizenship. The group's lawyer, Christiaan Alberdingk Thijm, said: ""Are you an EU citizen for life or can your citizenship be taken away from you? That is the fundamental question that will be put forward to the European Court."" In his court papers, he said the ECJ was the only court that could ""explain how to turn the political mess of Brexit into a judicial solution"".

Dozens charged over dark web crime site,"Thirty-six people have been charged for their alleged involvement in running a cyber-crime service responsible for more than $530m (Â£381m) of losses. The Infraud Organisationis said to have dealt,externalin stolen credit cards and passwords and engaged in bank fraud and ID theft. As of March 2017, its dark-web-based service's discussion forum is said to have had 10,901 registered members. The US Department of Justice said 13 of the suspects were now in custody. They include UK-based Anthony Nnamdi Okeakpu, who is alleged to have joined in December 2010 and have used the nickname ""moneymafia"". Other defendants include Svyatoslav Bondarenko, a Ukranian accused of having created Infraud in October 2010. Five apprehended defendants were based in the US while others came from France, Canada, Pakistan, Russia Egypt, Italy and Macedonia among other countries. ""As alleged in the indictment, Infraud operated like a business to facilitate cyber-fraud on a global scale,"" said acting assistant attorney general John Cronan of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. ""Its members allegedly caused more than $530m in actual losses to consumers, businesses, and financial institutions alike - and it is alleged that the losses they intended to cause amounted to more than $2.2bn."" This video can not be played Technology explained: What is the dark web? Affected businesses were said to have included HSBC bank and PayPal. The US authorities said they were now attempting to extradite eight of the suspects being held overseas. The indictment says,externalthat Infraud's administrators had aimed to run the ""premier online destination for the purchase and sale of stolen property"" and had used the slogan ""In Fraud We Trust"" to promote it. Its activities are alleged to have included: the sale and purchase of stolen dates of birth, addresses, passwords, social security numbers, payment card details and other personally identifying information the ability to advertise other sites that featured automated stores for stolen property the sharing and sale of malware the provision of forums and chat rooms to discuss illegal activities At one point in 2011, one of the accused is said to have indicated he had 795,000 UK logins to HSBC bank available for sale.

And one member is said to have offered to fraudulently book flights, rental cars and seats at US concerts and sporting events at a fraction of their actual price. Members are said to have given feedback ratings to each other to help maintain the quality of contraband sold via the service. Proceeds were said to have been laundered via digital currencies including Bitcoin andthe defunct service Liberty Reserve. In an effort to evade arrest, members are alleged to have avoided sharing their real identities with each other, and instead used nicknames including ""Mae Tony"", ""Poony"" and ""Hulk"".

Black cab rapist faces victim in court,"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi ""Black cab rapist"" John Worboys faced one of his victims in court as an appeal to challenge his release was granted. Worboys, who was jailed for drugging and sexually assaulting passengers, was due to be freed on licence. He appeared at the High Court earlier, where judges heard a judicial review application lodged by two of his victims, one of whom attended court. Worboys was told he would remain in jail until a full hearing on 13 March. He was summoned to appear in person at the Royal Courts of Justice by Sir Brian Leveson after the judge had a ""bad experience"" with a prison video link. Worboys' victims were unaware he would be present, but Sir Brian said it was important there was ""no interruption"" in proceedings. Launch of legal bid against Worboys' release Would London ban be enforceable? Victims told Worboys would serve life-sentence Solicitor Harriet Wistrich said one of the victims, who was in court throughout the hearing, found it ""very, very difficult"" that Worboys was also there. She added: ""She felt it was really necessary to be there and to say she wasn't going to be frightened of him being there, and to challenge his power. ""But obviously it is hard seeing him there in the flesh after all this time."" Ms Wistrich, who is representing both victims behind the judicial review action, said after the hearing: ""We are obviously very pleased that permission has been granted to proceed. ""We are looking forward to being able to understand and scrutinise all the material before the Parole Board, to consider how to bring forward a challenge."" Worboys, 60, was convicted of 19 offences including one count of rape, but is believed to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008. He was given an indefinite jail sentence in 2009, with a minimum term of eight years. This video can not be played 'Fiona', a victim of John Worboys, tells Today police told her in 2003 she wasn't 'believable' On 4 January the Parole Board announced its decision to release Worboyson licence, prompting anger among his victims and in Parliament. Victims' groups and representatives were outraged by news of Worboys' release, saying many victims were not informed before it was made public. However, the government said it would not challenge the Parole Board's decision. Justice Secretary David Gauke said at the time ""it would not be appropriate"" for the government to seek a judicial review, but added that his decision should not stop others from making their own legal challenge. ""Let me be absolutely clear, Worboys will not be released until his victims' representations have been properly considered and his licence conditions are in place."" The legal challenge was described in court as ""unique"" and ""unprecedented"", never before has someone other than a prisoner tried to overturn a Parole Board release decision. The hearing itself was also highly unusual, with John Worboys appearing in person, looking frail, thin and slightly hunched. It's the first time he's been seen in public since he was sentenced in 2009. During the proceedings Sir Brian Leveson spoke to Worboys - referring to him by his new name, Mr Radford - to seek his agreement on the disclosure of documents about his release. Halfway through, a solicitor, who had taken an interest in the case and was in court, agreed to represent the convicted sex offender, assuming he's granted legal aid. What wasn't a surprise about the case was the outcome - it will go to a full hearing next month when the decision to sanction Worboys' release can be scrutinised in detail. The case was brought forward by two of Worboys' victims and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. They are crowdfunding their action and have been pledged more than Â£62,000. Earlier in the hearing, Worboys agreed that the victims and Mr Khan should be allowed to see the Parole Board's reasons for ordering his release. Ben Collins, for the Parole Board, told the court: ""The board does not wish to take any step to prevent a review of the decision and does not propose to stand in the way."" Phillippa Kaufmann QC, representing two of Worboys' victims, said it appeared something had gone ""very wrong"" and the victims were ""concerned not only for themselves but for the wider public and women in particular"". The victims were also concerned that the decision was ""made entirely in secret,"" Ms Kaufmann said. Reacting to the ruling, mayor Sadiq Khan said Worboys' victims and Londoners would be ""relieved"". ""I'm pleased that there will now be an opportunity for thorough scrutiny of this decision by the Parole Board,"" he added.

Forecasts reveal Brexit impact by region,"Parts of the UK that backed a Leave vote would face the heaviest hit as a result of Brexit, according to estimates by government officials. The forecasts, seen by MPs, model the 15-year impact of the UK staying in the single market, doing a trade deal with the EU or leaving without a deal. They suggest that in England, the North East and West Midlands would see the biggest slowdown in growth. The government said the document did not represent its policy. It added that the forecasts did not ""consider the outcome we are seeking in the negotiations"". And one Eurosceptic Tory MP said the figures were ""complete nonsense"". Ministers meet for key Brexit talks EU 'seeks single market sanction power' Following a leak of some of the information to Buzzfeed last week, and political pressure to release it, ministers agreed to allow MPs to see the reports on a confidential basis in the House of Commons library. In each scenario in the forecasts, growth would be lower, by 2%, 5% and 8% respectively, than currently forecast over a 15-year period. In north-east England growth would be 3% lower if the UK stayed in the single market, 11% under a trade deal and 16% with no trade deal compared with staying in the EU, the forecast says. The research suggests London - which backed Remain - would fare the best, with reductions of 1%, 2% and 2.5% in each of the three scenarios. Scotland's estimated hit would be 2.5%, 6% and 9%. Wales would see reductions of 1.5%, 5.5% and 9.5%. Patrick Minford, of the Economists for Free Trade group, said: ""The continued leaks from Whitehall sources about the results of civil servants' latest modelling attempts is, sadly, a continuation of Project Fear's effort to paint Brexit as a damage limitation exercise."" The group has produced its own forecasts, based on ""proper, independent free trade policy,"" which predicts that UK economy would grow by 4% in the long term after Brexit. Brexit-backing Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused Treasury officials of ""fiddling the figures"" to make all options but staying in the EU look bad. Whitehall trade unions reacted angrily to this suggestion and government ministers have dismissed his allegation. The government has said the analysis is preliminary and crucially does not measure the impact of the UK's preferred option of a bespoke and comprehensive trade agreement, covering goods and financial services. A spokesman said: ""As ministers clearly set out in the House, this is provisional internal analysis, part of a broad ongoing programme of analysis, and further work is in progress. ""We are seeking an unprecedented, comprehensive and ambitious economic partnership - one that works for all parts of the UK. We are not expecting a no-deal scenario."" The research suggests that the option of staying in the single market and customs union, which has been rejected by ministers, would be the least damaging but would still see growth across different parts of the country between 1% and 3% lower than current forecasts. In the event of a limited free trade deal being negotiated, projected growth would be 8% lower in the West Midlands, north-west England and Northern Ireland, by 6% in Scotland and 5.5% in Wales. Should the UK leave the EU in March 2019 without any kind of deal, it suggests four parts of the UK would see a double digit slowdown in GDP growth. As well as north-east England, north-west England and Northern Ireland would see a 12% slowdown, while the West Midlands would see a 13% slowdown. Other official estimates suggest the UK car industry's GDP would shrink by 1% if the UK remained in the EU single market but would lose 8% if there was a free trade agreement and 8.5% if the UK left without a deal and went to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. The figures emerged as representatives of Nissan and other Japanese companies are set to meet Theresa May and Chancellor Philip Hammond on Thursday. Former attorney general and Conservative MP Dominic Grieve said the figures illustrated the risks of leaving the EU without a deal, which he said would hurt the ""poorest and vulnerable"" in society. Even if the UK achieved its stated objective of a deep and special partnership with the EU and trade deals with countries like the US, he said it was likely to yield, at best, a very small economic boost. But Eurosceptic Conservative MP John Redwood said the risks of a no-deal scenario had been overestimated and the Treasury figures were ""complete nonsense"".

Victims 'heard through media',"John Worboys was convicted of 19 offences in 2009 Victims of serial sex attacker John Worboys learned about his release from prison from the media, a review found. Many victims were ""shocked and distressed"" to seethe Parole Board's decisionin news headlines, Chief Inspector of Probation Dame Glenys Stacey's paper said. Her comments come as part of a review requested by the government into the ""victim contact scheme"". Two victims are set to begin a High Court battle against releasing Worboys. Dame Glenys's paper,externalsaid ""poor"" correspondence included letters with errors in the women's names and addresses. She said the National Probation Scheme (NPS) ""generally complied with the scheme provisions"", but that these mistakes suggested ""a lack of care or concern"". Worboys moved back to prison outside London Rapist release will not be challenged by government ""Those women not in contact with the scheme - the majority - learnt of the decision through the media. All who spoke to us described their shock and distress,"" she added. ""They had not felt prepared for this outcome."" Worboys, 60, was convicted of 19 offences in 2009. He drugged his female victims before attacking them in his black cab. This video can not be played Justice Secretary David Gauke says there will not be a judicial review Before Worboys's parole hearing, the NPS attempted to contact women who had not opted into the victim contact scheme. But there was not enough time before the hearing for them to receive or absorb the letters, the report said. ""What is more, the style and content of the letters lacked clarity and urgency,"" it added. ""One woman who had engaged with the scheme from the start did make a Victim Personal Statement to the Parole Board. ""Others who we interviewed were adamant that they would have wanted to do so, had they had the opportunity."" The VCS, run by the NPS, supports victims of violent or sexual crimes where the defendant is sentenced to at least a year in prison or has been detained under the Mental Health Act. After defendants are convicted, victims are asked if they want to opt into the scheme. If they do, they are given a Victim Liaison Officer (VLO) who keeps them informed about the offender. Updates might include a release date, licence conditions, or if the convict is moved to an open prison. Through the scheme victims are also able to make representations about an offender's release arrangements. Dame Glenys' report found liaison between the VLO and John Worboys' offender manager was ""poor"". Justice Secretary David Gauke said the report would help the government ""review parole transparency and victim contact"". He said he was reassured that correct procedures were followed but that ""we can do much better"". ""We have already changed the letters we send to victims to make them more compassionate, clearer and more informative, but there is more to do,"" he added.

May and ministers hammer out Brexit stance,"The PM is under pressure to spell out the details of the partnership she wants with the EU Theresa May has been chairing the first of two key Brexit meetings with senior ministers as the government faces more calls to clarify the UK's position. The Brexit cabinet committee is to sketch out what the future relationship between the UK and EU might look like. It was expected to focus on Northern Ireland and immigration. It comes as aleaked document suggests the EU wants to be able to restrict UK accessto the single market if there is a dispute after Brexit. According to a draft section of the UK and EU's withdrawal agreement, which has yet to be finalised, the power to suspend ""certain benefits"" would apply during a transition phase after the UK leaves in March 2019. The UK said the document simply reflected the EU's ""stated directives"". EU could use single market as sanction against UK A quick guide to the Brexit transition phase Barnier's trade warning for the UK How soon are answers needed? It comes as further details emerged of the Treasury's estimates of the impact on the economy of Brexit. According to the leaked estimates, the UK car industry's GDP would shrink by 1% if the UK remained in the EU single market but would lose 8% if there was a free trade agreement and 8.5% if the UK left without a deal and went to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. MPs have also been allowed to see the impact assessments for their own regions. All regions will see their economies shrink, with the North East of England, the West Midlands, and Northern Ireland being the worst affected, according to the analysis. The North-East would be hit hardest - with staying in the single market and customs union shaving 3% off GDP, an 11% reduction under a free trade deal and 16% under a no-deal WTO scenario, London would fare the best, with reductions of 1%, 2% and 3.5% in each of the three scenarios. Scotland's estimated hit would be 2.5%, 6% or 9%. Wales would see reductions of 1.5%, 5.5% or 9.5%. Brexit-backing Conservative MP Jacob-Rees Mogg has accused Treasury officials of ""fiddling the figures"" to make all options but staying in the EU look bad, after the documents werefirst leaked to Buzzfeed last week,external. The government said its preferred option - a bespoke deal covering trade and financial services - was not among those analysed in the leaked paper. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May restated the government's position that the UK would be leaving the single market and customs union and insisted she would be ""robust"" in getting the best deal. ""As I've said right from the very beginning, we will hear noises off, we will hear all sorts of things being said, of positions being taken,"" she said. ""What matters is the positions that we take in the negotiations, as we sit down and negotiate the best deal. We've shown we can do that, we did it in December and we're going to do it again."" The tensions within the Conservative Party were underlined on Monday when pro-EU former minister Anna Soubry told the BBC Mrs May should ""sling out"" arch Brexiteers, and threatened to quit the party. This video can not be played Business Secretary Greg Clark says the UK is looking for tariff-free trade Eurosceptics have been calling for a ""clean"" separation with the EU so the UK has the freedom to strike new trade deals, while pro-EU MPs say the UK should retain the closest possible access to the single market. Former Chancellor Ken Clarke said Theresa May had to see ""where the majority of opinion"" was within the cabinet, offer some concessions and those who could not live with the agreed stance would have to resign. He told BBC Radio 4's Today he wanted the UK to keep ""most of the features of the customs union and the single market"" after the transition period and suggested Parliament would back such a move. The key Brexit dates in 2018 Brexit: All you need to know What are the UK's Brexit trade options? But fellow Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said Mrs May had ""pushed back"" against that position, which he said was at odds with the government's stated position of achieving ""regulatory autonomy"". He told Today that ""no-one"" wanted a hard border on the island of Ireland or tariffs on trade between the UK and EU and it would be ""perverse"" if the EU ended up on insisting on them. The 11-member European Union Exit and Trade (Strategy and Negotiations) sub-committee is a key part of the government's decision-making process. Its members include Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who were at the forefront of the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, and Chancellor Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who campaigned for Remain. They are expected to discuss trade at another meeting on Thursday. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said this week there is ""not a moment to lose"" in finding a deal before the end of the year. Among those calling for more clarity on the UK's position is the British Chambers of Commerce, which has written to Mrs May asking for a ""clear, unequivocal statement of intent"". ""The perception amongst businesses on the ground, large and small alike, is one of continued division,"" it said. ""Even amongst the many optimistic, future-oriented firms - those who see opportunity in change - patience is wearing thin. Directly affected companies are poised to activate contingency plans. Many others, worryingly, have simply disengaged."" In response, Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK's aims were very clear, namely tariff-free trade with the EU with a ""minimum of frictions"" in the years ahead. Meanwhile, former transport minister Stephen Hammond has urged the UK to consider rejoining the European Free Trade Association, which it left in 1972 prior to joining the then European Economic Community. Speaking in a debate in Parliament, he said membership of the free trade body - whose members are Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland - was a ""sensible option"" which would give the UK the economic certainty and flexibility it wanted - although such an outcome has been rejected by ministers.

Rapist's jail move bid was refused,"Rapist John Worboys was denied a move to a lower security open prison before he was granted parole, it has emerged. The Parole Board denied his request in 2015 to be moved from high-security Wakefield Prison, after reading files and reports about him. The ex-London black-cab driver was granted release in November last year, but ministers are considering a judicial review of the decision. Worboys, 60, was convicted in 2009 of 19 offences against 12 women. He was given an indeterminate sentence andordered to serve at least eight years in jail,external. Why was Worboys released now? Cabbie who preyed on young women The Parole Board has now confirmed that he requested to be moved to an open prison, also known as a Category D jail, where prisoners are allowed to spend part of their day studying or visiting relatives to prepare for release. This request was turned down in 2015, but three Parole Board members concluded it was safe for him to be released in 2017. Parole Board Chairman Nick Hardwick said there should be an independent investigation into claims that Worboys' victims were not consulted about his release, which was reported by the media in January. He added: ""The anguish of his victims should be heard."" It has also emerged that the panel which granted Worboys' release heard from Dr Jackie Craissati, a clinical and forensic psychologist who has worked with a number of high-risk offenders. She was instructed by lawyers for Worboys and was among four psychologists who gave evidence. Two probation officers and three members of prison staff also appeared at the hearing. If the release goes ahead, it means Worboys, who changed his name by deed poll some time ago to John Radford, will be let out directly from the high-security Category A Wakefield Prison, in West Yorkshire. Altogether, he has spent 10 years in custody including a period on remand. It has also been confirmed that Worboys had been challenging his convictions as recently as 2015. He had applied to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in April 2013 claiming he had been been wrongfully convicted. The CCRC began assessing his application until Worboys withdrew it in May 2015, four months before his request for a transfer to an open prison was dealt with. Justice Secretary David Gauke has asked for legal adviceon whether November's decision to free Worboys can be contested in a judicial review. If a judge finds the Parole Board did not follow the correct process or reached its decision on the wrong basis, the move would be quashed and Worboys would have to make a fresh application for parole. The Parole Board has said ""correct procedures were followed"" in the case and are ""confident"" he would not reoffend. Mr Hardwick added that the board's decision ""should be open to legal challenge"" but warned against ""political interference"". In astatement,external, he said: ""It would be a bad day for us all if people's rightful abhorrence of Worboys' crimes or concern about a Parole Board decision allowed these basic principles of justice to be overturned.""

Worboys release held over legal bid,"John Worboys gave his victims drug-laced champagne before he attacked them The release of black cab rapist John Worboys from prison has been put on temporary hold following a legal challenge by two of his victims. Lawyers representing the women were granted a stay on his release after making an urgent application to the High Court on Thursday. The Parole Board provoked anger this month after announcing Worboys would be released from jail. Worboys, 60, was jailed for a minimum term of eight years in 2009. He was convicted of 19 offences and given an indeterminate sentence for public protection, although police believe he may have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults. Reality Check: Could Worboys be banned from London? The cabbie who preyed on young women Rapist's victims 'told he would serve life' Lawyer Harriet Wistrich said the stay on his release had been granted ""until an oral application between 6-8 February"". She said it was ""obviously good that we have got through the first hurdle"" but added that Worboys could ""potentially"" have a claim for damages if the victims fail in their legal battle. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said the Justice Secretary David Gauke had supported the request for a stay on Worboys' release while the judicial review is heard. He said: ""It is right that victims can be reassured that Worboys will not be released until the court has had a chance to consider their views."" This video can not be played ""Fiona"" - not her real name- told BBC Newsnightâs Kirsty Wark she believed John Worboys would re-offend The Parole Board approved his release with ""stringent"" licence conditions, with chairman Nick Hardwick saying the board was ""confident"" Worboys would not reoffend. The government previously announced it would not challenge the Parole Board's decision. However, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan haslodged an application for a judicial review into the plan to release him. Worboys told his victims he had won the lottery and invited them to celebrate with him At his trial, jurors heard Worboys picked up his victims in London's West End and gave them champagne laced with sedatives, claiming he had won the lottery or had won money at casinos.

Failed NHS trust caused 'unnecessary harm',"Huge cuts to district nursing were made with little thought to clinical consequences, says the report Patients at a failed NHS trust suffered ""unnecessary harm"" because a senior leadership team was ""out of its depth"", says a report seen by BBC News. Misguided cost-cutting at Liverpool Community Health (LCH) led to severe staff shortages and bullying, it found. Despite the problems, BBC News has also seen evidence that regulators helped the trust's chief executive find another six-figure NHS job. LCH apologised to patients, families and staff who had suffered as a result. The trust provided services such as district nursing, dentistry and diabetes care to about 750,000 people in Merseyside. A report in 2016 previously found that an excessive focus on becoming a foundation trust,,externalallowing greater freedom from regulators, had led to extreme cost-cutting and staff being bullied to meet targets. This latest review, carried out by Dr Bill Kirkup, who alsoinvestigated the Morecambe Bay scandal at Furness General Hospital, focused on the trust's clinical failures. He describes Liverpool Community Health, established in 2010, as being ""dysfunctional from the outset"". Its leadership team, led by chief executive Bernie Cuthel and chaired by Frances Molloy, was inexperienced, he found. Nonetheless, the trust set out to achieve foundation status, setting ""infeasible financial targets that damaged patient services"". The plans included: losing almost 50 district nursing posts cutting dentistry budgets by 44% an overall savings target of 15% in a year In one year, the district nursing budget was underspent by Â£2.9m, leading to an increase in the most serious types of pressure ulcers, the wrong teeth being removed and patients suffering fractured hips, the report found. The authors could not quantify the exact number of patients who suffered unnecessary harm due to the ""poor standard of incident reporting and investigations"". They found staff were constantly bullied, with a ""punitive and blame culture"" derived from an ""excessively top down"" structure. Some were suspended without any reason being given, their careers left in limbo, because of a ""chaotic"" human resources department that ""was not fit for purpose"". In 2014, following concerns raised by Labour MP Rosie Cooper, a Care Quality Commission report found significant problems at the trust. These findings prompted the resignation of top executives, and new management brought in significant improvements and dozens of new staff.  The trust is now in the process of being wound up, with most services passing to another NHS trust, MerseyCare, in April. Emails seen by BBC News show that an NHS regulator, the Trust Delivery Authority, arranged for chief executive Bernie Cuthel to leave Liverpool Community Health by finding her a position at Manchester Mental Health and Social Care Trust on a 12-month secondment. Ms Cuthel's initial three-month salary would be paid by LCH, in lieu of notice - but the TDA said it would finance the remaining nine months of the secondment. The emails indicate, however, that it never paid. Her salary at Liverpool, between Â£130,000 and Â£135,000 according to published accounts, was reduced by 10% in Manchester as she was no longer in an executive position. The TDA also provided her with coaching support. The emails say the TDA's thinking was that ""the secondment would provide Ms Cuthel with a period of rehabilitation, enabling her to reflect on learning from her experiences in Liverpool"". Bernie Cuthel is now on the governing body of a Liverpool-based charity After her post in Manchester, the former chief executive moved to work at ahealth board in North Walesand is now on the governing body of Nugent, a charity in Liverpool that offers a range of services to children and adults. The former chair of the trust stepped down in 2015 after five years at the helm.  She is now styled as the ""inspirational and influential"" chief executive of Health at Work, a Liverpool-based charity that has contracts with the NHS. The former HR director, who oversaw a ""chaotic"", ""unfit for purpose"" department left the trust in 2014.  She now works as an HR consultant, described on the company's website as being passionate about transforming culture and ""supporting organisations through their most testing times"". The former director of operations and executive nurse at the trust was suspended by the Nursing and Midwifery Council in April 2106.  She remains suspended. In his review, Dr Kirkup says the biggest clinical failures were arguably at Liverpool prison, where LCH provided healthcare services. The trust had ""no understanding of its requirements or how to manage it in a safe and effective manner"". Senior managers did not even have passes to visit the jail, the authors found. Healthcare staff atthe jail, recently described as the worst prison in England, faced significant problems including a lack of risk assessments of offenders, poor mental health services and the use of equipment that was not fit for purpose. ""Due to the organisational culture in HMP Liverpool,"" says the review, ""unsafe practice had become accepted as normal."" So poor were their systems that an internal review conducted in late 2014, and seen by the BBC, resulted in eight deaths in custody having to be retrospectively reported, bringing the total over four years to 21. In a statement, Johanna Reilly, the trust's chief operating officer, apologised on behalf of the trust for the ""failings of the past"". ""I am extremely sorry that patients, families and members of staff suffered as a result,"" she added. She said significant progress has already been made and processes and clinical and HR practices would continue to be monitored to help ensure the ""highest standards of care going forward"". The trust fully accepted the review's findings and recommendations and was aware its publication might upset patients and their families, she added. A dedicated telephone helpline has been set up on0151 295 3087. A spokeswoman for NHS Improvement, which now incorporates the TDA said the regulator's view ""at the time of these events was that individuals should have the opportunity to learn lessons from their experiences and to pass these lessons on to the NHS to help improve patient care"". ""In this case, this was supported by a temporary arrangement.""

"Bus firm first to be fined over pensionsStotts Tours and Alan Stott will pay more than Â£60,000 after failing to enrol staff in a scheme.9m9 minutes agoManchester","Stotts Tours did not set up pensions for staff A bus company has become the first UK firm to be sentenced for failing to enrol staff on a pension scheme. Stotts Tours of Oldham, Greater Manchester, should have begun pension contributions for staff from 2015, The Pensions Regulator (TPR) said. The firm and its managing director Alan Stott previously admitted wilful failure to comply with pensions law. They were ordered to pay more than Â£39,000 at Brighton Magistrates' Court. District Judge Teresa Szagun said: ""Initially Mr Stott's attitude was to bury his head in the sand. This later left him in a position where he was out of his depth."" The fines and court costs come on top of Â£14,400 in civil fines already owed for failing to comply with the law on automatic pension enrolment. Stotts Tours must also pay an estimated Â£10,000 in backdated pension contributions for its staff, as well as ongoing contributions. Magistrates fined the company Â£27,000 and ordered it to pay Â£7,400 in costs and a Â£120 victim surcharge on Wednesday. Stott, 69, was ordered to pay a Â£4,455 fine and a Â£120 victim surcharge. According to the Pensions Act 2008,,externalevery employer in the UK, where appropriate, must contribute towards a pension scheme for their staff in a process known as automatic enrolment. Auto-enrolment has been phased inby the government since 2012, so that workers can save to top-up their state pension on retirement. Unless they are already signed up to a workplace pension, a slice of a worker's pay packet is automatically diverted to a pension savings pot, which is invested until retirement Their employer also makes a contribution, as does the government Individuals have the option to opt out if they wish, although that will mean losing the employer's contribution Anyone on a short-term contract, working where an agency pays their wages, or who is on maternity, adoption or carer's leave should still be eligible The total minimum contribution is currently set at 2% of earnings (0.8% from the worker, 1% from an employer, and 0.2% as tax relief from the government) From April 2018, it will increase to 5% of earnings (2.4% from the worker, 2% from the employer, and 0.6% as tax relief) From April 2019 onwards, it will rise to 8% of earnings (4% from the individual, 3% from the employer, and 1% as tax relief) In the first prosecution of its kind, TPR found 36 staff from Stotts Tours should have been put on a pension scheme from June 2015. TPR director Darren Ryder said ""automatic enrolment is not an option, it is the law"". He said: ""It's extremely disappointing that a tiny minority of employers continue to flout the law by denying their staff the pensions they are entitled to.""

Bulger killer jailed for indecent images,"Jon Venables was 10 when he and Robert Thompson killed James Bulger Jon Venables, one of the killers of toddler James Bulger, has been jailed for possessing child abuse images for the second time. He admitted charges of making indecent images of children and one of having a ""sickening"" paedophile manual. Sentencing him to three years and four months Mr Justice Edis said Venables was ""manipulative and dishonest"". James's mother faced a ""horrendous ordeal"" hearing the killer's ""vile behaviour"" in court, a spokesman said. Denise Fergus and James's father Ralph Bulger were at the Old Bailey to hear the latest guilty pleas. This video can not be played Ralph Bulger says the sentence given to Jon Venables is an insult Following the hearing, campaigners condemned Venables' sentence as ""too short"". Chris Johnson, of the Justice for James Campaign, said: ""Sitting through this hearing this morning was a horrendous ordeal for Denise, having to listen to the vile and repulsive behaviour that Venables has engaged in yet again. ""The length of the sentence is too short. Three years is really a farce because this is re-offending and there is a pattern to this behaviour. ""There should be no further collusion or attempts to cover up his offending behaviour. If re-bailed he must be kept on a very tight leash."" James Bulger was two when he was abducted and killed in 1993 In 2010, Venables had been jailed for two years after admitting downloading and distributing indecent images. Along with Robert Thompson, he abducted, tortured and killed two-year-old James in Liverpool in 1993 when they were both aged 10. They were released on licence in 2001 after serving eight years for the murder and were both given new identities. Venables, who has lifelong anonymity, appeared by videolink at the Old Bailey earlier. He admitted having 392 category A images - deemed the most severe - 148 category B and 630 category C pictures. The court heard when Venables' computer was seized in November images were found of children, mainly aged between six and 13, although some were younger. Mr Justice Edis said some of the images found were of babies. ""Given your history, it is significant that a number of the images and films were of serious crimes inflicted on male toddlers,"" he said. Officers also found a ""paedophile manual"", described by prosecutor Louis Mably as a ""disgusting and sickening document which falls far below any recognisable standard of morality"". James Bulger's mother Denise Fergus faced a ""horrendous ordeal"" hearing the killer's ""vile behaviour"" in court, a spokesman said Mr Justice Edis said possessing the manual suggested Venables was ""at least contemplating the possibility"" of committing an actual sexual crime against children. Along with the jail sentence, the judge made Venables the subject of an indefinite sexual harm prevention order and ordered his laptop be confiscated. He said the Parole Board would decide when Venables would be released. The judge said he had received a request to delay sentencing so Mr Bulger could make a victim impact statement. But, in deciding to sentence straight away, Mr Justice Edis said: ""I know already how it must be for them when that tragic event is once more brought into the public domain into court and so on because of the offending of one of the killers."" ""I do not think there is very much more that can be said to me that I do not already know that could have an effect on the sentencing process,"" he said. Jon Venables, who has lifelong anonymity, appeared by videolink at the Old Bailey A report found Venables was a ""high risk of real harm to children"" in the future, the court was told. It states that he has a ""long-term and profound interest in children"". The court also heard that as he was being taken to a police station, Venables admitted he had ""let people down"". He said: ""This is my own fault. I have let people down again.""

Rees-Mogg says heckling good for politicians,"Jacob Rees-Mogg said masks were sinister, but protests were part of political life Jacob Rees-Mogg said that heckling can be good for politicians making a speech, in evidence to a parliamentary inquiry into free speech in universities. The Conservative MP faced protests last week when he spoke at the University of the West of England. But he said that the wearing of masks by demonstrators was more ""sinister"". Sam Gyimah, the Universities Minister, earlier warned of a ""creeping culture of censorship"" on university campuses. Mr Rees-Mogg told the Human Rights Committee that ""people shouting and heckling"" is part of political life. ""To be perfectly honest, as a politician a bit of heckling can make your speech. It can actually be very good for the speaker rather than damaging."" He said that protestors at the event in Bristol were trying to stop him speak, but there was no threat of violence until there were claims that one of the demonstrators had been hit. Apart from the masks, he said the protest was ""perfectly legitimate"" and only a little ""pushy"". Jacob Rees-Mogg faced protests at the University of the West of England ""As a politician you should expect that people may come and heckle and that not everybody is going to want to sit there quietly and listen to my view of the world,"" said Mr Rees-Mogg. ""As MPs, we can hardly complain considering the noise we make in the chamber of the House of Commons."" The committee is investigating claims that free speech is being inhibited in universities - and Mr Rees-Mogg told them the protest he faced was much less worrying than the ""online abuse"" faced by some female MPs. Sam Gyimah said students should not be ""mollycoddled"" away from difficult subjects The Conservative MP said he feared ""self-censorship"" from universities, who might not want the ""hassle"" and expense of inviting speakers who might be controversial. Mr Gyimah, the universities minister, had told the Human Rights Committee that a culture of intolerance was spilling over from social media. ""There is a section within our universities that think you can restrict free speech. ""If what you're doing is essentially mollycoddling someone from opinions and views that they might find offensive, then that is wrong."" But Harriet Harman, who chairs the committee, questioned whether there was evidence of free speech being eroded. Concerns about threats to free speech in university had been widely publicised, but that was not the same as providing evidence, she said. Harriet Harman asked for evidence to back claims of free speech being limited at university Mr Gyimah said he thought there was a growing problem in universities of groups trying to stop others from expressing ideas - although specific evidence could be ""difficult to gather"". He said there had been protests over speakers on topics such as Israel and issues of religion, sexuality or political belief. There have also been concerns over ""no-platforming"", where people are prevented from speaking - but members of the committee pressed Mr Gyimah over whether there was any proof of this being a widespread problem in universities. The committee is also considering whether the Prevent counter-extremism strategy stops students from discussing some controversial subjects. Ben Wallace, Security Minister, said there was ""no real evidence of free speech being curtailed by Prevent"". Ben Wallace, Security Minister, said it was a myth that Prevent was curtailing free speech ""We have struggled to find evidence of actual events that have been cancelled."" But Mr Wallace said: ""Freedom of speech is not absolute."" For example, it was not lawful to incite racial hatred. He said that Prevent was a response to an authentic problem, of people being radicalised on campus. Radical Islamists were still recruiting in ""educational settings"" and 23,000 people in the UK were currently considered security concerns with an ""extremist mindset"", he told the committee. But MPs and peers on the committee questioned whether there was enough guidance to make a clear distinction between legitimate, strong views and unlawful violent extremism. They raised concerns that even if events had not been cancelled, there could have been events that were never even proposed, because of fears over being referred to Prevent. In December, the previous Universities Minister, Jo Johnson, warned that universities thatfailed to uphold free speech could face finesfrom the new regulator, the Office for Students. Earlier this week, the Prime Minister, Theresa May, said: ""In our universities, which should be bastions of free thought and expression, we've seen the efforts of politicians and academics to engage in open debate frustrated by an aggressive and intolerant minority. ""It's time we asked ourselves seriously whether we really want it to be like this.""

Negative Brexit forecasts revealed,"Parts of the UK that backed a Leave vote would face the heaviest hit as a result of Brexit, according to estimates by government officials. The forecasts, seen by MPs, model the 15-year impact of the UK staying in the single market, doing a trade deal with the EU or leaving without a deal. They suggest that in England, the North East and West Midlands would see the biggest slowdown in growth. The government said the document did not represent its policy. It added that the forecasts did not ""consider the outcome we are seeking in the negotiations"". And one Eurosceptic Tory MP said the figures were ""complete nonsense"". Ministers meet for key Brexit talks EU 'seeks single market sanction power' Following a leak of some of the information to Buzzfeed last week, and political pressure to release it, ministers agreed to allow MPs to see the reports on a confidential basis in the House of Commons library. In each scenario in the forecasts, growth would be lower, by 2%, 5% and 8% respectively, than currently forecast over a 15-year period. In north-east England growth would be 3% lower if the UK stayed in the single market, 11% under a trade deal and 16% with no trade deal compared with staying in the EU, the forecast says. The research suggests London - which backed Remain - would fare the best, with reductions of 1%, 2% and 2.5% in each of the three scenarios. Scotland's estimated hit would be 2.5%, 6% and 9%. Wales would see reductions of 1.5%, 5.5% and 9.5%. Patrick Minford, of the Economists for Free Trade group, said: ""The continued leaks from Whitehall sources about the results of civil servants' latest modelling attempts is, sadly, a continuation of Project Fear's effort to paint Brexit as a damage limitation exercise."" The group has produced its own forecasts, based on ""proper, independent free trade policy,"" which predicts that UK economy would grow by 4% in the long term after Brexit. Brexit-backing Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg has accused Treasury officials of ""fiddling the figures"" to make all options but staying in the EU look bad. Whitehall trade unions reacted angrily to this suggestion and government ministers have dismissed his allegation. The government has said the analysis is preliminary and crucially does not measure the impact of the UK's preferred option of a bespoke and comprehensive trade agreement, covering goods and financial services. A spokesman said: ""As ministers clearly set out in the House, this is provisional internal analysis, part of a broad ongoing programme of analysis, and further work is in progress. ""We are seeking an unprecedented, comprehensive and ambitious economic partnership - one that works for all parts of the UK. We are not expecting a no-deal scenario."" The research suggests that the option of staying in the single market and customs union, which has been rejected by ministers, would be the least damaging but would still see growth across different parts of the country between 1% and 3% lower than current forecasts. In the event of a limited free trade deal being negotiated, projected growth would be 8% lower in the West Midlands, north-west England and Northern Ireland, by 6% in Scotland and 5.5% in Wales. Should the UK leave the EU in March 2019 without any kind of deal, it suggests four parts of the UK would see a double digit slowdown in GDP growth. As well as north-east England, north-west England and Northern Ireland would see a 12% slowdown, while the West Midlands would see a 13% slowdown. Other official estimates suggest the UK car industry's GDP would shrink by 1% if the UK remained in the EU single market but would lose 8% if there was a free trade agreement and 8.5% if the UK left without a deal and went to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. The figures emerged as representatives of Nissan and other Japanese companies are set to meet Theresa May and Chancellor Philip Hammond on Thursday. Former attorney general and Conservative MP Dominic Grieve said the figures illustrated the risks of leaving the EU without a deal, which he said would hurt the ""poorest and vulnerable"" in society. Even if the UK achieved its stated objective of a deep and special partnership with the EU and trade deals with countries like the US, he said it was likely to yield, at best, a very small economic boost. But Eurosceptic Conservative MP John Redwood said the risks of a no-deal scenario had been overestimated and the Treasury figures were ""complete nonsense"".

Food may influence cancer spread,"There is mounting evidence the food on your plate can alter cancer's growth and spread, say Cambridge scientists. Animal research,published in the journal Nature,,externalshowed breast tumours struggled without the dietary nutrient asparagine. It is found in the foodies' favourite asparagus, as well as poultry, seafood and many other foods. In the future, scientists hope to take advantage of cancer's ""culinary addictions"" to improve treatment. Asparagine is an amino acid - a building block of protein - andtakes its name,externalfrom asparagus. The study, conducted at the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, took place on mice with an aggressive form of breast cancer. Normally they would die in a couple of weeks as the tumour spread throughout the body. But when the mice were given a low-asparagine diet or drugs to block asparagine then the tumour struggled to spread. ""It was a really huge change, [the cancers] were very difficult to find,"" said Prof Greg Hannon. Last year, the University of Glasgow showed cutting out the amino acids serine and glycineslowed the development,externalof lymphoma and intestinal cancers. Prof Hannon told the BBC: ""We're seeing increasing evidence that specific cancers are addicted to specific components of our diet. ""In the future, by modifying a patient's diet or by using drugs that change the way that tumour cells can access these nutrients we hope to improve outcomes in therapy."" Fruit and veg: For a longer life eat 10-a-day Controlled amino acid diet 'could help cancer treatment' An initial tumour is rarely deadly. It is when the cancer spreads throughout the body - or metastasises - that it can become fatal. A cancerous cell must go through huge changes in order to spread - it must learn to break off the main tumour, survive in the bloodstream and thrive elsewhere in the body. It is this process for which researchers think asparagine is necessary. But fear not asparagus lovers, these findings still need to be confirmed in people and asparagine is hard to avoid in the diet anyway. In the long run, scientists think patients would be put on special drinks that are nutritionally balanced, but lack asparagine. Prof Charles Swanton, Cancer Research UK's chief clinician, said: ""Interestingly, the drug L-asparaginase is used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, which is dependent on asparagine. ""It's possible that in future, this drug could be repurposed to help treat breast cancer patients."" Further trials are still necessary. Baroness Delyth Morgan, the chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, said patients should not go on drastic diets on the back of this study. She said: ""We don't recommend patients totally exclude any specific food group from their diet without speaking to their doctors. ""We'd also encourage all patients to follow a healthy and varied diet.""

Early Briton had dark skin and blue eyes,"This video can not be played DNA shows early Brit had dark skin A cutting-edge scientific analysis shows that a Briton from 10,000 years ago had dark brown skin and blue eyes. Researchers from London's Natural History Museum extracted DNA from Cheddar Man, Britain's oldest complete skeleton, which was discovered in 1903. A University College London team analysed the genome, and the results were used for a facial reconstruction. It underlines the fact that the lighter skin characteristic of modern Europeans is a relatively recent phenomenon. No prehistoric Briton of this age had previously had their genome analysed. As such, the analysis provides valuable new insights into the first people to resettle Britain after the last Ice Age. The analysis of Cheddar Man's genome  - the ""blueprint"" for a human, contained in the nuclei of our cells - will be published in a journal, and will also  feature in the upcoming Channel 4 documentary The First Brit, Secrets Of The 10,000-year-old Man. 'Cheddar George' tweet on early Briton Cheddar Man's remains had been unearthed 115 years ago in Gough's Cave, located in Somerset's Cheddar Gorge. Subsequent examination has shown that the man was short by today's standards - about 5ft 5in - and probably died in his early 20s. Prof Chris Stringer, the museum's research leader in human origins, said: ""I've been studying the skeleton of Cheddar Man for about 40 years ""So to come face-to-face with what this guy could have looked like - and that striking combination of the hair, the face, the eye colour and that dark skin: something a few years ago we couldn't have imagined and yet that's what the scientific data show."" A replica of Cheddar Man's skeleton now lies in Gough's Cave Fractures on the surface of the skull suggest he may even have met his demise in a violent manner. It's not known how he came to lie in the cave, but it's possible he was placed there by others in his tribe. The Natural History Museum researchers extracted the DNA from part of the skull near the ear known as the petrous. At first, project scientists Prof Ian Barnes and Dr Selina Brace weren't sure if they'd get any DNA at all from the remains. But they were in luck: not only was DNA preserved, but Cheddar Man has since yielded the highest coverage (a measure of the sequencing accuracy) for a genome from this period of European prehistory - known as the Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age. They teamed up with researchers at University College London (UCL) to analyse the results, including gene variants associated with hair, eye and skin colour. They found the Stone Age Briton had dark hair - with a small probability that it was curlier than average - blue eyes and skin that was probably dark brown or black in tone. This combination might appear striking to us today, but it was a common appearance in western Europe during this period. Steven Clarke, director of the Channel Four documentary, said: ""I think we all know we live in times where we are unusually preoccupied with skin pigmentation."" Prof Mark Thomas, a geneticist from UCL, said: ""It becomes a part of our understanding, I think that would be a much, much better thing. I think it would be good if people lodge it in their heads, and it becomes a little part of their knowledge."" Unsurprisingly, the findings have generated lots of interest on social media.

Cheddar Man's genome reveals he was closely related to other Mesolithic individuals - so-called Western Hunter-Gatherers - who have been analysed from Spain, Luxembourg and Hungary. Dutch artists Alfons and Adrie Kennis, specialists in palaeontological model-making, took the genetic findings and combined them with physical measurements from scans of the skull. The result was a strikingly lifelike reconstruction of a face from our distant past. Pale skin probably arrived in Britain with a migration of people from the Middle East around 6,000 years ago. This population had pale skin and brown eyes and absorbed populations like the ones Cheddar Man belonged to. Prof Chris Stringer had studied Cheddar Man for 40 years - but was struck by the Kennis brothers' reconstruction No-one's entirely sure why pale skin evolved in these farmers, but their cereal-based diet was probably deficient in Vitamin D. This would have required agriculturalists to synthesise this essential nutrient in their skin using sunlight. ""There may be other factors that are causing lower skin pigmentation over time in the last 10,000 years. But that's the big explanation that most scientists turn to,"" said Prof Thomas. The genomic results also suggest Cheddar Man could not drink milk as an adult. This ability only spread much later, after the onset of the Bronze Age. Present-day Europeans owe on average 10% of their ancestry to Mesolithic hunters like Cheddar Man. Britain has been something of a boom-and-bust story for humans over the last million-or-so years. Modern humans were here as early as 40,000 years ago, but a period of extreme cold known as the Last Glacial Maximum drove them out some 10,000 years later. Elon Musk's Falcon rocket soars into space Food may influence cancer spread Graduate loses bid to sue Oxford over 2:1 degree There's evidence from Gough's Cave that hunter-gatherers ventured back around 15,000 years ago, establishing a temporary presence when the climate briefly improved. However, they were soon sent packing by another cold snap. Cut marks on the bones suggest these people cannibalised their dead - perhaps as part of ritual practices. The actual skull of Cheddar Man is kept in the Natural History Museum, seen being handled here by Ian Barnes Britain was once again settled 11,000 years ago; and has been inhabited ever since. Cheddar Man was part of this wave of migrants, who walked across a landmass called Doggerland that, in those days, connected Britain to mainland Europe. This makes him the oldest known Briton with a direct connection to people living here today. This is not the first attempt to analyse DNA from the Cheddar Man. In the late 1990s, Oxford University geneticist Brian Sykes sequenced mitochondrial DNA from one of Cheddar Man's molars. Mitochondrial DNA comes from the biological ""batteries"" within our cells and is passed down exclusively from a mother to her children. Prof Sykes compared the ancient genetic information with DNA from 20 living residents of Cheddar village and found two matches - including history teacher Adrian Targett, who became closely connected with the discovery. The result is consistent with the approximately 10% of Europeans who share the same mitochondrial DNA type.

Graduate loses bid to sue Oxford over 2:1,"Faiz Siddiqui sued Oxford University for Â£1m in damages A graduate who sued Oxford University over his failure to get a top degree has had his claim dismissed by the High Court. Faiz Siddiqui claimed ""inadequate teaching"" contributed to his low mark in a final year history paper in 2000. He alleged it cost him entry to a top US law college and sought Â£1m from the university. But in his ruling, Mr Justice Foskett said he was not convinced teaching was ""negligently inadequate"". Oxford University accepted there were fewer teaching staff available in the Michaelmas (Autumn) Term in 1999 due to staff being granted leave of absence. But it denied teaching was ""inadequate"" and Mr Justice Foskett was not persuaded otherwise. Faiz Siddiqui studied modern history at the University of Oxford and sat his final exams in 2000 Mr Siddiqui, who studied at Brasenose College, said his 2:1 degree result meant he had not had a successful career in law and it caused him to suffer from depression. Although the judge accepted the claimant had suffered severe depression, he felt this could not be attributed to his degree result. He also found there were other reasons beyond his bouts of depression to explain his failures to hold down the various jobs he had. Norovirus hits Winter Olympics security staff Freemasons: We are discriminated against Trudeau faces PC 'peoplekind' backlash Mr Siddiqui had also argued he was suffering from ""insomnia, depression and anxiety"" at the time of his finals and said his personal tutor did not alert examination authorities. But Mr Justice Foskett's ruling said there was nothing in the email exchanges between them or medical records to suggest he was depressed or suffering from insomnia at the time of the exams. In his conclusion, the judge said Mr Siddiqui deserved ""sympathy and understanding"" but the claim ""must be dismissed"". He said the claimant ""undoubtedly"" felt he had not achieved the standards he set himself and hoped he could ""re-focus"" and start using his ""undoubted intelligence"" to create a worthwhile future.

Deepfake porn videos banned by Twitter,"Star Wars actress Daisy Ridley has had a computer-generated version of her face featured in a deepfake clip, as seen in this screenshot Twitter is the latest platform to ban a new type of pornographic video that replaces the original actor's face with that of another person. The clips, known as deepfakes, typically use the features of female TV personalities, actors and pop singers. Unlike some social networks, Twitterallows hardcore pornography,externalon its platform. But it said deepfakes broke its rules against intimate images that featured a subject without their consent. The San Francisco-based company acted six hours after a Twitter account dedicated to publishing deepfake clips was publicised on a Reddit forum. News site Motherboard was first to report the development. ""We will suspend any account we identify as the original poster of intimate media that has been produced or distributed without the subject's consent,"" Twitter told Motherboard. It added that ""deepfakes fall solidly"" within the type of clips bannedby its intimate media policy,external. The development followed an announcement by Pornhub that it too would remove deepfake clips brought to its attention. Until now, the adult site had been a popular source for the material, with some deepfake videos attracting tens of thousands of views. Fake porn has serious consequences Deepfake videos deleted from net Fake Obama created using AI tool Video-hosting service Gfycat and chat service Discord had already taken similar action. Deepfakes involve the use of artificial intelligence software to create a computer-generated version of a subject's face that closely matches the original expressions of another person in a video. FakeApp made it easier for users to make use of the face-swapping algorithm To do this, the algorithm involved requires a selection of photos of the subject's face taken from different angles. In cases where the two people involved have similar body types, the results can be quite convincing. The practice began last year, but became more common in January following the release of FakeApp - a tool that automates the process. It requires only a single button click once the source material has been provided. One Reddit group dedicated to sharing clips and comments about the process now has more than 91,000 subscribers. Not all of the clips generated have been pornographic in nature - many feature spoofs of US President Donald Trump, and one user has specialised in placing his wife's face in Hollywood film scenes.

But most of the material generated to date appears to be explicit. While the vast majority of these feature mainstream celebrities, some users have begun generating clips using the faces of YouTube personalities in recent days, a move that has proved controversial with others. In addition, there has been a backlash following reports that some people had created illegal child abuse imagery by using photos of under-16s. ""I saw one... of some little girl from a TV show and told the original poster to take it down,"" reported one Reddit member. Users are also being warned not to try to buy or sell specially commissioned deepfake videos among themselves. The actress Emma Watson features in several deepfake video clips Motherboard revealed one advert for such a service earlier this week, noting that any commercial activity could put those involved at risk of being prosecuted. Some of the clips being created already rival the quality of face-swapping special effects used in films, including Rogue One and Blade Runner 2049. And efforts are being made to make further improvements. A page on the Github code-sharing site reveals that work is being done to make eyeball movements ""more realistic and consistent"" with those of the person featured in the original footage. Work is being done to create more refined ""masks"" used to create the computer-generated faces In addition, attempts are being made to: avoid a jittering effect in some clips prevent graphical artefacts appearing where the computer-generated face merges with the original body produce more natural skin tones Some users have also begun exploring the use of Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud Platform as an alternative to trying to generate the clips on their own computers. Such a move has the potential to make it possible to generate longer videos without having to wait days, but would involve having to pay the services a fee for their processing efforts.

Man accused of fighting IS to be charged,"Jim Matthews appeared in a Channel 4 documentary in 2015 A British man who fought against so-called Islamic State is to be charged with a terror offence. Ex-soldier Jim Matthews, 43, of London, travelled to Syria and fought with the Kurdish forces, the YPG. Mr Matthews will appear at Westminster Magistrates Court on 14 February to be charged with one count of attending a place used for terrorist training. He appeared in a Channel 4 documentary - The Brits battling Isis - about his fight against the jihadist group. In a statement, the Metropolitan Police said Mr Matthews was alleged to have attended ""a place or places in Iraq and Syria where instruction or training was provided for purposes connected to the commission or preparation of terrorism on or before 15 February 2016"". The offence comes under section 8 of the Terrorism Act 2006. By BBC News correspondent Emma Vardy This is believed to be the first charge of its kind in the UK. It is estimated that since 2015 dozens of Britons have fought as volunteers with the Kurds in Syria. The YPG have been important allies of the West in helping to defeat so-called Islamic State. But terrorism laws in the UK prohibit engaging in violence for a political or ideological cause. It has so far been unclear how the actions of Britons fighting against Islamic State would be treated by the British courts. The government has long repeated warnings that fighting with any group could lead to legal consequences.

Dark web paedophile blackmailed victims,"Falder used online names including '666devil' and 'evilmind' A ""highly manipulative"" paedophile, described as one of the UK's worst, blackmailed his victims into performing degrading acts, a court heard. Cambridge graduate Matthew Falder made people photograph themselves, before sharing the images on the ""dark web"". Falder, 29, of Edgbaston, Birmingham, admitted 137 charges at crown court in October, including encouraging the rape of a four-year-old boy. His sentencing hearing gives the first details of his crimes. Midlands Live: MP gets in hot water over rail comments; Chief constable faces gross misconduct hearing The former Birmingham University geophysicist researcher used the online names ""666devil"" and ""evilmind"" on websites like Gumtree to find victims. He would blackmail them with a ""constant stream"" of increasingly depraved requests. Three of his victims attempted suicide. Opening the case, Ruona Iguyovwe said Falder got victims ""to produce increasingly severe self-generated indecent images of themselves, the focus of these images being to humiliate and degrade the victims"". Ms Iguyovwe said once he had compromising images of his victims, he told them to send him more material or he would share images with their friends and family. Described by the National Crime Agency as one of the UK's worst paedophiles, Falder bragged that he couldn't be caught He told one to ""choose carefully"", or he would ""send the images to everyone on Facebook associated with your school, and in letters to your parents and teachers, explaining with printouts of all the pictures that you will strip for money"". The hearing was told he also forced another victim to lick toilet seats and eat dog food. Falder distributed the images on websites known to be associated with paedophiles and those interested in ""hurtcore"", material which depicts rape and abuse. The court heard he posed as a female artist, sending images of previous victims, pretending they were him. When some victims threatened to tell parents or police, ""sophisticated"" Falder bragged ""I can't be caught"", using anonymous email accounts and software to cover his tracks. It took 30 minutes to read out all the charges against Matthew Falder at his first hearing in October Falder was snared after an investigation led by the National Crime Agency (NCA) with help from GCHQ, the FBI, and law enforcement in Israel, Slovenia, Australia and New Zealand. He also previously admitted charges of causing the sexual exploitation of a child, making and distributing indecent images of children and voyeurism. Describing the impact of Falder's actions, one of his victims told the court: ""I feel dirty, like used goods."" In a statement, the victim said her traumatic experiences had triggered the breakdown of relationships with her parents and boyfriend, and forced her to leave home. ""Part of me believes that's all I am good for anymore - to be abused,"" she said. Judge Philip Parker QC told her she was ""exceedingly brave"" for coming to court. The hearing continues.

'Crazy' Christmas fine cancelled by mayor,"Lee Williamson said he pulled in to a bus stop to give a homeless man clothes, food, and to chat to him A man who was fined after he pulled into a bus stop on Christmas Day to help a homeless man is to have his penalty cancelled by Leicester's mayor. Lee Williamson, 43, of Evington, Leicester, said he stopped to give a homeless man a blanket, hat, gloves, scarf, food, and chat to him. He later received a Â£70 fine, despite there being no buses on 25 December. Sir Peter Soulsby, the city mayor, said to punish Mr Williamson for doing a ""good deed"" was ""absolutely crazy"". Live updates from the East Midlands Mr Williamson said he was ""over the moon"" following Sir Peter's intervention. ""That just the news I wanted to hear,"" he said. ""Common sense is prevailing. I'm happy with that."" Leicester City Council had said the camera enforcement was an important safety measure after acyclist died there in 2016. Mr Williamson said it felt like he was being punished for helping someone and would never normally dream of stopping at a bus stop. He had also said he would not pay the fine. It prompted many people to offer to pay it on his behalf due to Mr Williamson's initial generosity. War veteran Mr Williamson said it is normally a busy road and he would ""never dream"" of stopping at a bus stop Now, Sir Peter has said he will help overturn the fine, having first stated that ""legal parking"" had been available nearby. He told the BBC: ""It was quite clear what Lee was doing was an act of a good Samaritan on Christmas day and even though it's important to keep this safe... there are exceptions.""

Ministers locked in key Brexit talks,"The PM is under pressure to spell out the details of the partnership she wants with the EU Theresa May has been chairing the first of two key Brexit meetings with senior ministers as the government faces more calls to clarify the UK's position. The Brexit cabinet committee is to sketch out what the future relationship between the UK and EU might look like. It was expected to focus on Northern Ireland and immigration. It comes as aleaked document suggests the EU wants to be able to restrict UK accessto the single market if there is a dispute after Brexit. According to a draft section of the UK and EU's withdrawal agreement, which has yet to be finalised, the power to suspend ""certain benefits"" would apply during a transition phase after the UK leaves in March 2019. The UK said the document simply reflected the EU's ""stated directives"". EU could use single market as sanction against UK A quick guide to the Brexit transition phase Barnier's trade warning for the UK How soon are answers needed? It comes as further details emerged of the Treasury's estimates of the impact on the economy of Brexit. According to the leaked estimates, the UK car industry's GDP would shrink by 1% if the UK remained in the EU single market but would lose 8% if there was a free trade agreement and 8.5% if the UK left without a deal and went to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. MPs have also been allowed to see the impact assessments for their own regions. All regions will see their economies shrink, with the North East of England, the West Midlands, and Northern Ireland being the worst affected, according to the analysis. The North-East would be hit hardest - with staying in the single market and customs union shaving 3% off GDP, an 11% reduction under a free trade deal and 16% under a no-deal WTO scenario, London would fare the best, with reductions of 1%, 2% and 3.5% in each of the three scenarios. Scotland's estimated hit would be 2.5%, 6% or 9%. Wales would see reductions of 1.5%, 5.5% or 9.5%. Brexit-backing Conservative MP Jacob-Rees Mogg has accused Treasury officials of ""fiddling the figures"" to make all options but staying in the EU look bad, after the documents werefirst leaked to Buzzfeed last week,external. The government said its preferred option - a bespoke deal covering trade and financial services - was not among those analysed in the leaked paper. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May restated the government's position that the UK would be leaving the single market and customs union and insisted she would be ""robust"" in getting the best deal. ""As I've said right from the very beginning, we will hear noises off, we will hear all sorts of things being said, of positions being taken,"" she said. ""What matters is the positions that we take in the negotiations, as we sit down and negotiate the best deal. We've shown we can do that, we did it in December and we're going to do it again."" The tensions within the Conservative Party were underlined on Monday when pro-EU former minister Anna Soubry told the BBC Mrs May should ""sling out"" arch Brexiteers, and threatened to quit the party. This video can not be played Business Secretary Greg Clark says the UK is looking for tariff-free trade Eurosceptics have been calling for a ""clean"" separation with the EU so the UK has the freedom to strike new trade deals, while pro-EU MPs say the UK should retain the closest possible access to the single market. Former Chancellor Ken Clarke said Theresa May had to see ""where the majority of opinion"" was within the cabinet, offer some concessions and those who could not live with the agreed stance would have to resign. He told BBC Radio 4's Today he wanted the UK to keep ""most of the features of the customs union and the single market"" after the transition period and suggested Parliament would back such a move. The key Brexit dates in 2018 Brexit: All you need to know What are the UK's Brexit trade options? But fellow Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said Mrs May had ""pushed back"" against that position, which he said was at odds with the government's stated position of achieving ""regulatory autonomy"". He told Today that ""no-one"" wanted a hard border on the island of Ireland or tariffs on trade between the UK and EU and it would be ""perverse"" if the EU ended up on insisting on them. The 11-member European Union Exit and Trade (Strategy and Negotiations) sub-committee is a key part of the government's decision-making process. Its members include Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who were at the forefront of the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, and Chancellor Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who campaigned for Remain. They are expected to discuss trade at another meeting on Thursday. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said this week there is ""not a moment to lose"" in finding a deal before the end of the year. Among those calling for more clarity on the UK's position is the British Chambers of Commerce, which has written to Mrs May asking for a ""clear, unequivocal statement of intent"". ""The perception amongst businesses on the ground, large and small alike, is one of continued division,"" it said. ""Even amongst the many optimistic, future-oriented firms - those who see opportunity in change - patience is wearing thin. Directly affected companies are poised to activate contingency plans. Many others, worryingly, have simply disengaged."" In response, Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK's aims were very clear, namely tariff-free trade with the EU with a ""minimum of frictions"" in the years ahead. Meanwhile, former transport minister Stephen Hammond has urged the UK to consider rejoining the European Free Trade Association, which it left in 1972 prior to joining the then European Economic Community. Speaking in a debate in Parliament, he said membership of the free trade body - whose members are Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland - was a ""sensible option"" which would give the UK the economic certainty and flexibility it wanted - although such an outcome has been rejected by ministers.

"Early Briton had dark skin and blue eyesScientists put a face to Cheddar Man, Britain's oldest complete skeleton from 10,000 years ago.","This video can not be played DNA shows early Brit had dark skin A cutting-edge scientific analysis shows that a Briton from 10,000 years ago had dark brown skin and blue eyes. Researchers from London's Natural History Museum extracted DNA from Cheddar Man, Britain's oldest complete skeleton, which was discovered in 1903. A University College London team analysed the genome, and the results were used for a facial reconstruction. It underlines the fact that the lighter skin characteristic of modern Europeans is a relatively recent phenomenon. No prehistoric Briton of this age had previously had their genome analysed. As such, the analysis provides valuable new insights into the first people to resettle Britain after the last Ice Age. The analysis of Cheddar Man's genome  - the ""blueprint"" for a human, contained in the nuclei of our cells - will be published in a journal, and will also  feature in the upcoming Channel 4 documentary The First Brit, Secrets Of The 10,000-year-old Man. 'Cheddar George' tweet on early Briton Cheddar Man's remains had been unearthed 115 years ago in Gough's Cave, located in Somerset's Cheddar Gorge. Subsequent examination has shown that the man was short by today's standards - about 5ft 5in - and probably died in his early 20s. Prof Chris Stringer, the museum's research leader in human origins, said: ""I've been studying the skeleton of Cheddar Man for about 40 years ""So to come face-to-face with what this guy could have looked like - and that striking combination of the hair, the face, the eye colour and that dark skin: something a few years ago we couldn't have imagined and yet that's what the scientific data show."" A replica of Cheddar Man's skeleton now lies in Gough's Cave Fractures on the surface of the skull suggest he may even have met his demise in a violent manner. It's not known how he came to lie in the cave, but it's possible he was placed there by others in his tribe. The Natural History Museum researchers extracted the DNA from part of the skull near the ear known as the petrous. At first, project scientists Prof Ian Barnes and Dr Selina Brace weren't sure if they'd get any DNA at all from the remains. But they were in luck: not only was DNA preserved, but Cheddar Man has since yielded the highest coverage (a measure of the sequencing accuracy) for a genome from this period of European prehistory - known as the Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age. They teamed up with researchers at University College London (UCL) to analyse the results, including gene variants associated with hair, eye and skin colour. They found the Stone Age Briton had dark hair - with a small probability that it was curlier than average - blue eyes and skin that was probably dark brown or black in tone. This combination might appear striking to us today, but it was a common appearance in western Europe during this period. Steven Clarke, director of the Channel Four documentary, said: ""I think we all know we live in times where we are unusually preoccupied with skin pigmentation."" Prof Mark Thomas, a geneticist from UCL, said: ""It becomes a part of our understanding, I think that would be a much, much better thing. I think it would be good if people lodge it in their heads, and it becomes a little part of their knowledge."" Unsurprisingly, the findings have generated lots of interest on social media.

Cheddar Man's genome reveals he was closely related to other Mesolithic individuals - so-called Western Hunter-Gatherers - who have been analysed from Spain, Luxembourg and Hungary. Dutch artists Alfons and Adrie Kennis, specialists in palaeontological model-making, took the genetic findings and combined them with physical measurements from scans of the skull. The result was a strikingly lifelike reconstruction of a face from our distant past. Pale skin probably arrived in Britain with a migration of people from the Middle East around 6,000 years ago. This population had pale skin and brown eyes and absorbed populations like the ones Cheddar Man belonged to. Prof Chris Stringer had studied Cheddar Man for 40 years - but was struck by the Kennis brothers' reconstruction No-one's entirely sure why pale skin evolved in these farmers, but their cereal-based diet was probably deficient in Vitamin D. This would have required agriculturalists to synthesise this essential nutrient in their skin using sunlight. ""There may be other factors that are causing lower skin pigmentation over time in the last 10,000 years. But that's the big explanation that most scientists turn to,"" said Prof Thomas. The genomic results also suggest Cheddar Man could not drink milk as an adult. This ability only spread much later, after the onset of the Bronze Age. Present-day Europeans owe on average 10% of their ancestry to Mesolithic hunters like Cheddar Man. Britain has been something of a boom-and-bust story for humans over the last million-or-so years. Modern humans were here as early as 40,000 years ago, but a period of extreme cold known as the Last Glacial Maximum drove them out some 10,000 years later. Elon Musk's Falcon rocket soars into space Food may influence cancer spread Graduate loses bid to sue Oxford over 2:1 degree There's evidence from Gough's Cave that hunter-gatherers ventured back around 15,000 years ago, establishing a temporary presence when the climate briefly improved. However, they were soon sent packing by another cold snap. Cut marks on the bones suggest these people cannibalised their dead - perhaps as part of ritual practices. The actual skull of Cheddar Man is kept in the Natural History Museum, seen being handled here by Ian Barnes Britain was once again settled 11,000 years ago; and has been inhabited ever since. Cheddar Man was part of this wave of migrants, who walked across a landmass called Doggerland that, in those days, connected Britain to mainland Europe. This makes him the oldest known Briton with a direct connection to people living here today. This is not the first attempt to analyse DNA from the Cheddar Man. In the late 1990s, Oxford University geneticist Brian Sykes sequenced mitochondrial DNA from one of Cheddar Man's molars. Mitochondrial DNA comes from the biological ""batteries"" within our cells and is passed down exclusively from a mother to her children. Prof Sykes compared the ancient genetic information with DNA from 20 living residents of Cheddar village and found two matches - including history teacher Adrian Targett, who became closely connected with the discovery. The result is consistent with the approximately 10% of Europeans who share the same mitochondrial DNA type.

"'One in four' UK dinners is vegetarianA 'sustained interest' in vegan and meat-free diets is driving the change, industry analysts say.","More than a quarter of all evening meals in the UK are vegan or vegetarian, research shows. In the 12 weeks to the end of January, 29% of them contained no meat or fish, according to Kantar Worldpanel. Trends like Veganuary  (going vegan for January) and ""sustained interest"" in meat-free diets are affecting habits, the market researcher said. Meanwhile, Yorkshire-based meat substitute company Quorn Foods saw global sales rise by 16% last year. The research - collected from a consumer panel of 30,000 households - reflects a year-on-year move to more vegetarian meals (26.9% of evening meals were vegetarian in 2014 and 27.8% in 2016). Through January, one in 10 shoppers bought a meat-free ready meal, boosting sales by 15% compared to this time last year.

Merkel clinches Germany coalition deal,"Angela Merkel's party suffered heavy losses in Germany's election last year Germany is set to emerge from months of political deadlock after Angela Merkel's conservatives (CDU/CSU) finally agreed a coalition deal with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). Negotiators have agreed on the division of key ministries - one of the last hurdles towards forming a government. It could end more than four months of wrangling since inconclusive elections in September. But the deal will still need to be approved by SPD members. Many in the party fear that re-entering a coalition with CDU/CSU could damage it in the long term. In a joint news conference on Wednesday, Chancellor Merkel said the agreement gave the basis for a ""good and stable government"". Germany's marriage of convenience SPD membership spike sparks concern SPD leader Martin Schulz thanked the conservatives for making what he said were tough compromises. In a tweet, he said the deal ""achieved a lot for people"",externaland he would be recommending that his party members accept it. The SPD looks set to control six ministries, including finance and foreign affairs. Mr Schulz has confirmed he will step down as SPD leader in March and instead become foreign minister, if the coalition deal is approved by SPD members. German elections: Merkel's hollow victory Angela Merkel's quiet power He will be replaced as SPD leader by former Labour and Social Affairs Minister Andrea Nahles. Mr Schulz says the deal ""achieves a lot for people"" The SPD's 460,000 members will have the final say on the whole agreement in a postal vote, the result of which will be announced on 2 March. Those opposed to any deal with Mrs Merkel include a new group within the SPD calling itself NoGroKo (no grand coalition). By Damien McGuinness, BBC News, Berlin Handing Germany's centre-left control of finance, foreign and labour policy would have a big impact on the rest of the world, particularly Europe. The promised spending spree on infrastructure and services will likely boost Germany's economy further, and the tax cuts may give an added boost to German consumer spending. A Social Democrat finance ministry - replacing pro-austerity Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble - is more likely to go along with French President Macron's ambitious plans for EU reform, by allowing more German support for struggling eurozone economies. Mr Macron wants to create a common eurozone budget and a eurozone finance minister, but Germany has so far been wary of any move that might lead to what it calls a ""transfer union"" used to prop up indebted governments. An SPD-led finance ministry could be much more amenable to Mr Macron's proposals. And at home these powerful ministries would help the SPD push for key left-wing policies, such as better rights for employees. This video can not be played German post-war politics in two minutes All of this could go down well with SPD party members, who will vote on any final coalition deal. An agreement which looks like a win for the SPD will increase the likelihood that they will vote yes. But if they vote no, then the most likely outcome could be fresh elections. European jitters over German coalition talks What are Macron's economic plans? Mr Schulz at first ruled out going back into government with Mrs Merkel's centre-right CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU. The parties had seen their popularity drop after being in coalition on and off since 2005. He changed his mind when CDU/CSU coalition talks with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens broke down. Both Mr Schulz and Mrs Merkel have been under pressure to see off a challenge by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which became the third biggest party in September's election. This video can not be played How a woman from East Germany became one of the world's most powerful figures Other than distributing ministries, there have been big stumbling blocks in the coalition talks over workers' rights and healthcare. Just how far to the right is AfD? Immigration, Europe, and tax, have also been points of contention. European Union allies, such as France, see Germany as a pillar of stability in the bloc and have been hoping Mrs Merkel succeeds. Top EU officials, including the Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, welcomed the breakthrough on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He said in a tweet,external: ""Relaunching the German model in this parliament with this arrangement and this chancellor will clearly not be possible."" Meanwhile Alice Weidel, the head of the far-right AfD's group of MPs in the new parliament, criticised the coalition's proposed immigration policy, which would see up to 220,000 asylum seekers given residency each year and a scheme to encourage highly-qualified people to move to Germany.

Paedophile 'blackmailed' online victims,"Falder used online names including '666devil' and 'evilmind' A ""highly manipulative"" paedophile, described as one of the UK's worst, blackmailed his victims into performing degrading acts, a court heard. Cambridge graduate Matthew Falder made people photograph themselves, before sharing the images on the ""dark web"". Falder, 29, of Edgbaston, Birmingham, admitted 137 charges at crown court in October, including encouraging the rape of a four-year-old boy. His sentencing hearing gives the first details of his crimes. Midlands Live: MP gets in hot water over rail comments; Chief constable faces gross misconduct hearing The former Birmingham University geophysicist researcher used the online names ""666devil"" and ""evilmind"" on websites like Gumtree to find victims. He would blackmail them with a ""constant stream"" of increasingly depraved requests. Three of his victims attempted suicide. Opening the case, Ruona Iguyovwe said Falder got victims ""to produce increasingly severe self-generated indecent images of themselves, the focus of these images being to humiliate and degrade the victims"". Ms Iguyovwe said once he had compromising images of his victims, he told them to send him more material or he would share images with their friends and family. Described by the National Crime Agency as one of the UK's worst paedophiles, Falder bragged that he couldn't be caught He told one to ""choose carefully"", or he would ""send the images to everyone on Facebook associated with your school, and in letters to your parents and teachers, explaining with printouts of all the pictures that you will strip for money"". The hearing was told he also forced another victim to lick toilet seats and eat dog food. Falder distributed the images on websites known to be associated with paedophiles and those interested in ""hurtcore"", material which depicts rape and abuse. The court heard he posed as a female artist, sending images of previous victims, pretending they were him. When some victims threatened to tell parents or police, ""sophisticated"" Falder bragged ""I can't be caught"", using anonymous email accounts and software to cover his tracks. It took 30 minutes to read out all the charges against Matthew Falder at his first hearing in October Falder was snared after an investigation led by the National Crime Agency (NCA) with help from GCHQ, the FBI, and law enforcement in Israel, Slovenia, Australia and New Zealand. He also previously admitted charges of causing the sexual exploitation of a child, making and distributing indecent images of children and voyeurism. Describing the impact of Falder's actions, one of his victims told the court: ""I feel dirty, like used goods."" In a statement, the victim said her traumatic experiences had triggered the breakdown of relationships with her parents and boyfriend, and forced her to leave home. ""Part of me believes that's all I am good for anymore - to be abused,"" she said. Judge Philip Parker QC told her she was ""exceedingly brave"" for coming to court. The hearing continues.

Generation Game reboot cut to two shows,"Last year Perkins and Giedroyc said they were ""so excited"" to be co-hosting the show A revival of The Generation Game, to be hosted by comedy duo Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins, has been reduced to just two shows. When the vintage game show's return wasannounced last year, the BBC said it would have a four-episode run. ""During the production process it's not unusual for a new series to change length as the format evolves,"" said the BBC in a statement. ""We've got a brilliant show for audiences on BBC One this spring."" Sir Bruce Forsyth, pictured with Anthea Redfern, was the show's original host Four shows were filmed in all, though one or more of these may have been pilots that were not intended for transmission. The Sun has claimed that the ""combined cost of cutting the episodes is... around Â£400,000"" - a figure the BBC said was ""speculation"". The Generation Game began on BBC One in 1971, with Sir Bruce Forsyth as its longest-serving host.

"Swimsuits 'unacceptable' at betting showGambling Commission chief condemns industry event where women wear ""little more than swimsuits"".4h4 hours agoBusinessComments","Women at the ICT Totally Gaming conference in 2014 Scantily clad women are ""unacceptable"" at a betting industry conference, Britain's gambling regulator has said. Sarah Harrison told the BBC that some women working at the ICE Totally Gaming event were wearing ""little more than swimsuits"", while men wore smart suits. The chief executive of the Gambling Commission said the body could boycott future ICE Total Gaming events. But the event's manager said the complaint was directed at a ""very small"" number of firms taking part. Kate Chambers, managing director of ICE London, also said the show has been encouraging exhibitors to represent women more respectfully. Have you attended one of these events? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external The three-day ICE Total Gaming event, held at London's ExCel centre, is an international showcase for the industry, attended by betting companies, technology providers, and casino operators. The Guardian newspaper attended the event andspoke to some women working there,external. One of them told the newspaper she was paid Â£100 a day to work on a stand. ""'Somebody asked me yesterday how much I would charge', indicating that the request referred to sex,"" the newspaper reported. Earlier, Ms Harrison told BBC's Radio 4's Today programme of her dismay at seeing a gender disparity at the show, with some women on exhibition stalls doing promotional work in revealing clothing. ""The men were wearing smart suits and women were being asked to wear not much more than swimsuits. That's totally unacceptable; it's not reflective of the modern economy,"" she said. ""This isn't about political correctness. It's about good regulation and good governance, because businesses that have a more diverse workforce are more likely to make better decisions. And that's critical from a regulator's point of view."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She added: ""Given our focus is on fairer and safer gambling, businesses that look more like their customers are much more likely to be able to put in place the protections and the safeguards that we are really focussed on."" Her comments come amid outrage overthe notorious Presidents Club men-only dinnerand campaigns against the use of 'walk-on girls' at sports events. Ms Harrison, who is leaving the Gambling Commission for a role at the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, spoke at the ICE event earlier this week. The occasion was, she said in her speech, ""an opportunity to highlight and challenge what is a significant stain on this industry's reputation"" - a lack of diversity. She said Britain's highest paid boss was a woman - Denise Coates chief executive at betting firm Bet365. ""Yet from walking around the exhibition you wouldn't know this,"" she said. ""Any future participation by the Gambling Commission in events like this will depend on there being change.""

Tesco faces Â£4bn equal pay claim,"This video can not be played Pam Jenkins says the men's and women's jobs are of ""equal value"" Tesco is facing Britain's largest ever equal pay claim and a possible bill running to Â£4bn. Thousands of women who work in Tesco stores could receive back pay totalling Â£20,000 if the legal challenge demanding parity with men who work in the company's warehouses is successful. Lawyers say hourly-paid female store staff earn less than men even though the value of the work is comparable. Tesco said it worked hard to ensure all staff were paid ""fairly and equally"". What you need to know about the gender pay gap Pay gap 'widens as women get older' Paula Lee, of Leigh Day solicitors told the BBC it was time for Tesco to tackle the problem of equal pay for work of equal worth. Her firm has been contacted by more than 1,000 Tesco staff and will this week take the initial legal steps for 100 of them. The most common rate for women is Â£8 an hour whereas for men the hourly rate can be as high as Â£11 an hour, she added. Cleaners vs Binmen -What is ""work of comparable value""? Since 1984 workers doing jobs that require comparable skills, have similar levels of responsibility and are of comparable worth to the employer, should also be rewarded equally, according to the law. Thus if you are a cleaner, lugging mops and buckets up and down staircases, you may have a case for being paid the same as co-workers collecting rubbish bins. It doesn't matter whether the cleaner or the shop floor worker is male or female, they may still have a case to see their pay upped to match colleagues doing other jobs. But in practice many of the poorer paid jobs have been done by women. Key moments in the fight for equal pay Ms Lee said it was a problem that had been ""hiding in plain sight"" for years and that while there was no suggestion that Tesco had intentionally been underpaying women, historical divisions between male and female roles had led to the pay differential. ""We believe an inherent bias has allowed store workers to be underpaid over many years,"" she said. ""In terms of equal worth to the company there really should be no argument that workers in stores, compared to those working in the depots, contribute at least equal value to the vast profits made by Tesco. ""The law has been there since 1984 - you can compare with a different job. ""That's 34 years to put your house in order; that's 34 years of having the advantage of paying unequally, 34 years of you making pay decisions and making financial decisions and 34 years hiding what is in open sight."" Leigh Day said that up to 200,000 supermarket workers could be affected, the majority of them women. Initial claims have been lodged with the conciliation service, ACAS - the first stage in what is likely to be a lengthy legal process through the employment tribunal system which could last several years. If even a small proportion of the women are successful, the bill for Tesco would be significant. Birmingham City Council is now liable for over Â£1bn pounds in payments after settling an equal pay claim from women employed as cleaners, cooks and carers. Their pay was below men in comparable jobs such as bin collectors and road workers. Leigh Day is also fighting similar actions against rival supermarket groups Asda and Sainsbury's on behalf of shop floor workers. In 2016,an employment tribunal ruledthat 9,500 women who work at Asda  on check-outs or stacking shelves, could compare themselves to higher paid men who work at warehouses. Asda is currently appealing the ruling. Tesco said that all their staff could progress equally and were paid fairly, whatever their gender or background. ""We are unable to comment on a claim that we have not received,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Tesco has always been a place for people to get on in their career, regardless of their gender, background or education, and we work hard to make sure all our colleagues are paid fairly and equally for the jobs they do."" Two workers for Tesco told the BBC they wanted fair treatment, arguing that their jobs in the stores were as demanding as warehouse jobs. Pam Jenkins has been working for Tesco for 26 years. ""I think that we should be brought up to their [the men's] level,"" she told me. ""Obviously the jobs are slightly different but to put it bluntly they are of equal value. ""We deal with customers, they [the men] don't have to. We load, we take the stock and we load the stock, they take it off the lorry and we load it onto the shelves. ""Women have been fighting for equal rights and their voice to be heard for 100 years, we are not just doing it for us, there are many people out there. ""We are just trying to put things right and it's a shame we are still having to fight in this day and age."" Kim Element has been working for Tesco for 23 years. ""Although we think we have equal rights, there are times where there are discrepancies and you can't explain them,"" she said. ""And I think Tesco's are one of many companies that aren't addressing the fact that women seem to still be paid less."" Ms Lee said that Tesco was a good employer, signing up to a number of gender equality projects over a number of years. But she said the company - along with many others - was still failing to reward people equally. The criteria that the courts use to compare jobs in these cases aren't precisely pre-defined. But the starting point is to send in an independent expert to do a job evaluation study. That expert scores each of the roles under consideration including considerations such as how demanding they are physically, mentally and emotionally. If they involve working in the cold, or facing customer complaints, or if they require technical know-how, qualifications, responsibility for other staff or enhanced communication skills, that will push up their value. If the roles are comparable the case can then go to an employment tribunal, but there's still scope for the employer to argue that there's another reason the pay differs: if workers in those jobs have been there longer, or have more professional experience for example. While individuals can bring cases, It is much easier to bring such claims if you're part of a group. ""You need momentum behind the claim. That opens the doors,"" says Leigh Day's spokesperson. ""It forces them to be transparent and give information to a tribunal which you may not get on a one to one basis."" What is the gender pay gap?

The women still struggling to vote,"Frustrating. That's how some women describe accessing the vote, 100 years after the law changed. Despite having a legal right to vote, some are still unable to cast a ballot at election time - or at least not in secret. The government has put systems in place to help, but many people say these are often cumbersome and leave people reliant on family or friends. ""There is no autonomy,"" Ruksana Khanum, a law graduate who is partially-sighted, says. Blind and partially-sighted people are provided with a tactile overlay for their ballot paper, but this only indicates numbers down the left-hand side and where the boxes are to cross. No names or parties are rendered in braille. Ruksana says this leaves her reliant on a family member or friend to read out the ballot paper for her and then, as the overlay has a tendency to slip, to check that she has actually crossed the intended box. As the youth forum advisor for the Royal Society for Blind Children, she is campaigning for a more accessible ballot paper. ""Frustration is pervasive,"" she adds. With technology ""we can do things - but with this fundamental right, we are stuck in the dark ages"". Ruksana Khanum campaigns for better access to voting for blind and partially-sighted people Despite the Electoral Commission's directions to local authorities,external, advising them to ensure polling stations do not disadvantage disabled people,a 2010 survey by the disability charity Scope,externalfound two-thirds of them had access issues. From simple problems such as steps and tables being too high - creating barriers for wheelchair users - to difficulties arranging proxy votes for people who cannot use a pen, disabled women and men are finding themselves struggling to access the democratic process. Domestic violence vote law plans unveiled Why do disabled people feel ignored when it comes to voting? Remembering suffragist Millicent Fawcett Scope's head of policy, James Taylor, said he had heard of disabled people being turned away from polling stations. ""This should not be happening and councils must work to make all necessary changes. If we want everyday equality, then an equal share in our democracy is one of the fundamental places we need to start,"" he added. Before the last election, social media was awash with pleas for people to register to vote. Many emphasised how quick and easy it was to do; simply fill out a very short online form and you were good to go. But for homeless women, including some of the 60,000 living in temporary accommodation, this simple-sounding task is almost impossible. People who cannot provide a permanent address cannot use the standard online form but must instead print a different one and return it - by post or by hand - to a local electoral office. The resources needed to do this (access to the internet, a printer etc) are hard to come by for these women. Combined with a general lack of knowledge about the possibility of registering without an address, this means that although a system exists to allow homeless women to vote, many remain unregistered and unheard. The same appears to be true for survivors of domestic violence - a system is in place, but it is complicated and difficult to navigate. For many abuse survivors, registering to vote in the regular way is dangerous. Being registered means their names and addresses would appear on the public electoral roll, allowing perpetrators to find out exactly where they live. One survivor of domestic violence explained the lengths she went to to keep her address secret. ""I even removed the house numbers from the front door in case he came looking,"" she said of her abuser. Describing her time in a safe house, she says: ""I was unaware at the time that not registering would adversely affect my credit rating for a prolonged time and, of course, I forfeited my right to vote."" She says that women need protection so they can rebuild their lives, including regaining their democratic voice. Mehala Osborne survived abuse and launched the campaign to have the law changed to allow anonymous registration Currently, there is a system in place which allows survivors to register anonymously, so long as they can provide documentation (almost always a court order) proving that regular registration would compromise their safety. The issue, according to the charity Women's Aid, is that many survivors do not have these documents; they have not been through a legal process. Nor can they easily get them. According to Women's Aid, letters of evidence ""can only be signed by very senior figures in specific agencies, such as the director general of the Serious Organised Crime Agency"". The charity is calling for the bar for eligible evidence to be lowered, so that refuge workers and health professionals can attest to a woman's status. Domestic violence vote law plans unveiled The charity's chief executive, Katie Ghose, said that ""while 2018 is a time for us to celebrate the long hard battle our sisters fought to secure suffrage... we must remember that some women continue to be silenced"". She emphasised that anonymity ""is a matter of life and death"" and that ""women are often on the run for the rest of their lives"". The charity is therefore also calling for anonymous registration to be valid indefinitely. ""We urge the government to mark this centenary by sending out a clear message to all survivors of domestic abuse: that their voices matter, and their right to vote will never be taken away.""

Actresses and arsonists: Women who won the vote,"Before 1918 no women were allowed to vote in parliamentary elections. It took the extraordinary actions of ordinary women to bring the issue to the forefront of politics; women who were prepared to go to prison, to go on hunger strike, to be force fed - just to achieve parity with men. Two branches emerged - thesuffragistsused peaceful tactics such as non-violent demonstrations, petitions and the lobbying of MPs; while thesuffragettes'methods were more militant, smashing windows and setting fire to buildings. Most people have heard of the poster girls of women's suffrage, such as Emily Wilding Davison and the Pankhursts, but here are some of the lesser-known women - and men - who dedicated themselves to the cause. Lilian Lenton photographed in a prison exercise yard, and newspaper coverage of her escape and arrest Lilian Lenton, a firm believer in the suffragettes' motto ""deeds not words"", had an ambition of burning down at least two buildings a week. She trained as a dancer when she left school but became a suffragette as soon as she turned 21. She quickly became famous for her ability to escape from the authorities. Moving from her hometown of Leicester to London, early in 1913 she began a series of arson attacks in the capital. Her object was to bring the country into crisis, showing that it was impossible to govern those who did not want to be governed. She was arrested in February 1913 for setting fire to the Tea House at Kew Gardens and in Holloway prison went on hunger strike before being forcibly fed. The process, which involved stuffing a tube through her nose and down her throat, caused her to become seriously ill as she breathed food into her lungs. She was quickly released. The authorities did not want a martyr. You can hear Lilian Lenton speaking here However, her time in jail only made her more determined. She continued her campaign of arson and was soon jailed again in Leeds before being released under the""Cat and Mouse Act"",externalwhen she went on hunger strike. A prison report from 1913, which describes Lenton's general conduct as 'bad, very defiant' and details how she was put in a special cell after smashing the first one up Fearing she would be rearrested once recovered, she fled the city in a delivery van, dressed as an errand boy. Taxis took her to Harrogate and then Scarborough from where she escaped to France in a private yacht, although she soon returned to Britain, setting fire to things again. This act of evasion earned her the nickname of ""the Leicester Pimpernel"". A newspaper cutting from May 1914 describes how she evaded capture. ""She led the police a merry dance up and down the country for several weeks while she changed her disguises. Harrogate, Scarborough and Dundee were a few of the towns she visited. She also stayed at Cardiff. There she was nearly caught, but by disguising herself as an infirm old lady, with a black shawl over her head, she hobbled into the station and travelled to London"". During World War One, she served in Serbia with a hospital unit and was awarded a French Red Cross medal. After the war the Representation of the People Act 1918 was passed, awarding the vote to women householders or the wives of householders, aged 30 and over. Lenton, who was unmarried and did not own a home, was unimpressed by this concession. ""I hadn't either a husband or furniture, although I was over 30,"" she said. She died aged 81, in 1972. Elizabeth Robins was a successful actor Elizabeth Robinswas an American actor and playwright brought up by her grandmother after her mother was committed to an insane asylum. She married an actor and was far more successful than him - he eventually killed himself by jumping into a river, leaving a note to her saying: ""I will not stand in your light any longer."" Robins came toLondon in 1891 to play the lead in Ibsen's,externalHedda Gabler, becoming the pre-eminent Ibsen actress of her day. By 1906 she had begun to focus on women's suffrage as a subject for drama. In the autumn she wroteVotes for Women!,externalin which one of the main characters is based on suffragette leader Christabel Pankhurst. The play was a success and performed all over the country. She later adapted it into a book - The Convert - which is still in print. Robins took the production to New York and Rome, helping to spread the message. She gave some of the proceeds to the suffragette movement. As suffragette militancy increased, she wrote articles and letters in support. Other than her brief marriage, she remained single. Highly intelligent, she was welcomed into London's literary and artistic circles, enjoying friendships with George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, and Henry James. She continued to campaign on feminist issues for the rest of her life, even turning her house into a convalescent home for overworked professional women. She was also a driving force behind the founding of the New Sussex Hospital for Women and Children. Margaret Bondfieldwas one of very few working class women who rose to the top of the suffrage movement. Born in Chard, Somerset, in 1873, the second youngest of eleven children, she became an apprentice at a drapers in Brighton aged 14. There she saw how the daily grind wore down the women workers and affected their self-respect. She observed they were left with little time or energy to pursue interests away from work, with many girls seeming intent on getting married as early as possible in order to escape the drudgery. Ms Bondfield left Brighton and went to live with her brother in London - working, again, in a shop. She became an active trade unionist and was shocked by the working culture of long hours, low wages, poor diet and requirement to ""live in"" in often dismal dormitories. She co-founded the first trade union for women, the National federation of Women Workers, and later recalled how one irate grocer ""read a recruitment leaflet, tore it up and stamped on the bits"", shouting: ""Union indeed! Go home and mend your stockings!"" By 1910, she was working as an advisor to the Liberal government - helping to influence the Health Insurance Bill, giving improved maternity benefits to mothers, and working to further gender equality. In 1923 she became one of the first female MPs, winning Northampton for Labour, and in early 1924, she made history when she was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour - the first woman ever to become a government minister. In 1929 she was made Minister of Labour herself - the first time that a woman had been made a British cabinet minister. She remained a staunch Labour supporter until her death at the age of 80. Clement Attlee, the leader of the party and former prime minister, gave the address at her funeral. The Pankhurst Anthem How the BBC is marking the 1918 centenaries Frederick and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence were both prominent suffragettes Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and her husband Fred were a suffragette power couple. Emmeline Pethickhad a strong social conscience and worked with working class girls in London to improve their living standards and employment prospects.Frederick Lawrencewas a barrister from a wealthy family, who had aspirations to become a Liberal MP. When the pair fell in love, Miss Pethick refused to marry him until he became a socialist. The couple agreed to combine their names, but continue to hold separate bank accounts. His money and her organisational skills helped the Women's Social and Political Union, the radical organisation led by Mrs Pankhurst, rise to prominence. Campaigns were planned at their country home, which was also used as a place where women released from prison could recuperate, and together they ran the publicationVotes for Women. Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence came up with the colours of purple, white and green to represent the suffragettes: ""Purple as everyone knows is the royal colour, it stands for the royal blood that flows in the veins of every suffragette, the instinct of freedom and dignityâ¦ white stands for purity in private and public lifeâ¦ green is the colour of hope and the emblem of spring."" After World War One, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence became an international campaigner for women's rights and peace. Her husband became a Labour MP, and in 1945, a peer. But, as influential and helpful as they were, the Pethick-Lawrences fell out with Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, who preferred militant action. The couple disapproved of the campaign to smash windows, but because of their involvement with the group, they were arrested, charged with conspiracy and jailed for nine months. Both went on hunger strike, both were force-fed. Mrs Pethick-Lawrence said: ""If the government was naive enough to believe the nasal tube or the stomach pump, the steel gag, the punishment cell, handcuffs and the straight jacket would break the spirit of women who were determined to win the enfranchisement of their sex, they were again woefully misled"". The courts also took the contents of their home to pay for the cost of the windows. Just as damaging were the prosecution costs. Bailiffs were called in and the couple only narrowly avoided bankruptcy. When the WSPU planned to move on to campaigns of arson, the Pethick-Lawrences objected. Christabel Pankhurst then arranged for them to be expelled from the the organisation. ""Christabel made it quite clear that she had no further use for us,"" Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence later recalled. Despite being pushed to one side, the Pethick-Lawrences continued to campaign for equality. In 1928, theEqual Franchise Act,externalgranted equal voting rights to all women and men aged 21 or over. At a celebratory gathering, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence thanked the government for the new law, saying: ""We have fought a good fight.""

Suffragists or suffragettes - who won women the vote?,"""Women's vote won"" declared the Manchester Guardian following 6 February 1918. The passing of the Representation of the People Act had extended voting rights to women over the age of 30 who owned property for the first time. In this centenary year a group of women called the suffragettes will be much celebrated. Yet, the suffragists began campaigning years before them with a very different vision for how to secure the vote for women - so who did win it? The Suffragists â were first to organise, forming local societies in the 1860s The Suffragettes â were active for just 10 years after splitting from the Suffragists in 1903 Suffragists â focused on middle-class women Suffragettes â encouraged working-class women to protest Suffragists â held public speaking events, lobbied MPs and wrote petitions Suffragettes â disrupted meetings, vandalised art and buildings and were often arrested Suffragists â dinner parties! Suffragettes â hunger strikes! Everyone organised marches! Suffragists â successfully built support in parliament over many years Suffragettes â increased publicity and re-energised the cause but also sparked a backlash Then in World War One, women took new roles in factories and beyond... ...which made denying them voting rights harder than ever After 50 years of women standing up and speaking out... Parliament finally passed a law giving some women the vote in 1918 Click next arrow to proceed Loading ... Swipe to progress  By the late 19th century parliamentary reforms had given more men the right to vote in Britain, while petitions to enfranchise women were mocked and rejected. Growing anger turned into action, and in 1897 local campaigners came together to form the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies (NUWSS). Known as the suffragists, they were made up of mostly middle-class women and became the biggest suffrage organisation with more than 50,000 members. Suffragist Millicent Fawcett will be the first woman to have a statue in Parliament Square. Their president, Millicent Garrett Fawcett, passionately believed that non-violent campaigning would lead to constitutional change. She wanted to prove, through petitions and the lobbying of MPs, that women were respectable and responsible enough to participate in politics. The broad focus of the suffragists is reflected in the colours adopted by the group; Green, White and Red, stood for Give Women Rights.  Meanwhile the sashes often seen on suffragettes (and in the Disney film Mary Poppins) used Green, White and Violet, demanding Give Women Votes. After six years with little progress, a number of women across the country became frustrated with Fawcett's moderate campaigning style. Emmeline Pankhurst, who had been a member of the Manchester suffragist group, believed it was time for direct action by working-class women who would use any means necessary to secure the vote.  ""Deeds not words"" - the motto of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) she created in 1903 - summed up their tactic of demanding, not asking, for their rights. The label of suffragette was actually first used in an article by Daily Mail journalist Charles E Hands. The intention of the ""ette"" suffix was ""to belittle and to show that they were less than the proper kind of suffrage worker"", says Elizabeth Crawford, a researcher and author on the women's suffrage movement. ""But they took up the name and were very proud of it."" The early action of these suffragettes was just to heckle politicians, and that ""was considered really untoward"" says Ms Crawford. A turning point came in 1905. Suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst was arrested numerous times. Pankhurst's daughter, Christabel, and fellow suffragette Annie Kenney, were charged with obstruction after they interrupted a Liberal Party meeting to ask if they would give votes to women. The women chose prison over paying a fine, and the considerable attention this attracted to the suffragette cause became their inspiration. ""The idea of militancy then was ratcheted up over the years,"" Ms Crawford says. ""This was never overtly condoned by the leadership, but on the other hand they didn't condemn them.  They just more or less said 'do what's necessary'."" The militants embraced the label and named their magazine Suffragette. As street demonstrations became increasingly angry and windows were smashed in Whitehall, arrests became common amongst the suffragettes. This led to a new tactic - hunger strikes - and the brutal force-feeding they were subjected to attracted sympathy to their cause. From 1912 the militant tactics became more violent; Mary Richardson took a meat cleaver to a painting at London's National Gallery while Sikh Princess Sophia Duleep Singh threw herself in front of the prime minister's car. Suffragettes often chained themselves to railings Arson attacks became commonplace - including on churches and libraries. They even bombed the house of then Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd George - though no one was hurt. Were extreme suffragettes regarded as terrorists? Sophia: Suffragette Princess Historian Katherine Connelly explains that at this period, the militant suffrage movement became more elitist, largely organising middle class and upper class women. ""That elitism was also coupled with a neglect for winning over public opinion,"" she says. Fawcett was sympathetic to the aims of the suffragettes, but as public outrage grew Ms Crawford explains that this was damaging her cause. ""People didn't distinguish between the two factions of the movement and were put off the whole idea."" The funeral procession for Emily Wilding Davison In 1913 suffragists organised a march of 50,000 law-abiding members to London to show suffragettes did not represent them. Yet in the same year Fawcett demonstrated loyalty to the suffragettes who risked their life for the cause. After Emily Wilding Davison threw herself under the King's horse at the Epsom Derby, she declared ""courage calls to courage everywhere, and its voice cannot be denied"". ""It's not possible to imagine women winning the vote without the suffragettes,"" says Ms Connelly, ""The militant organising, particularly of working class women, pointed to the possibility of a movement that would grow and could potentially become an enormous mass movement."" Both sides of the movement halted their campaigns in 1914, in order to support the war efforts. World War One and women undertaking jobs usually done by men was the catalyst for extending votes to women. Women took up jobs in munitions factories ""It was the suffragists who said that if you give the vote to more classes of men then you must include women,"" says Ms Crawford. ""The whole idea of what women could be, had changed by then - with all the work they'd been doing in World War One - that the government felt able to make this concession."" Ms Connelly agrees that the suffragettes were inspired by the suffragists, but that ultimately both movements played their part in winning the vote by organising women on mass in so many different ways.

Police Scotland chief constable quits,"Mr Gormley's contract was due to expire at the end of this year The chief constable of Police Scotland has resigned with immediate effect. Phil Gormley had been on special leave since September amid a series of investigations into claims of gross misconduct. The Police Investigations and Review Commissioner (Pirc) had been investigating five complaints, while a further two were being assessed internally. Mr Gormley has always denied any wrongdoing. But in a statement, he said he had come to the conclusion since ""events"" in November that it would be impossible to resume his duties in any meaningful way ahead of his contract expiring at the end of this year, regardless of the outcome of the investigations. How a glittering police career turned into a soap opera Timeline: The Phil Gormley inquiry Police chief facing seventh complaint Mr Gormley had been told by the Scottish Police Authority (SPA) in November that he could return to work, but thedecision was subsequently reversedafter Justice Secretary Michael Matheson expressed concerns about it. In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, Mr Matheson said he respected Mr Gormley's decision, which he hoped would allow policing in Scotland to move forward. He also paid tribute to ""all of those officers who have continued to serve the people of Scotland every day, helping to keep crime at historically low levels and making our communities safer"". In his statement, Mr Gormley said the past eight months had been difficult for him and his family, and thanked his wife for her ""love and loyalty"". He added: ""I now need to prioritise the health and wellbeing of my family on whom these events have taken a significant toll. ""The support of colleagues from across the UK with whom I have served during the last 32 years has been a source of great strength. ""As chief constable of Police Scotland I have had the privilege to meet and work with some exceptional people, I wish them well for the future and it is in their interests that I feel it is right to step aside."" Mr Matheson told MSPs he hoped Mr Gormley's departure would help the force to move forward Pirc confirmed that all of its misconduct investigations into the chief constable will now come to an end, and that reports containing all of the information that had been gathered will be submitted to the SPA. Mr Gormley was named as the head of the Police Scotland in December 2015, before being sworn in the following month. The single national force is the second-largest in the UK behind the Metropolitan Police, with about 17,000 officers. Mr Gormley had previously been deputy director of the National Crime Agency, and had served as the chief constable of Norfolk Police. The SPA, which oversees Police Scotland, said he would not be required to work his contractual notice period. It said he would receive a payment in respect of his salary for his three month notice period, and for his outstanding annual leave entitlement. But Mr Gormley will receive no other settlement or severance payment from the SPA. Mr Gormley's resignation comes two months after Susan Deacon took over as chairwoman of the SPA SPA chairwoman Susan Deacon, who has previouslybacked the justice secretaryin the row over the chief constable's future, said Mr Gormley had made a ""significant contribution to policing in Scotland"". She said: ""I would like to thank him for this contribution and wish him well for the future. ""This has been a challenging period for all concerned, and in the interest of policing in  Scotland we now need to move on"". Her tribute to Mr Gormley was echoed by Deputy Chief Constable Iain Livingstone, who added: ""My focus, and that of all officers and staff, will remain on day-to-day policing and serving the people of Scotland as we go forward."" Police Scotland is the second largest force in the UK, with 17,000 officers In December it emerged that the SPA, under former chairman Andrew Flanagan, had agreed Mr Gormley's return to duty. It had even drafted a press release in consultation with Mr Gormley's lawyers which said arrangements were in place to support the welfare of officers involved in the ongoing misconduct investigations. The decision was reversed following an intervention from Mr Matheson, who told parliament key parties had not been consulted and there was a ""particular concern"" about the impact the chief constable's return could have on those who had made the allegations. Mr Matheson said he had questioned ""clear deficiencies"" in the SPA's decision-making process, causing the body to reverse the move. Mr Flanagan later told a committee of MSPs that Mr Matheson had told him it would be a ""bad decision"" to bring Mr Gormley back. But he insisted he did not feel ""directed"" to halt the chief constable's return. However, Mr Matheson was heavily criticised by Mr Gormley's lawyer David Morgan, who said there was ""no lawful basis"" for his intervention. TheScottish Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, said Mr Gormley had made a ""considerable contribution to policing over his long career."" Its chairwoman, Andrea MacDonald, said: ""It is to his credit that he recognised continued speculation over allegations of misconduct were an ongoing distraction and, in the best interests of policing in Scotland, decided to resign. We wish him well in the future."" TheScottish Conservativescalled on the justice secretary to ""follow the chief constable out of the door"". The party's justice spokesman, Liam Kerr, said: ""Mr Gormley makes clear in his resignation statement that it was the events of November 2017 - when Michael Matheson intervened to prevent his return to work - that made it impossible for him to carry on. ""Michael Matheson may hope that the stink hanging over this affair will clear with Mr Gormley's departure. It won't."" Labour's justice spokesman Daniel Johnsonsaid: ""Police Scotland has been riddled by crisis and controversy for years now, but the case of Phil Gormley descended into utter farce and raised serious questions about ministerial oversight. ""This sorry affair has dragged the reputation of Scottish policing through the mud and must be incredibly demoralising for rank and file officers who put their lives on the line to keep communities safe."" Scottish Greens MSP John Finnie, a former police officer, said Mr Gormley's resignation was in the ""best interests of Police Scotland, the Scottish public and Mr Gormley himself."" Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Renniesaid Mr Gormley's resignation should not lead people to believe all of the problems in Police Scotland were now solved.

Merkel clinches Germany coalition dealAn agreement looks set to end months of wrangling since inconclusive elections in September.19m20 minutes agoEurope,"Angela Merkel's party suffered heavy losses in Germany's election last year Germany is set to emerge from months of political deadlock after Angela Merkel's conservatives (CDU/CSU) finally agreed a coalition deal with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). Negotiators have agreed on the division of key ministries - one of the last hurdles towards forming a government. It could end more than four months of wrangling since inconclusive elections in September. But the deal will still need to be approved by SPD members. Many in the party fear that re-entering a coalition with CDU/CSU could damage it in the long term. In a joint news conference on Wednesday, Chancellor Merkel said the agreement gave the basis for a ""good and stable government"". Germany's marriage of convenience SPD membership spike sparks concern SPD leader Martin Schulz thanked the conservatives for making what he said were tough compromises. In a tweet, he said the deal ""achieved a lot for people"",externaland he would be recommending that his party members accept it. The SPD looks set to control six ministries, including finance and foreign affairs. Mr Schulz has confirmed he will step down as SPD leader in March and instead become foreign minister, if the coalition deal is approved by SPD members. German elections: Merkel's hollow victory Angela Merkel's quiet power He will be replaced as SPD leader by former Labour and Social Affairs Minister Andrea Nahles. Mr Schulz says the deal ""achieves a lot for people"" The SPD's 460,000 members will have the final say on the whole agreement in a postal vote, the result of which will be announced on 2 March. Those opposed to any deal with Mrs Merkel include a new group within the SPD calling itself NoGroKo (no grand coalition). By Damien McGuinness, BBC News, Berlin Handing Germany's centre-left control of finance, foreign and labour policy would have a big impact on the rest of the world, particularly Europe. The promised spending spree on infrastructure and services will likely boost Germany's economy further, and the tax cuts may give an added boost to German consumer spending. A Social Democrat finance ministry - replacing pro-austerity Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble - is more likely to go along with French President Macron's ambitious plans for EU reform, by allowing more German support for struggling eurozone economies. Mr Macron wants to create a common eurozone budget and a eurozone finance minister, but Germany has so far been wary of any move that might lead to what it calls a ""transfer union"" used to prop up indebted governments. An SPD-led finance ministry could be much more amenable to Mr Macron's proposals. And at home these powerful ministries would help the SPD push for key left-wing policies, such as better rights for employees. This video can not be played German post-war politics in two minutes All of this could go down well with SPD party members, who will vote on any final coalition deal. An agreement which looks like a win for the SPD will increase the likelihood that they will vote yes. But if they vote no, then the most likely outcome could be fresh elections. European jitters over German coalition talks What are Macron's economic plans? Mr Schulz at first ruled out going back into government with Mrs Merkel's centre-right CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU. The parties had seen their popularity drop after being in coalition on and off since 2005. He changed his mind when CDU/CSU coalition talks with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens broke down. Both Mr Schulz and Mrs Merkel have been under pressure to see off a challenge by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which became the third biggest party in September's election. This video can not be played How a woman from East Germany became one of the world's most powerful figures Other than distributing ministries, there have been big stumbling blocks in the coalition talks over workers' rights and healthcare. Just how far to the right is AfD? Immigration, Europe, and tax, have also been points of contention. European Union allies, such as France, see Germany as a pillar of stability in the bloc and have been hoping Mrs Merkel succeeds. Top EU officials, including the Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, welcomed the breakthrough on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Elon Musk's Falcon rocket soars to spaceThe world's most powerful rocket successfully lifts clear of its pad on historic maiden flight.9h9 hours agoScience & EnvironmentComments,"This video can not be played SpaceX launches world's most powerful rocket US entrepreneur Elon Musk has launched his new rocket, the Falcon Heavy, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The mammoth vehicle - the most powerful since the shuttle system - lifted clear of its pad without incident to soar high over the Atlantic Ocean. It was billed as a risky test flight in advance of the lift-off. The SpaceX CEO said the challenges of developing the new rocket meant the chances of a successful first outing might be only 50-50. ""I had this image of just a giant explosion on the pad, a wheel bouncing down the road. But fortunately that's not what happened,"" he told reporters after the event. Shock and awe at Falcon Heavy launch With this debut, the Falcon Heavy becomes the most capable launch vehicle available. The aim was to send this car and mannequin towards Mars' orbit It is designed to deliver a maximum payload to low-Earth orbit of 64 tonnes - the equivalent of putting five London double-decker buses in space. Such performance is slightly more than double that of the world's next most powerful rocket, the Delta IV Heavy - but at one third of the cost, says Mr Musk. SpaceX rocket lights 27 engines Musk's Boring Company presents LA tunnel plan 'Approval' for hyperloop from New York to Philadelphia For this experimental and uncertain mission, however, he decided on a much smaller and whimsical payload - his old cherry-red Tesla sports car. A space-suited mannequin was strapped in the driver's seat, and the radio set to play a David Bowie soundtrack on a loop. The Tesla and its passenger have been despatched into an elliptical orbit around the Sun that reaches out as far as the Planet Mars. The Falcon Heavy is essentially three of SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 vehicles strapped together. And, as is the usual practice for SpaceX, all three boost stages - the lower segments of the rocket - returned to Earth to attempt controlled landings. Allow Twitter content?

Two came back to touchdown zones on the Florida coast just south of Kennedy. Their landing legs made contact with the ground virtually at the same time. ""That was epic,"" said Mr Musk. ""That's probably the most exciting thing I've ever seen, literally."" The third booster was due to settle on a drone ship stationed several hundred kilometres out at sea. Unfortunately, it was unable to slow its descent by re-igniting sufficient engines, missed the target vessel and was destroyed as it hit the water at some 500km/h. By then, the upper-stage of the Falcon Heavy, with its Tesla cargo, was heading on a trajectory that would hopefully take it towards Mars' orbit. That required the engine on the upper-stage to fire on three separate occasions, with the third and final ignition only occurring after a long cruise phase - something which was confirmed some six hours after the launch.

This video can not be played A car, a golf ball, a pie... the oddities sent into space over the years. Having such a large and powerful rocket should open up some fascinating new possibilities for Mr Musk and his SpaceX company. These include launching: Much bigger satellites for use by US intelligence and the military. The scale of these satellites is limited by current rocket performance. Large batches of satellites, such as those for Mr Musk's proposed constellation of thousands of spacecraft to deliver broadband across the globe. Bigger, more capable robots to go to the surface of Mars, or to visit the outer planets such as Jupiter and Saturn, and their moons. Huge telescopes. Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, is having to be folded origami-like to fit in its launcher next year. But it is the low cost - brought about through the recovery and reuse of the boosters - that Elon Musk believes will be a game-changer when allied to the new performance. ""It'll be game-over for all other heavy-lift rockets,"" he told reporters on Monday.

Victims allowed to challenge Worboys release,"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi ""Black cab rapist"" John Worboys faced one of his victims in court as an appeal to challenge his release was granted. Worboys, who was jailed for drugging and sexually assaulting passengers, was due to be freed on licence. He appeared at the High Court earlier, where judges heard a judicial review application lodged by two of his victims, one of whom attended court. Worboys was told he would remain in jail until a full hearing on 13 March. He was summoned to appear in person at the Royal Courts of Justice by Sir Brian Leveson after the judge had a ""bad experience"" with a prison video link. Worboys' victims were unaware he would be present, but Sir Brian said it was important there was ""no interruption"" in proceedings. Launch of legal bid against Worboys' release Would London ban be enforceable? Victims told Worboys would serve life-sentence Solicitor Harriet Wistrich said one of the victims, who was in court throughout the hearing, found it ""very, very difficult"" that Worboys was also there. She added: ""She felt it was really necessary to be there and to say she wasn't going to be frightened of him being there, and to challenge his power. ""But obviously it is hard seeing him there in the flesh after all this time."" Ms Wistrich, who is representing both victims behind the judicial review action, said after the hearing: ""We are obviously very pleased that permission has been granted to proceed. ""We are looking forward to being able to understand and scrutinise all the material before the Parole Board, to consider how to bring forward a challenge."" Worboys, 60, was convicted of 19 offences including one count of rape, but is believed to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008. He was given an indefinite jail sentence in 2009, with a minimum term of eight years. This video can not be played 'Fiona', a victim of John Worboys, tells Today police told her in 2003 she wasn't 'believable' On 4 January the Parole Board announced its decision to release Worboyson licence, prompting anger among his victims and in Parliament. Victims' groups and representatives were outraged by news of Worboys' release, saying many victims were not informed before it was made public. However, the government said it would not challenge the Parole Board's decision. Justice Secretary David Gauke said at the time ""it would not be appropriate"" for the government to seek a judicial review, but added that his decision should not stop others from making their own legal challenge. ""Let me be absolutely clear, Worboys will not be released until his victims' representations have been properly considered and his licence conditions are in place."" The legal challenge was described in court as ""unique"" and ""unprecedented"", never before has someone other than a prisoner tried to overturn a Parole Board release decision. The hearing itself was also highly unusual, with John Worboys appearing in person, looking frail, thin and slightly hunched. It's the first time he's been seen in public since he was sentenced in 2009. During the proceedings Sir Brian Leveson spoke to Worboys - referring to him by his new name, Mr Radford - to seek his agreement on the disclosure of documents about his release. Halfway through, a solicitor, who had taken an interest in the case and was in court, agreed to represent the convicted sex offender, assuming he's granted legal aid. What wasn't a surprise about the case was the outcome - it will go to a full hearing next month when the decision to sanction Worboys' release can be scrutinised in detail. The case was brought forward by two of Worboys' victims and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. They are crowdfunding their action and have been pledged more than Â£62,000. Earlier in the hearing, Worboys agreed that the victims and Mr Khan should be allowed to see the Parole Board's reasons for ordering his release. Ben Collins, for the Parole Board, told the court: ""The board does not wish to take any step to prevent a review of the decision and does not propose to stand in the way."" Phillippa Kaufmann QC, representing two of Worboys' victims, said it appeared something had gone ""very wrong"" and the victims were ""concerned not only for themselves but for the wider public and women in particular"". The victims were also concerned that the decision was ""made entirely in secret,"" Ms Kaufmann said. Reacting to the ruling, mayor Sadiq Khan said Worboys' victims and Londoners would be ""relieved"". ""I'm pleased that there will now be an opportunity for thorough scrutiny of this decision by the Parole Board,"" he added.

The gender pay gap,"UK companies with 250 or more employees must publish their gender pay gap data by April 2018. About 9,000 firms will have to calculate their gender pay gap and publish it ona government website,externalby 4 April 2018, or 30 March for the public sector. With big companies revealing their figures,including the BBC, the gender pay gap is a major talking point in offices across the UK. Gender pay gap 'widens for graduates' BBC News explains what you need to know about the gender pay gap, why companies have to report on it and what happens if they don't. The gender pay gap is the percentage difference between average hourly earnings for men and women. Across the UK, men earned 18.4% more than women in April 2017, according to theOffice for National Statistics,external(ONS). This figure is calculated on a 1% sample of employees' jobs. It takes the median average for men and women, which is the level of pay that half of people earn more than, and half earn less than. As the following graph shows, the gap between men and women's earnings for both full and part-time work has fallen from 27.5% in 1997 to 18.4% in 2017. If you only look at full-time workers the pay gap drops to 9.1%. For part-time workers the pay gap favours women, who now earn 5.1% more than men. The pay gap isn't the same as equal pay. Equal pay - that men and women doing the same job should be paid the same - has been a legal requirement for 47 years. Under the Equal Pay Act 1970, and more recently, the Equality Act 2010, it is unlawful to pay people unequally because they are a man or a woman. This applies to all employers, no matter how small. So, a company might have a gender pay gap if a majority of men are in top jobs, despite paying male and female employees the same amount for similar roles. There's no one reason behind the gender pay gap - it's a complex issue. The Fawcett Society,external, a group which campaigns for equality, says caring responsibilities can play a big part. Women often care for young children or elderly relatives. This means women are more likely to work in part-time roles, which are often lower paid or have fewer opportunities for progression. Another important factor is a divided labour market. Women are still more likely to work in lower-paid and lower-skilled jobs. Women currently make up 62% of those earning less than the living wage,according to the Living Wage Foundation,external. Discrimination is another cause of the gender pay gap. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (ECHR)has previously found,externalthat one in nine new mothers were either dismissed, made redundant or treated so poorly they felt they had to leave their job. This can create a gap in experience, leading to lower wages when women return to work. Men also tend to take up the majority of the most senior roles at a company, which are the highest paid. UK companies with 250 or more employees will have to publish their gender pay gap data by April 2018, under a new legal requirement. Public, private and voluntary sector firms are now all required to disclose average pay for men and women, including bonuses. Employers also have the option to include a narrative with their calculations. This would explain the reasons for the results, and give details about actions they are taking to tackle the gender pay gap. Firms must publish a snapshot of their employee pay as at 5 April 2017 if they are a private business or charity, or 31 March 2017 for those in the public sector. All the data will eventually be available on agovernment database,external. Easyjet says its aiming to increase its number of female pilots from 6% to 20% by 2020 At the time of publication, more than 750 firms have revealed their figures - that's out of an estimated 9,000 companies required to submit their data. Insurance company Aviva was one of the first big financial services companies to publish a report on its gender pay gap. Aviva employs 16,000 people in the UK, with a median pay gap of 27.6%. The bonus gap stood at 40.5%. Aviva said the gender pay gap was a result of having fewer women than men in senior roles,in its report,external. Easyjet reported,externalthat women's median hourly pay rates are 45.5% lower than men's. Women earn 38.4% less atVirgin Money,externaland 2.5% less per hour atLadbrokes,external. All three firms say men and women in the same roles are paid equally. At Easyjet, for example, pilots make up more than a quarter of its UK employees. 6% of its UK pilots are women - a role which pays Â£92,400 on average. Lower paid cabin crew, 69% of whom are women, earn an average salary of Â£24,800. The airline said it has set a target that 20% of new entrant pilots should be female by 2020. The Ladbrokes Coral group put its gender pay gap down to ""weak representation"" at senior levels. Virgin Money said it was ""confident"" men and women were paid equally for the same roles. It said it aims to achieve a 50:50 gender balance in its workforce by 2020. Companies can't be punished for a wide gender pay gap. But they might be punished for failing to publish their data, or for publishing inaccurate or misleading figures. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for ensuring employers publish their pay gap figures. TheEHRC set out plans,externalfor its enforcement policy in December. The EHRC says it will approach employers informally at first, but businesses could ultimately face ""unlimited fines and convictions"". As the EHRC is still consulting on these plans, it remains to be seen whether they can or will punish companies in this way. At the moment, there is no enforcement mechanism in the regulations on publishing pay gap data. The UK government says it will also publish sector-specific league tables, highlighting companies failing to address pay differences between men and women.

Pay gap 'widens with age',"The ONS found the gender pay gap was entirely in favour of men in every occupation. The difference between what men and women get paid widens as women get older, new research shows. TheOffice for National Statistics found,externalpay differences were smaller at younger ages, but increased from 40 onwards, reaching a peak between 50 and 59. It also found the gender pay gap was entirely in favour of men in every occupation. The government said it was taking action to address pay discrepancies. The ONS said the increased pay gap for older women could be explained by taking time out, possibly to have children. It added: ""When we modelled the factors that influence pay, the results showed that both men's and women's pay grow for most of their lives. ""Overall, women's pay grows less than men's and also stops growing earlier than men's pay. This applies to both the private and public sectors."" Mind the gender pay gap What is the gender pay gap like where you are? According to the agency, men's pay increased by 10.4% to an average rate of Â£14.48 an hour between 2011 and 2017. That compared with a 12% rise for women to Â£13.16. On average, men were paid Â£1.32 an hour more than women last year, a gap of 9.1%, according to the ONS. It found occupations with the smallest pay gap have almost equal employment levels between men and women. Dawn Butler, shadow minister for women and equalities, said the government was failing to tackle the gender pay gap. ""There is still a lot of progress to be made in terms of gender equality and achieving equal pay is one of them,"" she said. But a government spokesperson said it was committed to eliminating pay discrepancies. ""Action taken by this government means that we are one of the first countries in the world to require all large employers to publish their gender pay gap and bonus data. This is not an option, it is the law."" Gender pay gap revealed at 500 UK firms What is the pay gap like where you are?

What is the pay gap where you are?,"The gap in pay between men and women will take 100 years to close, a campaign group has warned. Campaigners highlight 10 November as the point in 2017 when a woman on an average wage stops being paid relative to their male counterparts. But in some parts of the UK, the gender pay gap is so wide, it is as though women work unpaid from September. Vivienne Hayes, of the Women's Resource Centre, said progress had moved at a ""snail's pace"". Campaign group the Fawcett Society said that progress in closing the pay gap has ""stalled"". If the mean average pay gap for full time workers of 14.1% closes at the rate it has over the last five years, it won't reach 0% until 2117, it said. Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Map built with Carto.Can't see the map?Click here,external The government wants large firms to disclose their pay gap, but will not force them to comply. Ms Hayes, chief executive of charity the Women's Resource Centre, said: ""We are here again, year after year lamenting the seemingly impervious issue of equal pay for men and women. ""Even though we have had a law since 1970 outlawing the practice of sex discrimination in pay, our progress is probably not even at a snail's pace."" There are different ways of calculating the pay gap. For example, for full time workers. the gap based on median hourly earnings has narrowed to its smallest for 20 years, according to theOffice for National Statistics,external, but was still 9.1% in 2017. Taking into account all workers, both full and part time, the median average gap has risen slightly from 18.2% in 2016 to 18.4% this year. In 183 out of 206 local authority areas, men in full time jobs earn more on average than women, but the gap varies from place to place. The top 10 includes the City of London and Tower Hamlets, which contains the financial area Canary Wharf. However, it is not a simple case of the gap being highest in the areas with the most lucrative jobs. Blaenau Gwent in Wales has the highest percentage gap between male and female full-time workers, with the average man on Â£14.07 an hour and average woman on Â£9.54, a difference of 32%. That is equivalent to women not being paid from 4 September. Knowsley in Merseyside, one of the most deprived areas of England, also appears in the top 10. Why is Essex best for top pay? Important moments in the fight for equal pay Does your job pay less than five years ago? Paid less than your colleagues?Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external Roger Smith from the Office for National Statistics said women tend to earn more in areas with a higher rate of people working in the public sector while the age of the workforce also played a part. The Fawcett Society said when higher earning jobs, more commonly held by men, are given more weight the average would mean effectively women stopped being paid from 10 November. Jemima Olchawski, of the society, said: ""One of the biggest gaps is in finance, which is why you'll see the City of London and Tower Hamlets high up. ""There will also be issues around care. Women still make up the vast majority of carers. So we need to see more support for fathers to take time out to be with their children or care for relatives."" Lawyer Linda Wong says financial penalties are needed when firms do not disclose their pay gap Linda Wong, a solicitor with law firm Leigh Day, said: ""The pay gap will persist unless there is commitment and consistency across the board."" The firm has been representing 17,000 former and current employees of Asda and 1,000 Sainsbury's workers in claims for equal pay. An employment tribunal found in 2016 that the Asda women, who mainly worked at check-outs or stacking shelves, could compare themselves to higher paid men working in warehouses. Lawyers said the difference in pay was between Â£1 and Â£3 an hour. Asda strongly disputed the claims and is appealing. It said the demands of the jobs were different. ""Pay rates in stores differ from pay rates in distribution centres for legitimate reasons, including the different market rates for different jobs in different sectors,"" a spokeswoman said. Chris Evans and Claudia Winkleman are the BBC's highest paid male and female stars The gender pay gap at the BBC has also been exposed with men found to beearning an average of 9.3%more than women. However, Director General Tony Hall said it showed the BBC was ""in a better place than many organisations"" where the gap is higher. Female presenters have demanded ""real change"" by the end of 2017 after it was revealed two-thirds of stars on more than Â£150,000 a year were men. Analysis by Robert Cuffe, BBC News Head of Statistics If official figures say the gap is 9% and campaigners say it's 14%, is someone using a dodgy number? Not necessarily. Both figures come from theOffice for National Statistics,external. They use different averages. The 9% figure uses the middle (median) number. The 14% figure uses the mean average. The mean can be pushed up by very a small number of high values. If Bill Gates walks into your local pub, the mean wealth there will shoot up by millions, but the median won't change much. The ONS prefer 9% for that reason but campaigners say that the average should reflect the gaps across all of society. Whether equal pay day lands on 10 November (mean), 27 November (median) or on a different day in your area, this analysis shows that there are few places in the UK where it lands on 31 December. There were 23 areas of the UK where women's average pay was greater than men's. This included Middlesbrough and Stoke-on-Trent, which have a high proportion of people out of work due to unemployment, sickness, disability or caring duties. However, they also included areas like Bexley, Havering and Sutton, which have low levels of unemployment. Across the UK, the average full-time male chief executive or senior official earns Â£48.53 an hour, or Â£93,960 a year. A woman in a similar role earns an average of Â£36.54 an hour, or Â£70,000 a year. The UK ranks 20th out of 144 countries around the world for closing the gender pay gap, but no country has absolute equality. In Iceland, which is ranked the best by the World Economic Forum, women walked out of their workplaces at 14:38 on 24 October 2016 in protest at the gap. According to unions, this was the time of day that women began working unpaid relative to men. Minister of state for apprenticeships, skills and women Anne Milton said the government had introduced a legal requirement for all large employers to publish their gender pay and bonus data by April 2018. ""By shining a light on where there are gaps, they can take action to address it,"" she saidâ. ""There are no excuses, employers now need to get on with the job of publishing their pay gap and pledge to improve workplace equality."" Female workers won an equal pay claim against Birmingham City Council Women who worked for decades for Birmingham City Council celebrated when they were told they had won their battle for equal pay, but were angry it had ever had to go to court. In 2012 the Supreme Court ruled the council would have to pay claims brought by former employees who earned less than male counterparts. The following year the council agreed to settle 11,000 claims. Pam Saunders spent almost 30 years with the authority and worked as a mobile home care assistant, helping people to wash, do their shopping and housework. She told the BBC in 2012: ""At the end of the day we did work hard for them. We really, really did and so why shouldn't they have paid us the right amount in the beginning?"" The BBC England Data Unit used the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings published by the Office for National Statistics and analysed the full time hourly median earnings, excluding overtime, for male and female workers in each local authority area to get the percentage gap between their earnings. We then calculated the dates on which the average female worker in each area effectively stops being paid, relative to male workers, because of the gap in their earnings.

"Over 1 in 4 UK dinners are vegetarianA 'sustained interest' in vegan and meat-free diets is driving the change, industry analysts say.","More than a quarter of all evening meals in the UK are vegan or vegetarian, research shows. In the 12 weeks to the end of January, 29% of them contained no meat or fish, according to Kantar Worldpanel. Trends like Veganuary  (going vegan for January) and ""sustained interest"" in meat-free diets are affecting habits, the market researcher said. Meanwhile, Yorkshire-based meat substitute company Quorn Foods saw global sales rise by 16% last year. The research - collected from a consumer panel of 30,000 households - reflects a year-on-year move to more vegetarian meals (26.9% of evening meals were vegetarian in 2014 and 27.8% in 2016). Through January, one in 10 shoppers bought a meat-free ready meal, boosting sales by 15% compared to this time last year. Sales of vegetables, such as spinach and aubergine, are also up 43% and 23% respectively, compared to the last 12 months. Veganuary 'helps boost vegan numbers in the UK' Marks & Spencer to stop selling 'cauliflower steak' Bake Off's Ruby Tandoh: How sharing food helps my mental health Make Me a Vegan: The big challenge Tesco is one of a growing number of retailers and high street chainslooking to cater forthe growing appetite for veganism, with new product ranges. But both the supermarket's dairy and its produce lines - fruit and vegetables - saw the greatest sales growth, according to Kantar. ""Around the world we are seeing a significant increase in meat-reduction diets, including both flexitarianism and veganism,"" said Quorn Foods CEO, Kevin Brennan. The company ferments a fungus to produce Mycoprotein. This is used in all Quorn products from meat-free chicken and mince to burgers and fishless fingers. But the rise in plant-based food hasn't affected the British meat industry as much as some would expect. In fact, the Agriculture & Horticulture Development Board (AHDB) says in the short term, meat sales are increasing. In another report, Kantar'sanalysis,externalshows that 0.9% more meat and poultry and 2.9% more processed meat and poultry (like bacon and sausages) was bought over the 2017 festive period than the previous Christmas. While the AHDB - funded by farmers and growers - recognises the growth of flexitarians - who are reducing their meat consumption overall - it says most people are still enjoying meat dishes at the weekend or replacing red meat with fish or chicken. In the long term, it said, meat-eating has slowed, but just 0.2% of meat and fish buyers stopped doing so last year.

Elon Musk's Falcon rocket soars to space,"This video can not be played SpaceX launches world's most powerful rocket US entrepreneur Elon Musk has launched his new rocket, the Falcon Heavy, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The mammoth vehicle - the most powerful since the shuttle system - lifted clear of its pad without incident to soar high over the Atlantic Ocean. It was billed as a risky test flight in advance of the lift-off. The SpaceX CEO said the challenges of developing the new rocket meant the chances of a successful first outing might be only 50-50. ""I had this image of just a giant explosion on the pad, a wheel bouncing down the road. But fortunately that's not what happened,"" he told reporters after the event. Shock and awe at Falcon Heavy launch With this debut, the Falcon Heavy becomes the most capable launch vehicle available. The aim was to send this car and mannequin towards Mars' orbit It is designed to deliver a maximum payload to low-Earth orbit of 64 tonnes - the equivalent of putting five London double-decker buses in space. Such performance is slightly more than double that of the world's next most powerful rocket, the Delta IV Heavy - but at one third of the cost, says Mr Musk. SpaceX rocket lights 27 engines Musk's Boring Company presents LA tunnel plan 'Approval' for hyperloop from New York to Philadelphia For this experimental and uncertain mission, however, he decided on a much smaller and whimsical payload - his old cherry-red Tesla sports car. A space-suited mannequin was strapped in the driver's seat, and the radio set to play a David Bowie soundtrack on a loop. The Tesla and its passenger have been despatched into an elliptical orbit around the Sun that reaches out as far as the Planet Mars. The Falcon Heavy is essentially three of SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 vehicles strapped together. And, as is the usual practice for SpaceX, all three boost stages - the lower segments of the rocket - returned to Earth to attempt controlled landings. Allow Twitter content?

Two came back to touchdown zones on the Florida coast just south of Kennedy. Their landing legs made contact with the ground virtually at the same time. ""That was epic,"" said Mr Musk. ""That's probably the most exciting thing I've ever seen, literally."" The third booster was due to settle on a drone ship stationed several hundred kilometres out at sea. Unfortunately, it was unable to slow its descent by re-igniting sufficient engines, missed the target vessel and was destroyed as it hit the water at some 500km/h. By then, the upper-stage of the Falcon Heavy, with its Tesla cargo, was heading on a trajectory that would hopefully take it towards Mars' orbit. That required the engine on the upper-stage to fire on three separate occasions, with the third and final ignition only occurring after a long cruise phase - something which was confirmed some six hours after the launch.

This video can not be played A car, a golf ball, a pie... the oddities sent into space over the years. Having such a large and powerful rocket should open up some fascinating new possibilities for Mr Musk and his SpaceX company. These include launching: Much bigger satellites for use by US intelligence and the military. The scale of these satellites is limited by current rocket performance. Large batches of satellites, such as those for Mr Musk's proposed constellation of thousands of spacecraft to deliver broadband across the globe. Bigger, more capable robots to go to the surface of Mars, or to visit the outer planets such as Jupiter and Saturn, and their moons. Huge telescopes. Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, is having to be folded origami-like to fit in its launcher next year. But it is the low cost - brought about through the recovery and reuse of the boosters - that Elon Musk believes will be a game-changer when allied to the new performance. ""It'll be game-over for all other heavy-lift rockets,"" he told reporters on Monday. ""It'll be like trying to sell an aircraft where one aircraft company has a reusable aircraft and all the other companies had aircraft that were single-use where you would parachute out at your destination and the plane would crash-land randomly somewhere. Crazy as that sounds - that's how the rocket business works.""

"Poundland 'naughty' elf ad 'irresponsible'The social media campaign, which featured sexual references, breached the ASA code of practice.13h13 hours agoTechnology","Poundland has been told that the ads must not appear again in their current form A Poundland ad campaign that featured innuendo and depictions of sexual acts has been deemed ""irresponsible"" by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The pre-Christmas social media posts featured a ""naughty"" toy elf and were published on Twitter and Facebook. One image featured the elf holding a tea bag in a suggestive pose with a plastic doll. The ASA ruled that this and eight other images breached itscode of practice for advertisers.,external The regulator pointed out that the images were available on ""ungated"" websites and therefore viewable by anyone, including children. Some of the posts may also have been seen as demeaning to women, the ASA added. Poundland's initial response to the complaints had been to state that the elf campaign was based on humour and double entendres, according to the ASA. The retailer also pointed out that Twitter and Facebook had policies that were designed to prevent under-13s from creating accounts on the websites. It also said that a Twitter poll of 12,000 respondents was 82% in favour of the campaign. ""They stated a large number of people found the campaign to be humorous, engaging, and in line with what it meant to be British,"" the ASA said. Poundland's naughty elf was so naughty that it attracted the censure of the Advertising Standards Authority However, the regulator decided against the retailer in the end. It said that because the ads had been shared widely on social media, they therefore would have been seen by ""a large number of people, including some children"" who did not actively follow the Poundland accounts. A 2017 Ofcom report,externalfound that nearly a quarter of eight to 11-year-olds now had a presence on social media sites. The ads were ""irresponsible and likely to cause serious or widespread offence"", said the ASA, which also revealed it had received 85 complaints about the Poundland campaign. In December,Poundland removed a box of Twinings tea bagsfrom one of the ads after the tea maker complained that the picture ""misuses our product"". At the time, Poundland's marketing director Mark Pym said, ""We're proud of a campaign that's only cost Â£25.53 and is being touted as the winning marketing campaign this Christmas!"" Poundland has been told that the images concerned must not appear again in their current form. Other new ASA rulings include: a ban of a Tunnock's Tea Cakes campaign that featured a female tennis player holding one of the cakes against her thigh. The watchdog said that combining the image with the phrase ""serve up a treat"" had objectified women and was socially irresponsible clearing Ryanair to describe itself as Europe's number one airline. There had been complaints that the claim was misleading in light of thousands of flight cancellations in 2017. But the ASA accepted that travel data for 2016 - the industry's most recent figures - showed Ryanair carrying more passengers than any other European airline Poundland's 'Naughty Elf' ad drops Twinings Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Rapist Worboys appears in court,"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women in his taxi ""Black cab rapist"" John Worboys faced one of his victims in court as an appeal to challenge his release was granted. Worboys, who was jailed for drugging and sexually assaulting passengers, was due to be freed on licence. He appeared at the High Court earlier, where judges heard a judicial review application lodged by two of his victims, one of whom attended court. Worboys was told he would remain in jail until a full hearing on 13 March. He was summoned to appear in person at the Royal Courts of Justice by Sir Brian Leveson after the judge had a ""bad experience"" with a prison video link. Worboys' victims were unaware he would be present, but Sir Brian said it was important there was ""no interruption"" in proceedings. Launch of legal bid against Worboys' release Would London ban be enforceable? Victims told Worboys would serve life-sentence Solicitor Harriet Wistrich said one of the victims, who was in court throughout the hearing, found it ""very, very difficult"" that Worboys was also there. She added: ""She felt it was really necessary to be there and to say she wasn't going to be frightened of him being there, and to challenge his power. ""But obviously it is hard seeing him there in the flesh after all this time."" Ms Wistrich, who is representing both victims behind the judicial review action, said after the hearing: ""We are obviously very pleased that permission has been granted to proceed. ""We are looking forward to being able to understand and scrutinise all the material before the Parole Board, to consider how to bring forward a challenge."" Worboys, 60, was convicted of 19 offences including one count of rape, but is believed to have carried out more than 100 rapes and sexual assaults on women in London between 2002 and 2008. He was given an indefinite jail sentence in 2009, with a minimum term of eight years. This video can not be played 'Fiona', a victim of John Worboys, tells Today police told her in 2003 she wasn't 'believable' On 4 January the Parole Board announced its decision to release Worboyson licence, prompting anger among his victims and in Parliament. Victims' groups and representatives were outraged by news of Worboys' release, saying many victims were not informed before it was made public. However, the government said it would not challenge the Parole Board's decision. Justice Secretary David Gauke said at the time ""it would not be appropriate"" for the government to seek a judicial review, but added that his decision should not stop others from making their own legal challenge. ""Let me be absolutely clear, Worboys will not be released until his victims' representations have been properly considered and his licence conditions are in place."" The legal challenge was described in court as ""unique"" and ""unprecedented"", never before has someone other than a prisoner tried to overturn a Parole Board release decision. The hearing itself was also highly unusual, with John Worboys appearing in person, looking frail, thin and slightly hunched. It's the first time he's been seen in public since he was sentenced in 2009. During the proceedings Sir Brian Leveson spoke to Worboys - referring to him by his new name, Mr Radford - to seek his agreement on the disclosure of documents about his release. Halfway through, a solicitor, who had taken an interest in the case and was in court, agreed to represent the convicted sex offender, assuming he's granted legal aid. What wasn't a surprise about the case was the outcome - it will go to a full hearing next month when the decision to sanction Worboys' release can be scrutinised in detail. The case was brought forward by two of Worboys' victims and the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan. They are crowdfunding their action and have been pledged more than Â£62,000. Earlier in the hearing, Worboys agreed that the victims and Mr Khan should be allowed to see the Parole Board's reasons for ordering his release. Ben Collins, for the Parole Board, told the court: ""The board does not wish to take any step to prevent a review of the decision and does not propose to stand in the way."" Phillippa Kaufmann QC, representing two of Worboys' victims, said it appeared something had gone ""very wrong"" and the victims were ""concerned not only for themselves but for the wider public and women in particular"". The victims were also concerned that the decision was ""made entirely in secret,"" Ms Kaufmann said. Reacting to the ruling, mayor Sadiq Khan said Worboys' victims and Londoners would be ""relieved"". ""I'm pleased that there will now be an opportunity for thorough scrutiny of this decision by the Parole Board,"" he added.

House of CommonsParliament That's where we leave our live coverage from Westminster for today. MPs also have a half-term break next week and will be back on Tuesday 20 February. Judicial oversight of the European Arrest Warrant House of LordsParliament Lord Jay of Ewelme, the crossbench peer who chairs the EU Home Affairs Sub-committee, has the final word in the debate. He says future judicial oversight over the European Arrest Warrant in the UK after Brexit currently looks like an ""intractable problem"" which he expects the House to come back to in the future. The end of the debate brings today's session in the Lords to an end. It's a half-term break for peers next week. The House will meet again on Tuesday 20 February at 2:30pm. Community banks debate House of CommonsParliament Economic Secretary to the Treasury John Glen says this debate has rightly ""aroused a lot of passion"" and the banks will need to respond to what they've heard. ""We have heard the case for banks to remain open,"" Mr Glen says. ""Ultimately, the government can't reverse market movements or changes in customer behaviour,"" he adds. Judicial oversight of the European Arrest Warrant House of LordsParliament Government spokesman Lord Young of Cookham says that ""dispute resolution"" is required for close co-operation on arrests and extradition after Brexit. It is ""in the interests of both sides"" to reach an agreement, he tells the House, adding that dispute resolution methods are a common part of deals between the EU and non-EU states. The UK will bring ""direct jurisdiction"" of the European Court of Justice to an end, he insists. Community banks debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow Business Minister Bill Esterson says 11% of the population, who are ""typically older and poorer"" rely on using local bank branches. Mr Esterson says the closure of these branches highlights ""financial exclusion"" in action across the country. The closure of bank branches is felt at a ""personal and business level"", he adds. Community banks debate House of CommonsParliament SNP consumer affairs spokesperson Patricia Gibson rounds up the debate for her party. Ms Gibson says banks ""reprieved"" from closure, following ""negotiations with the SNP leadership"" are welcomed but do not go far enough. RBS is to keep 10 closure-threatened branches open until at least the end of the year. The UK government has ""not lifted a single finger"" to help prevent the closure programme, she tells the House. Judicial oversight of the European Arrest Warrant House of LordsParliament ""Only a court can appropriately review decisions relating to the liberty of an individual,"" says shadow foreign affairs spokesman Lord Collins of Highbury. A ""no-deal Brexit"" would make continued co-operation ""much harder"", the Labour peer argues. He declares that Labour would allow ""continued co-operation"" with the European Court of Justice. ""This system works,"" he adds. ""The government has imposed a red line that simply won't work."" Judicial oversight of the European Arrest Warrant House of LordsParliament Lord Marks of Henley-on-Thames, who is replying to the debate for the Liberal Democrats, proposes that judicial oversight of the arrest warrant could be done by a parallel court. This could be ""effectively a division"" of the European Court of Justice but with a British judge, he argues. He says the government is being influences by Brexit ""ideologues"" and tells ministers: ""In the interests of partnership... please stop posturing."" Community banks debate Allow Twitter content?

Judicial oversight of the European Arrest Warrant House of LordsParliament Labour peer Baroness Kennedy of the Shaws thinks that the government's decision to have a ""red line"" of leaving the European Court of Justice was ""absolute folly"". The court ""is the best arbiter"", she argues. Judicial oversight of the European Arrest Warrant House of LordsParliament Over in the House of Lords, peers are debating a report from the European Union Committee on Brexit and judicial
oversight of the
European Arrest
Warrant (EAW). The arrest warrant operates in all EU member states and replaced separate extradition arrangements. Thereport,externalnotes that the government has said it wants to remain party to the EAW scheme but that it also ""intends to remove the jurisdiction of the European Court of
Justice (CJEU) in the UK"" after leaving the EU. The committee suggests a possible solution ""might be to follow the precedent set
by Norway and Iceland and seek a bilateral extradition agreement
with the EU that mirrors the EAWâs provisions as far as possible"". If no agreement is reached, ""falling back on the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition
would significantly slow down extradition proceedings"", the report says. The public and government have worried over the seemingly remorseless decline in the number of bank branches in high streets and rural areas for at least 30 years. The forces driving closure programmes are varied but financial innovation, a fall in the use of cheques as a payment means and increased use of electronic payment services have all played their part. The impact of the financial crisis and the new regulatory costs bearing down on profits have made banks look again at the viability of their branch networks. Last year, RBSrevealed plans to close 62 Scottish branches, including some in remote and rural communities. The full closure plans, which also involved 197 NatWest branches, were attacked by politicians and local authorities. Community banks debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP William Wragg says it's likely that all MPs taking part in the debate ""have an interest from their own constituencies"". Mr Wragg claims that 10,000 bank branches have closed in the last 25 years - ""over half of all of them"". It is ""right to embrace technological change"" but many customers prefer ""face-to-face service"" and the chance to talk to people, he says. Mr Wragg adds that banks offer ""personal relationships"" with customers which is ""particularly important for elderly and vulnerable people"". Community banks debate House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Ruth Smeeth opens her debate on community banks, saying that local bank closures ""rip the heart"" out of towns. The motion says such banks are of ""vital importance"" and expresses concern about the effect
of branch closure announcements by Lloyds Bank, RBS/NatWest and Santander. The motion, tabled by Ms Smeeth along with Conservative MP William Wragg, calls on the government to support
measures to protect access to banking services in local communities in the UK. The UK's four big High Street banks closed, or announced plans to shut, a total of 948 branches during 2017. Environmental Audit Committee report House of CommonsParliament Labour's Mary Creagh, chair of the Environmental Audit Committee, is introducing areport by her committee,externalon the Ministry of Justice's environmental footprint. The report found the Ministry is ""failing to meet many of its own unambitious targets"" and called for it to make new commitments as soon as possible. The committee also recommended the government should review the oversight and governance arrangements of contractorsâ performance. Ms Creagh tells MPs there is a ""certain irony"" that the department tasked with upholding the law is failing to meet its own guidance. State pension age statement House of CommonsParliament Plaid Cymru's Jonathan Edward asks for the reasons behind the ""arbritary"" 31st March deadline this year for those wishing to make a complaint to the DWP about lack of notice of the pension age changes. Mr Opperman says he can't give a ""precise answer"" to that, but assures Mr Edwards he will write to him. State pension age statement House of CommonsParliament Labour's Carolyn Harris calls on the minister to meet her and Conservative MP Tim Loughton for further discussions and to ""acknowledge the problem and come up with a respectful answer"". Minister Guy Opperman says the matter has ""been debated since 1995"" and successive governments have taken a similar line. Liberal Democrat work and pensions spokesman Stephen Lloyd says the Conservatives and Labour did little in government to address the problem. Mr Opperman reminds him that he supported the Conservatives in coalition government to pass the Pensions Act in 2011 when, according to the minister, the Lib Dems supported fiscal discipline. Amongst other measures, the Pensions Act 2011 accelerated an existing timetable for increasing the state pension age to 66. It isdue to increase,externalto 68 between 2037 and 2039. State pension age statement House of CommonsParliament SNP MP Patrick Grady says there is ""clearly majority in this house"" in support of women born in 1950s. Instead of ""bluster and ""passing the buck"" the government should improving arrangements for women who have been ""adversely effected"" by changes to the state pension age, he says. It's time for the UK government to ""pay out"", he adds. Minister Guy Opperman says if an individual is of working age then they can be ""addressed with assistance"" by the Scottish Government - citing the words of Scottish Social Security Minister Jeane Freeman MSP.

Kim sister to make landmark S Korea trip,"Kim Yo-jong in a 2015 picture of her brother touring a military unit The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is to attend the Winter Olympic Games which open in Pyeongchang in the South on Friday, ministers in Seoul say. Kim Yo-jong, a senior Workers' Party official promoted to the politburo last year, will be the first immediate Kim family member to cross the border. Both Koreas will march under one flag at the opening ceremony. The North's participation has been seen as a thawing of bilateral ties. Leader's sister takes 'real power' south North Korea crisis in 300 words However, the US, Japan and others have accused the North of using the Games for propaganda purposes. Believed to have been born in 1987, she is the youngest daughter of late leader Kim Jong-il and is Kim Jong-un's full sister. She is about four years younger than her brother and is said to be very close to him. Keeping up with the Kims: North Korea's elusive first family Kim Jong-un's sister Yo-jong waits in the wings She is reportedly married to the son of Choe Ryong-hae, the powerful party secretary. Kim Yo-jong at the opening of a residential complex in Pyongyang in 2017 Kim Yo-jong has been in the spotlight sporadically in recent years, with her main job being to protect her brother's image via her role in the party's propaganda department. She remains blacklisted by the US over alleged links to human rights abuses in North Korea. Analysis: BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul This is a huge surprise. There had been speculation Kim Yo-jong might be part of the delegation but few thought it would actually happen. It is being seen as a sign that Kim Jong-un is serious about improving ties with South Korea. Kim Yo-jong is one of Kim Jong-un's closest aides and some are speculating that she might be bringing a message from her brother. But there could be a number of obstacles to overcome if she is to make it to Pyeongchang. She is targeted by US sanctions for alleged human rights abuses, although she is not on the UN Security Council travel blacklist. There is also the question of how she will get to the Games. Seoul has had to request special permission from the US and others in the international community to allow North Korean athletes and performers to travel south by bus and ferry. They may have to do so again and this time it will be for a member of Kim Jong-un's own family. It would be the first by a direct member of the Kim dynasty. Chang Song-thaek, Kim Jong-un's uncle and brother in law of Kim Jong-il, did travel to the South but did not belong to the Baekdu blood line, which is considered significant. There is speculation in the South that this is part of Kim Yo-jong's grooming for greater power, and that she could be bringing a letter from her brother to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who she is likely to meet. It is unclear whether Kim Yo-jong will be at the opening ceremony on Friday. Inside the world's most secretive country Politically, four figures, including Kim Yo-jong, are key. The others are: Kim Yong-nam. North Korea's ceremonial head of state, the president of its parliament. The diplomatically sure-footed 90-year-old has seen the rule of all three North Korean leaders and has travelled overseas before Ri Son-gwon. The head of the North Korean state agency in charge of inter-Korean affairs. A veteran negotiator, he was North Korea's chief delegate at the rare inter-Korean talks held in January Choe Hwi. Vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party and chairman of the National Sports Guidance Committee. Under US state department sanctions It's a 280-strong delegation, most of whom arrived in the South on Wednesday. Led by North Korean Sports Minister Kim Il-guk, it includes 229 cheerleaders, four officials from the National Olympic Committee, 26 taekwondo demonstrators and 21 journalists. This video can not be played North Korean cheerleaders arrive in the South for the Games The team arrived via a western border at 09:28 local time (00:26 GMT), the Yonhap news agency reported. North Korea at the Winter Olympics: All you need to know North Korea: A sporting history of bombs and diplomacy Only 10 athletes will compete for the North at the Games, along with another 12 as part of a unified Korean women's ice hockey team. Michael Madden, North Korea leadership expert In announcing its delegates both to the 2018 Winter Olympics and the inter-Korean culture events on the sidelines, Pyongyang let out the information in a slow drip. Part of this is Pyongyang maximising the positive PR effects. The announcement of the full delegation came following the arrival of its athletes to the Games late last week, and one day after 10 musicians arrived in South Korea. So now North Korea has earned itself a third day of positive media coverage about its participation in the Olympics. The US is scornful of the North's motives over the Olympics and is sending Vice-President Mike Pence to the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang to counter what it terms propaganda. Both the US and Japan have been critical of the North's Olympics policy ""We're travelling to the Olympics to make sure that North Korea doesn't use the powerful symbolism in the backdrop of the Winter Olympics to paper over the truth about their regime,"" he said. He was in Tokyo on Wednesday and maintained the pressure, announcing that ""the United States will soon unveil the toughest and most aggressive round of economic sanctions on North Korea"". Japan has been equally sceptical. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said: ""We must not be fooled by North Korea's 'smile diplomacy'."" North Korea currently faces growing international pressure and sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes. Its latest ballistic missile test, on 28 November, sparked a new series of measures from the UN, targeting petrol shipments and travel for North Koreans, and a war of words between the North and US President Donald Trump. Kim Jong-un then extended a New Year's olive branch to the South over participation in the Olympics, which run from 9 to 25 February. The perceived warming of ties has not been without difficulties, not least the North's decision to move a military parade in Pyongyang from April to the day before the opening of the Games.

UK 'could adopt' Norway recycling system,"This video can not be played How Norway's bottle recycling scheme works A Scandinavian deposit-based system for recycling bottles is thought likely to be adopted in the UK. Advisers to government say the schemes have massively reduced plastic litter in the environment and seas. And a ministerial delegation has been to Norway to see if the UK should copy an industry-led scheme that recycles 97% of bottles. In the UK, figures show that only around half of all plastic bottles get recycled. Norway claims to offer the most cost-efficient way of tackling plastic litter. Plastic recycling: Your questions answered Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem UK faces build-up of plastic waste Curb 'devastating' plastic waste, MPs say The Norwegian government decided the best method would be to put a tax on every bottle that's not recycled - then leave the operating details of the scheme up to business. It works like this: The consumer pays a deposit on every bottle - the equivalent of 10p to 25p depending on size. They return it empty and post it into a machine which reads the barcode and produces a coupon for the deposit. If the careless consumer has left liquid in the bottle, the machine eats it anyway - but hands the deposit to the shopkeeper who'll need to empty the bottle. Similar schemes are in operation in other Nordic nations, Germany, and some states in the US and Canada. The managers of the Norway operation say it could easily be applied to the UK. In Norway, the deposit-return machine accepts only two types of plastic bottle, with approved labels and even approved glue to fix the labels. This allows the labels to be stripped easily, and simplifies recycling. In the UK, roadside collection of plastic bottles in Britain are bedevilled by contamination from rogue rubbish being put in the recycling container. Kjell Olav Maldum, chief executive of Infinitum which runs the Norway bottle scheme, told BBC News: ""There are other recycling schemes, but we believe ours is the most cost-efficient. ""We think it could be copied in the UK - or anywhere. ""Our principle is that if drinks firms can get bottles to shops to sell their products, they can also collect those same bottles."" Some would like to see a Norwegian-style scheme adopted in the UK Scotland has already committed to a deposit return scheme, without details so far. But politicians in Westminster have been more cautious amid lobbying by drinks manufacturers and fears from small shops about the administrative burden. In Norway, small shopkeepers are said to generally favour the deposit return system. They get paid a small fee for each bottle, and are also said to benefit from increased footfall from people returning bottles. Sajana Pariyar, who works at the Joker minimarket in central Oslo told me: ""It's a good thing. People return the bottle and with the money they get from it they buy things from us. ""It increases the number of people in our shops. It's good for business."" When we visited her store, a homeless man patiently fed a sack-full of bottles and cans into the mouth of the machine. He'd collected the containers from a nearby office, and raised Â£5 in the process. Food may influence cancer spread Graduate loses bid to sue Oxford over 2:1 degree Trudeau faces PC 'peoplekind' backlash But even in recycling-conscious Norway, some people still transgress. The worst offenders are youngsters quaffing energy drinks on the run to school. So some schools have now installed bottle collecting racks at the school gates to avoid plastic bottles going into general rubbish bins. The most virtuous consumers are older beer drinkers who can stash their cans at home before returning them later. Just 3% of Norway's plastic bottles elude the deposit return scheme, but even so the absolute numbers are high. This video can not be played Is it hygienic to reuse your plastic water bottle? Terje Skovly works at a municipal recycling scheme, ROAF, which collects the bins from 70,000 homes on the outskirts of Oslo. At his plant - a 3-D maze of conveyors and ramps - a steady stream of plastic bottles is isolated from other waste by infrared recognition. These bottles have been mixed with other waste during collection so they can't be used again for food grade packaging. They get down-graded into plastic furniture instead. ""I get angry when I see that,"" he told me as he glared at the bottle conveyor below us. ""Why are people so lazy that they can't be bothered to recycle a bottle? We should increase the deposit to 50p on a large bottle."" What was the value in lost deposits? I asked. He made a rough calculationâ¦ just under a million dollars. A year. With that amount of cash swilling around the scheme in spare change, it's little wonder that representatives of other nations are considering the advantages of going Norwegian. But even Norway's ultra-efficient recycling system can't compete with virgin plastic on cost. The problem, the recyclers say, is that the ingredients of plastic - oil and gas - are simply too cheap. The cost of each bottle is subsidised by a few pence by the manufacturer. This ultimately gets passed to the consumer. The operators of the scheme argue that it's more appropriate for people buying drinks to pay for them to be recycled, rather than have taxpayers foot the bill for cleaning up litter on beaches. The UK government's working party studying plastic waste will mention Norway as an example of a system working well. Members are also intrigued by the example of Lithuania, which is said to have achieved a 93% return rate in just three years. Samantha Harding, from the countryside group CPRE, has been campaigning against plastic litter for more than a decade. She told BBC News: ""It frustrates me when people say 'oh, they only recycle because they're Scandinavianâ¦ in the UK we're different.' ""Well, they're doing it in Germany too - and states in the US and Canada. Are they all the same, so are we different from all of them? ""The key is to get an economic incentive - put a deposit on the bottle and most people won't throw money away."" She applauded the Norwegian system of putting racks round bins in public places for discarded plastic bottles. ""People say they don't want to see homeless people rummaging through bins to get the deposit back on bottlesâ¦ why don't we make it easy for them?"" Ms Harding said one great advantage of deposit return schemes is that it obliges each part of the plastic chain to change their behaviour - from product concept to design; to manufacture; transport; use; and finally disposal. ""This is great because we've seen big firms campaigning against good schemes because it forced them to take more responsibility. We're in a crisis now - there's no room for that sort of thing,"" she said.

Worboys victims communications 'poor',"John Worboys was convicted of 19 offences in 2009 Victims of serial sex attacker John Worboys learned about his release from prison from the media, a review found. Many victims were ""shocked and distressed"" to seethe Parole Board's decisionin news headlines, Chief Inspector of Probation Dame Glenys Stacey's paper said. Her comments come as part of a review requested by the government into the ""victim contact scheme"". Two victims are set to begin a High Court battle against releasing Worboys. Dame Glenys's paper,externalsaid ""poor"" correspondence included letters with errors in the women's names and addresses. She said the National Probation Scheme (NPS) ""generally complied with the scheme provisions"", but that these mistakes suggested ""a lack of care or concern"". Worboys moved back to prison outside London Rapist release will not be challenged by government ""Those women not in contact with the scheme - the majority - learnt of the decision through the media. All who spoke to us described their shock and distress,"" she added. ""They had not felt prepared for this outcome."" Worboys, 60, was convicted of 19 offences in 2009. He drugged his female victims before attacking them in his black cab. This video can not be played Justice Secretary David Gauke says there will not be a judicial review Before Worboys's parole hearing, the NPS attempted to contact women who had not opted into the victim contact scheme. But there was not enough time before the hearing for them to receive or absorb the letters, the report said. ""What is more, the style and content of the letters lacked clarity and urgency,"" it added. ""One woman who had engaged with the scheme from the start did make a Victim Personal Statement to the Parole Board. ""Others who we interviewed were adamant that they would have wanted to do so, had they had the opportunity."" The VCS, run by the NPS, supports victims of violent or sexual crimes where the defendant is sentenced to at least a year in prison or has been detained under the Mental Health Act. After defendants are convicted, victims are asked if they want to opt into the scheme. If they do, they are given a Victim Liaison Officer (VLO) who keeps them informed about the offender. Updates might include a release date, licence conditions, or if the convict is moved to an open prison. Through the scheme victims are also able to make representations about an offender's release arrangements. Dame Glenys' report found liaison between the VLO and John Worboys' offender manager was ""poor"". Justice Secretary David Gauke said the report would help the government ""review parole transparency and victim contact"". He said he was reassured that correct procedures were followed but that ""we can do much better"". ""We have already changed the letters we send to victims to make them more compassionate, clearer and more informative, but there is more to do,"" he added.

Trump plans 'to top' France's military parade,"This video can not be played What makes a military parade? Here's how other countries do it US President Donald Trump has asked the Pentagon to organise a large military parade in the nation's capital. The president made the request of top military chiefs in late January, after reportedly being impressed by a French Bastille Day parade last year. ""It was one of the greatest parades I've ever seen,"" he later said. ""We're going to have to try and top it."" Democrats compared the plan to displays of military might organised by autocratic nations. The plan was first revealed by the Washington Post, before being confirmed by the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders. This video can not be played Fallen soldier's mum recalls looking for her son's face among marching soldiers ""President Trump is incredibly supportive of America's great service members who risk their lives every day to keep our country safe,"" she said. ""He has asked the Department of Defense to explore a celebration at which all Americans can show their appreciation."" Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday that the Pentagon was drawing up potential plans for the parade and would send them to the White House for approval. When asked why President Trump wanted such a parade, Mr Mattis said it demonstrated the ""president's affection and respect for the military"". This video can not be played Raining on Trump's (would be) parade ""We've been putting together some options,"" he told White House reporters. ""We'll send them up to the White House for decision."" Military displays in Washington DC are usually only used to mark victory at the end of a war. US media linked the plan toMr Trump's admiration for a military parade he attended in Paris in July last year. The occasion, marking 100 years since America entered World War One, saw troops march down the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es, accompanied by dozens of military vehicles, flyovers of military aircraft, and traditional mounted cavalry. This video can not be played President Trump enjoyed the Bastille Day parade in July Commentators say a US parade would be extremely expensive, given the cost of bringing military hardware and personnel to the capital and protecting its streets from tanks designed for war zones. Democratic politicians have criticised the expense and said such ideas carry worrying symbolism. ""What an absurd waste of money!"" tweeted Representative Jim McGovern.,external""Trump acts more like dictator than president. Americans deserve better."" Representative Jackie Speier, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN: ""I was stunned by it, to be quite honest... we have a Napoleon in the making here."" Several retired military personnel have also condemned the plan, saying the money would be better served improving conditions for veterans or raising military wages. Speaking to CNN, Lt Gen Mark Hertling said: ""I don't know a whole lot of soldiers who like them [parades]."" ""The military will do whatever the commander in chief asks them to do - but it's not a good idea for our military."" Trump's longstanding nuclear fixation Why does Trump admire strongmen leaders? Washington DC city council members and the Democratic mayor have panned the prospect, even if the federal government reimburses the city for all the costs. City councilman David Grosso said if there is a parade, he will hold a competing march dedicated to ""peace and nonviolence"". Mayor Muriel Bowser told the Washington Post that ""usually when you see big military parades, it's celebrating an end of a war, and I don't think that's been announced"". Large-scale military parades are seen by many as a relic of a bygone era and the Cold War, but they remain a common occurrence in many states - Communist and former Soviet nations and beyond. North Korea is probably the best-known for its spectacular displays - withan enormous show to take place on Thursday. Mr Trump also enjoyed a display of military might during his visit to China last November.Russia enjoys showing off its latest military hardwareat its frequent parades. The last time the US put on a grand military spectacle was back in 1991, when troops were celebrating victory in the first Gulf War But they are regular in other countries - Venezuela, Iran and Brazil all enjoy putting on a spectacle. In France, the annual Bastille Day parade, which was beefed up after the November 2015 terror attacks, harks back to France's militaristic past. An extravagant show in Saudi Arabia last year also reflected security concerns ahead of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Like North Korea, Thai forces parade on armed forces day and countries such as Australia and Sri Lanka use military parades as part of national day celebrations. Military parades can serve a patriotic purpose in monarchies -the UK celebrates the Queen's birthday each year with Trooping the Colour. The US, however, has largely reserved such ceremonies for the end of major conflicts. The last such in Washington DC was on 9 June 1991, when President George Bush Snr celebrated the end of the Gulf War. It is thought to have cost taxpayers some $10m (Â£7.2m) and was followed by another parade the next day in New York. Shock and awe at Falcon Heavy launch What's behind the Justin Timberlake backlash?

Australian MP reveals mum never came back,"This video can not be played ""I'd rather not share this with my closest friends let alone the parliament of Australia,"" Ms Lamb said An Australian MP says she cannot verify if she is legally allowed to sit in parliament as she has been estranged from her mother since the age of six. Susan Lamb, from the opposition Labor party, is facing scrutiny over whether she is a dual citizen - a status that is prohibited for Australian MPs. In an emotional speech, Ms Lamb said her ""traumatic story"" from childhood meant she could not access key papers. One government minister said her eligibility remained in question. Ms Lamb said her British father died about 20 years ago, having raised her as a single parent, and she was unable to prove she was not a dual citizen. Fighting back tears, she told fellow MPs that her mother once dropped her at school and ""never came back"". ""I would rather not share this with my closest friends, let alone the parliament of Australia,"" she said on Wednesday. ""I do not know what was going on in my mum's life back then... I do not know what is going on in her life now."" The UK blogger who shook Australia's government How a dual citizen crisis befell Australia She said the UK Home Office needed her parents' marriage certificate to determine whether she had inherited citizenship. Ms Lamb said she was not legally entitled to access the certificate herself. ""So I would simply ask those opposite [government MPs] - take a moment and think about the circumstances,"" she said. Government frontbencher Michael Keenan said the speech did not resolve doubts over the opposition MP's status. ""I am very sorry to hear of her personal circumstances and clearly it is very painful for her,"" he said. ""[However] we have had members in very similar positions and ultimately they referred themselves to the High Court."" Both parties have intensely scrutinised each other over the dual citizenship saga, amid tight numbers in the House of Representatives. The constitutional rule has unseated 10 politicians since last July. Two MPs have since returned through by-elections.

Energy bills rise for those on price cap,"Five million of the UK's most vulnerable households are facing an average rise of Â£57 a year in their energy bills, the regulator has said. Ofgem said savings under the current price cap will be reduced from April. That is because the cost of producing energy - including wholesale costs - is expected to rise in the Spring. The so-called safeguard tariff has now been extended to an extra one million households who currently receive the warm home discount. Around four million people with pre-payment meters already have their bills capped. The extra million households will start by saving Â£115 a year, but from April the savings will be reduced to an average of Â£66 a year. Energy price cap plans revealed Which? said there were other fixed price deals available which would be cheaper than the safeguard tariff. ""While it's right that help is extended to vulnerable customers, an average saving of just Â£66 on people's energy bills from April makes the safeguard tariff far from the cheapest deal on the market,"" said Alex Neil, Which? managing director of home products and services. ""Anyone overpaying on a poor value tariff should look to switch away to a better deal immediately, as they may save up to Â£305 a year."" However Ofgem said the safeguard tariff was not designed to be the cheapest on the market. It was merely meant to protect people on standard variable tariffs (svts) from being over-charged. And it said people would still be be better off after April than if there was no cap on prices. ""Protecting vulnerable customers is a priority for Ofgem,"" said Dermot Nolan, the regulator's chief executive. ""Even when energy costs rise, people on the worst deals are better off under the safeguard tariff as they can be sure that they are not overpaying for their energy, and any rise is justified."" Eventually the government is planning to cap the bills of everyone on expensive standard variable tariffs. If that legislation has not been passed by next winter, Ofgem plans to cap the bills of a further two million households. Those eligible for the latest cap include those with low incomes and some people over the age of 65.

German parties 'clinch coalition deal',"Angela Merkel's party suffered heavy losses in Germany's election last year Germany is set to emerge from months of political deadlock after Angela Merkel's conservatives (CDU/CSU) finally agreed a coalition deal with the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD). Negotiators have agreed on the division of key ministries - one of the last hurdles towards forming a government. It could end more than four months of wrangling since inconclusive elections in September. But the deal will still need to be approved by SPD members. Many in the party fear that re-entering a coalition with CDU/CSU could damage it in the long term. In a joint news conference on Wednesday, Chancellor Merkel said the agreement gave the basis for a ""good and stable government"". Germany's marriage of convenience SPD membership spike sparks concern SPD leader Martin Schulz thanked the conservatives for making what he said were tough compromises. In a tweet, he said the deal ""achieved a lot for people"",externaland he would be recommending that his party members accept it. The SPD looks set to control six ministries, including finance and foreign affairs. Mr Schulz has confirmed he will step down as SPD leader in March and instead become foreign minister, if the coalition deal is approved by SPD members. German elections: Merkel's hollow victory Angela Merkel's quiet power He will be replaced as SPD leader by former Labour and Social Affairs Minister Andrea Nahles. Mr Schulz says the deal ""achieves a lot for people"" The SPD's 460,000 members will have the final say on the whole agreement in a postal vote, the result of which will be announced on 2 March. Those opposed to any deal with Mrs Merkel include a new group within the SPD calling itself NoGroKo (no grand coalition). By Damien McGuinness, BBC News, Berlin Handing Germany's centre-left control of finance, foreign and labour policy would have a big impact on the rest of the world, particularly Europe. The promised spending spree on infrastructure and services will likely boost Germany's economy further, and the tax cuts may give an added boost to German consumer spending. A Social Democrat finance ministry - replacing pro-austerity Wolfgang SchÃ¤uble - is more likely to go along with French President Macron's ambitious plans for EU reform, by allowing more German support for struggling eurozone economies. Mr Macron wants to create a common eurozone budget and a eurozone finance minister, but Germany has so far been wary of any move that might lead to what it calls a ""transfer union"" used to prop up indebted governments. An SPD-led finance ministry could be much more amenable to Mr Macron's proposals. And at home these powerful ministries would help the SPD push for key left-wing policies, such as better rights for employees. This video can not be played German post-war politics in two minutes All of this could go down well with SPD party members, who will vote on any final coalition deal. An agreement which looks like a win for the SPD will increase the likelihood that they will vote yes. But if they vote no, then the most likely outcome could be fresh elections. European jitters over German coalition talks What are Macron's economic plans? Mr Schulz at first ruled out going back into government with Mrs Merkel's centre-right CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU. The parties had seen their popularity drop after being in coalition on and off since 2005. He changed his mind when CDU/CSU coalition talks with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens broke down. Both Mr Schulz and Mrs Merkel have been under pressure to see off a challenge by the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which became the third biggest party in September's election. This video can not be played How a woman from East Germany became one of the world's most powerful figures Other than distributing ministries, there have been big stumbling blocks in the coalition talks over workers' rights and healthcare. Just how far to the right is AfD? Immigration, Europe, and tax, have also been points of contention. European Union allies, such as France, see Germany as a pillar of stability in the bloc and have been hoping Mrs Merkel succeeds. Top EU officials, including the Economics Commissioner Pierre Moscovici, welcomed the breakthrough on Wednesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He said in a tweet,external: ""Relaunching the German model in this parliament with this arrangement and this chancellor will clearly not be possible."" Meanwhile Alice Weidel, the head of the far-right AfD's group of MPs in the new parliament, criticised the coalition's proposed immigration policy, which would see up to 220,000 asylum seekers given residency each year and a scheme to encourage highly-qualified people to move to Germany.

Dead minister's son wins by-election,"This video can not be played Jack Sargeant: ""Let's be kind to each other... the message I learnt from my dad"" The son of a sacked former Welsh Labour minister whose death sparked a by-election has won the vote and will succeed his father as an AM. Jack Sargeant, 23, won the Alyn and Deeside assembly by-election for Labour with a majority of 6,545. He said: ""I'm looking forward to going down to Cardiff Bay and standing up for the people of Alyn and Deeside."" The seat in Flintshire became vacant afterCarl Sargeant was found dead at homein Connah's Quay on 7 November. As it happened: Alyn and Deeside by-election Carl Sargeant: A timeline Sacked Labour minister found dead 'No alternative' but to sack Carl Sargeant Speaking on stage after the result was announced at Coleg Cambria in Connah's Quay, Jack Sargeant said: ""We still are devastated by dad's death. ""This is a by-election we shouldn't be fighting. There are questions still to be answered. But tonight is not the night for those questions to be answered. ""Despite the tragic circumstances, this is now an opportunity to start a movement to change politics. Let's go back to traditional Labour values and look after those who can't look after themselves. He said he wanted ""a kind message in life in general, not just in politics. ""Let's be kind to each other...that's the message I learned from my dad."" Jack Sargeant signing the Oath of Allegiance to become an assembly member Carl Sargeant was Alyn and Deeside AM from 2003 until his death. Sacked as cabinet secretary for communities and children amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards women, he was found dead four days later having apparently taken his own life. First Minister Carwyn Jones faces two ongoing investigations - one into his handling of the sacking of Carl Sargeant while the other is considering whether he misled the assembly in statements about what he knew about allegations of bullying within the Welsh Government in 2014. After the by-election result was declared, Welsh Government Economy Secretary and Labour Clwyd South AM Ken Skates was asked if Jack Sargeant would now be a thorn in the side of the first minister. ""I don't think so, no,"" he said. ""He'll be a thorn in the side of the Tories, that's for sure, and he'll be a thorn in the side of anybody who stands in the way of the best interests of the people of Alyn and Deeside. ""That's what Jack's focused on, that's what he's going to deliver."" Speaking before the result, Clwyd West Conservative AM Darren Millar said it would be ""an endorsement of Jack and Carl Sargeant's family"". ""I don't think in any way the Labour party or Carwyn Jones can claim credit for what I think will be a clear win for Jack Sargeant,"" he said. Jack Sargeant, Labour - 11,267 (60.7% - up 14.9) Sarah Atherton, Conservative - 4,722 (25.4% - up 4.4) Donna Lalek, Liberal Democrat - 1,176 (6.3% - up 1.8) Carrie Harper, Plaid Cymru - 1,059 (5.7% - down 3.3) Duncan Rees, Green Party - 353 (1.9% - down 0.5) Turnout - 29.1% (down 5.5) No surprises that Jack Sargeant won this by-election. In the end, he increased Labour's majority. So he's off to Cardiff Bay, following in his late father's footsteps. When he gets there, what sort of relationship will he have with First Minister Carwyn Jones, who dismissed his father? People around Jack Sargeant answer that by saying he's a team player. There are outstanding questions however, as Jack Sargeant acknowledged in his acceptance speech, about the way Carl Sargeant was sacked. An independent inquiry will look into all of that - and the Sargeant family has a role in helping to draw up the inquiry's terms of reference. As it happened: Alyn and Deeside by-election Timeline: Death of Carl Sargeant Hundreds attend Carl Sargeant funeral 'No alternative' but to sack Sargeant No 'natural justice' for Sargeant Sacked Labour minister found dead Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

North Korea leader's sister to visit South,"Kim Yo-jong in a 2015 picture of her brother touring a military unit The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is to attend the Winter Olympic Games which open in Pyeongchang in the South on Friday, ministers in Seoul say. Kim Yo-jong, a senior Workers' Party official promoted to the politburo last year, will be the first immediate Kim family member to cross the border. Both Koreas will march under one flag at the opening ceremony. The North's participation has been seen as a thawing of bilateral ties. Leader's sister takes 'real power' south North Korea crisis in 300 words However, the US, Japan and others have accused the North of using the Games for propaganda purposes. Believed to have been born in 1987, she is the youngest daughter of late leader Kim Jong-il and is Kim Jong-un's full sister. She is about four years younger than her brother and is said to be very close to him. Keeping up with the Kims: North Korea's elusive first family Kim Jong-un's sister Yo-jong waits in the wings She is reportedly married to the son of Choe Ryong-hae, the powerful party secretary. Kim Yo-jong at the opening of a residential complex in Pyongyang in 2017 Kim Yo-jong has been in the spotlight sporadically in recent years, with her main job being to protect her brother's image via her role in the party's propaganda department. She remains blacklisted by the US over alleged links to human rights abuses in North Korea. Analysis: BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul This is a huge surprise. There had been speculation Kim Yo-jong might be part of the delegation but few thought it would actually happen. It is being seen as a sign that Kim Jong-un is serious about improving ties with South Korea. Kim Yo-jong is one of Kim Jong-un's closest aides and some are speculating that she might be bringing a message from her brother. But there could be a number of obstacles to overcome if she is to make it to Pyeongchang. She is targeted by US sanctions for alleged human rights abuses, although she is not on the UN Security Council travel blacklist. There is also the question of how she will get to the Games. Seoul has had to request special permission from the US and others in the international community to allow North Korean athletes and performers to travel south by bus and ferry. They may have to do so again and this time it will be for a member of Kim Jong-un's own family. It would be the first by a direct member of the Kim dynasty. Chang Song-thaek, Kim Jong-un's uncle and brother in law of Kim Jong-il, did travel to the South but did not belong to the Baekdu blood line, which is considered significant. There is speculation in the South that this is part of Kim Yo-jong's grooming for greater power, and that she could be bringing a letter from her brother to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who she is likely to meet. It is unclear whether Kim Yo-jong will be at the opening ceremony on Friday. Inside the world's most secretive country Politically, four figures, including Kim Yo-jong, are key. The others are: Kim Yong-nam. North Korea's ceremonial head of state, the president of its parliament. The diplomatically sure-footed 90-year-old has seen the rule of all three North Korean leaders and has travelled overseas before Ri Son-gwon. The head of the North Korean state agency in charge of inter-Korean affairs. A veteran negotiator, he was North Korea's chief delegate at the rare inter-Korean talks held in January Choe Hwi. Vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party and chairman of the National Sports Guidance Committee. Under US state department sanctions It's a 280-strong delegation, most of whom arrived in the South on Wednesday. Led by North Korean Sports Minister Kim Il-guk, it includes 229 cheerleaders, four officials from the National Olympic Committee, 26 taekwondo demonstrators and 21 journalists. This video can not be played North Korean cheerleaders arrive in the South for the Games The team arrived via a western border at 09:28 local time (00:26 GMT), the Yonhap news agency reported. North Korea at the Winter Olympics: All you need to know North Korea: A sporting history of bombs and diplomacy Only 10 athletes will compete for the North at the Games, along with another 12 as part of a unified Korean women's ice hockey team. Michael Madden, North Korea leadership expert In announcing its delegates both to the 2018 Winter Olympics and the inter-Korean culture events on the sidelines, Pyongyang let out the information in a slow drip. Part of this is Pyongyang maximising the positive PR effects. The announcement of the full delegation came following the arrival of its athletes to the Games late last week, and one day after 10 musicians arrived in South Korea. So now North Korea has earned itself a third day of positive media coverage about its participation in the Olympics. The US is scornful of the North's motives over the Olympics and is sending Vice-President Mike Pence to the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang to counter what it terms propaganda. Both the US and Japan have been critical of the North's Olympics policy ""We're travelling to the Olympics to make sure that North Korea doesn't use the powerful symbolism in the backdrop of the Winter Olympics to paper over the truth about their regime,"" he said. He was in Tokyo on Wednesday and maintained the pressure, announcing that ""the United States will soon unveil the toughest and most aggressive round of economic sanctions on North Korea"". Japan has been equally sceptical. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said: ""We must not be fooled by North Korea's 'smile diplomacy'."" North Korea currently faces growing international pressure and sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes. Its latest ballistic missile test, on 28 November, sparked a new series of measures from the UN, targeting petrol shipments and travel for North Koreans, and a war of words between the North and US President Donald Trump. Kim Jong-un then extended a New Year's olive branch to the South over participation in the Olympics, which run from 9 to 25 February. The perceived warming of ties has not been without difficulties, not least the North's decision to move a military parade in Pyongyang from April to the day before the opening of the Games.

Gig workers promised rights crackdown,"The government says it will enforce the rights that workers are entitled to The government has promised an overhaul of employment rights to improve conditions for millions of workers, including those in the gig economy. The changes include stricter enforcement of holiday and sick pay rights, and higher fines for firms that breach contracts or mistreat staff. It is a response to last year's Taylor Review into working practices. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the measures would ""address very clearly"" the rights of those in insecure work. He told the BBC that very often a worker did not have the ability to challenge or force a company to follow the law. ""We will be enforcing the rights that people have and are entitled to,"" Mr Clark said. He added: ""We want to embrace new ways of working, and to do so we will be one of the first countries to prepare our employment rules to reflect the new challenges."" Although the government says that nearly all the recommendations of the Taylor review will be adopted, unions have said the plan will still leave 1.8 million workers without key rights. Much of what has been announced simply involves enforcing and clarifying existing laws. So, for example, people who are officially classified as workers are already entitled to sick pay and holiday pay, but many of them don't know that. It can certainly be confusing. Uber drivers are now considered to be workers, so they are entitled to these benefits. Yet Deliveroo riders are still classified as self-employed and that means they're not eligible. The government's plan will make sure that everyone knows what they're entitled to when they start working for a company and the rules will now be enforced by HMRC, so people actually get what they're owed. Undoubtedly, that's good news for some workers. But in terms of giving people new rights, it's pretty limited stuff. TheTaylor Review,externalconcentrated particularly on the so-called gig economy of part time and flexible workers. It said all work in the UK economy should be ""fair and decent"". The government says it is going further than the Review's recommendations by: Enforcing holiday and sick pay entitlements Giving all workers the right to demand a payslip Allowing flexible workers to demand more stable contracts The quantity and quality of jobs in the gig economy will be monitored and steps will be taken to make sure flexible workers are aware of their rights. The government is also asking the Low Pay Commission to consider a higher minimum wage for workers on zero-hour contracts, and says it may also repeal laws that allow agencies to employ workers on cheaper rates. Matthew Taylor, the author of the original review, called the government's response ""substantive and comprehensive"". He said: ""It will make a difference to the lives of the most vulnerable workers and that is what matters. ""I welcome the range of specific commitments to improve the protections and rights of workers and to enforce those rights more strongly. ""On important issues, including pay for variable hours workers, employment status and representation of workers I welcome the direction indicated today, but there is more work to be done to encourage the Government to be bold in living up to its commitment to good work for all."" Richard Laughton, Sharing Economy UK Chair, the trade body for the sharing economy industry,  said firms welcomed the government's plan. ""Many people hugely value the flexibility that platforms provide and have been able to participate in the employment market for the first time. ""Greater clarity on knowing when they are to be paid will help individuals make informed choices."" Mr Laughton who is also chief executive of easyCar, added: ""It's essential that updates to the UK's labour market continue to promote entrepreneurship, encourage participation and maintain flexibility while helping to develop skills."" However, unions have been far more critical. Dr. Jason Moyer-Lee, General Secretary of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said: ""Like the Taylor Review, it so far appears big on grandiose claims, light on substance. ""The most important single thing government could do is introduce effective government enforcement of employment law. They say they will do this but give no indication of how."" TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady added: ""The government has taken a baby step - when it needed to take a giant leap. ""These plans won't stop the hire and fire culture of zero-hours contracts or sham self-employment. And they will still leave 1.8 million workers excluded from key protections. Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ""This could be the biggest shake-up of employment law in generations. It is right, therefore, that government proceeds cautiously by consulting widely. ""However, while they have accepted almost every single recommendation from the Taylor Review, and in some cases even gone further, the lack of action on tax reform is a wasted opportunity.""

Game of Thrones creators join Star Wars,"Benioff (left) and Weiss will get their own Star Wars film as soon as Game of Thrones ends The creators of the Game of Thrones TV series are to make a series of films for the rapidly-expanding Star Wars universe. David Benioff and DB Weiss will begin work on Star Wars when Game of Thrones ends in 2019, Lucasfilm announced. Little is known about the project. But it will develop a story separate from the current series, and also from a trilogy planned by director Rian Johnson, who was behind 2017's The Last Jedi. ""In the summer of 1977 we travelled to a galaxy far, far away, and we've been dreaming of it ever since,"" Benioff and Weiss said in a joint statement. Disney banks on Star Wars for growth Star Wars: 'Time for female director' Game of Thrones, known for its violence and nudity, is markedly different from the more family-friendly Star Wars films. But Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm, said the pair ""are some of the best storytellers working today"".

Trump plans military parade in Washington,"This video can not be played What makes a military parade? Here's how other countries do it US President Donald Trump has asked the Pentagon to organise a large military parade in the nation's capital. The president made the request of top military chiefs in late January, after reportedly being impressed by a French Bastille Day parade last year. ""It was one of the greatest parades I've ever seen,"" he later said. ""We're going to have to try and top it."" Democrats compared the plan to displays of military might organised by autocratic nations. The plan was first revealed by the Washington Post, before being confirmed by the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders. This video can not be played Fallen soldier's mum recalls looking for her son's face among marching soldiers ""President Trump is incredibly supportive of America's great service members who risk their lives every day to keep our country safe,"" she said. ""He has asked the Department of Defense to explore a celebration at which all Americans can show their appreciation."" Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday that the Pentagon was drawing up potential plans for the parade and would send them to the White House for approval. When asked why President Trump wanted such a parade, Mr Mattis said it demonstrated the ""president's affection and respect for the military"". This video can not be played Raining on Trump's (would be) parade ""We've been putting together some options,"" he told White House reporters. ""We'll send them up to the White House for decision."" Military displays in Washington DC are usually only used to mark victory at the end of a war. US media linked the plan toMr Trump's admiration for a military parade he attended in Paris in July last year. The occasion, marking 100 years since America entered World War One, saw troops march down the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es, accompanied by dozens of military vehicles, flyovers of military aircraft, and traditional mounted cavalry. This video can not be played President Trump enjoyed the Bastille Day parade in July Commentators say a US parade would be extremely expensive, given the cost of bringing military hardware and personnel to the capital and protecting its streets from tanks designed for war zones. Democratic politicians have criticised the expense and said such ideas carry worrying symbolism. ""What an absurd waste of money!"" tweeted Representative Jim McGovern.,external""Trump acts more like dictator than president. Americans deserve better."" Representative Jackie Speier, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN: ""I was stunned by it, to be quite honest... we have a Napoleon in the making here."" Several retired military personnel have also condemned the plan, saying the money would be better served improving conditions for veterans or raising military wages. Speaking to CNN, Lt Gen Mark Hertling said: ""I don't know a whole lot of soldiers who like them [parades]."" ""The military will do whatever the commander in chief asks them to do - but it's not a good idea for our military."" Trump's longstanding nuclear fixation Why does Trump admire strongmen leaders? Washington DC city council members and the Democratic mayor have panned the prospect, even if the federal government reimburses the city for all the costs. City councilman David Grosso said if there is a parade, he will hold a competing march dedicated to ""peace and nonviolence"". Mayor Muriel Bowser told the Washington Post that ""usually when you see big military parades, it's celebrating an end of a war, and I don't think that's been announced"". Large-scale military parades are seen by many as a relic of a bygone era and the Cold War, but they remain a common occurrence in many states - Communist and former Soviet nations and beyond. North Korea is probably the best-known for its spectacular displays - withan enormous show to take place on Thursday. Mr Trump also enjoyed a display of military might during his visit to China last November.Russia enjoys showing off its latest military hardwareat its frequent parades. The last time the US put on a grand military spectacle was back in 1991, when troops were celebrating victory in the first Gulf War But they are regular in other countries - Venezuela, Iran and Brazil all enjoy putting on a spectacle. In France, the annual Bastille Day parade, which was beefed up after the November 2015 terror attacks, harks back to France's militaristic past. An extravagant show in Saudi Arabia last year also reflected security concerns ahead of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Like North Korea, Thai forces parade on armed forces day and countries such as Australia and Sri Lanka use military parades as part of national day celebrations. Military parades can serve a patriotic purpose in monarchies -the UK celebrates the Queen's birthday each year with Trooping the Colour. The US, however, has largely reserved such ceremonies for the end of major conflicts. The last such in Washington DC was on 9 June 1991, when President George Bush Snr celebrated the end of the Gulf War. It is thought to have cost taxpayers some $10m (Â£7.2m) and was followed by another parade the next day in New York. Shock and awe at Falcon Heavy launch What's behind the Justin Timberlake backlash?

"Breaking|Breaking newsNorth Korea leader's sister to visit SouthThe high-profile Kim Yo-jong will attend the opening of the Winter Olympics, officials say.1m2 minutes agoAsia","Kim Yo-jong in a 2015 picture of her brother touring a military unit The influential sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is to attend the Winter Olympic Games which open in Pyeongchang in the South on Friday, ministers in Seoul say. Kim Yo-jong, a senior Workers' Party official promoted to the politburo last year, will be the first immediate Kim family member to cross the border. Both Koreas will march under one flag at the opening ceremony. The North's participation has been seen as a thawing of bilateral ties. Leader's sister takes 'real power' south North Korea crisis in 300 words However, the US, Japan and others have accused the North of using the Games for propaganda purposes. Believed to have been born in 1987, she is the youngest daughter of late leader Kim Jong-il and is Kim Jong-un's full sister. She is about four years younger than her brother and is said to be very close to him. Keeping up with the Kims: North Korea's elusive first family Kim Jong-un's sister Yo-jong waits in the wings She is reportedly married to the son of Choe Ryong-hae, the powerful party secretary. Kim Yo-jong at the opening of a residential complex in Pyongyang in 2017 Kim Yo-jong has been in the spotlight sporadically in recent years, with her main job being to protect her brother's image via her role in the party's propaganda department. She remains blacklisted by the US over alleged links to human rights abuses in North Korea. Analysis: BBC's Laura Bicker in Seoul This is a huge surprise. There had been speculation Kim Yo-jong might be part of the delegation but few thought it would actually happen. It is being seen as a sign that Kim Jong-un is serious about improving ties with South Korea. Kim Yo-jong is one of Kim Jong-un's closest aides and some are speculating that she might be bringing a message from her brother. But there could be a number of obstacles to overcome if she is to make it to Pyeongchang. She is targeted by US sanctions for alleged human rights abuses, although she is not on the UN Security Council travel blacklist. There is also the question of how she will get to the Games. Seoul has had to request special permission from the US and others in the international community to allow North Korean athletes and performers to travel south by bus and ferry. They may have to do so again and this time it will be for a member of Kim Jong-un's own family. It would be the first by a direct member of the Kim dynasty. Chang Song-thaek, Kim Jong-un's uncle and brother in law of Kim Jong-il, did travel to the South but did not belong to the Baekdu blood line, which is considered significant. There is speculation in the South that this is part of Kim Yo-jong's grooming for greater power, and that she could be bringing a letter from her brother to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who she is likely to meet. It is unclear whether Kim Yo-jong will be at the opening ceremony on Friday. Inside the world's most secretive country Politically, four figures, including Kim Yo-jong, are key. The others are: Kim Yong-nam. North Korea's ceremonial head of state, the president of its parliament. The diplomatically sure-footed 90-year-old has seen the rule of all three North Korean leaders and has travelled overseas before Ri Son-gwon. The head of the North Korean state agency in charge of inter-Korean affairs. A veteran negotiator, he was North Korea's chief delegate at the rare inter-Korean talks held in January Choe Hwi. Vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party and chairman of the National Sports Guidance Committee. Under US state department sanctions It's a 280-strong delegation, most of whom arrived in the South on Wednesday. Led by North Korean Sports Minister Kim Il-guk, it includes 229 cheerleaders, four officials from the National Olympic Committee, 26 taekwondo demonstrators and 21 journalists. This video can not be played North Korean cheerleaders arrive in the South for the Games The team arrived via a western border at 09:28 local time (00:26 GMT), the Yonhap news agency reported. North Korea at the Winter Olympics: All you need to know North Korea: A sporting history of bombs and diplomacy Only 10 athletes will compete for the North at the Games, along with another 12 as part of a unified Korean women's ice hockey team. Michael Madden, North Korea leadership expert In announcing its delegates both to the 2018 Winter Olympics and the inter-Korean culture events on the sidelines, Pyongyang let out the information in a slow drip. Part of this is Pyongyang maximising the positive PR effects. The announcement of the full delegation came following the arrival of its athletes to the Games late last week, and one day after 10 musicians arrived in South Korea. So now North Korea has earned itself a third day of positive media coverage about its participation in the Olympics. The US is scornful of the North's motives over the Olympics and is sending Vice-President Mike Pence to the opening ceremony in Pyeongchang to counter what it terms propaganda. Both the US and Japan have been critical of the North's Olympics policy ""We're travelling to the Olympics to make sure that North Korea doesn't use the powerful symbolism in the backdrop of the Winter Olympics to paper over the truth about their regime,"" he said. He was in Tokyo on Wednesday and maintained the pressure, announcing that ""the United States will soon unveil the toughest and most aggressive round of economic sanctions on North Korea"". Japan has been equally sceptical. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said: ""We must not be fooled by North Korea's 'smile diplomacy'."" North Korea currently faces growing international pressure and sanctions over its nuclear and missile programmes. Its latest ballistic missile test, on 28 November, sparked a new series of measures from the UN, targeting petrol shipments and travel for North Koreans, and a war of words between the North and US President Donald Trump. Kim Jong-un then extended a New Year's olive branch to the South over participation in the Olympics, which run from 9 to 25 February. The perceived warming of ties has not been without difficulties, not least the North's decision to move a military parade in Pyongyang from April to the day before the opening of the Games.

Asia markets follow Wall Street higher,"Wall Street shares slipped on Wednesday, but were somewhat steadier than in recent days, which saw sharp trading swings. The Dow Jones dipped less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 fell about 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 0.9%. Declines in technology and energy shares weighed on the markets, which have seen a sudden increase in volatility. Investors are worried by policy shifts, including higher interest rates. European stock markets also recovered ground on Wednesday, but a rally in Asia faded. Stock markets: Your questions answered The volatility marks a turn for the markets, which rose steadily for much of last year. But analysts and economists, who for months have forecast that rapidly-rising markets were due a correction, said investors should get used to choppier markets. ""It's not like this is going to be one and done,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade. Signs of volatility have been rising in recent weeks, as investors digest the impact of new tax cuts and tighter central banking policies, among other shifts. A US Labor Department report of strong wage growth in January triggered a market sell-off last week, as investors saw a sign that inflation could rise faster than expected and lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly. The market plunge spread globally as investors rushed to redistribute assets in reaction to the shift. Wednesday's declines came after US lawmakers announced a budget deal, which would lift spending caps and could add to the inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, soft demand for US Treasuries at an auction on Wednesday sent yields higher - typically a signal of higher rates. London's FTSE 100 closed 1.9% higher, in Paris the Cac-40 rose by 1.8% and Frankfurt's Dax was up by 1.6%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index pulled back from early highs to add 0.2%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.8%.  Australia's S&P/ASX 200 ended up 0.8% while South Korea's Kospi index dropped 2.3%. During this week's market mayhem you probably heard a lot about volatility - and in particular, this thing called the Fear Index, or Vix. But what is it? Technically, the Vix is a measure of the expected amount of gyration in stock prices on the S&P 500 over the next month. A low level indicates investors don't expect prices to fluctuate that much - a spike implies choppy waters ahead. But it's only recently that investors could trade on - or against - fear. Well, fear of change, specifically. The Vix, technically theCboe Volatility Index,external, was first launched in 1993. But you could only bet on it - using options - in 2006. A key thing about the Vix is that the volatility that the index predicts tends to be worse than actual volatility. In other words, we think the future will be worse than it is. That pessimism is something a group of investors have exploited - they bet that the future would be calmer than the Vix model suggested. And over the years, that has made them a lot of money. The only problem for them is when that calm evaporates, like now. US shares regain ground to close higher Stock markets: Your questions answered Did robots trigger the market plunge?

Holiday and sick pay for gig workers,"The government says it will enforce the rights that workers are entitled to The government has promised an overhaul of employment rights to improve conditions for millions of workers, including those in the gig economy. The changes include stricter enforcement of holiday and sick pay rights, and higher fines for firms that breach contracts or mistreat staff. It is a response to last year's Taylor Review into working practices. Business Secretary Greg Clark said the measures would ""address very clearly"" the rights of those in insecure work. He told the BBC that very often a worker did not have the ability to challenge or force a company to follow the law. ""We will be enforcing the rights that people have and are entitled to,"" Mr Clark said. He added: ""We want to embrace new ways of working, and to do so we will be one of the first countries to prepare our employment rules to reflect the new challenges."" Although the government says that nearly all the recommendations of the Taylor review will be adopted, unions have said the plan will still leave 1.8 million workers without key rights. Much of what has been announced simply involves enforcing and clarifying existing laws. So, for example, people who are officially classified as workers are already entitled to sick pay and holiday pay, but many of them don't know that. It can certainly be confusing. Uber drivers are now considered to be workers, so they are entitled to these benefits. Yet Deliveroo riders are still classified as self-employed and that means they're not eligible. The government's plan will make sure that everyone knows what they're entitled to when they start working for a company and the rules will now be enforced by HMRC, so people actually get what they're owed. Undoubtedly, that's good news for some workers. But in terms of giving people new rights, it's pretty limited stuff. TheTaylor Review,externalconcentrated particularly on the so-called gig economy of part time and flexible workers. It said all work in the UK economy should be ""fair and decent"". The government says it is going further than the Review's recommendations by: Enforcing holiday and sick pay entitlements Giving all workers the right to demand a payslip Allowing flexible workers to demand more stable contracts The quantity and quality of jobs in the gig economy will be monitored and steps will be taken to make sure flexible workers are aware of their rights. The government is also asking the Low Pay Commission to consider a higher minimum wage for workers on zero-hour contracts, and says it may also repeal laws that allow agencies to employ workers on cheaper rates. Matthew Taylor, the author of the original review, called the government's response ""substantive and comprehensive"". He said: ""It will make a difference to the lives of the most vulnerable workers and that is what matters. ""I welcome the range of specific commitments to improve the protections and rights of workers and to enforce those rights more strongly. ""On important issues, including pay for variable hours workers, employment status and representation of workers I welcome the direction indicated today, but there is more work to be done to encourage the Government to be bold in living up to its commitment to good work for all."" Richard Laughton, Sharing Economy UK Chair, the trade body for the sharing economy industry,  said firms welcomed the government's plan. ""Many people hugely value the flexibility that platforms provide and have been able to participate in the employment market for the first time. ""Greater clarity on knowing when they are to be paid will help individuals make informed choices."" Mr Laughton who is also chief executive of easyCar, added: ""It's essential that updates to the UK's labour market continue to promote entrepreneurship, encourage participation and maintain flexibility while helping to develop skills."" However, unions have been far more critical. Dr. Jason Moyer-Lee, General Secretary of the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) said: ""Like the Taylor Review, it so far appears big on grandiose claims, light on substance. ""The most important single thing government could do is introduce effective government enforcement of employment law. They say they will do this but give no indication of how."" TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady added: ""The government has taken a baby step - when it needed to take a giant leap. ""These plans won't stop the hire and fire culture of zero-hours contracts or sham self-employment. And they will still leave 1.8 million workers excluded from key protections. Stephen Martin, director general of the Institute of Directors, said: ""This could be the biggest shake-up of employment law in generations. It is right, therefore, that government proceeds cautiously by consulting widely. ""However, while they have accepted almost every single recommendation from the Taylor Review, and in some cases even gone further, the lack of action on tax reform is a wasted opportunity.""

Aftershocks rock Taiwan after deadly quake,"This video can not be played Rescue at Taiwan quake-hit tilted building Aftershocks continue to rattle Taiwan after a strong earthquake killed at least seven people and injured more than 250 others on Tuesday night. A 5.7-magnitude tremor was felt late on Wednesday, in the same area where the 6.4-magnitude quake struck on the country's east coast. Some 67 people are still unaccounted for after a number of buildings across the city of Hualien were badly damaged. Hualien, a popular tourist hub, is home to about 100,000 people. Images from the city showed tilted structures, scattered debris and extensive damage to roads. Dozens of the missing are thought to be in a residential building that is leaning dramatically to one side. Engineers have attempted to secure it using concrete blocks and steel, but efforts have been complicated by ongoing tremors and rainfall. Rescues at the apartment block were at one stage temporarily suspended for safety reasons, but emergency responders and soldiers continued to work into the night on Wednesday. This video can not be played Taiwan eyewitness Zeena Starbuck was caught in an aftershock live on TV An 80-year-old resident of the building told the AFP news agency that he was asleep in his flat on the top floor when Tuesday's earthquake struck. ""My bed turned completely vertical. I was sleeping and suddenly I was standing,"" Chen Chih-wei said. At least two people died in the city's Marshal Hotel when the building's bottom floors collapsed. Authorities said on Wednesday they believed no one else was left inside. Residents of Hualien have been told to stay away from their damaged homes, and hundreds have taken shelter in community buildings because of the aftershocks. Authorities said the Hotel's ground floor and basement collapsed President Tsai Ing-wen was at the scene of the quake on Wednesday morning, where she visited hospitals and relief centres. In a statement, Ms Tsai said that the government would help Hualien to the best of its abilities, adding that she hoped ""people's lives would return to normal as soon as possible"". Pope Francis also expressed solidarity with the victims in a statement released by the Vatican. by Cheng Chunglan, BBC Chinese, Hualien Earthquakes are not uncommon for residents in Hualien but the 6.4-magnitude quake, one of the strongest in recent years, came as a shock. According to witnesses, residents were running out of buildings crying and screaming when the earthquake shook the city. ""It is the first time in my life [where I felt like] I wanted to hide under a bed,"" said 32-year-old Ms Chieh. ""Later, my entire family and all my neighbours ran out onto the street."" She added that she felt very scared and found it ""unbelievable"" that the hotel building near her home was so seriously damaged. People reported feeling Tuesday's quake in the island's capital, Taipei, more than 160km (100 miles) away. The earthquake happened exactly two years after a previous quake in the Taiwanese city of Tainan that killed at least 116 people. Taiwan has been rocked by more than 100 earthquakes so far this month, according to the government. The island sits near a junction of two tectonic plates and is regularly hit by earthquakes. Taiwan has for all practical purposes been independent since 1950, but China regards it as a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland. Are you in the area? Did you witness what happened?

Carl Sargeant's son wins by-election,"This video can not be played Jack Sargeant: ""Let's be kind to each other... the message I learnt from my dad"" The son of a sacked former Welsh Labour minister whose death sparked a by-election has won the vote and will succeed his father as an AM. Jack Sargeant, 23, won the Alyn and Deeside assembly by-election for Labour with a majority of 6,545. He said: ""I'm looking forward to going down to Cardiff Bay and standing up for the people of Alyn and Deeside."" The seat in Flintshire became vacant afterCarl Sargeant was found dead at homein Connah's Quay on 7 November. As it happened: Alyn and Deeside by-election Carl Sargeant: A timeline Sacked Labour minister found dead 'No alternative' but to sack Carl Sargeant Speaking on stage after the result was announced at Coleg Cambria in Connah's Quay, Jack Sargeant said: ""We still are devastated by dad's death. ""This is a by-election we shouldn't be fighting. There are questions still to be answered. But tonight is not the night for those questions to be answered. ""Despite the tragic circumstances, this is now an opportunity to start a movement to change politics. Let's go back to traditional Labour values and look after those who can't look after themselves. He said he wanted ""a kind message in life in general, not just in politics. ""Let's be kind to each other...that's the message I learned from my dad."" Jack Sargeant signing the Oath of Allegiance to become an assembly member Carl Sargeant was Alyn and Deeside AM from 2003 until his death. Sacked as cabinet secretary for communities and children amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour towards women, he was found dead four days later having apparently taken his own life. First Minister Carwyn Jones faces two ongoing investigations - one into his handling of the sacking of Carl Sargeant while the other is considering whether he misled the assembly in statements about what he knew about allegations of bullying within the Welsh Government in 2014. After the by-election result was declared, Welsh Government Economy Secretary and Labour Clwyd South AM Ken Skates was asked if Jack Sargeant would now be a thorn in the side of the first minister. ""I don't think so, no,"" he said. ""He'll be a thorn in the side of the Tories, that's for sure, and he'll be a thorn in the side of anybody who stands in the way of the best interests of the people of Alyn and Deeside. ""That's what Jack's focused on, that's what he's going to deliver."" Speaking before the result, Clwyd West Conservative AM Darren Millar said it would be ""an endorsement of Jack and Carl Sargeant's family"". ""I don't think in any way the Labour party or Carwyn Jones can claim credit for what I think will be a clear win for Jack Sargeant,"" he said. Jack Sargeant, Labour - 11,267 (60.7% - up 14.9) Sarah Atherton, Conservative - 4,722 (25.4% - up 4.4) Donna Lalek, Liberal Democrat - 1,176 (6.3% - up 1.8) Carrie Harper, Plaid Cymru - 1,059 (5.7% - down 3.3) Duncan Rees, Green Party - 353 (1.9% - down 0.5) Turnout - 29.1% (down 5.5) No surprises that Jack Sargeant won this by-election. In the end, he increased Labour's majority. So he's off to Cardiff Bay, following in his late father's footsteps. When he gets there, what sort of relationship will he have with First Minister Carwyn Jones, who dismissed his father? People around Jack Sargeant answer that by saying he's a team player. There are outstanding questions however, as Jack Sargeant acknowledged in his acceptance speech, about the way Carl Sargeant was sacked. An independent inquiry will look into all of that - and the Sargeant family has a role in helping to draw up the inquiry's terms of reference.

Trump plans military parade in WashingtonThe president was reportedly so impressed by a ceremony in France he wants one for the US.1han hour agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played What makes a military parade? Here's how other countries do it US President Donald Trump has asked the Pentagon to organise a large military parade in the nation's capital.

""It was one of the greatest parades I've ever seen,"" he later said. ""We're going to have to try and top it."" Democrats compared the plan to displays of military might organised by autocratic nations.

Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said on Wednesday that the Pentagon was drawing up potential plans for the parade and would send them to the White House for approval. When asked why President Trump wanted such a parade, Mr Mattis said it demonstrated the ""president's affection and respect for the military"". This video can not be played Raining on Trump's (would be) parade ""We've been putting together some options,"" he told White House reporters. ""We'll send them up to the White House for decision."" Military displays in Washington DC are usually only used to mark victory at the end of a war. US media linked the plan toMr Trump's admiration for a military parade he attended in Paris in July last year. The occasion, marking 100 years since America entered World War One, saw troops march down the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es, accompanied by dozens of military vehicles, flyovers of military aircraft, and traditional mounted cavalry. This video can not be played President Trump enjoyed the Bastille Day parade in July Commentators say a US parade would be extremely expensive, given the cost of bringing military hardware and personnel to the capital and protecting its streets from tanks designed for war zones. Democratic politicians have criticised the expense and said such ideas carry worrying symbolism. ""What an absurd waste of money!"" tweeted Representative Jim McGovern.,external""Trump acts more like dictator than president. Americans deserve better."" Representative Jackie Speier, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, told CNN: ""I was stunned by it, to be quite honest... we have a Napoleon in the making here."" Several retired military personnel have also condemned the plan, saying the money would be better served improving conditions for veterans or raising military wages. Speaking to CNN, Lt Gen Mark Hertling said: ""I don't know a whole lot of soldiers who like them [parades]."" ""The military will do whatever the commander in chief asks them to do - but it's not a good idea for our military."" Trump's longstanding nuclear fixation Why does Trump admire strongmen leaders? Washington DC city council members and the Democratic mayor have panned the prospect, even if the federal government reimburses the city for all the costs. City councilman David Grosso said if there is a parade, he will hold a competing march dedicated to ""peace and nonviolence"". Mayor Muriel Bowser told the Washington Post that ""usually when you see big military parades, it's celebrating an end of a war, and I don't think that's been announced"". Large-scale military parades are seen by many as a relic of a bygone era and the Cold War, but they remain a common occurrence in many states - Communist and former Soviet nations and beyond. North Korea is probably the best-known for its spectacular displays - withan enormous show to take place on Thursday. Mr Trump also enjoyed a display of military might during his visit to China last November.Russia enjoys showing off its latest military hardwareat its frequent parades. The last time the US put on a grand military spectacle was back in 1991, when troops were celebrating victory in the first Gulf War But they are regular in other countries - Venezuela, Iran and Brazil all enjoy putting on a spectacle. In France, the annual Bastille Day parade, which was beefed up after the November 2015 terror attacks, harks back to France's militaristic past. An extravagant show in Saudi Arabia last year also reflected security concerns ahead of the annual Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. Like North Korea, Thai forces parade on armed forces day and countries such as Australia and Sri Lanka use military parades as part of national day celebrations. Military parades can serve a patriotic purpose in monarchies -the UK celebrates the Queen's birthday each year with Trooping the Colour. The US, however, has largely reserved such ceremonies for the end of major conflicts. The last such in Washington DC was on 9 June 1991, when President George Bush Snr celebrated the end of the Gulf War. It is thought to have cost taxpayers some $10m (Â£7.2m) and was followed by another parade the next day in New York. Shock and awe at Falcon Heavy launch What's behind the Justin Timberlake backlash?

Ministers gather for key Brexit meeting,"The PM is under pressure to spell out the details of the partnership she wants with the EU Theresa May has been chairing the first of two key Brexit meetings with senior ministers as the government faces more calls to clarify the UK's position. The Brexit cabinet committee is to sketch out what the future relationship between the UK and EU might look like. It was expected to focus on Northern Ireland and immigration. It comes as aleaked document suggests the EU wants to be able to restrict UK accessto the single market if there is a dispute after Brexit. According to a draft section of the UK and EU's withdrawal agreement, which has yet to be finalised, the power to suspend ""certain benefits"" would apply during a transition phase after the UK leaves in March 2019. The UK said the document simply reflected the EU's ""stated directives"". EU could use single market as sanction against UK A quick guide to the Brexit transition phase Barnier's trade warning for the UK How soon are answers needed? It comes as further details emerged of the Treasury's estimates of the impact on the economy of Brexit. According to the leaked estimates, the UK car industry's GDP would shrink by 1% if the UK remained in the EU single market but would lose 8% if there was a free trade agreement and 8.5% if the UK left without a deal and went to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. MPs have also been allowed to see the impact assessments for their own regions. All regions will see their economies shrink, with the North East of England, the West Midlands, and Northern Ireland being the worst affected, according to the analysis. The North-East would be hit hardest - with staying in the single market and customs union shaving 3% off GDP, an 11% reduction under a free trade deal and 16% under a no-deal WTO scenario, London would fare the best, with reductions of 1%, 2% and 3.5% in each of the three scenarios. Scotland's estimated hit would be 2.5%, 6% or 9%. Wales would see reductions of 1.5%, 5.5% or 9.5%. Brexit-backing Conservative MP Jacob-Rees Mogg has accused Treasury officials of ""fiddling the figures"" to make all options but staying in the EU look bad, after the documents werefirst leaked to Buzzfeed last week,external. The government said its preferred option - a bespoke deal covering trade and financial services - was not among those analysed in the leaked paper. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May restated the government's position that the UK would be leaving the single market and customs union and insisted she would be ""robust"" in getting the best deal. ""As I've said right from the very beginning, we will hear noises off, we will hear all sorts of things being said, of positions being taken,"" she said. ""What matters is the positions that we take in the negotiations, as we sit down and negotiate the best deal. We've shown we can do that, we did it in December and we're going to do it again."" The tensions within the Conservative Party were underlined on Monday when pro-EU former minister Anna Soubry told the BBC Mrs May should ""sling out"" arch Brexiteers, and threatened to quit the party. This video can not be played Business Secretary Greg Clark says the UK is looking for tariff-free trade Eurosceptics have been calling for a ""clean"" separation with the EU so the UK has the freedom to strike new trade deals, while pro-EU MPs say the UK should retain the closest possible access to the single market. Former Chancellor Ken Clarke said Theresa May had to see ""where the majority of opinion"" was within the cabinet, offer some concessions and those who could not live with the agreed stance would have to resign. He told BBC Radio 4's Today he wanted the UK to keep ""most of the features of the customs union and the single market"" after the transition period and suggested Parliament would back such a move. The key Brexit dates in 2018 Brexit: All you need to know What are the UK's Brexit trade options? But fellow Conservative MP Bernard Jenkin said Mrs May had ""pushed back"" against that position, which he said was at odds with the government's stated position of achieving ""regulatory autonomy"". He told Today that ""no-one"" wanted a hard border on the island of Ireland or tariffs on trade between the UK and EU and it would be ""perverse"" if the EU ended up on insisting on them. The 11-member European Union Exit and Trade (Strategy and Negotiations) sub-committee is a key part of the government's decision-making process. Its members include Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Environment Secretary Michael Gove, who were at the forefront of the Leave campaign in the EU referendum, and Chancellor Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Amber Rudd, who campaigned for Remain. They are expected to discuss trade at another meeting on Thursday. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said this week there is ""not a moment to lose"" in finding a deal before the end of the year. Among those calling for more clarity on the UK's position is the British Chambers of Commerce, which has written to Mrs May asking for a ""clear, unequivocal statement of intent"". ""The perception amongst businesses on the ground, large and small alike, is one of continued division,"" it said. ""Even amongst the many optimistic, future-oriented firms - those who see opportunity in change - patience is wearing thin. Directly affected companies are poised to activate contingency plans. Many others, worryingly, have simply disengaged."" In response, Business Secretary Greg Clark said the UK's aims were very clear, namely tariff-free trade with the EU with a ""minimum of frictions"" in the years ahead. Meanwhile, former transport minister Stephen Hammond has urged the UK to consider rejoining the European Free Trade Association, which it left in 1972 prior to joining the then European Economic Community. Speaking in a debate in Parliament, he said membership of the free trade body - whose members are Iceland, Norway, Lichtenstein and Switzerland - was a ""sensible option"" which would give the UK the economic certainty and flexibility it wanted - although such an outcome has been rejected by ministers.

Poundland 'naughty' elf ad 'irresponsible',"Poundland has been told that the ads must not appear again in their current form A Poundland ad campaign that featured innuendo and depictions of sexual acts has been deemed ""irresponsible"" by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). The pre-Christmas social media posts featured a ""naughty"" toy elf and were published on Twitter and Facebook. One image featured the elf holding a tea bag in a suggestive pose with a plastic doll. The ASA ruled that this and eight other images breached itscode of practice for advertisers.,external The regulator pointed out that the images were available on ""ungated"" websites and therefore viewable by anyone, including children. Some of the posts may also have been seen as demeaning to women, the ASA added. Poundland's initial response to the complaints had been to state that the elf campaign was based on humour and double entendres, according to the ASA. The retailer also pointed out that Twitter and Facebook had policies that were designed to prevent under-13s from creating accounts on the websites. It also said that a Twitter poll of 12,000 respondents was 82% in favour of the campaign. ""They stated a large number of people found the campaign to be humorous, engaging, and in line with what it meant to be British,"" the ASA said. Poundland's naughty elf was so naughty that it attracted the censure of the Advertising Standards Authority However, the regulator decided against the retailer in the end. It said that because the ads had been shared widely on social media, they therefore would have been seen by ""a large number of people, including some children"" who did not actively follow the Poundland accounts. A 2017 Ofcom report,externalfound that nearly a quarter of eight to 11-year-olds now had a presence on social media sites. The ads were ""irresponsible and likely to cause serious or widespread offence"", said the ASA, which also revealed it had received 85 complaints about the Poundland campaign. In December,Poundland removed a box of Twinings tea bagsfrom one of the ads after the tea maker complained that the picture ""misuses our product"". At the time, Poundland's marketing director Mark Pym said, ""We're proud of a campaign that's only cost Â£25.53 and is being touted as the winning marketing campaign this Christmas!"" Poundland has been told that the images concerned must not appear again in their current form. Other new ASA rulings include: a ban of a Tunnock's Tea Cakes campaign that featured a female tennis player holding one of the cakes against her thigh. The watchdog said that combining the image with the phrase ""serve up a treat"" had objectified women and was socially irresponsible clearing Ryanair to describe itself as Europe's number one airline. There had been complaints that the claim was misleading in light of thousands of flight cancellations in 2017. But the ASA accepted that travel data for 2016 - the industry's most recent figures - showed Ryanair carrying more passengers than any other European airline Poundland's 'Naughty Elf' ad drops Twinings Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Pay gap 'widens as women get older',"The ONS found the gender pay gap was entirely in favour of men in every occupation. The difference between what men and women get paid widens as women get older, new research shows. TheOffice for National Statistics found,externalpay differences were smaller at younger ages, but increased from 40 onwards, reaching a peak between 50 and 59. It also found the gender pay gap was entirely in favour of men in every occupation. The government said it was taking action to address pay discrepancies. The ONS said the increased pay gap for older women could be explained by taking time out, possibly to have children. It added: ""When we modelled the factors that influence pay, the results showed that both men's and women's pay grow for most of their lives. ""Overall, women's pay grows less than men's and also stops growing earlier than men's pay. This applies to both the private and public sectors."" Mind the gender pay gap What is the gender pay gap like where you are? According to the agency, men's pay increased by 10.4% to an average rate of Â£14.48 an hour between 2011 and 2017. That compared with a 12% rise for women to Â£13.16. On average, men were paid Â£1.32 an hour more than women last year, a gap of 9.1%, according to the ONS. It found occupations with the smallest pay gap have almost equal employment levels between men and women. Dawn Butler, shadow minister for women and equalities, said the government was failing to tackle the gender pay gap. ""There is still a lot of progress to be made in terms of gender equality and achieving equal pay is one of them,"" she said. But a government spokesperson said it was committed to eliminating pay discrepancies. ""Action taken by this government means that we are one of the first countries in the world to require all large employers to publish their gender pay gap and bonus data.

UK 'could adopt Norway recycling system',"This video can not be played How Norway's bottle recycling scheme works A Scandinavian deposit-based system for recycling bottles is thought likely to be adopted in the UK. Advisers to government say the schemes have massively reduced plastic litter in the environment and seas. And a ministerial delegation has been to Norway to see if the UK should copy an industry-led scheme that recycles 97% of bottles. In the UK, figures show that only around half of all plastic bottles get recycled. Norway claims to offer the most cost-efficient way of tackling plastic litter. Plastic recycling: Your questions answered Seven charts that explain the plastic pollution problem UK faces build-up of plastic waste Curb 'devastating' plastic waste, MPs say The Norwegian government decided the best method would be to put a tax on every bottle that's not recycled - then leave the operating details of the scheme up to business. It works like this: The consumer pays a deposit on every bottle - the equivalent of 10p to 25p depending on size. They return it empty and post it into a machine which reads the barcode and produces a coupon for the deposit. If the careless consumer has left liquid in the bottle, the machine eats it anyway - but hands the deposit to the shopkeeper who'll need to empty the bottle. Similar schemes are in operation in other Nordic nations, Germany, and some states in the US and Canada. The managers of the Norway operation say it could easily be applied to the UK. In Norway, the deposit-return machine accepts only two types of plastic bottle, with approved labels and even approved glue to fix the labels. This allows the labels to be stripped easily, and simplifies recycling. In the UK, roadside collection of plastic bottles in Britain are bedevilled by contamination from rogue rubbish being put in the recycling container. Kjell Olav Maldum, chief executive of Infinitum which runs the Norway bottle scheme, told BBC News: ""There are other recycling schemes, but we believe ours is the most cost-efficient. ""We think it could be copied in the UK - or anywhere. ""Our principle is that if drinks firms can get bottles to shops to sell their products, they can also collect those same bottles."" Some would like to see a Norwegian-style scheme adopted in the UK Scotland has already committed to a deposit return scheme, without details so far. But politicians in Westminster have been more cautious amid lobbying by drinks manufacturers and fears from small shops about the administrative burden. In Norway, small shopkeepers are said to generally favour the deposit return system. They get paid a small fee for each bottle, and are also said to benefit from increased footfall from people returning bottles. Sajana Pariyar, who works at the Joker minimarket in central Oslo told me: ""It's a good thing. People return the bottle and with the money they get from it they buy things from us. ""It increases the number of people in our shops. It's good for business."" When we visited her store, a homeless man patiently fed a sack-full of bottles and cans into the mouth of the machine. He'd collected the containers from a nearby office, and raised Â£5 in the process. Food may influence cancer spread Graduate loses bid to sue Oxford over 2:1 degree Trudeau faces PC 'peoplekind' backlash But even in recycling-conscious Norway, some people still transgress. The worst offenders are youngsters quaffing energy drinks on the run to school. So some schools have now installed bottle collecting racks at the school gates to avoid plastic bottles going into general rubbish bins. The most virtuous consumers are older beer drinkers who can stash their cans at home before returning them later. Just 3% of Norway's plastic bottles elude the deposit return scheme, but even so the absolute numbers are high. This video can not be played Is it hygienic to reuse your plastic water bottle? Terje Skovly works at a municipal recycling scheme, ROAF, which collects the bins from 70,000 homes on the outskirts of Oslo. At his plant - a 3-D maze of conveyors and ramps - a steady stream of plastic bottles is isolated from other waste by infrared recognition. These bottles have been mixed with other waste during collection so they can't be used again for food grade packaging. They get down-graded into plastic furniture instead. ""I get angry when I see that,"" he told me as he glared at the bottle conveyor below us. ""Why are people so lazy that they can't be bothered to recycle a bottle? We should increase the deposit to 50p on a large bottle."" What was the value in lost deposits? I asked. He made a rough calculationâ¦ just under a million dollars. A year. With that amount of cash swilling around the scheme in spare change, it's little wonder that representatives of other nations are considering the advantages of going Norwegian. But even Norway's ultra-efficient recycling system can't compete with virgin plastic on cost. The problem, the recyclers say, is that the ingredients of plastic - oil and gas - are simply too cheap. The cost of each bottle is subsidised by a few pence by the manufacturer. This ultimately gets passed to the consumer. The operators of the scheme argue that it's more appropriate for people buying drinks to pay for them to be recycled, rather than have taxpayers foot the bill for cleaning up litter on beaches. The UK government's working party studying plastic waste will mention Norway as an example of a system working well. Members are also intrigued by the example of Lithuania, which is said to have achieved a 93% return rate in just three years. Samantha Harding, from the countryside group CPRE, has been campaigning against plastic litter for more than a decade. She told BBC News: ""It frustrates me when people say 'oh, they only recycle because they're Scandinavianâ¦ in the UK we're different.' ""Well, they're doing it in Germany too - and states in the US and Canada. Are they all the same, so are we different from all of them? ""The key is to get an economic incentive - put a deposit on the bottle and most people won't throw money away."" She applauded the Norwegian system of putting racks round bins in public places for discarded plastic bottles. ""People say they don't want to see homeless people rummaging through bins to get the deposit back on bottlesâ¦ why don't we make it easy for them?"" Ms Harding said one great advantage of deposit return schemes is that it obliges each part of the plastic chain to change their behaviour - from product concept to design; to manufacture; transport; use; and finally disposal. ""This is great because we've seen big firms campaigning against good schemes because it forced them to take more responsibility. We're in a crisis now - there's no room for that sort of thing,"" she said.

Casino mogul quits amid harassment claims,"US casino mogul Steve Wynn has stepped down as chairman and CEO of his Wynn Resorts company amid sexual misconduct allegations. A Wall Street Journal report alleged that the 76-year-old billionaire harassed massage therapists and forced one staff member to have sex with him. Mr Wynn denied any misconduct and called the story ""preposterous"". Last month Mr Wynn alsoresigned as finance chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC). ""In the last couple of weeks, I have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity,"" Mr Wynn said in a statement on Tuesday. ""As I have reflected upon the environment this has created, one in which a rush to judgment takes precedence over everything else, including the facts, I have reached the conclusion I cannot continue to be effective in my current roles,"" he said. Wynn Resorts owns and operates several casino complexes including Wynn Macau, Wynn and Encore Las Vegas, and Wynn Palace Cotai. Wynn Macau's shares were suspended from trading in Hong Kong following the firm's announcement on Tuesday.

Daily chats 'help dementia sufferers',"Spending just 10 minutes a day talking to people with dementia about their interests or family could help improve their quality of life, according to a study. Researchers carried out a nine-month trial in 69 care homes in England. One-to-one interaction, combined with personalised care, significantly reduced the residents' anger and agitation, the study found. The authors said other homes should try taking a more ""personal"" approach. Blood test finds toxic Alzheimer's proteins Nine dementia 'risk factors' identified The study,published in PLOS Medicine,external, involved more than 800 people with dementia across care homes in south London, north London and Buckinghamshire over a nine-month randomised controlled trial. Staff in the homes were trained to learn about their patients' interests and abilities and ask them and their families questions about the care they received. This led to care that was more personalised and incorporated an hour a week of social interaction. This could range from conversations about a patient's family, or interests such as sport, to helping them take part in activities like gardening or music. The study found improvements in quality of life, agitation, and neuropsychiatric symptoms, with the greatest benefits for people with moderately severe dementia. Prof Clive Ballard, of the University of Exeter medical school, who led the research, told the BBC: ""Often there's a lot of nihilism around dementia, that people think that it's really awful, which it is, but think there's nothing you can do about it. ""I think what this is suggesting is that actually relatively simple things, if implemented robustly, can actually make a real difference to people's quality of life."" In the absence of a cure for dementia, researchers said, it was important to find cost-effective treatments for the illness Prof Ballard said in many care homes residents receive as little as two minutes of social interaction a day. He said in many care homes social activities were done in groups, such as with bingo, which often left a number of residents unengaged. Interacting with them, and learning about their interests and abilities, not only improved the quality of their lives but also made them easier to deal with, he said. Prof Ballard said this could ultimately help reduce costs, both in care homes and the wider social care system. However, the study also highlighted problems with training in the care sector, Prof Ballard said. He said there were currently 170 carer training manuals available, but only four were based on evidence that really worked, with manuals often used because of their cost, rather than efficacy. ""That is simply not good enough - it has to change,"" he said. Dr Doug Brown, director of research at the Alzheimer's Society, said: ""This study shows that training to provide this type of individualised care, activities and social interactions can have a significant impact on the wellbeing of people living with dementia in care homes. ""It also shows that this kind of effective care can reduce costs, which the stretched social care system desperately needs."" Researchers said future work should look at how sustainable the treatment would be for care homes across the country. Dr Sara Imarisio, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""With 850,000 people living with dementia in the UK and that number set to rise, it is important that research into new drugs is coupled with other approaches that can help transform people's lives.""

Casino mogul Steve Wynn quits his company,"US casino mogul Steve Wynn has stepped down as chairman and CEO of his Wynn Resorts company amid sexual misconduct allegations. A Wall Street Journal report alleged that the 76-year-old billionaire harassed massage therapists and forced one staff member to have sex with him. Mr Wynn denied any misconduct and called the story ""preposterous"". Last month Mr Wynn alsoresigned as finance chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC). ""In the last couple of weeks, I have found myself the focus of an avalanche of negative publicity,"" Mr Wynn said in a statement on Tuesday. ""As I have reflected upon the environment this has created, one in which a rush to judgment takes precedence over everything else, including the facts, I have reached the conclusion I cannot continue to be effective in my current roles,"" he said. Wynn Resorts owns and operates several casino complexes including Wynn Macau, Wynn and Encore Las Vegas, and Wynn Palace Cotai. Wynn Macau's shares were suspended from trading in Hong Kong following the firm's announcement on Tuesday.

Asia markets follow Wall Street higherStocks in Asia rallied on Wednesday as investors returned to markets after a day of heavy losses.18m19 minutes agoBusiness,"Wall Street shares slipped on Wednesday, but were somewhat steadier than in recent days, which saw sharp trading swings. The Dow Jones dipped less than 0.1%, while the S&P 500 fell about 0.5% and the Nasdaq dropped 0.9%. Declines in technology and energy shares weighed on the markets, which have seen a sudden increase in volatility. Investors are worried by policy shifts, including higher interest rates. European stock markets also recovered ground on Wednesday, but a rally in Asia faded. Stock markets: Your questions answered The volatility marks a turn for the markets, which rose steadily for much of last year. But analysts and economists, who for months have forecast that rapidly-rising markets were due a correction, said investors should get used to choppier markets. ""It's not like this is going to be one and done,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for TD Ameritrade. Signs of volatility have been rising in recent weeks, as investors digest the impact of new tax cuts and tighter central banking policies, among other shifts. A US Labor Department report of strong wage growth in January triggered a market sell-off last week, as investors saw a sign that inflation could rise faster than expected and lead the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more quickly. The market plunge spread globally as investors rushed to redistribute assets in reaction to the shift. Wednesday's declines came after US lawmakers announced a budget deal, which would lift spending caps and could add to the inflationary pressures. Meanwhile, soft demand for US Treasuries at an auction on Wednesday sent yields higher - typically a signal of higher rates. London's FTSE 100 closed 1.9% higher, in Paris the Cac-40 rose by 1.8% and Frankfurt's Dax was up by 1.6%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index pulled back from early highs to add 0.2%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng lost 0.8%.  Australia's S&P/ASX 200 ended up 0.8% while South Korea's Kospi index dropped 2.3%. During this week's market mayhem you probably heard a lot about volatility - and in particular, this thing called the Fear Index, or Vix. But what is it? Technically, the Vix is a measure of the expected amount of gyration in stock prices on the S&P 500 over the next month. A low level indicates investors don't expect prices to fluctuate that much - a spike implies choppy waters ahead. But it's only recently that investors could trade on - or against - fear. Well, fear of change, specifically. The Vix, technically theCboe Volatility Index,external, was first launched in 1993. But you could only bet on it - using options - in 2006. A key thing about the Vix is that the volatility that the index predicts tends to be worse than actual volatility. In other words, we think the future will be worse than it is. That pessimism is something a group of investors have exploited - they bet that the future would be calmer than the Vix model suggested. And over the years, that has made them a lot of money. The only problem for them is when that calm evaporates, like now. US shares regain ground to close higher Stock markets: Your questions answered Did robots trigger the market plunge?

"US shares regain ground to close higherWall Street shares closed up after a turbulent day, swinging between positive and negative territory.2h2 hours agoBusinessComments","This video can not be played Why are share prices falling? US stock markets have ended a day of massive fluctuations on a high note, rebounding  after recent steep losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2.3%, while the Nasdaq hit 2.1% and the S&P 500 rose 1.7%. Stocks shuttled between positive and negative territory throughout the day, their activity spanning more than 1,000 points. On Monday, the Dow had plunged by nearly 1,200 points or 4.6%, triggering losses in Asia and Europe. ""I think what you're seeing today is, 'Hold on. This got overdone'. The fundamentals of the companies haven't changed since Friday,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at online brokerage TD Ameritrade. Analysts have said for months that the financial markets were due a correction after a long period of rising prices. Investors are also fretting over the prospect of rising interest rates, which push up borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The steep sell-off began last week after data in the US showed stronger than expected wage growth. The report came amid other shifts, including new tax cuts, trade tensions, and a sinking dollar, that analysts say could lead inflation to rise faster than expected. The conditions pose a challenge for the Federal Reserve, which will need to raise interest rates to counter inflation, without moving so aggressively that it severely curbs economic activity. It is not clear how the changing economic currents, including tax cuts, will affect company financials ultimately, said Michael Bapis, managing director of The Bapis Group at Hightower, a wealth management firm in New York. ""You're seeing that volatility now because there's uncertainty,"" he said. Earlier on Tuesday,Japan's Nikkei 225closed down 4.7%. Markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris had initial losses of up to 3%, before recovering some ground. London's FTSE 100closed down almost 200 points or 2.6% at 7141.Frankfurt's DaxandParis's CACwere down 2.3% and 2.4% respectively. On Monday the FTSE 100 closed at its lowest level since April of last year. The falls follow some good years for investors. In 2017 the Dow in the US was up 25% and London's FTSE 100 rose 7.6%. Live: Global stock markets slump Asia markets are following Wall Street's lead - but why? The 2018 economy: What to watch Monday's decline was the largest in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US. US markets opened sharply lower again on Tuesday, but quickly rebounded amid frantic trade that continued throughout the day. Analysts have said the swings in the US markets in part reflect big investors moving to sell stocks and put money in other assets, such as bonds, which benefit from higher interest rates. Other companies that had strategies betting on calm markets also had to adjust. What has driven the Dow's surge? US jobs and wages rise in January The US economy in six charts Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not think the declines were a sign of broader problems. ""There are no systemic issues,"" he told a congressional panel on Tuesday. ""I don't think these types of moves, given how much the market has rallied, have financial stability concerns."" Even if you don't own shares directly, the chances are that you will be paying into a pension which is invested in shares and bonds. More than nine million people in the UK have auto enrolment pensions, and 12 million are active members of defined contribution schemes. That means the value of the pension is dependent on the value of the investments in it. Similarly, anyone who owns shares or funds in an ISA or a SIPP will have seen the value of their savings fall. But experts point out that investments rise and fall over time, and over the longer term, it should make little difference. ""It is effectively no change for normal investors, in that you have ridden a wave on the way up, so now is not the time to cash in,"" said Rebecca O'Keefe, head of investment at Interactive Investor. ""This is unwelcome news, but it is fundamentally a not unexpected reaction to the euphoria that saw markets rise so fast."" If you are planning on retiring in the next couple of months, you will have a slightly smaller pension pot than you did at the start of the year. But coincidentally the FTSE 100 is at almost exactly the same place it was a year ago, so you won't have lost anything over that longer term. Furthermore if you have a while to go before you retire, the shares in your pension fund have just become cheaper to buy - so there is a greater chance of them increasing in value. But, as ever, future market trends are difficult to determine. ""Markets are capricious beasts in the short term, and, looking forward, stock prices could move in either direction without defying the laws of statistics,"" said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""However, in the long term, markets are more reliable in generating growth, and so anyone saving for retirement should still consider the stock market as a friend, not a foe."" An A-Z Guide to Business Beasts Analysts say that in the short term, investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets, but doubt whether there will be a prolonged period of selling. Jane Sydenham, investment director at the stockbrokers Rathbones, said the recent moves were a ""correction"" rather than a crash. ""What we have to remember is stock markets have had a very smooth ride upwards and we've not had a fall of more than 3% for 15 months. There's been a real lack of volatility, which is very unusual."" She added thatbear markets- when shares go into a long period of decline - tend to happen ahead of a recession and at the moment growth forecasts were being upgraded. And analyst Laith Khalaf, of Hargreaves Lansdown, pointed out that, despite the heavy falls on Wall Street, the benchmark Dow Jones share index is still 20% up on where it stood this time last year.

At its height, 80 firefighters were called in on Tuesday night to tackle the fire at the first-floor flat in the four-storey converted house in Holland Park Gardens. Paramedics said the man died at the scene despite resuscitation efforts. Eyewitnesses described how the fire, at about 21:45 GMT, spread to a second floor. Eight neighbouring properties were evacuated. The fire was brought under control shortly after 02:00 GMT. Photos on social media showed flames and smoke coming from the building.

Tesco faces Â£4bn equal pay claimWomen working in supermarkets demand equal treatment with higher paid men working in warehouses.1han hour agoBusiness,"This video can not be played Pam Jenkins says the men's and women's jobs are of ""equal value"" Tesco is facing Britain's largest ever equal pay claim and a possible bill running to Â£4bn. Thousands of women who work in Tesco stores could receive back pay totalling Â£20,000 if the legal challenge demanding parity with men who work in the company's warehouses is successful. Lawyers say hourly-paid female store staff earn less than men even though the value of the work is comparable. Tesco said it worked hard to ensure all staff were paid ""fairly and equally"". What you need to know about the gender pay gap Pay gap 'widens as women get older' Paula Lee, of Leigh Day solicitors told the BBC it was time for Tesco to tackle the problem of equal pay for work of equal worth. Her firm has been contacted by more than 1,000 Tesco staff and will this week take the initial legal steps for 100 of them. The most common rate for women is Â£8 an hour whereas for men the hourly rate can be as high as Â£11 an hour, she added. Cleaners vs Binmen -What is ""work of comparable value""? Since 1984 workers doing jobs that require comparable skills, have similar levels of responsibility and are of comparable worth to the employer, should also be rewarded equally, according to the law. Thus if you are a cleaner, lugging mops and buckets up and down staircases, you may have a case for being paid the same as co-workers collecting rubbish bins. It doesn't matter whether the cleaner or the shop floor worker is male or female, they may still have a case to see their pay upped to match colleagues doing other jobs. But in practice many of the poorer paid jobs have been done by women. Key moments in the fight for equal pay Ms Lee said it was a problem that had been ""hiding in plain sight"" for years and that while there was no suggestion that Tesco had intentionally been underpaying women, historical divisions between male and female roles had led to the pay differential. ""We believe an inherent bias has allowed store workers to be underpaid over many years,"" she said. ""In terms of equal worth to the company there really should be no argument that workers in stores, compared to those working in the depots, contribute at least equal value to the vast profits made by Tesco. ""The law has been there since 1984 - you can compare with a different job. ""That's 34 years to put your house in order; that's 34 years of having the advantage of paying unequally, 34 years of you making pay decisions and making financial decisions and 34 years hiding what is in open sight."" Leigh Day said that up to 200,000 supermarket workers could be affected, the majority of them women. Initial claims have been lodged with the conciliation service, ACAS - the first stage in what is likely to be a lengthy legal process through the employment tribunal system which could last several years. If even a small proportion of the women are successful, the bill for Tesco would be significant. Birmingham City Council is now liable for over Â£1bn pounds in payments after settling an equal pay claim from women employed as cleaners, cooks and carers. Their pay was below men in comparable jobs such as bin collectors and road workers. Leigh Day is also fighting similar actions against rival supermarket groups Asda and Sainsbury's on behalf of shop floor workers. In 2016,an employment tribunal ruledthat 9,500 women who work at Asda  on check-outs or stacking shelves, could compare themselves to higher paid men who work at warehouses. Asda is currently appealing the ruling. Tesco said that all their staff could progress equally and were paid fairly, whatever their gender or background. ""We are unable to comment on a claim that we have not received,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Tesco has always been a place for people to get on in their career, regardless of their gender, background or education, and we work hard to make sure all our colleagues are paid fairly and equally for the jobs they do."" Two workers for Tesco told the BBC they wanted fair treatment, arguing that their jobs in the stores were as demanding as warehouse jobs. Pam Jenkins has been working for Tesco for 26 years. ""I think that we should be brought up to their [the men's] level,"" she told me. ""Obviously the jobs are slightly different but to put it bluntly they are of equal value. ""We deal with customers, they [the men] don't have to. We load, we take the stock and we load the stock, they take it off the lorry and we load it onto the shelves. ""Women have been fighting for equal rights and their voice to be heard for 100 years, we are not just doing it for us, there are many people out there. ""We are just trying to put things right and it's a shame we are still having to fight in this day and age."" Kim Element has been working for Tesco for 23 years. ""Although we think we have equal rights, there are times where there are discrepancies and you can't explain them,"" she said. ""And I think Tesco's are one of many companies that aren't addressing the fact that women seem to still be paid less."" Ms Lee said that Tesco was a good employer, signing up to a number of gender equality projects over a number of years. But she said the company - along with many others - was still failing to reward people equally. The criteria that the courts use to compare jobs in these cases aren't precisely pre-defined. But the starting point is to send in an independent expert to do a job evaluation study. That expert scores each of the roles under consideration including considerations such as how demanding they are physically, mentally and emotionally. If they involve working in the cold, or facing customer complaints, or if they require technical know-how, qualifications, responsibility for other staff or enhanced communication skills, that will push up their value. If the roles are comparable the case can then go to an employment tribunal, but there's still scope for the employer to argue that there's another reason the pay differs: if workers in those jobs have been there longer, or have more professional experience for example. While individuals can bring cases, It is much easier to bring such claims if you're part of a group. ""You need momentum behind the claim. That opens the doors,"" says Leigh Day's spokesperson. ""It forces them to be transparent and give information to a tribunal which you may not get on a one to one basis."" What is the gender pay gap?

Christmas Day homeless helper finedLee Williamson pulled into a bus stop to give a homeless man food and clothes and was later fined Â£70.9h9 hours agoLeicester,"Lee Williamson said he pulled in to a bus stop to give a homeless man clothes, food, and to chat to him A man who pulled in to a bus stop on Christmas Day to help a homeless man was fined by a council. Lee Williamson, of Evington, Leicester, said he stopped to give a homeless man a blanket, hat, gloves, scarf, food, and chat to him. He later received a Â£70 fine, despite there being no buses on 25 December. Leicester City Council said the camera enforcement was an important safety measure after acyclist died there in 2016. Mr Williamson, 43, said: ""I feel like I am being punished for helping someone - Â£70 could have put a homeless guy in a B&B for a week. ""Normally that is a busy road and I would never dream of stopping in a bus stop. But with it being Christmas Day, with no traffic and buses I could not see the harm in it."" War veteran Mr Williamson said it is normally a busy road and he would ""never dream"" of stopping in a bus stop He added that he wished the council could have ""a little more discretion and common sense"". ""I am not going to pay it. They will have to take me to court,"" he said. City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said: ""While buses may not be operating on Christmas Day, there is every likelihood that cyclists and other traffic will be using this stretch of road and stopping illegally in this area should still be considered dangerous. ""While we do recognise the good intentions in this instance, ample safe and legal parking was available within just a few metres of the bus clearway.""

Does being called Emmeline change your life?,"On the centenary of some British women winning the right to vote, 100 Women speaks to six women who share their first name with suffragette leader Emmeline Pankhurst. Spread across the globe, from Kigali to Sao Paulo, they all say their name has made them more inclined to fight for women's rights, even if they weren't originally named after the feminist icon. I am 40 this year, so experiencing my own big anniversary, in a way. I remember as a child being very proud of being born on on the 60th anniversary of limited suffrage and the 50th of full suffrage. I am fairly sure I ended up such a loudmouthed feminist because of my early childhood fascination with Pankhurst and what she represented. My mum said she'd always hoped that naming me after Pankhurst would produce a strong and powerful person. I wasn't a child that was afraid to have an opinion - even when I was little I would challenge my mum's friends if they said things that I didn't think were OK. Kids like seeing their names in books so every time I saw a reference to Pankhurst I got excited - it's not really taught as part of our history syllabus. And whilst I hated it as an awkward early teenager because it made me different, it made me aware of the responsibility that Emmelines have to be a force for good. I started a blog in 2014 to document my journey in giving up drinking, but after a while I got bored of writing about alcohol and started writing about feminism and self esteem.""Consent: Not Actually That Complicated"" was one of those weekly blogs,,externallike many I had written before, but for some reason it caught people's attention, and when I woke up in the morning my little blog had gone viral. It feels amazing to have written something that has started so many conversations about sex and consent. I am currently doing a history masters degree part-time in gender, sexuality and culture, and realising there is so much more to the women's movement than just the fight for suffrage. The downside to my name is there's never anything in a gift shop with Emmeline on! I had a great aunt who was called Emmeline, born around the turn of the century. I've always been very inspired by the name -  I like the idea of a feisty female role model who fought for women's rights. From a young age I always knew about Emmeline Pankhurst and last year for International Women's Day everyone in the office nominated a woman who inspired them for a photo wall and I put Emmeline Pankhurst up as my woman. I work for Dfid (UK Department for International Development) and have been in Kigali for almost four years, working as a social development adviser. I do a lot of work on gender and equality and women's empowerment. I don't think anyone in Rwanda knows who Pankhurst is - I think she's very much a figure of British history. Interestingly Rwanda ranks number one on the Gender Representation Index, due to the high proportion of women in parliament - far above the UK. In Rwanda 62% of parliamentarians are female and there are several powerful female ministers in government, but gender-based violence remains widespread and accepted, and in contrast to the large proportion of female parliamentarians, at the local level only 10% of mayors are women. Soon I'm being posted to Mozambique to work on an innovative programme empowering adolescent girls and women - where the situation for women is much more challenging, with high rates of child marriage, teenage pregnancy and much weaker female political representation. I think it's nice to have a name that has a story behind it. I actually named my daughter after Isolde in the story Tristan and Isolde and my son after Prince Caspian by CS Lewis. Christabel Pankhurst worked alongside her mother in the campaign to get women the vote I am the only Emmeline that I know. My mother searched in a name book and it said ""industrious and striving"". She said that she had heard of Emmeline Pankhurst - she didn't study her in the history syllabus but she knew she was an important person in history. I would have really loved to have learned about her - when I was younger I would search online to see if there were any other Emmelines out there and her name would come up first. I think looking back now I would say that it did have an impact on me - I am fairly outspoken and I do seek fairness in certain situations. There is a fine line between feminism and sexism - and in Asia those who aren't well versed with the term would relate it to a woman who was outspoken or demanding of more than they should. But it really is about having a voice in gender equality and creating a level playing field in terms of salary and equal opportunities. That is what feminism is ultimately, so if you were to ask me if I was a feminist then yes I would say I am. About 10 years ago I represented Malaysia for Miss World. I think these days it's a really good platform for women to speak out about the domestic issues in their country. In recent years there have been more women speaking up about women's rights and providing platforms for abused women in bad relationships or domestic violence, but the problem at the moment is there are not enough shelters provided to help these people. It would be good if the government would step up and provide more funding. There are more women-only facilities now - like women-only car parks closer to the entrance of shops, and they have train cabins that are women only. I think there should be more of it - you want to feel safe. It's a bit sad that it's necessary, but it's a good fix for now. I don't think Emmeline Pankhurst was the only reason my mum named me Emmeline - she liked the name and she never raised me saying 'you're named after Emmeline Pankhurst', but she was very interested in the suffragettes and she would describe herself as a feminist, so I think it played a part. People often say to me, 'That's a really beautiful name', and sometimes they'd say, 'Were you named afterthat Hot Chocolate song,external?' Very few people thought it might have been because of Pankhurst but I've always enjoyed that it gave me the opportunity for me to say, 'My mum's a feminist and was a fan of Pankhurst'. It was a start to a conversation about it. When we were growing up in the 1990s [in the UK] there was less talk about feminism than there is now - my mum talked about these ideas in the home but outside the home they weren't talked about. I studied GCSE history and we studied that time - and the suffragettes just came up as a sentence or a paragraph in our notes in a two-year course. It really was just a sentence of history. To think it's only 100 years ago - it's extraordinary because as you get older your sense of time and history changes. I would say I'm a feminist but I would like to not have to say that about myself. I want to be able to live in a world where I don't have to make that statement in order to get my rights. I think it's an amazing time for women but I believe that people just have to keep having conversations with themselves and with their friends, partners, with their sons and daughters. The only way things really change is when everyone is included in these conversations. It feels very media focused and that the media tends to polarise everything and that doesn't reflect in any way my own reality and my experience of talking to other people in my life. If you respect the opinions of others, people are also happy to listen to your point of view. It's these conversations that can help lead to change. My mum's told me I was named after Emmeline Pankhurst and it's always been important to me - the equality of both genders - and I really feel that's part of my character. I do feel there's a level of expectation to meet the fact I was named after her - especially when it comes to feminist issues. I feel it's important to stand up and talk about these things. My mum talked about the difference between when she was younger compared to when I was young- the opportunities to go abroad, to take on different career options, the flexibility for women to participate in all these different career options, and I've always tried to take those opportunities. But when I talk about Emmeline Pankhurst it's usually older generations (40-somethings onwards) who know who she is - I normally get blank faces from people younger than that. It is an unusual name here. The first choice was Larissa but my parents had a neighbour who had a daughter called Larissa and they didn't get on with each other so they decided to choose another name. And then my dad read Emmeline by Judith Rossner. It's a really good book. It's about a little girl who needed to leave her home and move to Massachusetts when she was 13 years old, to help her parents survive financially. It's kind of a sad story but she learned a lot about life really early on and the way that the author wrote it is really interesting. My parents weren't aware of the link with Emmeline Pankhurst. They have never left Brazil. But I like the fact that I share her name. I think it sounds like a strong name. Maybe I have been inspired by it. I left home at 21 and I live in Sao Paulo alone. I could develop my career far away from the family home and comfort zone. And I am a volunteer ina group called Startup Weekend Women,external- we have more than 1,000 girls in this movement for women in tech - we help people transform ideas into business. Feminism is growing in Brazil. Because the tech environment is very male that's my vision - we are getting strong about female inclusion and I think it's getting better.

"Actresses, arsonists and aristocrats: Women who won the vote","Before 1918 no women were allowed to vote in parliamentary elections. It took the extraordinary actions of ordinary women to bring the issue to the forefront of politics; women who were prepared to go to prison, to go on hunger strike, to be force fed - just to achieve parity with men. Two branches emerged - thesuffragistsused peaceful tactics such as non-violent demonstrations, petitions and the lobbying of MPs; while thesuffragettes'methods were more militant, smashing windows and setting fire to buildings. Most people have heard of the poster girls of women's suffrage, such as Emily Wilding Davison and the Pankhursts, but here are some of the lesser-known women - and men - who dedicated themselves to the cause. Lilian Lenton photographed in a prison exercise yard, and newspaper coverage of her escape and arrest Lilian Lenton, a firm believer in the suffragettes' motto ""deeds not words"", had an ambition of burning down at least two buildings a week. She trained as a dancer when she left school but became a suffragette as soon as she turned 21. She quickly became famous for her ability to escape from the authorities. Moving from her hometown of Leicester to London, early in 1913 she began a series of arson attacks in the capital. Her object was to bring the country into crisis, showing that it was impossible to govern those who did not want to be governed. She was arrested in February 1913 for setting fire to the Tea House at Kew Gardens and in Holloway prison went on hunger strike before being forcibly fed. The process, which involved stuffing a tube through her nose and down her throat, caused her to become seriously ill as she breathed food into her lungs. She was quickly released. The authorities did not want a martyr. You can hear Lilian Lenton speaking here However, her time in jail only made her more determined. She continued her campaign of arson and was soon jailed again in Leeds before being released under the""Cat and Mouse Act"",externalwhen she went on hunger strike. A prison report from 1913, which describes Lenton's general conduct as 'bad, very defiant' and details how she was put in a special cell after smashing the first one up Fearing she would be rearrested once recovered, she fled the city in a delivery van, dressed as an errand boy. Taxis took her to Harrogate and then Scarborough from where she escaped to France in a private yacht, although she soon returned to Britain, setting fire to things again. This act of evasion earned her the nickname of ""the Leicester Pimpernel"". A newspaper cutting from May 1914 describes how she evaded capture. ""She led the police a merry dance up and down the country for several weeks while she changed her disguises. Harrogate, Scarborough and Dundee were a few of the towns she visited. She also stayed at Cardiff. There she was nearly caught, but by disguising herself as an infirm old lady, with a black shawl over her head, she hobbled into the station and travelled to London"". During World War One, she served in Serbia with a hospital unit and was awarded a French Red Cross medal. After the war the Representation of the People Act 1918 was passed, awarding the vote to women householders or the wives of householders, aged 30 and over. Lenton, who was unmarried and did not own a home, was unimpressed by this concession. ""I hadn't either a husband or furniture, although I was over 30,"" she said. She died aged 81, in 1972. Elizabeth Robins was a successful actor Elizabeth Robinswas an American actor and playwright brought up by her grandmother after her mother was committed to an insane asylum. She married an actor and was far more successful than him - he eventually killed himself by jumping into a river, leaving a note to her saying: ""I will not stand in your light any longer."" Robins came toLondon in 1891 to play the lead in Ibsen's,externalHedda Gabler, becoming the pre-eminent Ibsen actress of her day. By 1906 she had begun to focus on women's suffrage as a subject for drama. In the autumn she wroteVotes for Women!,externalin which one of the main characters is based on suffragette leader Christabel Pankhurst. The play was a success and performed all over the country. She later adapted it into a book - The Convert - which is still in print. Robins took the production to New York and Rome, helping to spread the message. She gave some of the proceeds to the suffragette movement. As suffragette militancy increased, she wrote articles and letters in support. Other than her brief marriage, she remained single. Highly intelligent, she was welcomed into London's literary and artistic circles, enjoying friendships with George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde, and Henry James. She continued to campaign on feminist issues for the rest of her life, even turning her house into a convalescent home for overworked professional women. She was also a driving force behind the founding of the New Sussex Hospital for Women and Children. Margaret Bondfieldwas one of very few working class women who rose to the top of the suffrage movement. Born in Chard, Somerset, in 1873, the second youngest of eleven children, she became an apprentice at a drapers in Brighton aged 14. There she saw how the daily grind wore down the women workers and affected their self-respect. She observed they were left with little time or energy to pursue interests away from work, with many girls seeming intent on getting married as early as possible in order to escape the drudgery. Ms Bondfield left Brighton and went to live with her brother in London - working, again, in a shop. She became an active trade unionist and was shocked by the working culture of long hours, low wages, poor diet and requirement to ""live in"" in often dismal dormitories. She co-founded the first trade union for women, the National federation of Women Workers, and later recalled how one irate grocer ""read a recruitment leaflet, tore it up and stamped on the bits"", shouting: ""Union indeed! Go home and mend your stockings!"" By 1910, she was working as an advisor to the Liberal government - helping to influence the Health Insurance Bill, giving improved maternity benefits to mothers, and working to further gender equality. In 1923 she became one of the first female MPs, winning Northampton for Labour, and in early 1924, she made history when she was appointed as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Labour - the first woman ever to become a government minister. In 1929 she was made Minister of Labour herself - the first time that a woman had been made a British cabinet minister. She remained a staunch Labour supporter until her death at the age of 80. Clement Attlee, the leader of the party and former prime minister, gave the address at her funeral. The Pankhurst Anthem How the BBC is marking the 1918 centenaries Frederick and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence were both prominent suffragettes Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence and her husband Fred were a suffragette power couple. Emmeline Pethickhad a strong social conscience and worked with working class girls in London to improve their living standards and employment prospects.Frederick Lawrencewas a barrister from a wealthy family, who had aspirations to become a Liberal MP. When the pair fell in love, Miss Pethick refused to marry him until he became a socialist. The couple agreed to combine their names, but continue to hold separate bank accounts. His money and her organisational skills helped the Women's Social and Political Union, the radical organisation led by Mrs Pankhurst, rise to prominence. Campaigns were planned at their country home, which was also used as a place where women released from prison could recuperate, and together they ran the publicationVotes for Women. Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence came up with the colours of purple, white and green to represent the suffragettes: ""Purple as everyone knows is the royal colour, it stands for the royal blood that flows in the veins of every suffragette, the instinct of freedom and dignityâ¦ white stands for purity in private and public lifeâ¦ green is the colour of hope and the emblem of spring."" After World War One, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence became an international campaigner for women's rights and peace. Her husband became a Labour MP, and in 1945, a peer. But, as influential and helpful as they were, the Pethick-Lawrences fell out with Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst, who preferred militant action. The couple disapproved of the campaign to smash windows, but because of their involvement with the group, they were arrested, charged with conspiracy and jailed for nine months. Both went on hunger strike, both were force-fed. Mrs Pethick-Lawrence said: ""If the government was naive enough to believe the nasal tube or the stomach pump, the steel gag, the punishment cell, handcuffs and the straight jacket would break the spirit of women who were determined to win the enfranchisement of their sex, they were again woefully misled"". The courts also took the contents of their home to pay for the cost of the windows. Just as damaging were the prosecution costs. Bailiffs were called in and the couple only narrowly avoided bankruptcy. When the WSPU planned to move on to campaigns of arson, the Pethick-Lawrences objected. Christabel Pankhurst then arranged for them to be expelled from the the organisation. ""Christabel made it quite clear that she had no further use for us,"" Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence later recalled. Despite being pushed to one side, the Pethick-Lawrences continued to campaign for equality. In 1928, theEqual Franchise Act,externalgranted equal voting rights to all women and men aged 21 or over. At a celebratory gathering, Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence thanked the government for the new law, saying: ""We have fought a good fight.""
