Morrisons scraps 'use by' date on milk to cut waste,"Supermarket Morrisons is to scrap 'use by' dates on most of its milk in a move it says will stop millions of pints being poured down the sink. The retailer will instead place 'best before' on 90% of its own-brand milk and encourage customers to use a sniff test to check quality. Recycling charity Wrap said Morrisons was the first supermarket to make the move, which starts later this month. Ian Goode, senior milk buyer at Morrisons, said it was a ""bold step"". Milk is the third most wasted food and drink product in the UK, after potatoes and bread, with around 490 million pints wasted every year, according to Wrap. It also estimates 85 million pints of milk waste may be due to customers following 'use by' labels, despite research showing it can be used days after the date. Morrisons believes the move could save seven million pints of its own-brand milk being poured away each year. 'Use by' are the dates until which perishable food can be cooked and consumed safely. 'Best before' on food is guidance for when the product should be consumed to get the best quality, taste and texture. Morrisons said its research showed that milk does not need to be labelled as a perishable food. ""The dates on the milk will stay the same - it is what we are asking customers to do which is changing,"" the supermarket said. Mr Goode said: ""Wasted milk means wasted effort by our farmers and unnecessary carbon being released into the atmosphere. ""Good quality, well-kept milk has a good few days life after normal 'use by' dates - and we think it should be consumed, not tipped down the sink. ""So we're taking a bold step today and asking customers to decide whether their milk is still good to drink. Generations before us have always used the sniff test - and I believe we can too."" This video can not be played Five tricks for longer food freshness Marcus Gover, of Wrap, said: ""I am delighted that Morrisons is the first UK supermarket to take this important step to help reduce household food waste - it shows real leadership and we look forward to more retailers reviewing date labels on their products and taking action."" Morrisons has already scrapped 'use by' dates across some of its own-brand yogurt and hard cheese ranges. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) said it was alright to have 'use by' or 'best before' on milk depending on the processing and type. But there must be clear labelling, and the dates printed on all food and drink must be based on ""robust evidence about the product concerned"". The FSA also pointed out that when dealing with food generally, sniffing is not an appropriate safety test, especially with products that could cause food poisoning.

Cutting isolation to five days helpful - Zahawi,"This video can not be played Nadhim Zahawi says plans to cut self-isolation to five days are still under review Cutting the Covid self-isolation period to five days would ""certainly help"", a cabinet minister has said. Nadhim Zahawi also denied the government planned to stop supplying free lateral flow tests - after a report in a Sunday paper. People who test positive for Covid are required to self-isolate for at least seven days, but several sectors are experiencing staffing pressure. Mr Zahawi told the BBC the country was on the road ""from pandemic to endemic"". He said reducing the self-isolation period would help with staff absences in the workplace. Asked about exams, the education secretary said they would be going ahead but said there was also contingency planning. On the idea of stopping free lateral flow tests Mr Zahawi, a former vaccines minister, said he did not recognisethe Sunday Times report,external, saying the government had ordered 425 million lateral flow devices in January. ""We are not calling to an end free lateral flow tests,"" he said. Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? Look familiar? How rapid tests changed the pandemic Covid isolation cut from 10 days to seven with tests The US recently shortened the self-isolation window to five days, and the education secretary said it was important to remember that in the UK isolation begins when you get symptoms while in the US it starts from when you test positive. Mr Zahawi told BBC One's Sunday Morning that the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) had said that there might be a higher spike if the period was cut from seven to five days. He said the government would follow the science but would keep the potential measure under review. Rules on self-isolation for people in England infected with Covid changed last month,dropping from 10 days' quarantine to sevenif they test negative on days six and seven. Scottish Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said his governmentwas ""not contemplating"" reducing the isolation timeto five days at this stage, having just made the change from 10 to seven days. ""I think it would be sensible to see the impact,"" he said. With vaccines and new treatments reducing the risk Covid presents, what's considered proportionate changes because of the need to balance the harms caused by the virus and those caused by trying to suppress it. Take the isolation period, infectiousness is not like a switch. It doesn't just go on to off. Instead, people gradually move from peak infectiousness to lower infectiousness. As we become more able to live with the virus because it's causing milder illness, the benefits of long isolation periods wane. But the costs in terms of missing school or disrupting work remain. Slowly, but surely, we will see a rowing back of the remaining measures in place. Plans are understood to have been drawn up within government to start this as early as March, but the rise of Omicron set that back. There are several steps that could be taken. Shortening the isolation period further and then ending it unless an individual has symptoms is one. Dismantling PCR testing infrastructure in the community is another. These lab tests are needed to keep an eye on variants, but that can be done by testing hospital patients. Before Mr Zahawi said there were no plans to end free lateral flow tests opposition politicians had criticised the suggestion free tests might be stopped. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said such a move would be an ""utterly wrongheaded"" approach to dealing with coronavirus. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said ending free tests would be the wrong policy at the wrong time, adding that the best way to prevent the need for further restrictions was to ensure that people could test regularly and stop passing on the virus. ""That's why we believe those lateral flow tests have got to remain free whilst we have huge numbers of cases on a daily basis,"" she said. This video can not be played Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says there will be no end to free lateral flow tests Mr Zahawi also accepted more school staff will end up off work isolating for coronavirus as case rates rise when pupils return. He said staff absences were at about 8.5% last week but ""will increase, no doubt, because now schools are back we're going to see an increase in infection rates"". Contingency plans are being made for rising numbers of staff being off, the education secretary said, adding that some schools had remained open despite up to 40% of staff being absent. He said that ""exams in January are going ahead"" and ""in the summer we will be going ahead with GCSEs and A-levels"". But he added that there was ""always contingency planning"". There have been issues with staff absences in transport, health and schools as Covid cases rose over the festive period and in England Covid-related staff absences at hospitalshave risen sharply since Omicron took hold last month. And the boss of one of London's busiest hospitals has said he isworried about losing staff when mandatory vaccination rules come infrom April. It comes as the UK recorded 141,472 new cases, as well as 97 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - although the number of deaths recorded over weekends tends to be lower because of reporting delays. The total number of cases over the past seven days is up 6.6% on the previous week, while the figure for deaths is up 30.9%. Are you a business owner?

No fans at Six Nations may cost capital millions,"About 100,000 people descend of Cardiff city centre for rugby internationals If Six Nations rugby games aren't held in Cardiff it will be financially devastating, businesses say. Wales are due to play three fixtures in the capital, but Welsh Covid rules state fans are not allowed to attend sports events. TheWelsh Rugby Union has considered playing its home games in Englandwhere crowds are allowed. Wales' daily Covid case average is 10,500, and the first minister is reviewing restrictions weekly. Mark Drakeford warned the ""storm of Omicron has arrived in Wales"" and the country had ""a tough few weeks ahead"", as he announced Covid rules would remain in Wales. But after almost two years of Covid restrictions, business owners have warned not having a big Six Nations rugby pay day could be the final straw for hospitality. What are the new Covid rules for the UK? What tests do I need to go on holiday? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? The City Arms pub, opposite the Principality Stadium, would normally be full on a match day. ""Millions will be drained from the local economy as it has done over Christmas, and it just can't continue like this,"" said Gary Corp, who runs the City Arms. The Principality Stadium's city centre location helps make Cardiff an attractive destination for sports fans ""We missed out on some of our most profitable nights of the year,"" he said. He said the City Arms would normally make about Â£15,000 on a rugby day, but if Wales does not play in Cardiff, he would ""be lucky"" to make Â£2,000. Rugby fans enjoy the hospitality of Cardiff outside the City Arms pub near the Principality Stadium ""I've never known a time like this,"" Mr Corp added. ""If no fans were allowed into the ground during the Six Nations, it would be devastating for us."" The Principality Stadium's unique position in the heart of Cardiff's city centre makes it a favourite with travelling sports fans and the hospitality businesses around it, rely on supporters either popping in for drink, having a meal or staying the night. Research estimated each Six Nations game played in Cardiff boosts Wales' economy by more than Â£20m with former sponsor RBS estimating the 2017 tournament - where Wales played two games at home - brought Wales Â£52m worth of revenue. Wales' first 2022 Six Nations game at their 74,000 Cardiff arena is against Scotland on Saturday, 12 February. They later play France and Italy in March. The last time Scottish rugby fans were in Wales was before their 2020 Six Nations fixture was postponed just before the first Covid lockdown ""February to March can be a slow time for cities and for the retail sector like hotels and restaurants, these games are important,"" said economist Prof Max Munday of Cardiff University. ""Where the fans are coming from is worth bearing in mind as people who are staying here - like from Scotland, France and Italy - like to spend more money than perhaps day-trippers from England."" Scott Gibbs scores in a famous win in the last time Wales played a home game outside of Wales at Wembley in 1999 The Pontcanna Inn, near the stadium, normally puts up travelling rugby fans. ""Six Nations international weekends are the busiest of the year for us,"" said supervisor Lowri Davies. Welsh rugby welcomed back fans after 18 months for games in the summer of 2021 ""This year, there are a few bookings for the first weekend, and then it gets busier. However, if the rules stay the same for supporters, those bookings will more than likely be cancelled. ""We were used to seeing 500 people in, the bar is packed full, and we have waiting lists for rooms. ""We'd ideally like to see it back to where it was pre-Covid in terms of numbers, but we don't see it happening for more than one reason. Owners have said customer confidence of going out to bars post Christmas has dropped amid rising Covid levels ""The rules are part of the reason, but also, people choose to stay away. We saw that over Christmas, people just don't come out as they did."" Wales' daily Covid case average has risen to almost 10,500 a day - which has almost doubled inside a week - and Mr Drakeford has warned Wales' currentrestrictions will remain in place for several weeks,external. Each home game gives the Welsh Rugby Union a Â£7m boost. Robert Rice's family has run a Welsh gifts shop in Cardiff for 40 years. ""Internationals, without fail, are the big days for us,"" he said. ""Specifically, the France and Scotland games are ones we look forward to. They are the best weekends of the year. They are the assured massive boosts that we need after the winter. Call to end 'cosy relationship' of beer and rugby Rugby fans asked to wear masks at Wales match What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? ""The French weekend specifically every two years tops everything for the rest of the year. Not having those weekends would be absolutely tragic for us. ""It highlights how important international weekend are for us. In 40 years we've seen nothing like this."" This video can not be played Wales' health minister would be âdisappointedâ if Wales' 2022 Six Nations games were played in England Any decision on Six Nations matches is unlikely to be resolved soon, with the first minister telling a press conference on Friday it would not be clear if it would be ""safe"" to allow fans to return for a ""couple of weeks"". ""We have to see the tide turn on the Omicron wave,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""Then if the model is accurate and we see the numbers coming down reasonably rapidly, then we will be in a position to see whether it is safe to see greater social mixing."" However, Mr Drakeford did not criticise the WRU for looking at options, including moving the games across the border, but said it was ""debatable"" if cases were still high. ""I think that is perfectly legitimate for them as a multi-million pound organisation, that has to think about its business as well as its sporting interests,"" he said. On Sunday, he told Sky News he hoped there was a ""sensible, pragmatic"" way to stop Chester FCfalling foul of Welsh Covid laws. He said he had asked ""senior officials"" to talk to the club, police and the local authority which owns the ground which straddles the Wales and England border. ""I'm sure there is a sensible pragmatic solution here that doesn't mean that the club is placed in jeopardy, but doesn't result in the law being broken either,"" he told Sky News.

New York apartment block fire kills 19,"This video can not be played Watch: Fire is a ""horrific, painful moment"" for New York, says Mayor Eric Adams At least 19 people, including nine children, have died after a fire in a New York apartment building. Another 32 people were sent to hospital, several of whom are in a critical condition, according to New York Mayor Eric Adams. Fire department Commissioner Daniel Nigro said they had found victims on every floor of the 19-storey block, saying the smoke was ""unprecedented"". He told NBC News the death toll was the worst seen in New York for 30 years. It comes days afteran apartment fire in Philadelphia killed 12, with eight children among the dead. Sunday's fire broke out in an apartment that spans the second and third floors of the Bronx apartment block at about 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT), officials said. Some 200 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze, which officials believe was sparked by a malfunctioning electric heater. Commissioner Nigro said there were two floors of fire, but the smoke had spread everywhere. The local fire chief said the blaze was ""unprecedented"" Victims were found on every floor of the building The door to the apartment where the fire started was left open, and smoke then spread to every floor, Commissioner Nigro told reporters. ""Members found victims on every floor in stairwells and were taking them out in cardiac and respiratory arrest,"" he said. In a virtual news conference on Monday, Andrew Ansbro, the president of the firefighters' union, said the building was ""well-known in that area, for having difficult fires"", noting that its fire protection rules with regard to sprinklers and self-closing doors may have been different from those of the city. He claimed it was because the building had previously received federal subsidies and therefore was not required to follow the same fire codes. Mr Ansbro also said that Covid-19 had affected the staffing levels of first responders. George King, who lives nearby, told AFP news agency people were waving from the windows as the flames took hold. ""I saw the smoke, a lot of people were panicking,"" he said. ""You could see that no-one wanted to jump from the building."" Dozens of people have been injured A total of 63 people suffered injuries, including the 32 taken to hospital.Thirteen are in a critical condition, Stefan Ringel, a senior adviser to the mayor, told AP news agency.,external ""The impact of this fire is going to bring a level of pain and despair to our city,"" Mr Adams told reporters. ""The numbers are horrific."" He told CNN on Monday that the incident was ""a wake-up call for all our buildings"" to ensure complaints are heard and protective measures are working. New York Governor Kathy Hochul called Sunday's events ""a night of tragedy"", and pledged to create a victims' compensation fund to support survivors. ""There will be money to find new housing, burial costs and whatever we need because that's what we do here in New York,"" Ms Hochul said. The area of the Bronx where the fire occurred is home to a large Muslim immigrant population and many of those affected by the blaze are believed to have originally come to the US from the Gambia. Mr Adams urged anyone impacted by the fire to seek assistance from the authorities, irrespective of immigration status. He assured residents that their details would not be passed on to immigration services. Speaking alongside Mr Adams, New York Senator Chuck Schumer pledged to provide immigration support to allow families to come together to grieve. The building hosts a number of affordable housing apartments and the blaze is likely to raise questions over the quality of such units in the city. Representative Ritchie Torres, a Democratic lawmaker whose district includes the building, told the US network MSNBC that developments such as the building where the fire hit pose safety risks to residents. ""When we allow our affordable housing developments to be plagued by decades of disinvestment, we are putting lives at risk,"" Mr Torres said. Did you witness the incident?

At least 164 killed in Kazakhstan unrest - reports,"This video can not be played The BBC's Steve Rosenberg is in Kazakhstan's capital amid reports of a power struggle fuelling the recent unrest Internet services have returned to Kazakhstan's largest city following a five-day blackout. Almaty, the country's former capital, has been offline since Wednesday amid a wave of violence in the country. Almost 8,000 people have been detained throughout the country, the Interior Ministry said on Monday. The demonstrations, triggered by a rise in fuel prices, turned into the worst unrest the country has seen in its 30 years of independence. They started on 2 January and grew to reflect discontent at the government and former President Nursultan Nazarbayev, who led Kazakhstan for three decades and is still thought to retain significant influence. Last week, troops from countries including Russia were sent to Kazakhstan to help restore order. The presidential statement added that the situation had stabilised, with troops continuing ""cleanup"" operations and guarding ""strategic facilities"". A state of emergency and a nationwide curfew remain in place. AT THE SCENE:'Like something from an apocalypse film' CONTEXT:Why is there unrest in Kazakhstan? Where is it?Kazakhstan shares borders with Russia to the north and China to the east. It is a huge country the size of Western Europe. Why does it matter?A former Soviet republic which is mainly Muslim with a large Russian minority, it has vast mineral resources, with 3% of global oil reserves and important coal and gas sectors. Why is it making the news?Fuel riots, which have escalated to become broader protests against the government, have resulted in resignations at the top and a bloody crackdown on protesters. In the capital, Nursultan, there are obvious signs that security has been tightened, says the BBC's Steve Rosenberg, with the entrance to the city's Presidential Palace blocked. There is a growing suggestion, our correspondent adds, that the recent violence is linked to a power struggle within Kazakhstan's ruling elite. On Sunday evening government officials retracted an earlier statement posted to an officially-run channel on the Telegram social media app alleging that more than 164 people had died during the wave of violence. The Information Ministry told local media that the statement had been issued in error and was the result of a ""technical mistake"". Only 44 deaths have been confirmed. The security forces said they killed rioters in Almaty while trying to restore order and that protesters had tried to take control of police stations in the city. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev said ""20,000 bandits"" had attacked Almaty and that he had told security forces to ""fire without warning"". US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday criticised the president's directive. ""The shoot-to-kill order, to the extent it exists, is wrong and should be rescinded,"" he told ABC News' This Week. He said the US was also seeking clarification from the Kazakh president on why he had requested the presence of Russian troops. In another development, neighbouring Kyrgyzstan lodged a protest with the Kazakh ambassador over the detention in Kazakhstan of a Kyrgyz jazz musician, after footage emerged apparently showing him in custody, badly beaten. Kazakh authorities accuse Vikram Ruzakhunov of participating in the protests, and have paraded him on state television. On Saturday, Kazakh authorities said the country'sformer intelligence chief Karim Massimov had been arrestedon suspicion of treason. They gave no further details. Two former deputies to Mr Massimov have also been removed from their posts, the president's office said on Sunday. Marat Osipov and Daulet Ergozhin had been serving as deputy heads of the country's powerful National Security Committee prior to their removal. Mr Tokayev's office has yet to publicly provide a reason for the sackings.

The asylum homes where ceilings have fallen in,"Injury: This toddler needed stitches after a ceiling collapse Damp, debris and falling ceilings - a BBC investigation into accommodation for asylum seekers has uncovered serial concerns about housing conditions. Refugee organisations say they hear regularly about properties residents believe are unsafe, and they struggle to get help on a national phone line. The concerns come after a year of mounting controversy over how the Home Office is managing asylum seekers. But it said it was providing ""safe, comfortable and secure"" accommodation. Projections suggest the UK could house 80,000 asylum seekers by next year. The government puts asylum seekers in accommodation run separately to social housing. After previous criticisms, the Home Office reorganised contracts in 2019 under three companies: Mears, Serco and Clearspring Ready Homes. A fourth contract paid for a national phone line, Migrant Help, to handle complaints and pass them to the housing companies. Some 41,000 asylum seekers are living under the main scheme Housing for others, including hotels, brings the total nearer 65,000 Officials project there could be 80,000 by next spring Home Office pays about Â£560 per person per month - the lower end of the UK rental market Total costs depend on how many people are in the system but it's projected to be Â£4bn over 10 years Despite these changes, and more money devoted to the contracted homes, some support organisations say they still find residents who are concerned they are in poor-quality housing. Residents like Adam and his family, housed last year in West Yorkshire. The police officer and his wife fled sectarian tensions in an African nation and were placed in a home in Bradford. Last May, a bathroom leak developed and water began coming through downstairs. Adam reported it and there were visits by a repair team. Two weeks after the problem emerged, a ceiling collapsed. Escaped injury: Adam's wife with their daughter moments after the ceiling came in As the debris fell, Adam's wife instinctively bent over her daughter to protect her. He says: ""I was in the room upstairs, and all of a sudden I heard a noise and the missus was on the floor... all the plaster and wood was on her head. My baby was shouting and screaming."" The baby was unscathed, but Adam's wife received treatment for concussion. ""I could have lost my baby that day. I think it's in the system where things are going wrong - it's not the people - I think it's a system."" The home was provided by Mears - and it told the BBC a repair team had not found water ingress or timber decay before the incident. The firm said it had responded properly and promptly once it became aware. This video can not be played Residents in asylum housing film the conditions they are living in Mears moved Adam and his family to a new home - the BBC saw that property, which was clean and safe. A spokesman for the company said: ""As the only new provider, taking over from the previous contracts, this has been a time of transition as we have worked to make improvements and bring accommodation and support up to the new standards where many properties had been in constant use for many years. ""During the pandemic, in line with all social landlords, we prioritised more serious repairs and paused less serious repairs. A catch-up programme is now under way."" There is no suggestion Adam and his family's incident is the norm - but research indicates that neither was it an isolated experience. That collapse was predated by another in Bradford in the autumn of 2020, in which a child suffered an open head wound that required stitching. Refugee Action, a support organisation, said the Sudanese mother and her support worker had tried to flag her concerns on the national phone line. Mears moved the family to a new home after the incident. London: A ceiling collapses after a leak In another example from last May, a family in London say they too repeatedly called Migrant Help to report a leak in the property. The father recorded a video of the aftermath of the collapse for Migrant Help. The provider, Clearsprings Ready Homes, declined to comment. ""I've worked in this area of work for nearly 20 years. And I've never seen it as bad in terms of the housing and the accommodation that people are experiencing,"" says Tim Naor-Hilton, chief executive of Refugee Action. ""Our partners across the sector are also reporting very similar things. We are very, very worried that there is going to be some catastrophic incident at some point, somewhere in the country."" When refugee charities made Freedom of Information requests about the severity and frequency of complaints, and about how Migrant Help was performing, the Home Office turned them down. But a September 2021 Home Office survey of asylum seekers, obtained by the BBC, hints at a mixed picture. Only six out of ten respondents were happy or very happy with accommodation. The residents who had concerns complained about cleanliness on moving-in and the responsiveness to requests for repairs. Debris from a ceiling fall in London The survey's low response rate means it is hard to draw firm conclusions - so BBC News contacted more than 30 community organisations whose caseworkers have thousands of contacts with asylum seekers every year. Eight out of ten of the organisations told us that most weeks they heard concerns about accommodation. A quarter said they heard reports every day. Some asylum seekers told the charities they felt their homes were generally unclean, and the most common problems were reports of mould or a lack of hot water. Twenty-three of the organisations had come across clients worried about ceilings - although there was no suggestion that this was commonplace. The vast majority of organisations believed the service from the Migrant Help phone line was highly variable, poor, or exceptionally poor, with half saying it could take three goes to get a complaint logged. The Home Office says the BBC's survey is not representative - but one striking example from a year ago in Greater Manchester illustrates the concerns shared by many in the sector. Residents of a house there say they spent six weeks on the phone to Migrant Help complaining about problems with a blocked drain. There was ultimately a flood of sewage up through the kitchen sink. Blockage: Sewage flowed into this kitchen The provider of that home, Serco, has declined to comment - but the BBC understands the company had checked the home over before the residents moved in and believes it then did everything possible to deal with the problem with the drains once it was made aware. Ultimately, the area's wastewater utility company dug up the road to replace the drain while the damaged parts of the home were refitted. In 2020 a High Court judge ruled that the Home Office wasfailing to properly monitor accommodation,externalin one particular part of the system Independent inspectors havetwice criticised reception facilities on the Kent coastfor migrants arriving by boat - saying they are very poor Another report found that migrants were then being housed incramped and filthy conditions at Napier Barracksnear Folkestone, where there was a mass outbreak of Covid The High Court later ruledconditions at Napier to be unlawful. In 2020 the National Audit Office said the Home Office hadlearnt some lessons on the accommodation system,external- but it was too soon to know whether the new contracts would deliver The Home Office said 80% of surveyed residents were satisfied with Migrant Help - but the phone line had also experienced unprecedented demand due to factors including the pandemic. It was satisfied that it was now meeting its targets. The BBC has tried to contact Migrant Help separately for comment. ""We are dealing with unprecedented pressures on the asylum system and, despite this, we continue to ensure that the accommodation provided is safe, comfortable and secure,"" said a Home Office spokesman. ""We remain satisfied that our accommodation contractors [are] providing a good standard of accommodation and we have strict processes in place to respond promptly to maintenance issues and any complaints from residents. We take complaints extremely seriously and where issues do arrive we ensure they are acted upon quickly."" Back in West Yorkshire, Adam, the police officer-turned-asylum seeker, is still waiting for his case to be decided. But he's also urging the Home Office to look again at whether the accommodation system is working properly. ""I don't need any compensation,"" he says. ""I just don't want someone to be a victim like me in the future."" Residents in asylum housing film conditions.

Djokovic stay highlights concerns at refugee hotel,"Activists have been gathering at the hotel in support of refugees As tennis star Novak Djokovic fights deportation from Australia, he has been sent to an immigration hotel where refugees and asylum seekers have long complained of poor conditions. The Australian Open champion was stripped of his visa by border control agents who said he did not meet Covid-19 entry requirements, before being sent to the Park Hotel in Melbourne. A court will decide on whether he should be deported on Monday. Djokovic's fans have converged outside the building with protesting activists, who hope the Serbian player's stay will highlight the treatment of the asylum seekers and refugees inside. LIVE:Australia holding Djokovic prisoner, parents say EXPLAINER:Twists and turns of Djokovic's Australia mess Speaking on the phone from inside the building, Mohammad Joy Miah said he was feeling ""mentally broken"". ""I have not had any fresh light or fresh air from outside. My life is a room,"" he told the BBC. He also shared a picture that he says was taken at the end of December showing maggots in his dinner. ""I ate two or three that were in my broccoli"" before the guards agreed to take the meal away, he recalled. ""Whatever they give us, we must eat it to stay alive. The food is totally bad."" The account matched those of other people being held in the facility,who shared their experiences with Australia's SBS News last month.,external ""We keep telling them we can't eat this type of food but they've not been listening,"" an Iraqi asylum seeker told the news site. ""I've lost weight because I've just been eating nuts."" Djokovic's parents have called the accommodation ""terrible"" and claim their son is being treated like a prisoner. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic said his government had asked that the athlete be moved from the ""infamous hotel"". The Australian Border Force and Home Affairs Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce told the BBC that rich people ""can't wander around the world thinking... they are above the laws"". It is not clear what conditions Djokovic is being held in, and activists have highlighted the difference between the tennis star's situation and that of others there. ""Novak Djokovic has spent just one night in immigration detention in Australia but some have been locked up... for years on end,"" tweeted Sophie McNeill from Human Rights Watch. ""Australia's treatment of asylum seekers is inhumane, deeply cruel & illegal under international law."" BACKGROUND:Australia pays compensation to asylum seekers FEATURE:The kids locked up for most of their childhood Chris Breen, an activist with the Refugee Action Collective, said the biggest problem for those being held there was the ""indefinite nature of their detention"". ""If you're only there for a couple of days, a room in a hotel is not the end of the world. But if you're stuck there, it's a very different story. ""Djokovic at least knows that at some point he'll get out - whether that's getting a visa or deported, but the refugees don't have that."" Mr Breen also said he suspected that staff would be ""a lot more careful"" with Djokovic in terms of things like food. The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre estimates that there are now 33 refugees and people seeking asylum inside the Park Hotel, among some 70 held across Australia's onshore detention centres. The Park Hotel has been housing refugees and asylum seekers since late 2020. Kurdish refugee Mostafa ""Moz"" Azimitabar, who spent more than a year in immigration hotels including two months at the Park Hotel, described his room there as a ""coffin"". He said he spent about 23 hours a day inside the room he shared with one other person, where the window was tinted and sealed shut. ""A hotel is a place for people who want to be comfortable and enjoy their time, but when they lock the place, that place becomes a prison, not a hotel,"" he said. The hotel hit headlines last year because of a Covid outbreak, which saw about half of the refugees and asylum seekers being held there test positive. Staff and those detained described the facility as an ""incubator"" for the virus. ""I sit in the room and I am afraid. We are all afraid,""Salah Mustafa told the Guardian newspaper at the time.,external A fire also broke out at the hotel in December. One person was hospitalised for smoke inhalation but there were no fatalities, reports say. As attention returned to the hotel on Thursday, detainees looked on from inside the building. Mehdi Ali told AFP news agency that Djokovic was his favourite tennis player, and that he was saddened by the idea of the star being held there. ""The media will talk about us more, the whole world probably, which is so sad, just because Djokovic would be here for a few days,"" he said.

"New York apartment block fire kills 19There were nine children among the fatalities in the fire, which took hold on Sunday in the Bronx.US & Canada","This video can not be played Watch: Fire is a ""horrific, painful moment"" for New York, says Mayor Eric Adams At least 19 people, including nine children, have died after a fire in a New York apartment building. Another 32 people were sent to hospital, several of whom are in a critical condition, according to New York Mayor Eric Adams. Fire department Commissioner Daniel Nigro said they had found victims on every floor of the 19-storey block, saying the smoke was ""unprecedented"". He told NBC News the death toll was the worst seen in New York for 30 years. It comes days afteran apartment fire in Philadelphia killed 12, with eight children among the dead. Sunday's fire broke out in an apartment that spans the second and third floors of the Bronx apartment block at about 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT), officials said. Some 200 firefighters were sent to tackle the blaze, which officials believe was sparked by a malfunctioning electric heater. Commissioner Nigro said there were two floors of fire, but the smoke had spread everywhere. The local fire chief said the blaze was ""unprecedented"" Victims were found on every floor of the building The door to the apartment where the fire started was left open, and smoke then spread to every floor, Commissioner Nigro told reporters. ""Members found victims on every floor in stairwells and were taking them out in cardiac and respiratory arrest,"" he said. In a virtual news conference on Monday, Andrew Ansbro, the president of the firefighters' union, said the building was ""well-known in that area, for having difficult fires"", noting that its fire protection rules with regard to sprinklers and self-closing doors may have been different from those of the city. He claimed it was because the building had previously received federal subsidies and therefore was not required to follow the same fire codes. Mr Ansbro also said that Covid-19 had affected the staffing levels of first responders. George King, who lives nearby, told AFP news agency people were waving from the windows as the flames took hold. ""I saw the smoke, a lot of people were panicking,"" he said. ""You could see that no-one wanted to jump from the building."" Dozens of people have been injured A total of 63 people suffered injuries, including the 32 taken to hospital.Thirteen are in a critical condition, Stefan Ringel, a senior adviser to the mayor, told AP news agency.,external ""The impact of this fire is going to bring a level of pain and despair to our city,"" Mr Adams told reporters. ""The numbers are horrific."" He told CNN on Monday that the incident was ""a wake-up call for all our buildings"" to ensure complaints are heard and protective measures are working. New York Governor Kathy Hochul called Sunday's events ""a night of tragedy"", and pledged to create a victims' compensation fund to support survivors. ""There will be money to find new housing, burial costs and whatever we need because that's what we do here in New York,"" Ms Hochul said. The area of the Bronx where the fire occurred is home to a large Muslim immigrant population and many of those affected by the blaze are believed to have originally come to the US from the Gambia. Mr Adams urged anyone impacted by the fire to seek assistance from the authorities, irrespective of immigration status. He assured residents that their details would not be passed on to immigration services. Speaking alongside Mr Adams, New York Senator Chuck Schumer pledged to provide immigration support to allow families to come together to grieve. The building hosts a number of affordable housing apartments and the blaze is likely to raise questions over the quality of such units in the city. Representative Ritchie Torres, a Democratic lawmaker whose district includes the building, told the US network MSNBC that developments such as the building where the fire hit pose safety risks to residents. ""When we allow our affordable housing developments to be plagued by decades of disinvestment, we are putting lives at risk,"" Mr Torres said. Did you witness the incident?

Is this NHS crisis worse?,"The headlines were terrifying. Hospitals facing intolerable pressures with patients left dying in corridors, the BBC reported. It got so bad that 68 leading A&E doctors wrote to the prime minister to spell out their concerns. This is not now though.It was the winter of 2017-18- the last bad flu season when more than 300 people a day were dying from that virus at one point. And that was not even a one-off.In January 2016hospitals were cancelling routine operations, telling patients to stay away from A&E if they could, and emergency treatment areas were being set up outside some units - just as they are now. The truth is the past decade has been a story of lengthening waits and declining performance. A&E waits are the best barometer of this. The proportion of patients waiting less than four hours - a key metric in measuring NHS effectiveness - has been gradually eroded. It is a similar story elsewhere in the UK - with performance even worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. This should not come as a surprise, as NHS spending has been squeezed. Between 2010 and 2019 the annual rises for health were well below those traditionally given since the birth of the NHS, making it difficult to keep up with the needs of the ageing population. During that period, the Tories have been in power - albeit with the Lib Dems for the first five years. But it is worth noting, in its 2010 and 2015 election manifestos, Labour was not proposing any tangibly higher increases in spending either. The financial crash of 2008 meant all the main political parties were signed up to the idea that spending had to be curtailed. This parliament has seen a change - annual rises are now planned to be close to 4% and will end up higher once the pandemic spending is taken into account. But the result of the squeeze in the 2010s is fewer doctors and nurses per head of population than our Western European neighbours. The turn of the year is always the hardest time. And with the latest data for A&E only covering November, we need to look elsewhere to judge how alarming the current pressures driven by the Omicron variant are. Since Christmas there have been reports of hospitals declaring critical incidents. At one point on Wednesday evening, one in seven hospital trusts in England were in this situation.

This data shows the proportion of ambulance patients who waited 30 minutes or more, in the week shown. It comes from daily situation reports which are published weekly during the winter in England. As this is fast-turnaround data, the NHS says only minimal validation can be carried out but it is considered fit for purpose. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland do not publish ambulance queue data. Patients at A&E should be seen within four hours of arrival. This data shows the proportion of patients attending A&E who waited longer than four hours to be treated, discharged or admitted. This data is published monthly for England and Wales and weekly for Scotland. Northern Ireland publishes its data quarterly and Winter 2021 is not yet available. If a patient at A&E needs to be admitted, the wait from decision to admit to being given a bed on a ward is recorded in England. The bed waits figure is the proportion of patients admitted via A&E who waited longer than four hours for a ward bed. In Wales, bed wait data is not published, so the figure shown is the occupancy level in general and acute beds. Scotland and Northern Ireland do not publish bed wait or bed occupancy data. Data for England is show by NHS trust, where the trust includes at least one hospital with a Type 1 A&E department. Type 1 means a consultant-led 24 hour A&E service with full resuscitation facilities. When you enter a postcode for a location in England you will be shown a list of NHS trusts in your area. They will not necessarily be in order of your closest hospital as some trusts have more than one hospital. Data for Wales and Scotland are shown by NHS board. Comparative data from two years ago is shown where available. However, where trusts have merged there is no like-for-like comparison to show. Bed occupancy data in Wales only goes back to April 2020. If you can't see the lookup, click here Several hospital trusts declare critical incidents Covid absences put pressure on England's hospitals Military sends 200 personnel to back NHS in London It is, however, very hard to judge exactly what these declarations tell us. They are not normally made public and instead are there to alert local health systems that a service needs help. We have nothing to compare them to. If we look at the delays ambulances face when dropping off patients at A&E - this data is available in England up to last weekend - we can see the current difficulties are worse than the last winter before the pandemic hit. But it is also fair to say this does not represent the collapse of the NHS, despite all the headlines. The truth is the health service will not suddenly become overwhelmed. Instead, what is happening is that care is deteriorating bit by bit. The heart attack patients are waiting longer for an ambulance, more elderly patients are spending nights on a trolley in A&E and growing numbers of people are waiting for hip and knee replacements. The challenges are, of course, different from winters past. It is a pandemic after all. A mass vaccination campaign is underway, while the level of staff absence from Covid is bringing another added complexity - it is nearly twice what you would expect - and explains why the army has had to be brought in. Hospitals have also had to completely reconfigure their wards to create Covid and non-Covid areas. And the sheer numbers coming in are a problem. Traditionally winter would see around 1,000 admissions a day for all types of respiratory infections. Currently the NHS is seeing more than double that for Covid alone - although a chunk admittedly are people who are ill with something else, such as broken arms, strokes and cancer for example, and may well have come in anyway. But even if you discount these patients, you are still well above the 1,000 threshold. However, the NHS has been helped by lower pressures elsewhere. Flu is at rock-bottom levels. There are fewer than 50 patients in hospital with the virus in England. So what can we conclude? The challenges are certainly worse and that is translating into poorer quality services.

Labour demands energy firm tax hike to cut bills,"This video can not be played Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves criticises government policy as energy bills set to spike Labour has called for a windfall tax on North Sea gas and oil producers to help limit the expected rise in household gas and electricity bills by Â£200 The party says its Â£6.6bn plan would also remove VAT on domestic energy costs for a year and increase the warm homes discount for poorer households. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves told the BBC the UK was ""uniquely exposed"" to global energy price rises. But the government said it was working to manage the impact on consumers. And Prime Minister Boris Johnson has not ruled out taking steps to tackle the rising cost of energy, amid pressure from some of his own backbench MPs. Government discusses support for higher fuel bills We don't know how high bills will go - energy boss How much would cutting VAT on energy bills save me? Why are gas prices so high? The trade body Energy UKpredicts bills will surge by up to 50%in April, when the change to the price cap, due to be determined in February, kicks in. This could leave an average household paying about Â£700 more per year, it says. UK inflationhit a 10-year highin November, with the rate expected to increase to further in the next few months, while National Insurance contributions are set to rise in April. This has led to warnings of a cost-of-living ""crisis"". Labour is attempting to seize the initiative with a call for a windfall tax on oil and gas producers. The idea is not new. Previous Labour and Conservative governments have done it and the Lib Dems called for a similar move last week. But timing is everything, and the government is under pressure to ease the impact of rising energy bills, living costs and its looming increase in National Insurance payments. Boris Johnson has not ruled out taking steps to soften the blow, but so far has only said what he doesn't want to do - cut VAT on energy bills. In opposition, Labour has the luxury of being able to put forward a menu of policy options to try to make the government look indecisive. But it's the prime minister and the chancellor who'll have to find a politically palatable way to ease the acute strain coming to households and businesses. Doing nothing, it seems, is not an option. Under Labour's plan, North Sea energy producers, their profits boosted by price rises, would be forced to pay Â£1.2bn to mitigate household bills through a year-long increase to their corporation tax of 10 percentage points. The party also wants an extra Â£3.5bn to be spent on the warm homes discount, increasing it from Â£140 to Â£400 per year, while doubling the number of households eligible to 9.3 million. VAT, currently set at 5% for household energy bills, should be removed for a year from April - six months longer than Labour has previously called for - the party adds. The prime minister has argued that a VAT cut would be too ""blunt"" a tool, as it would affect all households, including the richest, rather than targeting those most in need. But Labour says its proposals would save most households about Â£200, while targeted support to lower earners and pensioners would save them Â£600. Ms Reeves told BBC One's Sunday Morning there were some ""pretty staggering"" energy bill rises in store for households. ""The problem is that so much of this has been caused by more than a decade of dither and delay in energy policy by the government,"" she said. ""The UK is uniquely exposed because of a failure to invest in nuclear and hydrogen and renewables."" Labour's plans are unlikely to become policy in time for April, as it is not in power, but the party is keen to put as much pressure on the government over what it sees as a central issue for millions of voters. The Liberal Democrats also called for a windfall tax on energy firms earlier this week, with leader Sir Ed Davey saying: ""It can't be right that a few energy fat cats are raking it in from record gas prices while millions of people can't even afford to heat their homes."" Conservative former energy minister Chris Skidmore has backed the idea of a windfall tax, which has been imposed by previous Labour and Tory governments. Former Conservative Chancellor Lord Lamont told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that, of Labour's proposals, increasing the warm homes discount would provide ""a much bigger bang for your buck"" than cutting VAT or a windfall tax. ""Windfall taxes tend to stick and then become permanent,"" he said. ""People don't have much sympathy when the prices go down and the windfall taxes remain."" A government spokesman said: ""The energy price cap is currently insulating millions of consumers from high global gas prices. We'll continue to listen to consumers and businesses on how to manage the costs of energy. ""We recognise people are facing pressures with the cost of living, which is why we are taking action worth more than Â£4.2bn, and supporting vulnerable households through initiatives such as the Â£500m household support fund, warm home discount, winter fuel payments and cold weather payments.""

Truss 'willing' to override post-Brexit dealThe foreign secretary issues a warning over the Northern Ireland-part of the deal if negotiations fail.Northern Ireland,"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss replaced Lord Frost as the UK's lead negotiator with the EU in post-Brexit talks Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says she will not accept a deal which means goods from Britain being checked as they enter Northern Ireland. Ms Truss, now the UK's lead negotiator with the EU in post-Brexit talks, was writing in theSunday Telegraph,external. In 2019 the prime ministeragreed a deal, known as the protocol,and for the last six months the UK has been attempting to renegotiate it. The EU said it was ""not too impressed"" with the foreign secretary's threat. Next week, Ms Truss is due to hold two days of talks with her European Union counterpart, MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ. ""I will not sign up to anything which sees the people of Northern Ireland unable to benefit from the same decisions on taxation and spending as the rest of the UK, or which still sees goods moving within our own country being subject to checks,"" she said. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal that prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. That also creates a new Irish Sea trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, with some goods needing to be checked as they enter Northern Ireland. In July, the UK proposed an arrangement in which goods from Great Britain which are due to stay in Northern Ireland would not be checked and would have minimal paperwork. Goods which are due to move onwards to the Republic of Ireland would be checked at Northern Ireland's ports. The EU published its own proposals in October, which it said would significantly reduce, but not eliminate, checks on goods. It has previously said that the easiest way to reduce checks would be for the UK to sign up to a Swiss-style agrifood agreement. That would involve all of the UK following the relevant EU rules, something the government says it could not accept. Liz Truss replaces Lord Frost in post-Brexit talks A simple guide to the Brexit border problem What is Article 16 and why does it matter? Ms Truss says that when she meets Mr Å efÄoviÄ, the EU's lead post-Brexit negotiator, she will be ""putting forward our constructive proposals to resolve the situation"". It is not yet clear if these differ from the July proposals. She has also repeated the UK's willingness to use the Article 16 mechanism of the protocol. Article 16 sets out the process for taking unilateral ""safeguard"" measures if either the EU or UK concludes that the deal is leading to serious practical problems or causing diversion of trade. Those safeguards would amount to suspending parts of the deal. Ms Truss said: ""I want a negotiated solution, but if we have to use legitimate provisions including Article 16, I am willing to do that. ""This safeguard clause was explicitly designed - and agreed to by all sides - to ease acute problems because of the sensitivity of the issues at play."" The protocol created a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK The EU has said it does not believe the use of Article 16 is justified and that its deployment could lead to the collapse of the wider Brexit deal, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. JoÃ£o Vale de Almeida, the EU's ambassador to the UK, said it was not helpful to ""keep agitating the issue"" of triggering Article 16. ""We've heard this before from the government, so we're not surprised. We are not too impressed,"" he told Sky News. ""I think we should focus on - at least that's where we are focused on - is trying to find solutions for difficulties in the implementation of the protocol"". The EU was ""even more eager"" to find compromises, he added. Next week Ms Truss is also due to meet Northern Ireland's political and business leaders. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said his meeting withMs Truss would have a ""major bearing"" on his next steps. In a tweet,,externalSir Jeffrey welcomed the foreign secretary's comments. ""She is right that unionists do not consent to the protocol and we need the government to follow through on their commitment to safeguard the union and protect Northern Ireland's place in the UK internal market,"" he said. Sir Jeffrey has demanded a deadline be set for an end to the protocol negotiations with Brussels. He has warned the party could quit the Stormont executive if there was no change to the protocol. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, said Sir Jeffrey's threat to walk away from power sharing was ""reckless and irresponsible"". ""The rest of us want to work together, all the other parties are there in the best interest of the public wanting to work together, and all the while the DUP continually are the outlier, whether that be Brexit or making institutions work,"" she said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said Ms Truss' comments outline a way forward for dealing with the EU. ""It is perfectly reasonable that goods from Great Britain which are destined to stay in Northern Ireland should not be subject to checks and those goods destined for the EU market can be checked at our ports,"" he said. ""We have already recommended legislation to make this workable as far back as 2019."" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the DUP was prepared to ""whip up fear, anger and resentment over port checks that affect virtually no one's daily life"". ""The re-emergence of the Tory Article 16 threat is as tired as the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in threats to collapse Stormont,"" he said. ""It solves nothing, it helps nobody, it will only make things worse."" Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said words must be followed by actions. ""Empty rhetoric, like empty threats from some in unionism, only buy more time for the union-dismantling protocol to bed in further."" What is Article 16 and why does it matter?

WRU considers hosting games in England,"Wales fans were there to celebrate along with try-scorer Ryan Elias as the hosts beat Australia in Cardiff in November 2021 The Welsh Rugby Union is considering playing home Six Nations games in England because of Covid crowd restrictions in Wales. First Minister Mark Drakeford imposedrestrictions on sporting events in Wales,effectively meaning professional games are behind closed doors. There is no date set for when measures could be eased, with the next review scheduled for 7 January. Wales are due to host Scotland in Cardiff on 12 February. Faletau expected to be fit for start of Six Nations Sturgeon hopes Scotland's Six Nations matches can 'go ahead to crowds' Wayne Pivac's side are also scheduled to meet France on 11 March and Italy eight days later at the Principality Stadium, meaning Wales could face the prospect of playing over half the competition on home soil with no fans. This video can not be played Welsh Government would be âdisappointedâ if Wales games switched to England As things stand, sporting events in England have no restrictions, so Wales' visit to Twickenham on 26 February will be played before a full house of 82,000, provided spectators can prove full vaccination status or show a negative lateral flow test. Wales launch the defence of their Six Nations title against Ireland in Dublin on 5 February, with current restrictions of 5,000 fans there. Scotland also has restrictions on spectator numbers of 500, France has a limit of 5,000 fans and Italy has a Covid pass system in place after tightening restrictions in December. The WRU lost Â£13.5m in matchday revenue during the 2021 Six Nations after home games against England and Ireland were played behind closed doors. The WRU's preference is to play home fixtures this year in front of full crowds in Cardiff and the union hopes restrictions will be lifted in time. There are major logistical issues in relocating matches including tickets already sold for the games, availability of stadiums and public health concerns, with the prospect of thousands of Welsh fans travelling to England and back. The WRU has also stressed throughout the pandemic it will abide by and support Welsh government's policy on public health. The governing body will also rely on future financial assistance from the Welsh government. This is the second time the WRU has considered moving games to England after exploring the possibility for the Autumn Nations Cup in November 2020, when the Principality Stadium was used as a field hospital. On that occasion Wales ended up playing their matches at Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli with no spectators. Wembley Stadium will not be able to host any Welsh Six Nations games this year because of preparations for England international football games in March. Other venues with the capacity required would be West Ham's London Stadium, Arsenal's Emirates Stadium or the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, which WRU officials visited in late 2020. That venue would prove troublesome this time around because two of the three weekends clash with Tottenham home matches in the Premier League. England's home ground Twickenham would also be another option. Six Nations organisers are monitoring the situation with meetings this week which they hope will offer more clarity on the situation in each of the countries. Health Minister Eluned Morgan says the Welsh Government would be disappointed if matches were staged outside of Wales and warned of financial consequences for the WRU. ""There would be a Welsh government understanding we would have to step in to support them financially if they did have to postpone those matches or cancel them in some way,"" said Ms Morgan. ""If they decide to go to England that would be more difficult for us to come up with that financial support."" Under Covid-19 restrictions imposed by the Welsh government, only 50 spectators are permitted to view outdoor events. The guidelines are reviewed weekly and Mr Drakeford has so far refused to give public assurances fans will be allowed to return in time for the Six Nations as case numbers for the Omicron variant continue to surge. Wales wing Louis Rees-Zammit, who plays for English club Gloucester, says fans must be allowed to watch the games, even if it means matches being moved. Allow Twitter content?

Andrew Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Senedd, says lifting crowd restrictions should be considered. ""Many people in Wales will tell you that the current restrictions do not make sense,"" he said. ""I am cautiously optimistic the initial fear over Omicron is not coming to pass and the Labour government needs to have a long hard think about if these restrictions are completely necessary on Friday [7 January]. ""It would be another blow to the Welsh economy if more of the Welsh pound is spent in London and not Cardiff.""

England cling on for draw in SydneyThe visitors bat out the final day of the fourth Test to end Australia's hopes of an Ashes clean sweep.,"This video can not be played The Ashes: England hold on for draw to deny Australia clean sweep Fourth Ashes Test, Sydney (day five of five) Australia416-8 dec&265-6 dec(Khawaja 101*, Green 74; Leach 4-84) England294& 270-9(Crawley 77, Stokes 60, Boland 3-30) Match drawn; Australia lead series 3-0 Scorecard England clung on for a tense draw on the final day of the fourth Test in Sydney to end Australia's hopes of an Ashes clean sweep. The tourists were 13 balls from safety when Jack Leach edged Steve Smith behind, leaving it to Stuart Broad and last batter James Anderson to guide England home. With the light fading and every Australia fielder around the bat, Broad and Anderson blocked out Smith and Nathan Lyon to secure a hard-fought draw, closing on 270-9. Zak Crawley earlier made a fluent 77 and Ben Stokes hit 60 despite still struggling with his side injury as England crept towards safety. Boland continued his extraordinary start to Test cricket with 3-30, while captain Pat Cummins took two wickets in three balls to rattle England. It was a thrilling end to an entertaining match, with England's players barely able to watch in the dressing room as Anderson played out the final over. Australia may be left to rue their late declaration on the fourth day, with rain meaning they lost seven overs as they tried to force victory on Sunday. The final Test of the series - a day-night match in Hobart - begins on 14 January. 'England show spirit, bottle & backbone' Clips & analysis of England's draw in Sydney Buttler to miss final Ashes Test with hand injury TMS podcast: England hold on to avoid Ashes whitewash This video can not be played England draw match as Anderson survives final ball England may have already lost the Ashes but here they showed real fight and character throughout the match. Jonny Bairstow displayed grit with his first-innings century and that energy and determination filtered back to the dressing room as the tourists fought to repel Australia on an absorbing final day. The small crowd at the Sydney Cricket Ground were at their loudest in the final hour, as Australia tore in with the new ball. Cummins, who had been subdued with the ball throughout the day, trapped Jos Buttler lbw on review before doing the same to Mark Wood two balls later with a delivery that knocked the bowler off his feet. That left it to Bairstow, nursing an thumb injury that may keep him out of the next Test, and Leach,one of the heroes of Headingley 2019,to see off 15 overs. Australia felt the pressure, with Smith dropping Bairstow off Mitchell Starc, but they would have felt victory was in their grasp when the same batter popped a catch to silly mid-off. Leach and Broad withstood some short, fast, hostile bowling, all accompanied by the chirping of the players around the bat, before a disappointed Leach edged Smith to slip. It was left to Broad and Anderson, the veterans, to see England home and give them something to smile about after a bruising tour. This video can not be played 'He's batted absolutely brilliantly' - best shots from Crawley's half-century Positives have been few and far between for England, but Crawley's performance in the morning session hinted at what could be in the coming years. Having started strongly the previous night, Crawley refused to let the bowlers settle. He pulled and drove the off-colour Starc before flicking Lyon away to bring up a 69-ball half-century. Just as Bairstow and Stokes did on the third day, Crawley threw Australia off their plans, dominating the bowling with his elegant strokeplay. By the time he fell, trapped by an excellent yorker from Cameron Green, he had scored 77. The other three England batters had scored 19 runs between them. Crawley also shared a 43-run stand with fellow opener Hameed. That this was England's third highest opening partnership in the last four Ashes series underlines how long their Test batting has been falling away. Hameed battled admirably but struggled for the fluency Crawley was showing at the other end. He was dropped by Alex Carey off Cummins but could not make it count, instead fiddling Scott Boland behind for nine to register his sixth consecutive single-figure score. It seems highly unlikely he will feature in the final Test at Hobart. Dawid Malan played a poor shot to Lyon and was bowled, Root was left aghast as he nicked Boland behind and Stokes, having battled so bravely, almost punched his bat as he sent a simple catch off Lyon to Smith at slip. England have still to pass 300 on this tour, and while the draw in Sydney will raise their spirits, they will know that the same batting problems still linger in the background. England captain Joe Root, speaking to Test Match Special: ""Relief is the overwhelming emotion and I'm quite proud too. We had a lot thrown at us in this game and the guys have really stood up and showed a lot of character and pride. ""Today shows how much it means to them. When you find yourself out of the series it is really important you front up and time and time again show how much it means to you. I think everyone has done that this week.""

How rapid tests changed the pandemic,"Lateral flow tests are now part of life for much of the UK. Billions of pounds of public money have been spent on test kits. Has it all been worth it? Earlier this week, 38-year-old Hailing Hackney unwrapped the last lateral flow test in her kitchen cupboard. ""I was feeling tired, but then I'm always feeling tired,"" she says. ""I saw my best friend over Christmas and her son had tested positive, so I thought I should just check."" Like so many others across the UK, she was surprised when a faint line started to appear on the white testing strip. Later that evening her symptoms began - a mild headache and a runny nose. Hailing runs Sparkle Nails & Beauty in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham. She had a full list of customers coming in for treatments after New Year and had to quickly rebook all of them. ""I take two tests a week because I see so many people as part of my job,"" she says. ""It was just lucky I found out so quickly."" The whole point of mass testing like this is to break chains of transmission - to keep Hailing away from her customers at a time when she might be infectious but have no obvious symptoms. ""I'm serious when I say they have been the single most powerful tool in reducing transmission of the virus,"" says Irene Petersen, professor of epidemiology at University College London. The idea of population-wide Covid testing on this scale was first revealed in leaked documents in the autumn of 2020. The plan was to use millions of cheap, throwaway lateral flow tests that could give a result in 15 minutes, rather than the more sensitive PCR tests which had to be sent off and processed in a laboratory. But Operation Moonshot - as it was called by the government - got off to a bumpy start. There was alarm about the rumoured Â£100bn price tag, while some of the early results of a large pilot in Liverpool raised questions about the accuracy of the tests themselves. When twice-weekly rapid testing was rolled out in secondary schools in the spring of 2021, there were worries that large numbers of pupils would be incorrectly told they had the virus - a so-called ""false positive"" - and sent home. Some scientists said the school programme could do ""more harm than good"" and leaked emails claimed it could all be scaled back. But data now suggests much of that concern was misplaced. Since March, 183,939 pupils in England have tested positive on a lateral flow test at home and then had a sample sent off to a laboratory for a follow-up PCR test. In total 89% of those swabs returned the same positive result. Secondary school students took tests as they returned after the Christmas holidays The proportion of false positives does increase when the prevalence of the disease falls in society. But the weekly rate of those positive lateral flow tests later confirmed by PCR has never fallen below 50% and has been above 84% since the start of the school year in September. No medical test - not even one conducted in a laboratory - can ever be 100% accurate. Some schooling was disrupted unnecessarily but - overall - those real-world results were better than some had first feared. Alexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology at the University of Reading, says it ""quickly became clear"" that if the tests were used as instructed, ""you don't tend to get large numbers of false positives"". Gradually those same rapid lateral flow tests have become part of everyday life. To begin with they were rolled out in healthcare settings, workplaces and sporting events. Then in April, the programme was extended to the general public. Boxes of seven tests could be delivered free, or picked up from a pharmacy. But false positives are not the only possible drawback with mass testing on this scale. Some scientists are concerned that the public are often far too trusting if their lateral flow test comes back negative. ""It is absolutely not a get-out-of-jail free card, and you do need to continue to take precautions like mask wearing and social distancing,"" says Prof Sheila Bird from the MRC Biostatistics Unit at the University of Cambridge. ""It is helping to weed out some, but certainly not all, of the true positives."" On social media over Christmas it wasn't hard to find posts from people who said they were clear on multiple rapid tests taken at home - even with Covid symptoms - only to test positive on a more sensitive PCR test processed in a laboratory.

Ananalysis of the lateral flow kit used in Liverpool,externalshowed it only detected around half of people without symptoms who - on the same day - returned a positive PCR result. But those PCRs can pick up old genetic material from the virus left in the body even after the infectious period. Prof Petersen says that rapid lateral flow tests are far better at spotting the cases most likely to pass Covid on to someone else. Apeer-reviewed paper,externalshe co-authored in October found they were 80% effective at detecting any level of active Covid infection and even better at picking up the most infectious individuals. Quite how well lateral flow kits perform against Omicron is still unclear. Experiments showed the main brands used in the UK did successfully detectall 15 of the samples,externalinfected with the new variant. But a small studypublished in the past week,external, and based on different kits used in the US, raised fresh concerns - finding that some Omicron cases could be infectious for several days before being detected by rapid tests using nasal swabs. Scientists say the lesson is - if possible - to test just before you socialise and think of a negative lateral flow as a solid guide rather than something that can ever rule out a Covid infection. Was it worth it? Health authoritiesbudgeted Â£4.7bn this financial year,externalfor mass testing in England with the bulk of that going to suppliers of the kits - most of which are manufactured in China. Whether all that money is worth it is something epidemiologists are likely to be arguing about for many years. Untangling the effects of rapid testing from all the other Covid measures - from mask wearing to self-isolation - is extremely difficult and open to some interpretation. A recentanalysis of the first Liverpool pilot,external, which has not yet been peer reviewed by other scientists, found that the early roll out of mass testing in the city was linked to a 32% fall in Covid hospital admissions, and relieved significant pressure on the NHS. Parts of that first pilot scheme have now become government policy - for example using daily rapid tests as an alternative to quarantine for some people. Some scientists would like to see ministers go further and use lateral flows to completely replace expensive PCR lab tests - both for those with and without Covid symptoms. ""The PCR programme is such a complete waste of resources. It's there because it was the only thing we had at the beginning. It should be phased out sooner rather than later,"" says Prof Irene Petersen at UCL. Others think that as the Omicron wave passes, it is time to wind down the mass testing programme completely. Education secretary Nadim Zahawi told the BBC there are currentlyno plans to ask people to pay for lateral flow tests,amid speculation that the free service could be scrapped if Omicron infections decline. He said an extra 425 million tests are due to be made available this month with further shipments expected after that. Allyson Pollock, professor of public health at Newcastle University, says tests should be part of a clinical diagnosis or targeted at places like care homes and hospitals, where people are working with vulnerable groups. ""The cost of mass testing has been staggering,"" she says. ""The best advice is if you have symptoms is to simply stay at home until you are better, and that way you will avoid spreading Covid, flu and a host of other viral infections. ""All tests create harms. Tests can give false reassurance on the one hand, and on the other can create false alarms and unnecessary isolation."" Is testing here to stay? Whatever happens to the pandemic itself though, scientists think mass testing may have opened the door to other more efficient ways of detecting disease in the near future. A new generation of lateral flow tests are going into production - designed to detect not just Covid but different forms of influenza and other viruses at the same time. Some scientists think we could all soon store a supply of rapid tests or ""viral thermometers"" in the medicine cabinet to help diagnose sickness far more quickly. ""We have drugs which can reduce the severity of influenza, for example, but they need to be taken very soon after infection,"" says Prof Alex Edwards. ""You might be able to have a system where a vulnerable person can get tested and get the drugs immediately. It would be great to see a positive outcome like that from this very negative pandemic.""

No fans at Six Nations may cost Cardiff millions,"About 100,000 people descend of Cardiff city centre for rugby internationals If Six Nations rugby games aren't held in Cardiff it will be financially devastating, businesses say. Wales are due to play three fixtures in the capital, but Welsh Covid rules state fans are not allowed to attend sports events. TheWelsh Rugby Union has considered playing its home games in Englandwhere crowds are allowed. Wales' daily Covid case average is 10,500, and the first minister is reviewing restrictions weekly. Mark Drakeford warned the ""storm of Omicron has arrived in Wales"" and the country had ""a tough few weeks ahead"", as he announced Covid rules would remain in Wales. But after almost two years of Covid restrictions, business owners have warned not having a big Six Nations rugby pay day could be the final straw for hospitality. What are the new Covid rules for the UK? What tests do I need to go on holiday? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? The City Arms pub, opposite the Principality Stadium, would normally be full on a match day. ""Millions will be drained from the local economy as it has done over Christmas, and it just can't continue like this,"" said Gary Corp, who runs the City Arms. The Principality Stadium's city centre location helps make Cardiff an attractive destination for sports fans ""We missed out on some of our most profitable nights of the year,"" he said. He said the City Arms would normally make about Â£15,000 on a rugby day, but if Wales does not play in Cardiff, he would ""be lucky"" to make Â£2,000. Rugby fans enjoy the hospitality of Cardiff outside the City Arms pub near the Principality Stadium ""I've never known a time like this,"" Mr Corp added. ""If no fans were allowed into the ground during the Six Nations, it would be devastating for us."" The Principality Stadium's unique position in the heart of Cardiff's city centre makes it a favourite with travelling sports fans and the hospitality businesses around it, rely on supporters either popping in for drink, having a meal or staying the night. Research estimated each Six Nations game played in Cardiff boosts Wales' economy by more than Â£20m with former sponsor RBS estimating the 2017 tournament - where Wales played two games at home - brought Wales Â£52m worth of revenue. Wales' first 2022 Six Nations game at their 74,000 Cardiff arena is against Scotland on Saturday, 12 February. They later play France and Italy in March. The last time Scottish rugby fans were in Wales was before their 2020 Six Nations fixture was postponed just before the first Covid lockdown ""February to March can be a slow time for cities and for the retail sector like hotels and restaurants, these games are important,"" said economist Prof Max Munday of Cardiff University. ""Where the fans are coming from is worth bearing in mind as people who are staying here - like from Scotland, France and Italy - like to spend more money than perhaps day-trippers from England."" Scott Gibbs scores in a famous win in the last time Wales played a home game outside of Wales at Wembley in 1999 The Pontcanna Inn, near the stadium, normally puts up travelling rugby fans. ""Six Nations international weekends are the busiest of the year for us,"" said supervisor Lowri Davies. Welsh rugby welcomed back fans after 18 months for games in the summer of 2021 ""This year, there are a few bookings for the first weekend, and then it gets busier. However, if the rules stay the same for supporters, those bookings will more than likely be cancelled. ""We were used to seeing 500 people in, the bar is packed full, and we have waiting lists for rooms. ""We'd ideally like to see it back to where it was pre-Covid in terms of numbers, but we don't see it happening for more than one reason. Owners have said customer confidence of going out to bars post Christmas has dropped amid rising Covid levels ""The rules are part of the reason, but also, people choose to stay away. We saw that over Christmas, people just don't come out as they did."" Wales' daily Covid case average has risen to almost 10,500 a day - which has almost doubled inside a week - and Mr Drakeford has warned Wales' currentrestrictions will remain in place for several weeks,external. Each home game gives the Welsh Rugby Union a Â£7m boost. Robert Rice's family has run a Welsh gifts shop in Cardiff for 40 years. ""Internationals, without fail, are the big days for us,"" he said. ""Specifically, the France and Scotland games are ones we look forward to. They are the best weekends of the year. They are the assured massive boosts that we need after the winter. Call to end 'cosy relationship' of beer and rugby Rugby fans asked to wear masks at Wales match What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? ""The French weekend specifically every two years tops everything for the rest of the year. Not having those weekends would be absolutely tragic for us. ""It highlights how important international weekend are for us. In 40 years we've seen nothing like this."" This video can not be played Wales' health minister would be âdisappointedâ if Wales' 2022 Six Nations games were played in England Any decision on Six Nations matches is unlikely to be resolved soon, with the first minister telling a press conference on Friday it would not be clear if it would be ""safe"" to allow fans to return for a ""couple of weeks"". ""We have to see the tide turn on the Omicron wave,"" Mr Drakeford said. ""Then if the model is accurate and we see the numbers coming down reasonably rapidly, then we will be in a position to see whether it is safe to see greater social mixing."" However, Mr Drakeford did not criticise the WRU for looking at options, including moving the games across the border, but said it was ""debatable"" if cases were still high. ""I think that is perfectly legitimate for them as a multi-million pound organisation, that has to think about its business as well as its sporting interests,"" he said. On Sunday, he told Sky News he hoped there was a ""sensible, pragmatic"" way to stop Chester FCfalling foul of Welsh Covid laws.

Hundreds dead in Nigeria bandit attacks - reports,"The criminal gangs are well organised and operate in several states in north-west and central Nigeria At least 200 people in Nigeria's north-western Zamfara state have been buried after a wave of vicious attacks by gangs of gunmen over several days. Survivors told the BBC that motorbike-riding gangsters attacked village after village, shooting indiscriminately. The attacks are believed to be in response to military air strikes on Monday that forced some of the criminal gangs from their forest hideouts. The groups have plagued Zamfara and neighbouring states for several years. Known locally as bandits, these gangs are sophisticated networks of criminals who operate across large swathes of territory, often stealing animals, kidnapping for ransom and killing those who confront them. This week, the government officially labelled bandits as terrorists, allowing security forces to impose tougher sanctions on the groups and their supporters. On Friday it was initially reported that more than 100 people had been killed by suspected bandit militants in the region, after some 300 gunmen on motorbikes arrived in as many as nine communities between Tuesday and Thursday night. Gunmen burnt homes and mutilated the bodies of their victims in the assault. Villager Idi Musa told the AFP news agency that the attackers also stole around 2,000 cattle. Local media reported that the armed groups behind the attacks appeared to be on the move - heading towards the western part of Zamfara state after abandoning hideouts in forested areas in response to sustained government attacks. A spokesperson for Humanitarian Affairs Minister Sadiya Umar Farouq told AFP that more than 200 people had been buried. ANALYSIS:Outrage at Nigeria's brazen bandit attacks WATCH:Kidnappers demand millions for a child's life EXPLAINER:The motorcycle bandits terrorising northern Nigeria She also confirmed that more than 10,000 people had been left homeless and many were still missing. Meanwhile, officials in neighbouring Kebbi state said bandits had released a further 30 schoolchildren and one teacher who had been held for six months. It is not clear if a ransom was paid for their release. In June, the kidnappers took 102 students and eight teachers from a school in the city of Birnin Kebbi. An unspecified number had already been freed last year, after their parents negotiated with the captors. Kidnapping for ransom is a huge criminal enterprise in Nigeria. A story has been trending this weekend about a father from Katsina state, which borders Zamfara to the east, who has been removing the roof of his house to sell the metal sheeting to raise a ransom of about $250 (Â£180) for his son. The Katsina Post shared the photos of Sai'du Faskari on Facebook. He had himself been kidnapped by gunmen, and his children had raised about $125 for his ransom. When his son went to pay the bandits off, he was then taken hostage. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari has promised that the government will not relent in its battle with the ""outlaws"". ""The latest attacks on innocent people by the bandits is an act of desperation by mass murderers, now under relentless pressure from our military forces,"" he said in a statement on Saturday night. Nigeria's armed forces said this week that they had killed 537 ""armed bandits and other criminal elements"" in the region and arrested 374 others since May last year.

Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special I am surprised that they are going to assess Ben Stokes because he is such a precious commodity. You don't mess around with side strains. You just don't because you can make them even worse - they are just about the most serious soft tissue injury you can get. He obviously can't bowl or throw and he's obviously out in the field so he can bat. If he plays in Hobart and he makes it worse it would definitely take him out of the West Indies tour and it might mean he might not be able to bowl at the start of next summer which is not the way that any new direction would want to begin.

What are NI's Covid testing and isolation rules?,"As Northern Ireland's Covid-19 rules and guidance continue to change, BBC News NI examines the remaining advice around testing and self-isolation. From 22 April, there have been developments with regards to testing sites, contact tracing and advice for household contacts of positive cases. Testing sites across Northern Irelandclosed on 22 April, with the requirement ending for symptomatic people to take a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Instead, people displaying Covid symptoms are advised to take a lateral flow test (LFT). These will continue to be available free from more than 500 pharmacies, or through online orders. However, people without symptoms are no longer advised to take LFTs, except in some limited circumstances. For instance, those providing close personal care at home, or visiting high risk settings such as a hospital, a care home or a hospice, are still advised to take a LFT. People who have been advised to take tests by health professionals, or those eligible for Covid-19 treatments who develop symptoms, are also advised to take LFTs. The Department of Health has asked that everyone who takes a LFT shouldreport their result,external. PCR testing will still be availableif you are advised by a healthcare professional to take a PCR test.,external Access to PCR for the small group who remain eligible for PCR testingwill be via the home ordering service.,external The contact tracing service, which was provided by the Public Health Agency in Northern Ireland, has shifted its focus to providing advice to positive Covid cases and their household. The provision for the wider community ended on 22 April. Household contacts will be advised to be aware of symptoms and to avoid close contact with individuals at higher risk. Both vaccinated and unvaccinated household contacts must take a lateral flow test if symptoms develop to ascertain if they too are positive. Health officials have advised that providing ventilation, cleaning surfaces, washing hands and spending as little time as possible in shared spaces, such as kitchens, bathrooms and sitting areas, are advice to limit the spread of the virus among a household. Following a positive LFT result, the guidance is that the person should self-isolate for up to 10 days, either from the date of the test or when symptoms started, whichever is sooner. However, this period can end early, if the person has two negative LFT results taken 24 hours apart, with the first taken no earlier than day five. Daily tests are advised if this is not met until there have been two consecutive tests taken 24 hours apart. Health officials advise that people should continue their self-isolation if they still have a high temperature, until this has returned to normal for a 48-hour period. Those who leave isolation on or after day six are advised to limit contact with people who are at high risk and not to visit a hospital or healthcare setting. If someone's lateral flow tests continue to be positive and they have completed 10 full days of isolation, they do not need to take any more LFTs after day 10 and may leave isolation the following day. If someone is concerned, they may choose to limit close contact with other people, especially those who are at higher risk of severe illness until 14 days after the start of their self-isolation period. In Northern Ireland, the executive lists the following as Covid symptoms: a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss of or change in sense of smell or taste However, the Department of Health in NI said in April thatCovid-19 symptomsmay not be limited to just fever, new continuous cough or loss of sense of smell or taste. It follows the official list of symptoms being expanded to include nine more signs of a coronavirus infection. The UK Health Security Agency'supdated guidance,externalnow lists symptoms including a sore throat, muscle pains and diarrhoea. The Covid-19 dashboard published by the Department of Health features the latest statistics on the number of deaths linked to the virus, case numbers and hospital figures. Since 5 January, people in Northern Ireland who tested positive using a LFT no longer needed to take a PCR test to confirm the result. The department has asked people who test positive on a LFT to record their result, however, these changes have led to some confusion about the true number of positive cases in Northern Ireland. In March, BBC News NI reported that daily casescould be as high as 20,000, at a time when the department's figures indicated it was about 2,500. The department's number of deaths do not necessarily refer to the previous 24 hour reporting period, while the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency (Nisra) has published different numbers on a weekly basis, which focus on deaths where the virus was included on a death certificate. The department's hospital figures show the number of patients at any time who are being treated in hospital while testing positive, with a separate number showing how many Covid-positive patients are in intensive care.

Cutting self-isolation further helpful - Zahawi,"This video can not be played Nadhim Zahawi says plans to cut self-isolation to five days are still under review Cutting the Covid self-isolation period to five days would ""certainly help"", a cabinet minister has said. Nadhim Zahawi also denied the government planned to stop supplying free lateral flow tests - after a report in a Sunday paper. People who test positive for Covid are required to self-isolate for at least seven days, but several sectors are experiencing staffing pressure. Mr Zahawi told the BBC the country was on the road ""from pandemic to endemic"". He said reducing the self-isolation period would help with staff absences in the workplace. Asked about exams, the education secretary said they would be going ahead but said there was also contingency planning. On the idea of stopping free lateral flow tests Mr Zahawi, a former vaccines minister, said he did not recognisethe Sunday Times report,external, saying the government had ordered 425 million lateral flow devices in January. ""We are not calling to an end free lateral flow tests,"" he said. Who needs to self-isolate now and for how long? Look familiar? How rapid tests changed the pandemic Covid isolation cut from 10 days to seven with tests The US recently shortened the self-isolation window to five days, and the education secretary said it was important to remember that in the UK isolation begins when you get symptoms while in the US it starts from when you test positive. Mr Zahawi told BBC One's Sunday Morning that the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) had said that there might be a higher spike if the period was cut from seven to five days. He said the government would follow the science but would keep the potential measure under review. Rules on self-isolation for people in England infected with Covid changed last month,dropping from 10 days' quarantine to sevenif they test negative on days six and seven. Scottish Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said his governmentwas ""not contemplating"" reducing the isolation timeto five days at this stage, having just made the change from 10 to seven days. ""I think it would be sensible to see the impact,"" he said. With vaccines and new treatments reducing the risk Covid presents, what's considered proportionate changes because of the need to balance the harms caused by the virus and those caused by trying to suppress it. Take the isolation period, infectiousness is not like a switch. It doesn't just go on to off. Instead, people gradually move from peak infectiousness to lower infectiousness. As we become more able to live with the virus because it's causing milder illness, the benefits of long isolation periods wane. But the costs in terms of missing school or disrupting work remain. Slowly, but surely, we will see a rowing back of the remaining measures in place. Plans are understood to have been drawn up within government to start this as early as March, but the rise of Omicron set that back. There are several steps that could be taken. Shortening the isolation period further and then ending it unless an individual has symptoms is one. Dismantling PCR testing infrastructure in the community is another. These lab tests are needed to keep an eye on variants, but that can be done by testing hospital patients. Before Mr Zahawi said there were no plans to end free lateral flow tests opposition politicians had criticised the suggestion free tests might be stopped. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said such a move would be an ""utterly wrongheaded"" approach to dealing with coronavirus. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said ending free tests would be the wrong policy at the wrong time, adding that the best way to prevent the need for further restrictions was to ensure that people could test regularly and stop passing on the virus. ""That's why we believe those lateral flow tests have got to remain free whilst we have huge numbers of cases on a daily basis,"" she said. This video can not be played Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi says there will be no end to free lateral flow tests Mr Zahawi also accepted more school staff will end up off work isolating for coronavirus as case rates rise when pupils return. He said staff absences were at about 8.5% last week but ""will increase, no doubt, because now schools are back we're going to see an increase in infection rates"". Contingency plans are being made for rising numbers of staff being off, the education secretary said, adding that some schools had remained open despite up to 40% of staff being absent. He said that ""exams in January are going ahead"" and ""in the summer we will be going ahead with GCSEs and A-levels"". But he added that there was ""always contingency planning"". There have been issues with staff absences in transport, health and schools as Covid cases rose over the festive period and in England Covid-related staff absences at hospitalshave risen sharply since Omicron took hold last month. And the boss of one of London's busiest hospitals has said he isworried about losing staff when mandatory vaccination rules come infrom April. It comes as the UK recorded 141,472 new cases, as well as 97 deaths within 28 days of a positive test - although the number of deaths recorded over weekends tends to be lower because of reporting delays. The total number of cases over the past seven days is up 6.6% on the previous week, while the figure for deaths is up 30.9%. Are you a business owner?

My gut would be that, unless he is shot, to play Hameed in Hobart. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special I am surprised that they are going to assess Ben Stokes because he is such a precious commodity. You don't mess around with side strains. You just don't because you can make them even worse - they are just about the most serious soft tissue injury you can get. He obviously can't bowl or throw and he's obviously out in the field so he can bat. If he plays in Hobart and he makes it worse it would definitely take him out of the West Indies tour and it might mean he might not be able to bowl at the start of next summer which is not the way that any new direction would want to begin. They are going to have to start again. I thought he'd be sitting on the next seat to Jos Buttler on the flight home. #bbccricket Andy Kerr:Well done England. Batted through a day twice in this Test, and despite everything Oz threw at them, they salvaged a heroic draw. Not many sports can have heroic draws, but that was one of them! Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special Joe Root was measured. It underlines what we have been saying. This does represent turning things around a little bit and hopefully, from England's perspective, starting again. Root looked terrible after Melbourne when I spoke to him. Captains live this 24 hours a day. It's a full on job. You wonder how does he feel now about the future. BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra More from England captain Joe Root:""I'll look back on this match with pride, in some respect. Once we were in the position we were coming into today, and last night as well. For the openers to handle that pressure and come out and perform like that, and follow it on as a batting group today, it shows that the character is there."" Steven FinnFormer England bowler on BBC Test Match Special Your mind is fully focused on the job when you go out as a lower-order player in that situation. When you get out there you're in full bunker down, just get through, strip the game back to its basics mindset. You find your focus and watch the ball so much harder than you usually do. BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra England captain Joe Root, speaking to TMS:""Relief is the overwhelming emotion and I'm quite proud too. We had a lot thrown at us in this game and guys have really stod up and showed a lot of character and pride. ""To come out and do that was really pleasing. It's a big step in the right direction. It's a step forward and one we have to build on going into that last Test. ""Today shows how much it means to them. When you find yourself out of the series it is really important you front up and time and time again show how much it means to you. I think everyone has done that this week. ""Jonny's performance, having taken the knock as well, was some of the best batting I've seen him produce in an England shirt. Similarly Ben and Jos as well, it showed a lot of character and put the team first. ""Jos is going to fly home. It's a quite serious injury. To front up after that knock shows a huge amount of character."" Here's the moment England secured the draw. Look at Ben Stokes! Imagine what he'd have been like if the result of this Test had an impact on the series. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special You have saved the match. You've done it hard. You've stopped the juggernaut that was just rolling down. It's significant. Simon MannBBC Test Match Special commentator I was trying to look at the dressing room to see the reaction. In a way, you have to be a bit quiet about your celebrations. #bbccricket Jenifer Moore:People who say Test cricket is boring know nothing. Jonathan AgnewBBC cricket correspondent on BBC Test Match Special England will feel so much happier. They won't be known as the team that were whitewashed. One person who will definitely be playing in Hobart is Zak Crawley. He was excellent at the top of the order today. He is so easy on the eye and surely has a very bright future in this England team. Who knows what England we will see in the final Test at Hobart, that starts on 14 January. We know that Jos Buttler is definitely going home. That means either Sam Billings may make his Test debut or Ollie Pope will come into the side. There are serious doubts over Ben Stokes and Jonny Bairstow and then there will be decisions to make around the bowlers, as always. Does Haseeb Hameed keep his place at the top of the order too? He now has six successive single-figure scores after another failure today. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
