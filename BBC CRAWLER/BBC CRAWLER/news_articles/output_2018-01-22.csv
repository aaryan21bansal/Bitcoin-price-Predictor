Army chief warns of Russian threat,"This video can not be played General Sir Nick Carter: Russia could initiate hostilities sooner than expected Britain's ability to respond to military threats from Russia will be ""eroded"" without further investment, the head of the Army has said. Russian hostility could come sooner than expected and Britain must prepare to ""fight the war we might have to fight"", General Sir Nick Carter added. The speech - approved by Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson - comes amidspeculation of potential defence cuts. The warning comes after Russia has practised simulated attacks in Europe. In the speech, at the Royal United Services Institute, Gen Carter highlighted Russia's new cyber warfare capabilities. He also spoke about Russian long-range missile strike capability, which he said was demonstrated in Syria when 26 missiles were deployed from a 1,500km (930 mile) range. Gen Carter said Russia was building an increasingly aggressive expeditionary force and the potential military threats to the UK ""are now on Europe's doorstep"". He said the Kremlin already boasted an ""eye-watering quantity of capability"" - a level the UK would struggle to match. Gen Carter stressed that Britain ""must take notice of what is going on around us"" or that the ability by the UK to take action will be ""massively constrained"". ""Rather like a chronic contagious disease, it will creep up on us, and our ability to act will be markedly constrained - and we'll be the losers of this competition,"" he said. He said he did ""not in any way"" want to suggest that Russia would go to war in the traditional sense, but that Moscow ""could initiate hostilities sooner than we expect"". ""I don't think it will start with little green men, it will start with something we don't expect. We should not take what we have seen so far as a template for the future."". Reality Check: What's happening to defence spending? Five questions on defence spending Zapad: What can we learn from Russia's latest military exercise? It comes as the Russian armyconducted large scale military exercises last yearon home soil, in Belarus and in the Russian territory of Kaliningrad - which is sandwiched between Nato members Poland and Lithuania. It was one of Russia's biggest military exercises since its 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula. Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said the UK's Â£36bn annual defence budget meant the government was addressing the range of threats from ""a position of strength"". However, Labour shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith said she was sure Gen Carter would have tried to make his case behind closed doors but had gone public as a ""last resort"". She added that if voicing concerns over funding made the prime minister and the chancellor ""wake up"", it would have been worth ""making the fuss"". Admiral Lord West, former head of the Royal Navy, said such warnings from a serving chief were unprecedented. ""For them to talk about the need for more resources, I haven't known that in my 52 years in the navy - I mean this is extraordinary,"" he said. By Jonathan Beale, defence correspondent Russia's new Armata T-14 tank The reality is that Britain would never confront a threat like Russia on its own. That's why it is part of Nato. But even as a key member of the alliance, the truth is that some of the UK's weapons are increasingly outdated. WhileRussia's been developing new Armata tanks,the Army's Challenger 2 hasn't been modernised for 20 years. Many have been mothballed as the UK focused on the counter-insurgency campaign in Iraq and Afghanistan. Britain's ground-based air defence systems are also becoming increasingly obsolete and no match for Russia. Still, the likelihood of any direct military confrontation with Russia seems extremely remote. True, the US National Defence Strategy recently highlighted the risks of a more assertive Russia and China. But for now, the concern is more about those countries using cyber and misinformation to disrupt life in the West. General Carter's intervention is more driven by fears of further deep cuts to the UK's armed forces. The Ministry of Defence has a black hole in its budget. It is rare for a military chief to make such an obvious and public appeal for more cash. But he's doing it under the orders of the Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson. He has sent his generals over the top to put pressure on the chancellor. Robert Hannigan, who stood down as director of the intelligence monitoring service GCHQ last year, said Russia was the single country that had ""kept me awake"" in recent years. He told BBC Radio 5 live: ""They have always been very capable, but in the last two, three, four years they've become quite aggressive."" Gen Carter's speech comes as national security adviser Mark Sedwill conducts a review of the UK's security capabilities. All three armed forces have been asked to put forward options for cuts as the Ministry of Defence looks at how it will control spending. There are concerns within the forces that the review will prioritise counter-cyber attacks and terrorism, rather than major defence. This video can not be played Watch: Russia's war game in 2017 under way Col Rupert Wieloch, a former senior British commander of forces in Libya, said the structure of funding needed to be addressed so that money for the armed forces was not ""confused"" with money for cyber security. However, Britain's armed forces are now at their smallest since the Napoleonic wars. The size of the Army has been cut from more than 100,000 to 82,000 since 2010. Last week Conservative MP Julian Lewis, chairman of the Commons defence select committee, posed an urgent question in the Commons after speculation that there were plans to cut the UK military by 14,000 service personnel, nine warships and 100 helicopters. Mr Williamson said ""hard work"" is taking place to give the armed forces the ""right resources"". Some MPs have called to increase defence spending to 3% of GDP.It is currently at 2%- in line with guidelines for Nato members.

JLR cuts Range Rover production,"The Range Rover Evoque has been made at Halewood since 2011 Jaguar Land Rover will cut production of some vehicles amid uncertainty over Brexit and changes to taxes on diesel cars. The company will temporarily scale back output of the Discovery Sport and Range Rover Evoque models later this year. Last week, JLR said its global sales hit a record in 2017, but that the UK market was ""tough"". Vehicle makers have blamed Brexit confusion and a hike in diesel taxation for a general fall in UK car sales. The two Land Rover models are made at the company's Halewood plant on Merseyside. Output will be reduced in the second quarter of 2018. JLR said the car industry continued to face a ""range of challenges"" that were hitting consumer confidence. Diesel cars: Your questions answered What's gone wrong in the UK car market? ""Ongoing uncertainty surrounding Brexit is being felt by customers at home - with demand for new cars down 5.7% in 2017 - and in Europe where collectively, we sell approximately 45% of total UK production. ""Add to this, concern around the future of petrol and diesel engines, and general global economic and political uncertainty and it's clear to see why industry is seeing an impact on car sales."" It said it regularly reviewed production schedules to ensure market demand was ""balanced"". The Range Rover Evoque has been made at Halewood since 2011 and Discovery Sport since 2014. ""Volumes have remained at peak levels since that time, allowing us to maintain what was initially a three-shift pattern. These changes to operating patterns are temporary and sensible business practice,"" JLR added. Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders for November showed the number of cars built in the UK fell 4.6%, driven lower by a fall in domestic demand, while exports grew. SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes said at the time: ""Brexit uncertainty, coupled with confusion over diesel taxation and air quality plans, continues to impact domestic demand for new cars and, with it, production output.""

A&E stats may have to be recalculated,"NHS hospital trusts in England may have to recalculate A&E performance figures from last October onwards. The UK Statistics Authority has told NHS England to explain changes to the recording of A&E data. It says the changes - highlighted by BBC News - could have left people reaching ""misleading conclusions"". They raise questions over some trusts' performance on the highest profile NHS performance target - that patients in A&E are seen within four hours. Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: ""The changes that are understood to have been made to recording practice throw doubt on whether the scale of the crisis facing emergency medicine - made so clear in December's data - is actually greater than first thought."" The letter focuses on advice given to trusts by the health regulator NHS Improvement. Ed Humpherson, of the UKSA, says changes suggested by officials could ""be having impact on recording practice."" Ambulance A&E delays hit one in eight Long A&E waits: 3m a year wait over four hours The official target requires 95% of patients to be treated, assessed or discharged within four hours, a figure the NHS has failed to meet since July 2015. A hospital trust's performance figures include the main accident and emergency department (known as Type 1) and minor injuries or care centres (known as Type 3). These centres tend to see and treat patients a lot more quickly than those needing emergency care. Data in these clinics tends to pull up the overall performance of a trust. This is confirmed by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. The BBC has seen emails sent by NHS Improvement, the body responsible for overseeing trusts, in October last year. In one email titled ""counting of A&E performance"" sent to trusts in the south of England, it says they have committed to meeting the 95% target by March 2018 but that trusts had marginally failed to make the required progress.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The email urged trusts to make sure they counted all their performance. It said if ""there is an urgent activity undertaken by a walk-in centre or urgent treatment centre or other provider within your local delivery board that currently is not reporting activity - we can work with you to apportion the activity to the main provider"". The implication is that including these centres would help improve overall performance. This, and another email sent later in October by NHS Improvement, was seen by trusts as a request to add in data from walk-in centres not run by them and not on hospital grounds. This is in direct conflict with clear guidance issued in November 2015 by NHS England, which says walk-in centre data can be included only if the trust has clinical responsibility for the service or if it co-located on the trust's grounds. Analysis by the BBC shows as least six trusts in England have seen an improvement in their all A&E types four-hour performance figures in October compared with September by adding in walk-in centres not on their site and not run by the trusts. It is thought some trusts have seen their four-hour performance improve by nearly much as 5%. University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust A&E performance figures now include additional data for the City of Coventry Walk In Centre, which is run by Virgin Care Services and contracted by the local commissioning group Another email from Jim Mackey, the outgoing chief executive of NHS Improvement, to trusts in October also wanted to make sure alternative pathways to A&E - such as urgent clinics - were included in trusts' performance data. None of the changes is clear on the dataset produced by NHS England each month. The data produced by NHS England for affected trusts is no longer directly comparable from October 2017 onwards with the corresponding months of preceding years. An NHS Improvement official said it intended to address variation in the way A&E activity was being reported to ensure all trusts were reporting the same activity on the same basis. ""This change was not intended to artificially inflate A&E performance figures,"" the official said. NHS Improvement denied any attempt had been made to secretly change the way figures were reported. The Department of Health and Social Care said data should be collected as NHS  England had suggested ""so we have a clear and consistent picture of A&E performance across the country"". Figures for December 2017 show 85.1% of people were seen admitted, treated or discharged in England in all types of A&E department in four hours, the same as in January 2017, the worst performance on record. The BBC understands Monday's intervention by the UK statistics Authority means the NHS will have to seriously consider reviewing and republishing data from October, when the NHS has been dealing with winter pressures.

Civil servants want to 'frustrate Brexit',"Lord Lawson of Blaby served as chancellor between 1983-89 Civil servants will ""do their best to frustrate"" Brexit, Lord Lawson has said in an interview with BBC Newsnight. The former chancellor said Whitehall felt uneasy about Brexit because it represented radical change. His remarks highlight unease in the cabinet at the civil service's handling of Brexit. Cabinet secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood responded by saying that the civil service prided itself on supporting the mandate of the government of the day. In a statement to Newsnight, Sir Jeremy said: ""In this case the mandate has come from the British people, has been endorsed overwhelmingly by Parliament and is the driving mission of the current government."" The cabinet secretary issued a rare statement after Lord Lawson spoke to Newsnight as part of a profile of Olly Robbins, the senior civil servant who serves as Prime Minister Theresa May's chief adviser on the EU. Brexit: All you need to know The key Brexit dates in 2018 Reality Check: Guidelines for Brexit negotiations Known as the prime minister's EU ""sherpa"", Mr Robbins works by her side in Whitehall and is the day-to-day UK Brexit negotiator with the European Commission in Brussels. Lord Lawson of Blaby, who served as chancellor between 1983-89, said his period in government showed that civil servants will implement radical change only if they are given strong political direction. Lord Lawson told Newsnight: ""The officials will do their best to frustrate this process because it goes against the grain so fundamentally. But they equally realise their constitutional duty to accept the leadership of the politicians, of the elected government."" The former chancellor, who was one of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's strongest supporters until they fell out in 1989, thought the 1980s provided a useful parallel. He said: ""Brexit is a most radical change of direction for this country. The idea that any bureaucrat could be in favour of radical change is a nonsense. Bureaucrats by their very nature loathe radical change of any kind. ""I was... a member of the Thatcher government. We came in and introduced radical change in economic policy. All the officials were aghast. They thought it would be a disaster. But at that time we had a strong cabinet led by an outstanding prime minister and they accepted the political leadership as is their constitutional duty. ""So we made this radical change and it worked out very well. It is really the job of the government, the cabinet and above all the prime minister to force this through."" Sir Jeremy rallied to the defence of the civil service. In a statement issued to Newsnight, the cabinet secretary said: ""The civil service has always prided itself on supporting the elected government of the day in carrying out its mandate. In this case the mandate has come from the British people, has been endorsed overwhelmingly by Parliament and is the driving mission of the current government. Sir Jeremy Heywood said the civil service prided itself on supporting the mandate of the government of the day ""The civil service is putting enormous effort and many of its very best people into making a success of the project. It is being tested on a daily basis and I am very proud of what we have -  so far - delivered. Morale is at record-levels, proving once again that the civil service is at is very best when under pressure."" The criticisms by Lord Lawson, who stressed that he was speaking about the civil service in general because he does not know Mr Robbins, reflect the private views of some cabinet ministers. One senior minister said he believes that Mr Robbins regards Brexit as a crisis to be managed rather than an opportunity to be seized. Speaking anonymously, the minister told Newsnight: ""The civil service is very defensive on Brexit. They do see it as a problem."" Tom Fletcher, an Oxford contemporary of Mr Robbins who later served alongside him as a senior official in Downing Street, strongly defended his old friend. He described Mr Robbins as an impartial civil servant committed to implementing the wishes of his political bosses. Mr Fletcher told Newsnight: ""[Olly Robbins] believes in public service. My impression is he believes he is there to work for the minister, for the prime minister. That comes through all of his interactions with them. It is not like an episode of Yes Prime Minister."" Mr Robbins, a low profile official who started his Whitehall career as a high flying Treasury official, wields immense influence in Whitehall. His proximity to the prime minister, from his perch in the cabinet office, means that he speaks with authority on her behalf in Whitehall, in Brussels and during visits to other EU capitals. Some Leave figures in government regard him with suspicion. Mr Robbins is understood to be aware of the criticisms and has worked hard to build up relations with the likes of Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. Mr Robbins was appointed as the prime minister's EU ""sherpa"" and as the founding permanent secretary of the new department for exiting the EU (DEXEU) in 2016. He won Mrs May's confidence as a senior Home Office official during her time as home secretary. In September, he dropped his post as permanent secretary at DEXEU to allow him to concentrate on his sherpa role on behalf of the prime minister.

Anger at Â£4k disabled parking charge,"The cost of disabled parking bays varies across the country A woman with multiple sclerosis has criticised an ""extortionate"" Â£3,800 charge to create a disabled parking bay outside her home. Cornwall Council charges applicants for a disabled bay thousands of pounds but elsewhere people pay nothing. Councillor Richard Pears said the authority is ""effectively charging people for being disabled"" and the cost should be subsidised. The matter will be discussed at afull council meeting,externalon Tuesday. In comparison, Medway Council in Kentcharges Â£40,external(if successful), while Leicestershire County Councilcharges Â£100,external. Cornwall Council said the Â£3,800 cost is for a Traffic Regulation Order, advertising, public consultation and painting the new bay. However, once installed the space does not guarantee parking for an individual as it is available for any disabled person to use. More news from Cornwall Deb Race said the Â£3,800 charge for a disabled bay outside her home 'doesn't seem fair' Deb Race, from St Austell in Cornwall, decided against paying for a disabled bay. She said: ""Just carrying anything up the road from the car is really difficult and each step is painful. ""To find nearly Â£4,000 and then have a lottery still as to whether I could park outside my house was totally prohibitive. It didn't seem fair."" Disabled parking bays can be advisory - where no action can be taken if another person parks there - or mandatory - where action can be taken against anyone parking there without a blue badge. Richard Pears said the charge is 'extortionate' Conservative councillor Mr Pears said: ""It's completely extortionate.

'Deacon of death' on trial in Bruges,"Ivo Poppe allegedly caused embolisms by deliberately injecting air into the bloodstream A Catholic deacon accused of killing at least 10 people - including his own mother - has gone on trial in Belgium. Former nurse Ivo Poppe is suspected of killing his victims by injecting air into their blood, causing a fatal embolism. The offences are alleged to have taken place at a clinic in Menen, where he worked as a nurse - and later, after being ordained, in a pastoral role. Belgian newspapers have nicknamed the 61-year-old man the ""deacon of death"". If found guilty of all the alleged murders, he would become one of the worst serial killers in Belgian history. Mr Poppe was arrested in 2014 after telling his psychiatrist that he had ""euthanised"" dozens of people. All of the alleged victims were elderly patients. He had, according to reports, initially made partial confessions during the investigation, saying he was acting compassionately for those who were terminally ill. However, he later retracted his statement and now denies the charges against him. The Facebook post that caught a killer German nurse 'killed at least 100' Belgium minor first 'helped to die' Among those he is formally accused of murdering are several relatives: two great-uncles, his father-in-law, and his mother - the most recent alleged victim, who died in 2011. His mother had reportedly been suffering from depression - but her doctors have denied that she would have chosen to be euthanised. Prosecutors have alleged that the deacon killed many more, pointing to a list of deaths at the hospital he noted in his diary. They say at least 50 deaths are suspicious. At Monday's hearing in a court in Bruges, his lawyers downplayed any such suggestion. Instead, they said he simply noted deaths that happened around him, according to Belgian broadcaster RTBF. The trial is expected to last more than a week and hear from dozens of witnesses, including relatives of the deceased.

Sir Bobby Charlton, who played in the same Army teams as Armfield during their national service, and later alongside him for England at the 1962 World Cup in Chile, spoke of his sadness. He said: ""I knew the man as well as the player, and it was not by chance that we stayed in touch for so long after we both retired. ""I have missed listening to his authoritative radio commentaries and now I will miss seeing Mr Blackpool around the scene."" Sir Geoff Hurst, who played with Armfield twice in the run-up to the 1966 World Cup, said: ""Jimmy was a great part of our group at the World Cup, one of the great full-backs, and one of the nicest guys you could wish to meet. ""I got to know him more after the World Cup, playing golf and at the reunions. Just an absolutely super guy and a sad loss."" Despite being a member of the 1966 cup-winning squad, a toe injury meant Armfield did not play as the team went on to win the tournament. Allow Twitter content?

Armfield, who was born in Denton, Greater Manchester, was a team-mate of Sir Stanley Matthews at Blackpool, where he made his name as an overlapping right-back. Armfield was never sent off during his career and was only booked once, after two fouls in an FA Cup match against Norwich City. He later wrote:  ""I had played more than 500 League games by then and the referee was almost apologetic."" Armfield leads England out with Bobby Moore behind him Armfield became manager of Bolton in 1971, and took over at Leeds in 1974, replacing Brian Clough and guiding them to a European Cup final, where they were beaten 2-0 by Bayern Munich. Leeds player Eddie Gray, who spent his entire career at the club, said Armfield ""steadied the ship"" and ""completely turned things round"" when Clough left. ""It wasn't an easy time for Jimmy to come in because the team were getting that bit older as well, but his manner, the way he conducted himself in and around the club was terrific,"" he said. Former Everton and England footballer Peter Reid, who played under Armfield at Bolton, also used Twitter to pay tribute. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Armfield was made a freeman of Blackpool in 2003 and named a CBE in December 2009 for services to Lancashire. Blackpool council leader Simon Blackburn said flags were flying at half-mast at the town hall, adding: ""His impact was absolutely huge. He was a big part of the community."" In 2010, the new South Stand at Blackpool FC's Bloomfield Road ground was named in his honour, and a statue commissioned by the Blackpool Supporters' Association was erected outside a year later.

Armfield played alongside Stanley Matthews at Blackpool His family said: ""Jimmy had two great loves, first and foremost was his family, to which he was devoted and loved dearly. The other was football, especially Blackpool, England and his colleagues at the PFA (Professional Footballers' Association). ""The family extends its thanks as we try to come to terms in a world without Jimmy."" Blackpool FC said: ""Our heartfelt condolences go out to Jimmy's wife Anne, his two sons, Duncan and John, and the rest of the Armfield family at this time."" PFA chief Gordon Taylor, who counted Armfield as a personal friend, said he was ""a national hero and football legend, Blackpool icon and captain of England, he will be sadly missed by all who knew him"". As a tribute to the resort's adopted son Blackpool Tower was lit up in Tangerine - Blackpool FC's colours - and the flag flew at half mast on council buildings.

"Anger at Â£4k disabled parking chargeA council's charge of Â£3,800 for installing a disabled parking bay is branded ""completely unfair"".27m28 minutes agoEngland","The cost of disabled parking bays varies across the country A woman with multiple sclerosis has criticised an ""extortionate"" Â£3,800 charge to create a disabled parking bay outside her home. Cornwall Council charges applicants for a disabled bay thousands of pounds but elsewhere people pay nothing. Councillor Richard Pears said the authority is ""effectively charging people for being disabled"" and the cost should be subsidised. The matter will be discussed at afull council meeting,externalon Tuesday. In comparison, Medway Council in Kentcharges Â£40,external(if successful), while Leicestershire County Councilcharges Â£100,external. Cornwall Council said the Â£3,800 cost is for a Traffic Regulation Order, advertising, public consultation and painting the new bay. However, once installed the space does not guarantee parking for an individual as it is available for any disabled person to use. More news from Cornwall Deb Race said the Â£3,800 charge for a disabled bay outside her home 'doesn't seem fair' Deb Race, from St Austell in Cornwall, decided against paying for a disabled bay. She said: ""Just carrying anything up the road from the car is really difficult and each step is painful. ""To find nearly Â£4,000 and then have a lottery still as to whether I could park outside my house was totally prohibitive. It didn't seem fair."" Disabled parking bays can be advisory - where no action can be taken if another person parks there - or mandatory - where action can be taken against anyone parking there without a blue badge. Richard Pears said the charge is 'extortionate' Conservative councillor Mr Pears said: ""It's completely extortionate. ""We're charging Â£3,800 down in Cornwall, one of the most deprived areas of the country. It's completely unfair.""

What does a government shutdown cost?,"A kiosk at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington explains what is going on A stand-off over the budget has led to a temporary shutdown of the US government. What will be the economic cost? The Senate has reached a compromise to reopen the government, as the impasse entered a third day. But while that brings a short-term spending deal closer - it must be approved by the House - some economists worry it could signal bigger problems to come. The temporary solution could help the US avoid one of the most direct consequences of the shutdown - lost hours by federal workers. In 2013, when the government shut down for 16 days, workers eventually received about $2bn for the furloughed time. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimated,externalthat the lost hours - at national parks, permit offices, federal loan programmes and the like - lowered economic growth in the fourth quarter by 0.3%. US government shutdown: How did we get here? There were also indirect effects, as the shutdown limited tourist activities and delayed pay cheques squeezed consumer spending. And some government contractors - who number in the hundreds of thousands - never regained the pay lost during the period. In 2013, the combination of indirect and direct costs amounted to as much as 0.6% of quarterly GDP or $24bn,according to some analyses,external. This time around, the Trump administration worked to limit the effects, keeping some national parks open and deeming more employees to be ""essential"" workers. Beth Ann Bovino, chief economist at S&P Global, says this will go down as a ""blip"" for the US economy. But the problem could repeat itself when the temporary spending bill runs out. A prolonged shutdown can hurt economic growth. Goldman Sachs estimates that each week of a shutdown could lead to roughly 0.2% reduction in quarterly GDP growth. As Congress headed towards a shutdown last week, US markets closed at record highs, again. Analysts say it is possible that the dysfunction could cause investor attitudes to swing, but the reaction during previous shutdowns suggests the effect will be modest. On the first day of shutdowns in prior years, markets fell an average of 0.9%, according to Goldman Sachs. And during three of the longest episodes (in the 1990s and in 2013), markets eventually gained 1.2% by the time the shutdowns ended. Previous shutdowns have forced the two sides to come together, helping to provide policy certainty. But unlike previous shutdowns, this one is happening when a single party controls both the White House and Congress. That has some economists worried that the gridlock over the budget is a preview of more battles to come - which would pose more problems than the short-term economic consequences would suggest. ""The direct economic costs of a government shutdown, either today or later this year, should be minimal, but it's easy to craft a scenario where the shutdown causes bigger problems down the road by boosting partisan conflict and policy uncertainty,"" Moody's Analytics writes. From 2013: US government shutdown isnât the worst of it US political dysfunction was a primary factor when S&P downgraded the US debt rating in 2011, a move that has the potential to raise the cost of borrowing. Questions over the debt level are expected to surface again this spring. Moody's also estimates that policy uncertainty could lead to about 2.1 million fewer new jobs over a two-year period. But the firm warned it may be overstating the effects. After all, as Ms Bovino says, when it comes to US government dysfunction, ""investors have gotten used to it"". ""We've been here so long now,"" she said. ""It weighs on business confidence. I don't know how much though.""

White House voicemail blames Democrats,"This video can not be played Donald Trump's shutdown voicemail The White House changed its answering machine message to blame Donald Trump's political opponents for its failure to answer calls. The recording was made amid a US government shutdown that left many federal services without staff. But callers to the White House comment line at the weekend were informed that Democrats were to blame. The recorded message said calls could not be answered because Democrats were holding government funding ""hostage"". The recorded message was set up on the White House comment phone line, which accepts calls from members of the public. ""Unfortunately, we cannot answer your call today because Congressional Democrats are holding government funding - including funding for our troops and other national security priorities - hostage to an unrelated immigration debate,"" the recording says. ""Due to this obstruction, the government is shut down."" US politicians in bid to end shutdown Why the US government has shut down Some members of the public opposed to Mr Trump expressed outrage at the partisan message on the public service. The message seemed so unusual to some that it was confirmed as genuine by journalists and fact-checking website Snopes. The line was frequently busy at the weekend, requiring multiple attempts before the BBC could get through to confirm the recording. The government shutdownbegan at midnight on Friday, when lawmakers failed to agree an extension to federal funding. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two men jailed for executive's murder,"Guy Hedger was at home with his husband when he was killed Two men have been jailed for murdering an executive in a botched burglary at his luxury home. Guy Hedger, 61, was shot dead in the raid at Ashley, Dorset, in the early hours of 30 April 2017. Jason Baccus, from Bournemouth, and Kevin Downton, from Winterborne Stickland, were convicted unanimously after a two-month trial at Winchester Crown Court. The pair have been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 34 years. Police said a breakthrough in the case came from DNA found on cigarette butts near the murder scene. Baccus, 42, and Downton, 40, were also found guilty of aggravated burglary, possessing a firearm and one count of burglary. They previously pleaded guilty to another count of burglary. During sentencing, judge Mr Justice Jay described the burglary as ""amateurish and incompetent"". Jason Baccus (left) and Kevin Downton have been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 34 years In a victim impact statement, Mr Hedger's husband Simon-Pierre Hedger-Cooper, known as Si, said the final moments of Guy's life were ""full of terror, fear and pain"". He said the shooting had ""radically changed my life forever - an experience from which I will never recover"". ""My life feels empty and full of sadness and darkness,"" he said. ""Deep and searing pain of never being able to properly say goodbye."" A gun was among items recovered from the River Stour during the police investigation Scott Keeping, 44, from Bournemouth, was found not guilty of murder as well as the other above charges. His wife Helen Keeping, 40, also known as Helen Cooper, was found not guilty of two counts of assisting an offender. The trial heard how Mr Hedger and his husband were confronted in their bedroom by two men wearing balaclavas and armed with a sawn-off shotgun. Mr Hedger was shot when his husband hit a panic button, triggering alarms. Guy Hedger's house is in a cul-de-sac in Ashley, Dorset Police admitted for the first 24 hours after the shooting they had no idea who may have been involved. It was what they called a ""cold start"". But the major breakthrough came when they found discarded cigarette butts around the corner from Guy Hedger's home. They contained the DNA of Jason Baccus. Police were then able to identify his known associates and track their movements at the time of the shooting. This led them to Kevin Downton, and Scott and Helen Keeping. Without the discovery of this crucial forensic link officers said it may have taken them much longer to identify those responsible. In a video shown to the court, Mr Hedger-Cooper said: ""I heard an almighty boom, shot, and Guy said 'I have been hit, I have been hit'."" Mr Hedger, the brand and marketing director of insurance firm Liverpool Victoria, died two hours later in hospital from a gunshot wound to the chest. Diamond jewellery and watches were among items worth more than Â£120,000 which were stolen in the burglary, near Ringwood. The court heard the intruders also removed an iPhone and landline in a ""callous"" attempt to stop Mr Hedger-Cooper calling the emergency services. Watches stolen from Guy Hedger's home were among items found in undergrowth next to a public footpath in Bournemouth Baccus told the court he had committed domestic and commercial burglaries in the past to fund his drink and drug habits. In evidence, he also said he had ""spent most of my adult life in prison,"" having started shoplifting at the age of five. In recent periods out of prison he would stay with Mr and Mrs Keeping at their home in Bournemouth, the court heard. Police said some of the stolen valuables were found hidden in a chimney breast of their flat. Downton, who worked as a carpenter, claimed he had been shopping for a birthday present for his daughter at Toys R Us in Poole on the evening of the murder. He said he visited ""two or three friends"" on the way home but declined to name them. He met fellow inmate Baccus in prison more than a decade ago and would buy cocaine from him, the court heard. Downton told the court the pair committed commercial burglaries together but denied having ever burgled a home. Jewellery stolen during the burglary was found in undergrowth at the side of a public footpath in Bournemouth Sentencing the pair, the judge said: ""Guy Hedger died in his bedroom when he was shot by you, Kevin Downton. You were an enthusiastic participant. ""You removed two phones from the bedside table. You have a cold ruthless streak and have shown no remorse."" He described Baccus as a ""career criminal"" who ""recruited"" Downton as the gunman, and who had also shown no remorse.

Brand in homeless plea for royal wedding,"Brand's wish is for the council to give a building to a homeless charity Russell Brand has called on a council to donate a building to house the homeless people of Windsor as a wedding gift to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. A petition launched by the comedian has gained more than 70,000 signatures. It comes after Windsor and Maidenhead Council leader Simon Dudley called on police to tackle ""aggressive begging"" in the town. Brand wants neighbouring Slough Borough Council to give a building to charity Shoc (Slough Homeless Our Concern). This video can not be played ""Medieval"": Find out what Windsor makes of the royal wedding row Shoc's current lease ceases in April. Shoc chief executive Steve Headley said if ""people forced to sleep rough in Windsor are forcibly removed"" the charity would be the ""obvious service that would assist them"". He added: ""If Shoc closes due to a lack of a building, this would not only overwhelm the other projects, but lives will be at risk."" In a video, Brand criticised Mr Dudley's comments, saying they were ""some terrifying sort of eugenics, genocide, burn the books, burn the people-type language"". Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry at St George's Chapel in Windsor on 19 May Brand added, ""of course it's not Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's fault"", but ""it is an interesting indication that in order to make this wedding spick and span and spotless, the most vulnerable people in society are being exposed to yet more persecution"". A Slough Borough Council spokeswoman said the authority was in contact and discussion with the homeless charity. Mr Dudley defended his comments about begging and said he was referring to anti-social behaviour, not homelessness. Theprime minister was among those who disagreed with Mr Dudley's views.

Universities face 14 days of strikes,"If talks fail, some universities could face strike action next month Top universities face 14 days of strike action, starting next month, if a row over planned changes to staff pensions is not resolved. Overall, 61 universities could be affected after members of the University and College Union voted in favour of industrial action. Staff fear the changes could cost an average lecturer Â£200,000 over the course of their retirement. The umbrella group Universities UK called the ballot result disappointing. Last-ditch talks are due to be held on Tuesday and if they fail, the union says: strikes will begin on 22 February with a two-day walkout strikes could escalate to blocks of up to five days in future weeks union members will work to contract, refusing to cover classes, do voluntary work or reschedule classes lost on strike days Staff are angry at plans to change the Universities Superannuation Scheme from a defined benefit scheme, where they would have a guaranteed income in retirement - to a defined contribution scheme, where their pensions would be subject to changes in the stock market. UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: ""Universities will be hit with levels of strike action not seen before on UK campuses if a deal cannot be done over the future of USS pensions."" The union says it would be happy for talks to be extended to try to reach a deal. Staff at 68 universities are members of the scheme which last yearwas reported to have a Â£17.5bn deficit- though the UCU says this figure is too pessimistic and artificially undervalues the scheme. Of these universities, 61 voted overwhelmingly in favour of action, with 88% in favour of strikes and 93% in favour of action short of a strike, with an overall turnout of 58%. Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College London, UCL, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and York are among the universities affected. At seven institutions the turnout was below the 50% required by law for a ballot to be valid. This vote puts lecturers in conflict with fee-paying students, and their parents, anxious about the future. Students are likely to feel the impact, with not only lectures but assessment of their degree coursework potentially being affected. And the strength of the ballot sets the scene for maximum disruption. It suggests the gulf between universities and the union may be too great to bridge at the final talks on Tuesday. But this ballot is significant for another reason too: it is less than a year since the government passed a law to make strike action in public services harder by setting a minimum turnout threshold of 50% and requiring a majority for strike action. By balloting separately in each one of the 68 older universities, the UCU has managed to get over the line in 61 of them and other public sector unions will be watching with interest. A Universities UK spokeswoman said a solution to ""significant funding challenges"" facing the scheme needed to be found. ""We should be under no illusion, this is not a problem that will go away if ignored. ""Without reform now, universities will likely be forced to divert funding allocated from research and teaching to fill a pensions funding gap. ""The option of no reform is a dangerous gamble.  It is a risk that employers cannot take."" The UUK spokeswoman urged staff to consider carefully the possible impact of disruptive strike action on students. National Union of Students president Shakira Martin backed more talks. ""It is in the interests of both staff and students that we have a university sector in which staff are treated and remunerated fairly,"" she said. Staff at institutions which became universities after 1992 are members of a separate pension scheme which is unaffected by the proposed changes.

Vote looms to end US shutdown,"Nearly 700,000 employees could be sent home without pay Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are waking up in the US, unable to work because of a government shutdown. The US Senate has failed to reach a temporary budget deal to keep it open. Some employees will not be paid until the stalemate is resolved. A vote will take place at noon in Washington (17:00 GMT) on whether to re-open government. Immigration remains one of the main sticking points between Republicans and Democrats. Democrats have refused to back a temporary budget deal until their concerns on immigration reform are dealt with. Essential federal services are still running across the country, but non-essential workers are not required to report to work. This video can not be played Government workers on what happens during a shutdown At midnight on Friday, lawmakers failed to agree on a spending bill. The bill was not a plan for funding for the whole of 2018, but would have kept things running until the middle of next month. Efforts to reach a compromise ahead of the working week failed in a rare Senate session late on Sunday. A vote to end the shutdown was postponed until midday on Monday, meaning many federal government offices will not open as the shutdown enters its third day. Why the US government has shut down White House voicemail blames Democrats Under Senate rules, the bill needs 60 votes in the 100-member chamber. This video can not be played Donald Trump's shutdown voicemail There are 50 Republican senators who are present and able to vote in the upper chamber on Monday, but at least 10 Democrats are needed to pass a budget. Republican Senator John McCain is away from Washington to receive cancer treatment. Democrats want President Trump to negotiate over immigration as part of a budget deal, but Republicans say no agreement is possible while federal government services are closed. Republicans want funding for border security - including a proposed border wall with Mexico - and immigration reforms, as well as increased military spending. On Saturday, Mr Trump said the ""nuclear option"" of a simple majority vote was necessary to end the impasse. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Global US approval 'tumbles under Trump' Ways he has actually changed America What Trump has said about your country A year in the life of Trump's hotel It means no pay for those federal employees who are ""furloughed"" - on unpaid leave - even though their workplaces are not open. The last government shutdown was in 2013, and lasted for 16 days. 10 unexpected consequences of the 2013 shutdown It cost the government $2bn in lost productivity and led to ""significant negative effects on the economy"", the OMB said at the time. Free coffee for federal workers near the White House during the shutdown After the 2013 shutdown, Congress passed a bill ensuring employees who were on unpaid leave received pay cheques for the time they missed. However, receiving pay is not guaranteed this time as Congress would have to approve it again. The shutdown began on the first anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. His trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, has also been called into question. Most staff in the departments of housing, environment, education and commerce will be staying at home on Monday.,externalHalf of workers in the treasury, health, defence and transportation departments will also not be going to work. But essential services that protect ""life or human property"" will continue, including national security, postal services, air traffic control, some medical services, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity generation. And the Trump administration said it planned to keep national parks open - their closure in the 2013 shutdown provoked an angry public reaction. However, many rangers and staffers will not go into work. The Statue of Liberty was closed on Sunday but the governor of New York said he will use state funds to keep the historic landmark open from Monday. Allow Twitter content?

Democrats have demanded protection from deportation of more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children. ""I hope it is just a matter of hours or days.

"I'll drain the swamp in UKIP, says Bolton","This video can not be played Henry Bolton says he will not be quitting as UKIP leader, adding: ""It is time to drain the swamp"". Henry Bolton has insisted he will not quit as UKIP leader, saying it is ""time to drain the swamp"" of malcontents within the party. He said UKIP's national executive committee, which passed a vote of no confidence in him, was ""not fit for purpose"" and must be reformed. Speaking in Folkestone, he urged UKIP to put an end to factional infighting. It came after 14 senior figures quit their roles, including Mr Bolton's deputy and assistant deputy. Who is Henry Bolton? Hamilton: Bolton should go UKIP leader splits with partner after texts Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Bolton had been ""pretty stupid"" in the way he had handled the media over claims about his private life. But he said he was ""very pleased"" that the leader was pushing for changes to the party's constitution and the national executive committee, which he said were long overdue. ""If UKIP doesn't change it will not exist in 18 months time,"" he said on his LBC radio show. He said he will ""wait to see"" Henry Bolton's proposals to reform UKIP, before deciding whether to back him staying on as leader. In an interview with Mr Farage, Mr Bolton hit out at those who had quit, saying: ""If they had any interest in the party they would be continuing their jobs - their resignations achieve nothing in that respect."" Asked how he was coping with the media attention, Mr Bolton said: ""In some ways I am enjoying navigating through all this."" UKIP's local government, education, trade and immigration spokesmen have all resigned as Mr Bolton defied growing calls to quit over offensive texts sent by his ex-girlfriend. Nigel Farage has called for reform of the NEC in the past Ex-education spokesman David Kurten said he believed Mr Bolton had ""no chance of surviving"" a vote of party members, saying he did not know what the leader ""hoped to achieve"" by staying on. In a statement to the media, Mr Bolton said he ""respected"" the party's constitutional process, which will see party members decide his future in the coming weeks. But he said the decision to force a vote was a ""distraction"" from what should be the party's focus on May's local elections and achieving ""true independence"" for the UK after Brexit. ""I repeat I shall not be resigning as party leader."" He said he had lost confidence in the NEC, which he said was unable to take the party forward and whose shortcomings he suggested had been recognised by previous leaders. ""The NEC requires significant and urgent reform. To that end, again during the coming weeks, I shall be proposing a new party constitution, with a newly constituted and reformed NEC. ""Likewise, it is now time to put an end to the factional in-fighting within the party and to remove those who have been a part of that. In a single phrase, it is time to 'Drain the Swamp'."" Mr Bolton, who has been under pressure over some of his former girlfriend's comments, has said another leadership contest could be financially ruinous for the party, which has staged three contests in the last 18 months. He has also said he has ended the ""romantic element"" of his relationship with Jo Marney after it emerged that in the past she had sent a text saying Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle would ""taint"" the Royal Family, leading to accusations of racism. Nigel Farage was succeeded as UKIP leader by Diane James - he then took over as interim leader when she quit Nigel Farage: UKIP's long-serving leader announced his resignation on 4 July 2016, saying his ""political ambition has been achieved"" by the Brexit vote Diane James: Lasted less than three weeks after being elected in September 2016 Nigel Farage: Returned as interim leader in October 2016 Paul Nuttall: Elected on 28 November 2016, but quit the following June after UKIP's general election collapse Henry Bolton: Elected on 29 September. Is facing resignations and a vote of no confidence But Mr Bolton has so far failed to convince many of the senior figures in the party - with the NEC's vote of no confidence in him on Sunday followed by a series of resignations on Monday. In his resignation letter as trade spokesman William Dartmouth, a South West England MEP, told Mr Bolton his position was ""untenable"". ""When you became leader you said that you would make the party successful,"" he said. ""If you still feel that way then you should resign forthwith."" Deputy leader Margot Parker, who is an East Midlands MEP, said Mr Bolton's ""personal life took over the job he was elected to do"". Mr Bolton said he split with his girlfriend Jo Marney after the 25-year-old's texts about Meghan Markle came to light She added: ""It would be quicker and cleaner if he came to the conclusion he could go sooner rather than later. ""This is taking time away from doing the job. This puts the party in a limbo situation."" She told Mr Farage, on his LBC programme ""It's a pretty wacky situation we find ourselves in"" and his questioning of his colleagues' loyalty was ""outrageous"". NEC member Paul Oakley told Mr Farage the party had already lost patience with Mr Bolton before the stories about his private life, adding: ""His handling of the media was absolutely atrocious"". Following the vote of no confidence party members who turn up to the EGM will given a vote on whether Mr Bolton should remain in post. UKIP, which has long campaigned to leave the EU, came top in the 2014 European elections and got the third largest vote share in the 2015 general election with 12.6% - but this plummeted to 1.8% in June - the first general election since the UK voted for Brexit.

Pope sorry for upsetting abuse victims,"The Pope made the apology while flying back to Rome after his visit to Chile and Peru Pope Francis has apologised for remarks he made last week in Chile defending a bishop accused of covering up sexual abuse. He said he realised his words hurt many, but repeated his belief that Chilean Bishop Juan Barros was innocent. The pontiff was speaking to journalists on board a plane flying back to Rome. Last week, he had said that victims who had accused Bishop Barros were committing slander. The Pope was openly criticised by Cardinal Sean O'Malley of Boston, who said he left victims of sexual abuse committed by priests feeling abandoned. ""I apologise to them if I hurt them without realising it, but it was a wound that I inflicted without meaning to,"" said the Pope on Monday, as quoted by Reuters news agency. ""It pains me very much."" Profile: Pope Francis Pope meets sex abuse victims in Chile The Pope marries couple on Chile flight Bishop Barros has not been accused of abuse, but of being present when another priest, Fernando Karadima, molested young boys. When questioned by a Chilean journalist on Thursday, the Argentine pontiff had said: ""The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, then I will speak. There is not a single piece of proof against him. Everything is slander. Is this clear?"" This prompted some of Karadima's victims to hold a press conference where they said it was ""offensive and unacceptable to say that we need to provide concrete evidence"". On Monday, the Pope said he regretted using the word ""proof"", saying he realised that it came off as a slap in the face. ""There are lots of abused people who cannot show proof. They don't have it. Or they have it but they keep it to themselves, suffering in silence,"" he said. By Jane Chambers, BBC News in Santiago Protesters in Chile are not impressed with the Pope's apology. They say it is unfair that he is choosing to believe the bishop over victims. Juan Carlos Claret is the spokesperson for the parishioners of Osorno, who have repeatedly asked for the bishop's resignation. Reacting to the Pope's recent comments, he said: ""The Pope is now saying that he refused the bishop's resignation twice because he thinks that [it] will show that he is guilty. That makes the Pope responsible for the misery that we are suffering."" He added: ""[The Pope] asks for evidence, but the victims have testified - isn't that enough for him? He apologises to us but now we need to see action. Sorry isn't good enough. Barros must resign."" Across the country, a cartoon - by Chilean satirist Guillo - is now circulating through social media. It shows the Pope saying, ""To believe in us you have to have faith. But if you want us to believe in you - you must bring me evidence"". In 2010, Father Karadima was publicly accused of molesting several teenaged boys in the capital, Santiago, starting in the 1980s. After the Vatican found him guilty, he was sentenced to a lifetime of ""penance and prayer"". He never faced criminal prosecution in Chile as too much time had passed, but the judge who heard victims' testimony in a year-long investigation described them as ""truthful and reliable"". The Pope has been criticised for appointing Bishop Barros as bishop of Osorno, in south-central Chile, in 2015. The ceremony at which he was installed as bishop of Osorno had to be cut short over protests in the cathedral. The Pope was greeted with protestsin Santiago, with demonstrators insisting the bishop should not hold his role. Francis also met victims of sexual abuse by priests in the country. He cried with them and said he felt ""pain and shame"" over the scandal.

Bolton: I will not quit as UKIP leader,"This video can not be played Henry Bolton says he will not be quitting as UKIP leader, adding: ""It is time to drain the swamp"". Henry Bolton has insisted he will not quit as UKIP leader, saying it is ""time to drain the swamp"" of malcontents within the party. He said UKIP's national executive committee, which passed a vote of no confidence in him, was ""not fit for purpose"" and must be reformed. Speaking in Folkestone, he urged UKIP to put an end to factional infighting. It came after 14 senior figures quit their roles, including Mr Bolton's deputy and assistant deputy. Who is Henry Bolton? Hamilton: Bolton should go UKIP leader splits with partner after texts Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Bolton had been ""pretty stupid"" in the way he had handled the media over claims about his private life. But he said he was ""very pleased"" that the leader was pushing for changes to the party's constitution and the national executive committee, which he said were long overdue. ""If UKIP doesn't change it will not exist in 18 months time,"" he said on his LBC radio show. He said he will ""wait to see"" Henry Bolton's proposals to reform UKIP, before deciding whether to back him staying on as leader. In an interview with Mr Farage, Mr Bolton hit out at those who had quit, saying: ""If they had any interest in the party they would be continuing their jobs - their resignations achieve nothing in that respect."" Asked how he was coping with the media attention, Mr Bolton said: ""In some ways I am enjoying navigating through all this."" UKIP's local government, education, trade and immigration spokesmen have all resigned as Mr Bolton defied growing calls to quit over offensive texts sent by his ex-girlfriend. Nigel Farage has called for reform of the NEC in the past Ex-education spokesman David Kurten said he believed Mr Bolton had ""no chance of surviving"" a vote of party members, saying he did not know what the leader ""hoped to achieve"" by staying on. In a statement to the media, Mr Bolton said he ""respected"" the party's constitutional process, which will see party members decide his future in the coming weeks. But he said the decision to force a vote was a ""distraction"" from what should be the party's focus on May's local elections and achieving ""true independence"" for the UK after Brexit. ""I repeat I shall not be resigning as party leader."" He said he had lost confidence in the NEC, which he said was unable to take the party forward and whose shortcomings he suggested had been recognised by previous leaders. ""The NEC requires significant and urgent reform. To that end, again during the coming weeks, I shall be proposing a new party constitution, with a newly constituted and reformed NEC. ""Likewise, it is now time to put an end to the factional in-fighting within the party and to remove those who have been a part of that. In a single phrase, it is time to 'Drain the Swamp'."" Mr Bolton, who has been under pressure over some of his former girlfriend's comments, has said another leadership contest could be financially ruinous for the party, which has staged three contests in the last 18 months. He has also said he has ended the ""romantic element"" of his relationship with Jo Marney after it emerged that in the past she had sent a text saying Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle would ""taint"" the Royal Family, leading to accusations of racism. Nigel Farage was succeeded as UKIP leader by Diane James - he then took over as interim leader when she quit Nigel Farage: UKIP's long-serving leader announced his resignation on 4 July 2016, saying his ""political ambition has been achieved"" by the Brexit vote Diane James: Lasted less than three weeks after being elected in September 2016 Nigel Farage: Returned as interim leader in October 2016 Paul Nuttall: Elected on 28 November 2016, but quit the following June after UKIP's general election collapse Henry Bolton: Elected on 29 September. Is facing resignations and a vote of no confidence But Mr Bolton has so far failed to convince many of the senior figures in the party - with the NEC's vote of no confidence in him on Sunday followed by a series of resignations on Monday. In his resignation letter as trade spokesman William Dartmouth, a South West England MEP, told Mr Bolton his position was ""untenable"". ""When you became leader you said that you would make the party successful,"" he said. ""If you still feel that way then you should resign forthwith."" Deputy leader Margot Parker, who is an East Midlands MEP, said Mr Bolton's ""personal life took over the job he was elected to do"". Mr Bolton said he split with his girlfriend Jo Marney after the 25-year-old's texts about Meghan Markle came to light She added: ""It would be quicker and cleaner if he came to the conclusion he could go sooner rather than later. ""This is taking time away from doing the job. This puts the party in a limbo situation."" She told Mr Farage, on his LBC programme ""It's a pretty wacky situation we find ourselves in"" and his questioning of his colleagues' loyalty was ""outrageous"". NEC member Paul Oakley told Mr Farage the party had already lost patience with Mr Bolton before the stories about his private life, adding: ""His handling of the media was absolutely atrocious"". Following the vote of no confidence party members who turn up to the EGM will given a vote on whether Mr Bolton should remain in post. UKIP, which has long campaigned to leave the EU, came top in the 2014 European elections and got the third largest vote share in the 2015 general election with 12.6% - but this plummeted to 1.8% in June - the first general election since the UK voted for Brexit.

"Tourists gulp at huge Venice steak billThe city's mayor promises justice for four Japanese tourists charged â¬1,100 for a meal.5h5 hours agoEurope","From mouth-watering steak to eye-watering bill in Venice The mayor of Venice has voiced outrage over the â¬1,100 (Â£970; $1,347) bill that four Japanese tourists say they had to pay for four steaks, a plate of fried fish, water and service. The four students complained to police after getting the eye-watering bill at a restaurant near St Mark's Square. Three women with them chose another restaurant - but even they ended up paying â¬350 for three plates of seafood pasta, Italian media report. The mayor has vowed to get justice. ""We will thoroughly examine this episode, we'll check to see if the complaint was made properly,"" Mayor Luigi Brugnaro tweeted.,external ""If this disgraceful episode is confirmed, we'll do all we can to punish those responsible. We are for justice - always!"" The four Japanese men complained to police on returning to Bologna, where they are students. Their case has been taken up by Marco Gasparinetti, spokesman for a Venice residents' forum called ""Gruppo 25 Aprile"". Spectacular St Mark's Square is a highlight of any Venice tour Italian media did not name the restaurant, but said it was owned by a Chinese woman and run by an Egyptian.

He said Gruppo 25 Aprile would post advice for tourists this week on Facebook to help them avoid such a ""mockery"".

Ecuador leader says Assange a problem,"President Moreno and Foreign Minister MarÃ­a Fernanda Espinosa would like to see Mr Assange leave the embassy Ecuador's President LenÃ­n Moreno has described Wikileaks founder Julian Assange as an ""inherited problem"" in a television interview. Mr Assange has been living inside the Ecuadorean embassy in London since June 2012, when he claimed political asylum. He had been wanted on assault claims in Sweden, which have been dropped, but says he fears extradition to the US. The UK recently refused to recognise Mr Assange as a diplomatic agent, which would have provided him with immunity. President Moreno said Mr Assange had created ""more than a nuisance"" for his government. He has in the past warned the Wikileaks founder not to interfere in Ecuadorean politics or ""that of nations that are our friends"". His warning followed Mr Assange's public support for the independence campaign in Catalonia. Mr Assange has also had at least one meeting with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, althoughMr Farage has dismissed reports that his contact with Mr Assange was more frequent. The Wikileaks founder was also reprimanded for interfering in the 2016 US election after publishing hacked emails from the campaign team of Hillary Clinton. Mr Assange was granted asylum by President Moreno's predecessor in office, Rafael Correa. Is Assange interfering in US election? Timeline of the Julian Assange case 18 revelations from Wikileaks' hacked Clinton emails Mr Moreno's government has said that it will maintain Mr Assange's asylum. But it has also sought ways for him to leave the embassy without risking arrest for breaching his bail conditions and possible extradition to the US over the 2010 publication of classified information by Wikileaks. In April,US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that arresting Mr Assange was a ""priority"". While he has not been charged with any offence so far, Mr Assange fears that the US authorities have prepared a sealed indictment ordering his arrest. In December,Mr Assange was granted Ecuadorean citizenship. Mr Assange posted a picture of himself wearing an Ecuadorean football shirt after he was granted citizenship Earlier this month, Ecuadorean Foreign Minister MarÃ­a Fernanda Espinosa asked the UK to recognise Mr Assange as a diplomatic agent with a view to him being provided with diplomatic immunity. However, that move was rejected by the UK authorities who said that Mr Assange should leave the embassy and ""face justice"". Speaking on Sunday, President Moreno said he was disappointed by the British government's response. ""This would have been a good result, unfortunately, things did not turn out as the foreign ministry planned and so the problem still exists."" The president said Ecuador would seek help from ""important people"" to solve the problem.

Universities face strikes over pensions,"If talks fail, some universities could face strike action next month Top universities face 14 days of strike action, starting next month, if a row over planned changes to staff pensions is not resolved. Overall, 61 universities could be affected after members of the University and College Union voted in favour of industrial action. Staff fear the changes could cost an average lecturer Â£200,000 over the course of their retirement. The umbrella group Universities UK called the ballot result disappointing. Last-ditch talks are due to be held on Tuesday and if they fail, the union says: strikes will begin on 22 February with a two-day walkout strikes could escalate to blocks of up to five days in future weeks union members will work to contract, refusing to cover classes, do voluntary work or reschedule classes lost on strike days Staff are angry at plans to change the Universities Superannuation Scheme from a defined benefit scheme, where they would have a guaranteed income in retirement - to a defined contribution scheme, where their pensions would be subject to changes in the stock market. UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: ""Universities will be hit with levels of strike action not seen before on UK campuses if a deal cannot be done over the future of USS pensions."" The union says it would be happy for talks to be extended to try to reach a deal. Staff at 68 universities are members of the scheme which last yearwas reported to have a Â£17.5bn deficit- though the UCU says this figure is too pessimistic and artificially undervalues the scheme. Of these universities, 61 voted overwhelmingly in favour of action, with 88% in favour of strikes and 93% in favour of action short of a strike, with an overall turnout of 58%. Oxford, Cambridge, Imperial College London, UCL, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Manchester and York are among the universities affected. At seven institutions the turnout was below the 50% required by law for a ballot to be valid. This vote puts lecturers in conflict with fee-paying students, and their parents, anxious about the future. Students are likely to feel the impact, with not only lectures but assessment of their degree coursework potentially being affected. And the strength of the ballot sets the scene for maximum disruption. It suggests the gulf between universities and the union may be too great to bridge at the final talks on Tuesday. But this ballot is significant for another reason too: it is less than a year since the government passed a law to make strike action in public services harder by setting a minimum turnout threshold of 50% and requiring a majority for strike action. By balloting separately in each one of the 68 older universities, the UCU has managed to get over the line in 61 of them and other public sector unions will be watching with interest. A Universities UK spokeswoman said a solution to ""significant funding challenges"" facing the scheme needed to be found. ""We should be under no illusion, this is not a problem that will go away if ignored. ""Without reform now, universities will likely be forced to divert funding allocated from research and teaching to fill a pensions funding gap. ""The option of no reform is a dangerous gamble.  It is a risk that employers cannot take."" The UUK spokeswoman urged staff to consider carefully the possible impact of disruptive strike action on students. National Union of Students president Shakira Martin backed more talks. ""It is in the interests of both staff and students that we have a university sector in which staff are treated and remunerated fairly,"" she said. Staff at institutions which became universities after 1992 are members of a separate pension scheme which is unaffected by the proposed changes.

Two men guilty of executive's murder,"Guy Hedger was at home with his husband when he was killed Two men have been jailed for murdering an executive in a botched burglary at his luxury home. Guy Hedger, 61, was shot dead in the raid at Ashley, Dorset, in the early hours of 30 April 2017. Jason Baccus, from Bournemouth, and Kevin Downton, from Winterborne Stickland, were convicted unanimously after a two-month trial at Winchester Crown Court. The pair have been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 34 years. Police said a breakthrough in the case came from DNA found on cigarette butts near the murder scene. Baccus, 42, and Downton, 40, were also found guilty of aggravated burglary, possessing a firearm and one count of burglary. They previously pleaded guilty to another count of burglary. During sentencing, judge Mr Justice Jay described the burglary as ""amateurish and incompetent"". Jason Baccus (left) and Kevin Downton have been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 34 years In a victim impact statement, Mr Hedger's husband Simon-Pierre Hedger-Cooper, known as Si, said the final moments of Guy's life were ""full of terror, fear and pain"". He said the shooting had ""radically changed my life forever - an experience from which I will never recover"". ""My life feels empty and full of sadness and darkness,"" he said. ""Deep and searing pain of never being able to properly say goodbye."" A gun was among items recovered from the River Stour during the police investigation Scott Keeping, 44, from Bournemouth, was found not guilty of murder as well as the other above charges. His wife Helen Keeping, 40, also known as Helen Cooper, was found not guilty of two counts of assisting an offender. The trial heard how Mr Hedger and his husband were confronted in their bedroom by two men wearing balaclavas and armed with a sawn-off shotgun. Mr Hedger was shot when his husband hit a panic button, triggering alarms. Guy Hedger's house is in a cul-de-sac in Ashley, Dorset Police admitted for the first 24 hours after the shooting they had no idea who may have been involved. It was what they called a ""cold start"". But the major breakthrough came when they found discarded cigarette butts around the corner from Guy Hedger's home. They contained the DNA of Jason Baccus. Police were then able to identify his known associates and track their movements at the time of the shooting. This led them to Kevin Downton, and Scott and Helen Keeping. Without the discovery of this crucial forensic link officers said it may have taken them much longer to identify those responsible. In a video shown to the court, Mr Hedger-Cooper said: ""I heard an almighty boom, shot, and Guy said 'I have been hit, I have been hit'."" Mr Hedger, the brand and marketing director of insurance firm Liverpool Victoria, died two hours later in hospital from a gunshot wound to the chest. Diamond jewellery and watches were among items worth more than Â£120,000 which were stolen in the burglary, near Ringwood. The court heard the intruders also removed an iPhone and landline in a ""callous"" attempt to stop Mr Hedger-Cooper calling the emergency services. Watches stolen from Guy Hedger's home were among items found in undergrowth next to a public footpath in Bournemouth Baccus told the court he had committed domestic and commercial burglaries in the past to fund his drink and drug habits. In evidence, he also said he had ""spent most of my adult life in prison,"" having started shoplifting at the age of five. In recent periods out of prison he would stay with Mr and Mrs Keeping at their home in Bournemouth, the court heard. Police said some of the stolen valuables were found hidden in a chimney breast of their flat. Downton, who worked as a carpenter, claimed he had been shopping for a birthday present for his daughter at Toys R Us in Poole on the evening of the murder. He said he visited ""two or three friends"" on the way home but declined to name them. He met fellow inmate Baccus in prison more than a decade ago and would buy cocaine from him, the court heard. Downton told the court the pair committed commercial burglaries together but denied having ever burgled a home. Jewellery stolen during the burglary was found in undergrowth at the side of a public footpath in Bournemouth Sentencing the pair, the judge said: ""Guy Hedger died in his bedroom when he was shot by you, Kevin Downton. You were an enthusiastic participant. ""You removed two phones from the bedside table. You have a cold ruthless streak and have shown no remorse."" He described Baccus as a ""career criminal"" who ""recruited"" Downton as the gunman, and who had also shown no remorse.

Two men guilty of Guy Hedger murder,"Guy Hedger was at home with his husband when he was killed Two men have been jailed for murdering an executive in a botched burglary at his luxury home. Guy Hedger, 61, was shot dead in the raid at Ashley, Dorset, in the early hours of 30 April 2017. Jason Baccus, from Bournemouth, and Kevin Downton, from Winterborne Stickland, were convicted unanimously after a two-month trial at Winchester Crown Court. The pair have been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 34 years. Police said a breakthrough in the case came from DNA found on cigarette butts near the murder scene. Baccus, 42, and Downton, 40, were also found guilty of aggravated burglary, possessing a firearm and one count of burglary. They previously pleaded guilty to another count of burglary. During sentencing, judge Mr Justice Jay described the burglary as ""amateurish and incompetent"". Jason Baccus (left) and Kevin Downton have been sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 34 years In a victim impact statement, Mr Hedger's husband Simon-Pierre Hedger-Cooper, known as Si, said the final moments of Guy's life were ""full of terror, fear and pain"". He said the shooting had ""radically changed my life forever - an experience from which I will never recover"". ""My life feels empty and full of sadness and darkness,"" he said. ""Deep and searing pain of never being able to properly say goodbye."" A gun was among items recovered from the River Stour during the police investigation Scott Keeping, 44, from Bournemouth, was found not guilty of murder as well as the other above charges. His wife Helen Keeping, 40, also known as Helen Cooper, was found not guilty of two counts of assisting an offender. The trial heard how Mr Hedger and his husband were confronted in their bedroom by two men wearing balaclavas and armed with a sawn-off shotgun. Mr Hedger was shot when his husband hit a panic button, triggering alarms. Guy Hedger's house is in a cul-de-sac in Ashley, Dorset Police admitted for the first 24 hours after the shooting they had no idea who may have been involved. It was what they called a ""cold start"". But the major breakthrough came when they found discarded cigarette butts around the corner from Guy Hedger's home. They contained the DNA of Jason Baccus. Police were then able to identify his known associates and track their movements at the time of the shooting. This led them to Kevin Downton, and Scott and Helen Keeping. Without the discovery of this crucial forensic link officers said it may have taken them much longer to identify those responsible. In a video shown to the court, Mr Hedger-Cooper said: ""I heard an almighty boom, shot, and Guy said 'I have been hit, I have been hit'."" Mr Hedger, the brand and marketing director of insurance firm Liverpool Victoria, died two hours later in hospital from a gunshot wound to the chest. Diamond jewellery and watches were among items worth more than Â£120,000 which were stolen in the burglary, near Ringwood. The court heard the intruders also removed an iPhone and landline in a ""callous"" attempt to stop Mr Hedger-Cooper calling the emergency services. Watches stolen from Guy Hedger's home were among items found in undergrowth next to a public footpath in Bournemouth Baccus told the court he had committed domestic and commercial burglaries in the past to fund his drink and drug habits. In evidence, he also said he had ""spent most of my adult life in prison,"" having started shoplifting at the age of five. In recent periods out of prison he would stay with Mr and Mrs Keeping at their home in Bournemouth, the court heard. Police said some of the stolen valuables were found hidden in a chimney breast of their flat. Downton, who worked as a carpenter, claimed he had been shopping for a birthday present for his daughter at Toys R Us in Poole on the evening of the murder. He said he visited ""two or three friends"" on the way home but declined to name them. He met fellow inmate Baccus in prison more than a decade ago and would buy cocaine from him, the court heard. Downton told the court the pair committed commercial burglaries together but denied having ever burgled a home. Jewellery stolen during the burglary was found in undergrowth at the side of a public footpath in Bournemouth Sentencing the pair, the judge said: ""Guy Hedger died in his bedroom when he was shot by you, Kevin Downton. You were an enthusiastic participant. ""You removed two phones from the bedside table. You have a cold ruthless streak and have shown no remorse."" He described Baccus as a ""career criminal"" who ""recruited"" Downton as the gunman, and who had also shown no remorse.

UKIP leader hit by multiple resignations,"This video can not be played Henry Bolton says he will not be quitting as UKIP leader, adding: ""It is time to drain the swamp"". Henry Bolton has insisted he will not quit as UKIP leader, saying it is ""time to drain the swamp"" of malcontents within the party. He said UKIP's national executive committee, which passed a vote of no confidence in him, was ""not fit for purpose"" and must be reformed. Speaking in Folkestone, he urged UKIP to put an end to factional infighting. It came after 14 senior figures quit their roles, including Mr Bolton's deputy and assistant deputy. Who is Henry Bolton? Hamilton: Bolton should go UKIP leader splits with partner after texts Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Bolton had been ""pretty stupid"" in the way he had handled the media over claims about his private life. But he said he was ""very pleased"" that the leader was pushing for changes to the party's constitution and the national executive committee, which he said were long overdue. ""If UKIP doesn't change it will not exist in 18 months time,"" he said on his LBC radio show. He said he will ""wait to see"" Henry Bolton's proposals to reform UKIP, before deciding whether to back him staying on as leader. In an interview with Mr Farage, Mr Bolton hit out at those who had quit, saying: ""If they had any interest in the party they would be continuing their jobs - their resignations achieve nothing in that respect."" Asked how he was coping with the media attention, Mr Bolton said: ""In some ways I am enjoying navigating through all this."" UKIP's local government, education, trade and immigration spokesmen have all resigned as Mr Bolton defied growing calls to quit over offensive texts sent by his ex-girlfriend. Nigel Farage has called for reform of the NEC in the past Ex-education spokesman David Kurten said he believed Mr Bolton had ""no chance of surviving"" a vote of party members, saying he did not know what the leader ""hoped to achieve"" by staying on. In a statement to the media, Mr Bolton said he ""respected"" the party's constitutional process, which will see party members decide his future in the coming weeks. But he said the decision to force a vote was a ""distraction"" from what should be the party's focus on May's local elections and achieving ""true independence"" for the UK after Brexit. ""I repeat I shall not be resigning as party leader."" He said he had lost confidence in the NEC, which he said was unable to take the party forward and whose shortcomings he suggested had been recognised by previous leaders. ""The NEC requires significant and urgent reform. To that end, again during the coming weeks, I shall be proposing a new party constitution, with a newly constituted and reformed NEC. ""Likewise, it is now time to put an end to the factional in-fighting within the party and to remove those who have been a part of that. In a single phrase, it is time to 'Drain the Swamp'."" Mr Bolton, who has been under pressure over some of his former girlfriend's comments, has said another leadership contest could be financially ruinous for the party, which has staged three contests in the last 18 months. He has also said he has ended the ""romantic element"" of his relationship with Jo Marney after it emerged that in the past she had sent a text saying Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle would ""taint"" the Royal Family, leading to accusations of racism. Nigel Farage was succeeded as UKIP leader by Diane James - he then took over as interim leader when she quit Nigel Farage: UKIP's long-serving leader announced his resignation on 4 July 2016, saying his ""political ambition has been achieved"" by the Brexit vote Diane James: Lasted less than three weeks after being elected in September 2016 Nigel Farage: Returned as interim leader in October 2016 Paul Nuttall: Elected on 28 November 2016, but quit the following June after UKIP's general election collapse Henry Bolton: Elected on 29 September. Is facing resignations and a vote of no confidence But Mr Bolton has so far failed to convince many of the senior figures in the party - with the NEC's vote of no confidence in him on Sunday followed by a series of resignations on Monday. In his resignation letter as trade spokesman William Dartmouth, a South West England MEP, told Mr Bolton his position was ""untenable"". ""When you became leader you said that you would make the party successful,"" he said. ""If you still feel that way then you should resign forthwith."" Deputy leader Margot Parker, who is an East Midlands MEP, said Mr Bolton's ""personal life took over the job he was elected to do"". Mr Bolton said he split with his girlfriend Jo Marney after the 25-year-old's texts about Meghan Markle came to light She added: ""It would be quicker and cleaner if he came to the conclusion he could go sooner rather than later. ""This is taking time away from doing the job. This puts the party in a limbo situation."" She told Mr Farage, on his LBC programme ""It's a pretty wacky situation we find ourselves in"" and his questioning of his colleagues' loyalty was ""outrageous"". NEC member Paul Oakley told Mr Farage the party had already lost patience with Mr Bolton before the stories about his private life, adding: ""His handling of the media was absolutely atrocious"". Following the vote of no confidence party members who turn up to the EGM will given a vote on whether Mr Bolton should remain in post. UKIP, which has long campaigned to leave the EU, came top in the 2014 European elections and got the third largest vote share in the 2015 general election with 12.6% - but this plummeted to 1.8% in June - the first general election since the UK voted for Brexit.

Red Arrows ejector seat death firm guilty,"Flt Lt Sean Cunningham died after being ejected from his aircraft in 2011 An ejection seat firm has admitted breaching health and safety laws over the death of a Red Arrows pilot. Flt Lt Sean Cunningham, 35, was ejected unexpectedly from his jet while it was on the ground at RAF Scampton in 2011. But the parachute on the seat did not then deploy and the South African-born airman was fatally injured. Martin-Baker Aircraft Ltd pleaded guilty at Lincoln Crown Court to breaching Section 3(1) of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. Company director John Martin entered the plea on behalf of the company, based near Uxbridge. The firm is due to be sentenced on 12 February. More stories from across Lincolnshire The ejection seat on Flt Lt Cunningham's Hawk T1 fired while he was carrying out pre-flight checks An inquest into Flt Lt Cunningham's death heard he was fired 300ft up into the air on 8 November before he hit the ground with ""tremendous"" force. The Iraq war veteran, who grew up in Coventry, had been carrying out pre-flight safety checks in his Hawk T1 jet when the seat fired. It emerged during the hearing in 2014 that the ejection seat firing handle had been left in an unsafe position meaning it could accidentally activate the seat. It is thought one of Flt Lt Cunningham's seat straps had pulled it into this unsafe position on a sortie four days earlier. Flt Lt Cunningham's parachute failed to deploy because a nut and bolt had been fastened too tightly. Martin-Baker had been aware of the possibility of the parachute mechanism jamming as early as 1990, the inquest was told. Coroner Stuart Fisher described the seats' safety mechanism as ""entirely useless"" andcriticised the company for failing to warn the RAF about safety issues. The Crown Prosecution Service considered possible manslaughter charges but said there was insufficient evidence. However, theHealth and Safety Executive announced in September 2016 it intended to prosecuteMartin-Baker Aircraft. In a statement issued by the firm after entering the guilty plea, it said: ""It should be noted that this was an isolated failure relating to the tightening of a nut during maintenance procedures conducted by RAF Aerobatic Team mechanics."" It added its ejection seats were in use by 92 air forces and had saved 7,059 lives over the past 73 years. 8 November 2011:Flt Lt Sean Cunningham died after being ejected from a Hawk T1 jet while on the ground at the Red Arrows base at RAF Scampton 9 November 2011:The day after his death, the MOD suspended training flights of aircraft fitted with the MK10 ejection seats including Hawk T1, Tornado and Tucano 22 November 2011:An inquest, which opened and adjourned in Lincoln, heard the Red Arrows pilot died from multiple injuries after being ejected from an aircraft.

Shutdown hits US as working week starts,"Nearly 700,000 employees could be sent home without pay Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are waking up in the US, unable to work because of a government shutdown. The US Senate has failed to reach a temporary budget deal to keep it open. Some employees will not be paid until the stalemate is resolved. A vote will take place at noon in Washington (17:00 GMT) on whether to re-open government. Immigration remains one of the main sticking points between Republicans and Democrats. Democrats have refused to back a temporary budget deal until their concerns on immigration reform are dealt with. Essential federal services are still running across the country, but non-essential workers are not required to report to work. This video can not be played Government workers on what happens during a shutdown At midnight on Friday, lawmakers failed to agree on a spending bill. The bill was not a plan for funding for the whole of 2018, but would have kept things running until the middle of next month. Efforts to reach a compromise ahead of the working week failed in a rare Senate session late on Sunday. A vote to end the shutdown was postponed until midday on Monday, meaning many federal government offices will not open as the shutdown enters its third day. Why the US government has shut down White House voicemail blames Democrats Under Senate rules, the bill needs 60 votes in the 100-member chamber. This video can not be played Donald Trump's shutdown voicemail There are 50 Republican senators who are present and able to vote in the upper chamber on Monday, but at least 10 Democrats are needed to pass a budget. Republican Senator John McCain is away from Washington to receive cancer treatment. Democrats want President Trump to negotiate over immigration as part of a budget deal, but Republicans say no agreement is possible while federal government services are closed. Republicans want funding for border security - including a proposed border wall with Mexico - and immigration reforms, as well as increased military spending. On Saturday, Mr Trump said the ""nuclear option"" of a simple majority vote was necessary to end the impasse. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Free coffee for federal workers near the White House during the shutdown After the 2013 shutdown, Congress passed a bill ensuring employees who were on unpaid leave received pay cheques for the time they missed. However, receiving pay is not guaranteed this time as Congress would have to approve it again. The shutdown began on the first anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. His trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, has also been called into question. Most staff in the departments of housing, environment, education and commerce will be staying at home on Monday.,externalHalf of workers in the treasury, health, defence and transportation departments will also not be going to work. But essential services that protect ""life or human property"" will continue, including national security, postal services, air traffic control, some medical services, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity generation. And the Trump administration said it planned to keep national parks open - their closure in the 2013 shutdown provoked an angry public reaction. However, many rangers and staffers will not go into work. The Statue of Liberty was closed on Sunday but the governor of New York said he will use state funds to keep the historic landmark open from Monday. Allow Twitter content?

Warning of Tory revolt over cuts,"Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson has been warned of a ""substantial"" revolt by Tory MPs in the event of more cuts to army numbers and naval capability. Ex-minister James Gray urged ministers not to use a security review next year as ""camouflage"" for a cut in manpower. Some Tory MPs have spoken out to warn the UK is at a defence crossroads. In his first Commons outing since he took the job, Mr Williamson said he was ""in awe"" of British troops and would do everything he could to support them. But Labour said Mr Williamson - who was a surprise choice to succeed Michael Fallon when he resigned last month - had shown little sign of trying to twist the chancellor's arm in the run-up to last week's Budget. Number of soldiers in British Army falls Williamson succeeds Fallon at defence A mini defence and security review launched after June's election - intended as an update to 2015's strategic security and defence review in light of emerging threats - is expected to be published early next year. Ahead of Monday's defence questions in the Commons, 25 Tory MPs signed a letter to Mr Williamson warning about the potential loss of amphibious assault ships HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark, saying it would ""dangerously limit the array of options"" available to the forces. It follows unconfirmed reports that full-time army numbers could fall from their current level of about 78,000 to 70,000 - well below the government's target of 82,000. Former Defence Minister Sir Nicholas Soames said the party had a ""duty"" to unite against further cuts to defence capability, while former soldier turned MP Johnny Mercer said a ""campaign"" was under way to ""get defence back to where it should be"" and the public did not want to UK's army to be ""the size of Belgium's"".

Mr Gray told the defence secretary that, as a former chief whip, he was well placed to ""fight the corner"" of defence in cabinet and urge chancellor Philip Hammond to ""dig deep"" to find the money needed. ""Will he speak to the prime minister and remind her that her primary duty is the defence of the realm? ""Will he speak to the national security adviser and the secretary of state for the cabinet office to remind them they must not use this review as some kind of camouflage to cut our services? ""Above all, will he speak to the chief whip to remind him if he does not do so, he is going to be facing a very substantial rebellion?"" In response, Mr Williamson said he regarded the UK's commitment to spend 2% of its income on defence ""as a base, not a ceiling"" and would lobby his ministerial colleagues on the MPs' behalf. ""When you see our armed forces and everything they do, and the commitment with which they give themselves to it, you cannot be anything other than awed by it. I will do everything I can to deliver for them."" Promising to reach his own judgement on the defence review, he said calls for Trident renewal funding to be taken out of the Ministry of Defence budget would be considered. He added: ""There has been a tendency since the 1990s to think the world is a much safer place than it actually is. The world is rapidly changing"". The defence secretary faced calls from Tory and Labour MPs to publish a specific defence industrial strategy following a consultation exercise earlier this year. Shadow defence secretary Nia Griffith said Conservative MPs were in ""open rebellion"" over defence spending. ""You cannot do security on the cheap,"" she said. ""We are hearing the marines may be cut by 15% and the Army reduced to 70,000, something which would seriously put our international credibility at risk. ""Just how bad do things have to get before the secretary of state does his job, stands up for defence and tells the prime minister and chancellor that enough is enough?"" Mr Williamson said it was a ""bit rich"" to be lectured by Labour on the issue of defence spending.

Five questions on defence funds,"A distinguished group of former military top brass haswritten an open letter to the prime ministerwarning that Britain's security is at risk unless the armed forces are properly funded. The letter reflects concern right across the ranks. The list includes not just the ""old and the bold"" - retired admirals, generals and air marshals - but former colonels, corporals and academics, too. The reality is that defence is not always top of the list of voters' concerns at an election. These are some of the questions behind the letter: There's always the danger of crying wolf. But few would disagree that the world is dangerous. The letter cites risks from all over the globe - whether from hostile states or extremist groups. Ministers have long argued that Britain's armed forces are the envy of the world and that even outside the European Union they'll play an important role. Some have even suggested that defence and security could be the UK's trump card in the difficult negotiations. The implication being that Europe's own security would suffer if they turned their back on Britain. Those who've signed this letter are not so sure. Brexit has already made the pound weaker. The letter says its fall ""threatens the purchase of meaningful numbers of jets"" for the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers. Almost $30bn (Â£22bn) worth of foreign military purchases planned by the MOD are exposed to currency fluctuations. That said, Britain is not leaving Nato - and it remains the cornerstone of European defence. The Nato alliance has set a target for its members to spend 2% of their national income, or GDP, on defence. Britain currently meets and is committed to that goal. In fact,Britain is one of the few Nato members to spend at least 2% on defence, according to the alliance's own figures. But MPs on the Commons Defence Committee say it'sbeen reached by ""creative accounting"",external. Those who've signed the letter put it more bluntly. They say it's a deception. In 2015, the government started adding several items of expenditure not previously included, such as military and civil service pensions, contributions to UN peacekeeping missions as well as much of the MOD's Â£1.4bn income. In the words of the letter ""most analysts now agree core defence expenditure for hard military power is well below 2%."" However, the calculations are entirely in accordance with Nato's own rules. It is true that defence spending rose this year. But it follows years of cuts. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon says the lean years are behind us. He says the MOD is spending Â£178bnon new equipment - including new jets, warships, aircraft carriers and armoured vehicles. Though that money is being spent over the next 10 years and also includes the cost of renewing Britain's Trident weapons system. The Treasury used to help foot that bill. A number of recent reports also question whether the MOD's equipment programme has been fully funded. Earlier this year, the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, noted that billions of pounds of efficiencieshad not yet been identified,external. While those who've signed the letter praise the government's2015 Defence and Security Review,externalas setting ""the right path for our long term security"", they say it has not been fully funded. They cite another report by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee who said ""the affordability of the Equipment Plan is at greater risk than at any time since its inception"". Policy tracker: What the parties have promised Election questions, answered Britain's armed forces are now at their smallest since the Napoleonic wars. The size of the army alone has been cut from more than 100,000 to just 82,000. Even then, the army is struggling with recruitment and is still below its fully trained strength. The government would argue that, though smaller, the armed forces are now more capable. Investment has been made in new equipment from body armour to drones. But there are still significant gaps. For example, Royal Navy warships are no longer fitted with any anti-ship missiles. The Navy can't afford them. Some capabilities have been ""hollowed out"". While the Royal Navy will soon have two new aircraft carriers, it's still not clear how many jets the MOD will be able to afford. Or how many new warships will be built to protect them. Those who've signed the letter warn that the armed forces are ""having to seek further very damaging savings in manpower support and training"". The seats where parties are choosing to stand aside Where Britain's parties stand on Brexit The last coalition government accused Labour of leaving a Â£34bn black hole in the MOD's budget. It was the reason why the 2010 Defence Review resulted in such savage cuts. However, during his time as defence secretary, Philip Hammond claimed to have balanced the books. Under Sir Michael Fallon, though, the accounts are under significant pressure. The recentreport by the National Audit Officesaid there's now a real risk of a return to the ""previous practice where affordability could only be maintained by delaying or reducing the cost of projects"". It's probably too early to say whether there's now a new black hole in the MODs accounts. But some estimate a gap of at least Â£10bn and growing. This is by no means the first time that former senior military officers have warned of a crisis in defence. But it's still not clear whether those concerns are shared by the voters, and whether defence features much in the general election.

The supermarket with no checkoutsAmazon opens its first grocery store without cashiers to shoppers in Seattle on Monday.2h2 hours agoBusinessComments,"Customers enter the store by scanning the Amazon Go app on their smartphone In a move that could revolutionise the way we buy groceries, Amazon has opened a supermarket with no checkout operators or self-service tills. Long queues formed outside the Amazon Go store in Seattle before it opened its doors to the public on Monday. It uses hundreds of ceiling-mounted cameras and electronic sensors to identify each customer and track the items they select. Purchases are billed to customers' credit cards when they leave the store. On entering the store, shoppers walk through gates similar to those in the London underground, swiping their smartphones loaded with the Amazon Go app. Then they are free to put any of the sandwiches, salads, drinks and biscuits on the shelves straight into their shopping bags.

There's no need for a trolley or basket, since you won't be unpacking it again at the till.  In fact, unless you need to be ID-checked for an alcohol purchase, there's also no need for any human interaction at all. With the help of sensors on the shelves, items are added to customers' Amazon Go account as they pick them up - and delete any they put back. An electronic receipt is issued as they exit. Virtual assistants and mobile shops: the changing face of shopping Amazon finally arrives in Australia The store opened to employees of the online retail giant in December 2016 and had been expected to allow the public in more quickly. But there were some teething problems with correctly identifying shoppers of similar body types - and children moving items to the wrong places on shelves, according to an Amazon insider. Aside from the technology, the shop is a conventional food store Gianna Puerini, head of Amazon Go, said the store had operated well during the test phase: ""This technology didn't exist - it was really advancing the state of the art of computer vision and machine learning.""

Grab-and-go shopping has been the ""future of retail"" for some time now. But now Amazon believes its time has come - or at least that it is ready for real-world testing. They're calling it ""Just walk out"" and while they won't spill the beans on just how it works, they say it uses ""computer vision, deep learning algorithms and sensor fusion, much like you'd find in a self-driving car"". You scan a QR code as you enter. After that, your phone can go back in your pocket. Hundreds of infra-red ceiling cameras have been trained (with Amazon employees as guinea pigs) over the past year to differentiate between customers as they move around the store, and between items for sale, even those with similar appearances, such as different flavours of the same canned drink. There are weight sensors on the shelves to help indicate if an item has been taken or put back. And some items carry a visual dot code, like a bar code, to help cameras identify them. Amazon isn't offering any information on how accurate the system is. However, one journalist attempted to shoplift some cans of soft drink - but the system spotted it and added them on his bill. Amazon has not said if it will be opening more Go stores, which are separate from theWhole Foods chain that it bought last yearfor $13.7bn (Â£10.7bn). As yet the company has no plans to introduce the technology to the hundreds of Whole Foods stores. However, retailers know that the faster customers can make their purchases, the more likely they are to return. Making the dreaded supermarket queue a thing of the past will give any retailer a huge advantage over its competitors. The Seattle store is not Amazon's first foray into bricks and mortar retailing. In 2015 the firm opened its first physical bookshop, also in Seattle where the company is based. Thereare now 13 in the US- as well as dozens of temporary pop-up outlets. Customers must have the Amazon Go app, and scan a QR code from it as they pass through a turnstile In its third quarter results in October, Amazon for the first time put a figure on the revenues generated by its physical stores: $1.28bn. Yet almost all of that was generated by Whole Foods. While its stores may not yet be moneyspinners, analysts have said Amazon is using them to raise brand awareness and promote its Prime membership scheme. Prime members pay online prices at its bookstores, for example, while non-members are charged the cover price. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon chief financial officer, recently hinted that rivals should expect more Amazon shops in the months and years ahead. ""You will see more expansion from us - it's still early, so those plans will develop over time,"" he said in October.

Shutdown hits US as working week startsMany federal services will not open on Monday as politicians struggle to agree on a new budget.6h6 hours agoUS & Canada,"Nearly 700,000 employees could be sent home without pay Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are waking up in the US, unable to work because of a government shutdown. The US Senate has failed to reach a temporary budget deal to keep it open. Some employees will not be paid until the stalemate is resolved. A vote will take place at noon in Washington (17:00 GMT) on whether to re-open government. Immigration remains one of the main sticking points between Republicans and Democrats. Democrats have refused to back a temporary budget deal until their concerns on immigration reform are dealt with. Essential federal services are still running across the country, but non-essential workers are not required to report to work. This video can not be played Government workers on what happens during a shutdown At midnight on Friday, lawmakers failed to agree on a spending bill. The bill was not a plan for funding for the whole of 2018, but would have kept things running until the middle of next month. Efforts to reach a compromise ahead of the working week failed in a rare Senate session late on Sunday. A vote to end the shutdown was postponed until midday on Monday, meaning many federal government offices will not open as the shutdown enters its third day. Why the US government has shut down White House voicemail blames Democrats Under Senate rules, the bill needs 60 votes in the 100-member chamber. This video can not be played Donald Trump's shutdown voicemail There are 50 Republican senators who are present and able to vote in the upper chamber on Monday, but at least 10 Democrats are needed to pass a budget. Republican Senator John McCain is away from Washington to receive cancer treatment. Democrats want President Trump to negotiate over immigration as part of a budget deal, but Republicans say no agreement is possible while federal government services are closed. Republicans want funding for border security - including a proposed border wall with Mexico - and immigration reforms, as well as increased military spending. On Saturday, Mr Trump said the ""nuclear option"" of a simple majority vote was necessary to end the impasse. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But essential services that protect ""life or human property"" will continue, including national security, postal services, air traffic control, some medical services, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity generation. And the Trump administration said it planned to keep national parks open - their closure in the 2013 shutdown provoked an angry public reaction. However, many rangers and staffers will not go into work.

Â£495k compensation payments over NI potholesThe figures have been released by the Department for Infrastructure under the Freedom of Information Act.3h3 hours agoNorthern IrelandComments,"The recent cold snap may have made the pothole problem even worse Almost Â£500,000 has been paid out in compensation payments to motorists whose vehicles were damaged by potholes and other road defects in the past two years. The figures, from the Department for Infrastructure (DfI), released under the Freedom of Information Act. They confirm that between 1 January, 2016 and 30 November, 2017, a total of 1,935 vehicle damage claims concluded. Compensation payments totalled Â£495,358.04. DfI also released figures highlighting that in 2017 more than 78,000 surface defects were recorded on nearly 16,400 stretches of road across Northern Ireland. The surface at Farnaloy Road, Madden, in County Armagh The road with the largest number of defects (108) was a stretch from Summerhill-Cherry Road near Upper Dunmurry Lane on the outskirts of west Belfast. This was followed by the Greenan Road (97) outside Warrenpoint and the Sixtowns Road (80) between Blackrock Road and Bealnamala Bridge near Magherafelt. FOI response - List of carriageway surface defects by road section â 2016,external FOI response - List of carriageway surface defects by road section â 2017,external Roads expert Wesley Johnston said it would cost more than Â£1bn to fully reinstate the entire 25,000km (15,534 miles) road network. However, with this year's maintenance budget totalling just Â£63m and with the latest cold snap creating new potholes, the problem looks likely to get worse. ""There is no doubt that as time goes on that the standard of the network and the surface of the roads is deteriorating,"" he said. Compensation payments for vehicles damaged totalled Â£495,358 in the past two years - pictured are potholes at Sixmilecross ""It is getting worse progressively over time, because each year we are under spending on maintenance so that adds to that deficit. ""So each year another bit gets added to it. What we are really doing is creating a problem for people down the line. ""Sooner or later there is going to have to be some reckoning because we can't keep under spending year after year after year."" DfI confirmed its limited maintenance budget. Darkley Road in Keady in County Armagh ""The 17/18 structural maintenance budget is Â£63m,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""In 2016/17 the structural maintenance outturn was Â£88m and in 2015/16 was Â£54m. ""Public safety remains a key priority for the department and despite a challenging budgetary situation, the department has this year delivered a significant programme of resurfacing and surface dressing and continues to carry out a programme of routine maintenance, including pothole repairs and street lighting repairs, to meet all essential public safety requirements."" The spokesperson added that there ""is a balance to be struck between building new roads and public transport provision and maintaining what we already have"".

Amanda Calderwood drives daily to and from the County Antrim villages of Broughshane and Ballyclare. She said her car has had two burst tyres in the last week due to potholes. She is frustrated with the standard of the roads she has to drive on.

A section of a road in Omagh that vehicles have to navigate Karen McShane, chair of the Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation, said going back six or seven years the budget for roads repairs was Â£100m per year, but that figure has been cut.

"A&E stats 'may have to be recalculated'Changes to the way A&E performance statistics are collected raise doubts about the data, the BBC understands.21m22 minutes agoHealth","NHS hospital trusts in England may have to recalculate A&E performance figures from last October onwards. The UK Statistics Authority has told NHS England to explain changes to the recording of A&E data. It says the changes - highlighted by BBC News - could have left people reaching ""misleading conclusions"". They raise questions over some trusts' performance on the highest profile NHS performance target - that patients in A&E are seen within four hours. Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: ""The changes that are understood to have been made to recording practice throw doubt on whether the scale of the crisis facing emergency medicine - made so clear in December's data - is actually greater than first thought."" The letter focuses on advice given to trusts by the health regulator NHS Improvement. Ed Humpherson, of the UKSA, says changes suggested by officials could ""be having impact on recording practice."" Ambulance A&E delays hit one in eight Long A&E waits: 3m a year wait over four hours The official target requires 95% of patients to be treated, assessed or discharged within four hours, a figure the NHS has failed to meet since July 2015. A hospital trust's performance figures include the main accident and emergency department (known as Type 1) and minor injuries or care centres (known as Type 3). These centres tend to see and treat patients a lot more quickly than those needing emergency care. Data in these clinics tends to pull up the overall performance of a trust. This is confirmed by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. The BBC has seen emails sent by NHS Improvement, the body responsible for overseeing trusts, in October last year. In one email titled ""counting of A&E performance"" sent to trusts in the south of England, it says they have committed to meeting the 95% target by March 2018 but that trusts had marginally failed to make the required progress.  Can't find your health trust?Browse the full list Rather search by typing?Back to search If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The email urged trusts to make sure they counted all their performance. It said if ""there is an urgent activity undertaken by a walk-in centre or urgent treatment centre or other provider within your local delivery board that currently is not reporting activity - we can work with you to apportion the activity to the main provider"".

"A&E stats 'may have to be recalculated'Changes to the way A&E performance statistics are collected raise doubts about the data, the BBC understands.20m20 minutes agoHealth","NHS hospital trusts in England may have to recalculate A&E performance figures from last October onwards. The UK Statistics Authority has told NHS England to explain changes to the recording of A&E data. It says the changes - highlighted by BBC News - could have left people reaching ""misleading conclusions"". They raise questions over some trusts' performance on the highest profile NHS performance target - that patients in A&E are seen within four hours. Dr Taj Hassan, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said: ""The changes that are understood to have been made to recording practice throw doubt on whether the scale of the crisis facing emergency medicine - made so clear in December's data - is actually greater than first thought.""

Ambulance A&E delays hit one in eight Long A&E waits: 3m a year wait over four hours The official target requires 95% of patients to be treated, assessed or discharged within four hours, a figure the NHS has failed to meet since July 2015. A hospital trust's performance figures include the main accident and emergency department (known as Type 1) and minor injuries or care centres (known as Type 3). These centres tend to see and treat patients a lot more quickly than those needing emergency care. Data in these clinics tends to pull up the overall performance of a trust. This is confirmed by the Royal College of Emergency Medicine. The BBC has seen emails sent by NHS Improvement, the body responsible for overseeing trusts, in October last year.

UK growth upgrade could 'dwarf' Brexit hit,"The Eurofighter production line at a BAE Systems factory in Warton, Lancashire Britain should prepare for a much more economically optimistic 2018 because global growth is better than predicted. That's the argument of Lord Jim O'Neill, the former Conservative Treasury minister and Remain supporter. He said Britain's growth forecasts are likely to be upgraded as China, the US and Europe show increased activity. The gloomy predictions of the possible effects of Brexit are likely to be ""dwarfed"" by the more positive figures, Lord O'Neill added. But he argued that far from ""changing his mind"" on the economic effects of Brexit, the question now for the UK was how much better the country could be doing without the uncertainty over its relationship with the European Union. ""I certainly wouldn't have thought the UK economy would be as robust as it currently seems,"" Lord O'Neill, who is on the board of the Northern Powerhouse Partnership, told me. ""That is because some parts of the country, led by the North West [of England], are actually doing way better than people seem to realise or appreciate. ""As well as this crucial fact, the rest of the world is also doing way better than many people would have thought a year ago, so it makes it easier for the UK."" Hammond on EU: Stop talking about 'punishing' UK over Brexit The 'making stuff' boom - here's why it matters Why stock markets are at record highs Arecent assessment by Cambridge Econometrics for the Mayor of Londonsuggested that growth across the UK could be on average 3% lower by 2030 than it would have been if Britain remained within the EU's single market and customs union. ""If that's the worst that Brexit will deliver, then I wouldn't worry about it,"" Lord O'Neill said ahead of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where there are likely to be a number of positive growth upgrades published for the global economy. ""Now, my own view is if we go for a really hard Brexit or a no-deal Brexit, we'll probably suffer more than that 3%. ""But if it is only 3%, what's going on with the rest of the world - helping us - and with productivity improving, that will easily dwarf a 3% hit over 13 years, easily."" Lord O'Neill said it was ironic that Britain was leaving the EU at just the time growth was increasing across the continent, given that one of the arguments for leaving was unshackling the UK from a number of ""sclerotic"" European economies. Better global growth helps UK exports - an important driver of the British economy. This video can not be played UK economy will do better than expected, says Lord Jim O'Neill, a former minister and a Remain supporter I asked him whether his optimistic forecasts now revealed that he, and many economists, had simply been too pessimistic about the effects of a Brexit vote. ""I'm almost embarrassed to accept that it might sound like that,"" Lord O'Neill replied. ""Because of course, in principle, I share the views of many that Brexit is a really weird thing for the UK to impose on itself from an economic perspective. ""And maybe this [better global growth] means the country's going to be able to cope with Brexit better than certainly somebody like me might have thought some time ago. ""But I would quickly add at the same time, I have felt for a good couple of years, as important as Brexit is, it isn't the most important thing facing Britain's future."" He said that global growth, better productivity and rebalancing government policies to support the north of England and other regions beyond London was much more important. There was some evidence, Lord O'Neill argued, that was now happening. He said that the ""Brexiteers are going to be like the cat with the cream. They're like 'there you go, told you so', which of course is ridiculous"". Lord O'Neill said that major sectors of the economy that are closely linked to the EU, such as car manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, were still facing significant threats because of the government's proposals to leave the customs union and the single market. China's economy has been buoyant in recent months Over the past six months economic forecasts have become more bullish on world growth. China, the US and Germany have all published strong economic data and last autumn the International Monetary Fund upgraded its global predictions. ""I'm guessing world GDP growth of at least 4%, so a good half percent higher than the consensus is currently saying - and signs of it actually accelerating,"" Lord O'Neill said. ""Virtually every major place I can think of, [with the] possible exception of us, are all sharing in it at the same time. World trade - just when everybody's trying to write it off - has actually risen sharply."" He said that President Donald Trump's reforms of the tax system and plans to loosen regulatory controls would boost the US economy. ""The secular stagnation that the likes of Larry Summers [the former US Treasury Secretary] have talked about for a few years looks suspiciously dodgy. I would imagine that the idea is going to be back tracked pretty quickly now.""

Ecuador leader says Assange 'a problem',"President Moreno and Foreign Minister MarÃ­a Fernanda Espinosa would like to see Mr Assange leave the embassy Ecuador's President LenÃ­n Moreno has described Wikileaks founder Julian Assange as an ""inherited problem"" in a television interview. Mr Assange has been living inside the Ecuadorean embassy in London since June 2012, when he claimed political asylum. He had been wanted on assault claims in Sweden, which have been dropped, but says he fears extradition to the US. The UK recently refused to recognise Mr Assange as a diplomatic agent, which would have provided him with immunity. President Moreno said Mr Assange had created ""more than a nuisance"" for his government. He has in the past warned the Wikileaks founder not to interfere in Ecuadorean politics or ""that of nations that are our friends"". His warning followed Mr Assange's public support for the independence campaign in Catalonia. Mr Assange has also had at least one meeting with former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, althoughMr Farage has dismissed reports that his contact with Mr Assange was more frequent. The Wikileaks founder was also reprimanded for interfering in the 2016 US election after publishing hacked emails from the campaign team of Hillary Clinton. Mr Assange was granted asylum by President Moreno's predecessor in office, Rafael Correa. Is Assange interfering in US election? Timeline of the Julian Assange case 18 revelations from Wikileaks' hacked Clinton emails Mr Moreno's government has said that it will maintain Mr Assange's asylum. But it has also sought ways for him to leave the embassy without risking arrest for breaching his bail conditions and possible extradition to the US over the 2010 publication of classified information by Wikileaks. In April,US Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that arresting Mr Assange was a ""priority"". While he has not been charged with any offence so far, Mr Assange fears that the US authorities have prepared a sealed indictment ordering his arrest. In December,Mr Assange was granted Ecuadorean citizenship. Mr Assange posted a picture of himself wearing an Ecuadorean football shirt after he was granted citizenship Earlier this month, Ecuadorean Foreign Minister MarÃ­a Fernanda Espinosa asked the UK to recognise Mr Assange as a diplomatic agent with a view to him being provided with diplomatic immunity. However, that move was rejected by the UK authorities who said that Mr Assange should leave the embassy and ""face justice"". Speaking on Sunday, President Moreno said he was disappointed by the British government's response. ""This would have been a good result, unfortunately, things did not turn out as the foreign ministry planned and so the problem still exists."" The president said Ecuador would seek help from ""important people"" to solve the problem.

The supermarket with no checkouts,"Customers enter the store by scanning the Amazon Go app on their smartphone In a move that could revolutionise the way we buy groceries, Amazon has opened a supermarket with no checkout operators or self-service tills. Long queues formed outside the Amazon Go store in Seattle before it opened its doors to the public on Monday. It uses hundreds of ceiling-mounted cameras and electronic sensors to identify each customer and track the items they select. Purchases are billed to customers' credit cards when they leave the store. On entering the store, shoppers walk through gates similar to those in the London underground, swiping their smartphones loaded with the Amazon Go app. Then they are free to put any of the sandwiches, salads, drinks and biscuits on the shelves straight into their shopping bags.

There's no need for a trolley or basket, since you won't be unpacking it again at the till.  In fact, unless you need to be ID-checked for an alcohol purchase, there's also no need for any human interaction at all. With the help of sensors on the shelves, items are added to customers' Amazon Go account as they pick them up - and delete any they put back. An electronic receipt is issued as they exit. Virtual assistants and mobile shops: the changing face of shopping Amazon finally arrives in Australia The store opened to employees of the online retail giant in December 2016 and had been expected to allow the public in more quickly. But there were some teething problems with correctly identifying shoppers of similar body types - and children moving items to the wrong places on shelves, according to an Amazon insider. Aside from the technology, the shop is a conventional food store Gianna Puerini, head of Amazon Go, said the store had operated well during the test phase: ""This technology didn't exist - it was really advancing the state of the art of computer vision and machine learning.""

Grab-and-go shopping has been the ""future of retail"" for some time now. But now Amazon believes its time has come - or at least that it is ready for real-world testing. They're calling it ""Just walk out"" and while they won't spill the beans on just how it works, they say it uses ""computer vision, deep learning algorithms and sensor fusion, much like you'd find in a self-driving car"". You scan a QR code as you enter. After that, your phone can go back in your pocket. Hundreds of infra-red ceiling cameras have been trained (with Amazon employees as guinea pigs) over the past year to differentiate between customers as they move around the store, and between items for sale, even those with similar appearances, such as different flavours of the same canned drink. There are weight sensors on the shelves to help indicate if an item has been taken or put back. And some items carry a visual dot code, like a bar code, to help cameras identify them. Amazon isn't offering any information on how accurate the system is. However, one journalist attempted to shoplift some cans of soft drink - but the system spotted it and added them on his bill. Amazon has not said if it will be opening more Go stores, which are separate from theWhole Foods chain that it bought last yearfor $13.7bn (Â£10.7bn). As yet the company has no plans to introduce the technology to the hundreds of Whole Foods stores. However, retailers know that the faster customers can make their purchases, the more likely they are to return. Making the dreaded supermarket queue a thing of the past will give any retailer a huge advantage over its competitors. The Seattle store is not Amazon's first foray into bricks and mortar retailing. In 2015 the firm opened its first physical bookshop, also in Seattle where the company is based. Thereare now 13 in the US- as well as dozens of temporary pop-up outlets. Customers must have the Amazon Go app, and scan a QR code from it as they pass through a turnstile In its third quarter results in October, Amazon for the first time put a figure on the revenues generated by its physical stores: $1.28bn. Yet almost all of that was generated by Whole Foods. While its stores may not yet be moneyspinners, analysts have said Amazon is using them to raise brand awareness and promote its Prime membership scheme. Prime members pay online prices at its bookstores, for example, while non-members are charged the cover price. Brian Olsavsky, Amazon chief financial officer, recently hinted that rivals should expect more Amazon shops in the months and years ahead. ""You will see more expansion from us - it's still early, so those plans will develop over time,"" he said in October.

A&E stats 'may have to be recalculated',"NHS hospital trusts in England may have to recalculate A&E performance figures from last October onwards. The UK Statistics Authority has told NHS England to explain changes to the recording of A&E data.

They raise questions over some trusts' performance on the highest profile NHS performance target - that patients in A&E are seen within four hours.

'Embarrassed women avoiding smear tests',"This video can not be played What happens during a smear test? Young women are avoiding getting smear tests because they are embarrassed by the look and smell of their pubic areas, a survey suggests. The charity Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust surveyed 2,017 British women. A third said embarrassment caused them to delay getting a smear test, which can prevent 75% of cervical cancers. The charity saidcervical cancer is the most common cancer in women under 35,,externalyet almost two-thirds of those surveyed weren't aware they're most at risk. A total of 220,000 British women are diagnosed with cervical abnormalities each year. Lauren Bennie said she put off having her smear test until the age of 30 because she was ""naive, embarrassed and uneducated about the female body"". ""So many silly things stopped me from going for my smear test,"" she said. ""I worried about the nurse being able to take one look at my bits and have some magic skill to be able to determine the number of sexual partners I'd had. I thought a lot about what kind of underwear and clothes to wear."" While at university in Dundee, she thought she might know the medical students who could be asked in to observe. Lauren Bennie said she put off having her smear test until the age of 30 ""I didn't know it at the time, but the embarrassment I felt around going for a smear was actually doing my body damage,"" said the 33-year-old Glaswegian. WATCH: Is there really scraping in a smear test? The truth about what it really involves,external When she did eventually get a test she was told she needed further examination. ""It was when I was faced with words such asdyskaryosis,external(abnormal cells), high-grade andcolposcopy,externalthat I realised the severity of the situation."" Hospital results later confirmed she had severely abnormal cells that were pre-cancerous on her cervix. ""It was terrifying,"" she said. ""I felt angry rather than sad that I had left it so long to go for a smear test."" Lauren's story isn't unique. The survey found young women are embarrassed to attend smear tests because of their body shape (35%), the appearance of their vulva (34%) and concerns over smell (38%). A third said they wouldn't go if they hadn't waxed or shaved their bikini area. About 15% also said they would miss their smear tests for a gym class or a waxing appointment. Robert Music, of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, said: ""Please don't let unhappiness or uncertainty about your body stop you from attending what could be a life-saving test. ""Nurses are professionals who carry out millions of tests every year, they can play a big part in ensuring women are comfortable."" Of the five million women in the UK invited to cervical screening each year, one in four do not attend. This rises to one in three among women aged 25 to 29 and is particularly bad in some geographic areas, such as Glasgow. Mr Music said: ""Every area has different demographics, pressures and geography,"" with the charityfinding,externala third of local healthcare providers and councils haven't made any action in the past year to increase uptake of smear tests. ""There is already so much great work being done across the UK, however, if this is not amplified and prioritised, we will continue to see a decline in cervical screening coverage and ultimately lives lost."" Lauren's smear test allowed her to catch the pre-cancerous cells before they developed into cancer. She said: ""I had to have surgery to have a piece of my cervix removed. ""Luckily I received the all-clear but if I had delayed my smear test any longer it could have been much worse. ""My smear test could have saved my life, please don't put yours off.""

Rescuers find man in snowdrifts,"This video can not be played The man had left his home to seek help after being without power for a week. A 64-year-old man has been rescued after a failed attempt to walk to safety from his home in the south of Scotland. He had been without power for seven days in the house near Eskdalemuir when he tried to reach the nearest village. After four hours of struggling through deep snow he had called for help. Darkness had fallen on Sunday when Moffat Mountain Rescue Team arrived in the area. They spent two hours battling through drifts before finding him. The man was eventually taken by 4x4 vehicle to Lockerbie. Rescue team leader Shaun Duignan said: ""This has been a busy week for the team with many team members working through the night to help stranded drivers and then a rescue closer to the expected role of a mountain rescue team, rescuing someone from a remote inaccessible location."" The team were called out again a few hours later to take part in an operation with Tweed Valley Mountain Rescue Team and Police Scotland to find two walkers on the Southern Upland Way. The search for the walkers began at 00:10. They were eventually found, uninjured, at 05:30. Throughout Sunday, heavy snow has caused travel chaos on roads in Scotland as motorists faced hazardous driving conditions as the weather deteriorated. Five people were hurt in a two-car crash near the Glencoe Mountain Resort on the A82 on Sunday. Local police asked drivers to avoid the area, who described the conditions in the area as ""extremely poor"". At the height of the problems at Glencoe, the road was closed while police dealt with the aftermath of the accident. 'Six mile tailback' at Scottish ski resort Climbers rescued from snow-covered ridge By Monday morning, only two closures due to weather conditions were being reported. At Lairg in the Highlands, the A836 was closed at the A839 junction on the Main Street. The snow gates remained closed on the B974 between Banchory and Fettercairn. Glasgow Airport had to be closed while the runway was cleared On Sunday, drivers in the south-west were urged to ""avoid unnecessary journeys"" following a spate of road accidents. Police said heavy snowfall across Dumfries and Galloway was causing problems on roads including the A75, which was blocked at the Glen for a short time. Police later said it had been gritted and was ""passable with care"". Heavy snow was also affecting the A76, the A701, the A709  and the A713 Castle Douglas - Ayr road, where there were a number of accidents. Glasgow Airport was closed for a short time while the runway was cleared of snow. Saturday night saw the coldest temperature recorded in the UK since February 14 2016, when -14.1C was recorded at Braemar. Despite the frigid temperatures in the far north, the mercury rose to 11C in the far south west of England. Met Office forecaster Steven Keate said the near 20C difference, caused as warmer air moves in, was ""pretty unusual for the UK"". ""The broad theme is it is turning milder from the west, but before we get there some snow will fall,"" he said. Hundreds of vehicles were stuck in traffic on the M74 on Tuesday night Yellow: Severe weather expected. Yellow means you should plan ahead thinking about possible travel delays, or the disruption of your day-to-day activities. Amber: Be prepared for disruption. There is an increased likelihood of bad weather affecting you, which could potentially disrupt your plans and possibly cause travel delays, road and rail closures, interruption to power and the potential risk to life and property. Red: Extreme weather is expected. Red means you should take action now to keep yourself and others safe from the impact of the weather. Widespread damage, travel and power disruption and risk to life is likely. You must avoid dangerous areas and follow the advice of the emergency services and local authorities.

Â£495k compensation payments over NI potholes,"The recent cold snap may have made the pothole problem even worse Almost Â£500,000 has been paid out in compensation payments to motorists whose vehicles were damaged by potholes and other road defects in the past two years. The figures, from the Department for Infrastructure (DfI), released under the Freedom of Information Act. They confirm that between 1 January, 2016 and 30 November, 2017, a total of 1,935 vehicle damage claims concluded. Compensation payments totalled Â£495,358.04. DfI also released figures highlighting that in 2017 more than 78,000 surface defects were recorded on nearly 16,400 stretches of road across Northern Ireland. The surface at Farnaloy Road, Madden, in County Armagh The road with the largest number of defects (108) was a stretch from Summerhill-Cherry Road near Upper Dunmurry Lane on the outskirts of west Belfast. This was followed by the Greenan Road (97) outside Warrenpoint and the Sixtowns Road (80) between Blackrock Road and Bealnamala Bridge near Magherafelt. FOI response - List of carriageway surface defects by road section â 2016,external FOI response - List of carriageway surface defects by road section â 2017,external Roads expert Wesley Johnston said it would cost more than Â£1bn to fully reinstate the entire 25,000km (15,534 miles) road network. However, with this year's maintenance budget totalling just Â£63m and with the latest cold snap creating new potholes, the problem looks likely to get worse. ""There is no doubt that as time goes on that the standard of the network and the surface of the roads is deteriorating,"" he said. Compensation payments for vehicles damaged totalled Â£495,358 in the past two years - pictured are potholes at Sixmilecross ""It is getting worse progressively over time, because each year we are under spending on maintenance so that adds to that deficit. ""So each year another bit gets added to it. What we are really doing is creating a problem for people down the line. ""Sooner or later there is going to have to be some reckoning because we can't keep under spending year after year after year."" DfI confirmed its limited maintenance budget. Darkley Road in Keady in County Armagh ""The 17/18 structural maintenance budget is Â£63m,"" a spokesperson told the BBC. ""In 2016/17 the structural maintenance outturn was Â£88m and in 2015/16 was Â£54m. ""Public safety remains a key priority for the department and despite a challenging budgetary situation, the department has this year delivered a significant programme of resurfacing and surface dressing and continues to carry out a programme of routine maintenance, including pothole repairs and street lighting repairs, to meet all essential public safety requirements."" The spokesperson added that there ""is a balance to be struck between building new roads and public transport provision and maintaining what we already have"". ""The Department of Finance recently published a briefing paper which outlines the impact of a number of future budget scenarios and we would welcome comments,"" they said. Carriageway Surface Defects by Road SectionÂ âÂ 2017,external Carriageway Surface Defects by Road SectionÂ âÂ 2016,external ""Any decisions on budget allocation will be for a future Minister for Infrastructure."" It was announced last week that DfI will receive Â£8.1m to support roads structural maintenance and the procurement of new buses by Translink. Amanda Calderwood drives daily to and from the County Antrim villages of Broughshane and Ballyclare. She said her car has had two burst tyres in the last week due to potholes. She is frustrated with the standard of the roads she has to drive on. Motorist Amanda Calderwood said snow means that sometimes drivers cannot see potholes ""I pass at least 10 to 12 potholes a day on my way to work,"" she said. ""You can avoid them sometimes but with the snow you can't always see them, it's impossible to avoid them. The Shore Road between Enniskillen and Belleek ""I'm out of money, I know I can claim it back, but I have been told to claim it back I have get out of the car and to take a picture of the pothole. ""One of the roads I drive on is the Colin Road in Ballyclare and there is no way, unless I had a death wish, that I would step out of the car to take a picture just to get Â£50 back,"" she added. A section of a road in Omagh that vehicles have to navigate Karen McShane, chair of the Chartered Institution of Highways and Transportation, said going back six or seven years the budget for roads repairs was Â£100m per year, but that figure has been cut. ""What we have is a Â£35bn asset and, if this was something that  you owned, as soon as something went wrong with it you'd repair it and get it right,"" she said. ""The problem is we don't have any ministers in place to make decisions to move money around to allow us to make those repairs. ""You mention a figure of Â£500,000 [in compensation] - what is the cost of a fatality?"" The problem is not confined to country road, as this picture from Ormeau Road in Belfast shows Alliance MLA Kellie Armstrong, who sat on the assembly's  infrastructure committee, said: ""The budget projections going forward means that instead of spending Â£100m we'll be lucky if we get Â£20m spent on our roads going forward. ""They're talking about turning off all street lights in another couple of years because we simply can't afford it - fixing potholes on rural roads, you can forget about that. ""We'll be talking about fixing only those roads that are the main trunk roads into urban areas.""

Tourists gulp at huge Venice steak bill,"From mouth-watering steak to eye-watering bill in Venice The mayor of Venice has voiced outrage over the â¬1,100 (Â£970; $1,347) bill that four Japanese tourists say they had to pay for four steaks, a plate of fried fish, water and service. The four students complained to police after getting the eye-watering bill at a restaurant near St Mark's Square. Three women with them chose another restaurant - but even they ended up paying â¬350 for three plates of seafood pasta, Italian media report. The mayor has vowed to get justice. ""We will thoroughly examine this episode, we'll check to see if the complaint was made properly,"" Mayor Luigi Brugnaro tweeted.,external ""If this disgraceful episode is confirmed, we'll do all we can to punish those responsible. We are for justice - always!"" The four Japanese men complained to police on returning to Bologna, where they are students. Their case has been taken up by Marco Gasparinetti, spokesman for a Venice residents' forum called ""Gruppo 25 Aprile"". Spectacular St Mark's Square is a highlight of any Venice tour Italian media did not name the restaurant, but said it was owned by a Chinese woman and run by an Egyptian. According to Mr Gasparinetti, only 1.1% of restaurants in that part of Venice are owned by locals, and the figure is 50% in the historic centre as a whole. He said Gruppo 25 Aprile would post advice for tourists this week on Facebook to help them avoid such a ""mockery"". There have been many cases of restaurants overcharging tourists in Venice, he said.

YouTube denies it should be regulated,"YouTube has denied its content should be regulated in a way similar to traditional broadcasters. Speaking to Newsbeat, the platform's chief business officer says the site is ""different"" and doesn't have the same ""editorial hand"" broadcasters have. The Google-owned company is about to launch its first original UK-based production on its ad-supported platform, fronted by Jack Whitehall. It will be produced by James Corden and the team behind his US talk show. YouTube's Robert Kyncl has insisted in a rare interview: ""We're not content creators; we're a platform that distributes the content"". There were calls for YouTube to be regulated after a vlog by Logan Paul - one of its biggest stars -showed the bodyof a man who appeared to have killed himself. A screengrab from the video posted by Logan Paul in Japan's Aokigahara forest The upload broke YouTube's community guidelines and the company says it'sputting in measuresto ensure a video like that is never uploaded again. In the UK, licensed broadcasters have to stick to rules set by the regulatorOfcom,external, but YouTube insists it's an open platform. ""It doesn't absolve us of responsibility, we actually take that very seriously,"" Kyncl says. The site's community guidelines act as the ""standards which are a guide on how to behave on YouTube,"" he adds. He also says YouTube's committed to hiring ""up to 10,000"" more people to monitor controversial content - and insists the site is ""constantly evolving"" to cope with new problems. ""The steps we're taking are not steps any government is asking us to do, these are the steps we're choosing to do because we believe that is the right thing to do."" Robert Kyncl admits monitoring an open site is ""one of the hardest things you can do"" but says it's worth doing properly ""because openness brings so many great benefits"". Original programming on the site - like the new comedy Training Days, focusing on what famous footballers get up to when they train - is going to increase. Demi Lovato's documentary Simply Complicated was broadcast on YouTube in 2017 Last year it broadcast Demi Lovato's documentary Simply Complicated, as well as Katy Perry's Witness Worldwide, a Big Brother-style four-day exclusive stream. Kyncl says it's using shows like that to ""drive more interest to YouTube to benefit content creators."" Working with James Corden and his team is no surprise after the success his Late Late Show's Carpool Karaoke feature has had on YouTube. The segment with Adele has had more than 175m views.

Its success ""surprised everybody"" admits Kyncl, who says: ""James is incredibly thoughtful to make sure his show works both on TV and on YouTube"". In 2016, Apple Music bought the rights to a Carpool Karaoke spin-off that YouTube had turned down. ""We figured we already have Carpool Karaoke so we don't need another one,"" Kyncl explains. ""It would be pretty hard to beat the one we already have. It didn't make sense for us - but it made sense for Apple."" Last year was ""difficult"", the company wrotein a blog post,external. There were issues with some of its biggest creators - not just with Logan Paul - but others like PewDiePie who wasaccused of using""a racial slur"". Investigations also revealed that ads for big brands were being regularly shown on racist videos or those that encouraged violence. Brands boycotted the site and pulled sponsorship. YouTube then announced it was going tomake it harderto make money from vlogs. Clips will no longer have adverts attached unless the publisher meets two criteria - that they have: at least 1,000 subscribers more than 4,000 hours of their content viewed by others within the past 12 months Some vloggers criticised the announcement, believing it punishes smaller channels. It's one of the steps YouTube is taking to regulate itself - by continuing to change its guidelines as the platform grows. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

US shutdown hits as working week begins,"Nearly 700,000 employees could be sent home without pay Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are waking up in the US, unable to work because of a government shutdown. The US Senate has failed to reach a temporary budget deal to keep it open. Some employees will not be paid until the stalemate is resolved. A vote will take place at noon in Washington (17:00 GMT) on whether to re-open government. Immigration remains one of the main sticking points between Republicans and Democrats. Democrats have refused to back a temporary budget deal until their concerns on immigration reform are dealt with. Essential federal services are still running across the country, but non-essential workers are not required to report to work. This video can not be played Government workers on what happens during a shutdown At midnight on Friday, lawmakers failed to agree on a spending bill. The bill was not a plan for funding for the whole of 2018, but would have kept things running until the middle of next month. Efforts to reach a compromise ahead of the working week failed in a rare Senate session late on Sunday. A vote to end the shutdown was postponed until midday on Monday, meaning many federal government offices will not open as the shutdown enters its third day. Why the US government has shut down White House voicemail blames Democrats Under Senate rules, the bill needs 60 votes in the 100-member chamber. This video can not be played Donald Trump's shutdown voicemail There are 50 Republican senators who are present and able to vote in the upper chamber on Monday, but at least 10 Democrats are needed to pass a budget. Republican Senator John McCain is away from Washington to receive cancer treatment. Democrats want President Trump to negotiate over immigration as part of a budget deal, but Republicans say no agreement is possible while federal government services are closed. Republicans want funding for border security - including a proposed border wall with Mexico - and immigration reforms, as well as increased military spending. On Saturday, Mr Trump said the ""nuclear option"" of a simple majority vote was necessary to end the impasse. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Global US approval 'tumbles under Trump' Ways he has actually changed America What Trump has said about your country A year in the life of Trump's hotel It means no pay for those federal employees who are ""furloughed"" - on unpaid leave - even though their workplaces are not open. The last government shutdown was in 2013, and lasted for 16 days. 10 unexpected consequences of the 2013 shutdown It cost the government $2bn in lost productivity and led to ""significant negative effects on the economy"", the OMB said at the time. Free coffee for federal workers near the White House during the shutdown After the 2013 shutdown, Congress passed a bill ensuring employees who were on unpaid leave received pay cheques for the time they missed. However, receiving pay is not guaranteed this time as Congress would have to approve it again. The shutdown began on the first anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. His trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, has also been called into question. Most staff in the departments of housing, environment, education and commerce will be staying at home on Monday.,externalHalf of workers in the treasury, health, defence and transportation departments will also not be going to work. But essential services that protect ""life or human property"" will continue, including national security, postal services, air traffic control, some medical services, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity generation. And the Trump administration said it planned to keep national parks open - their closure in the 2013 shutdown provoked an angry public reaction. However, many rangers and staffers will not go into work. The Statue of Liberty was closed on Sunday but the governor of New York said he will use state funds to keep the historic landmark open from Monday. Allow Twitter content?

Friday's vote fell 50-49, far short of the 60 needed to advance the bill. This is due to a number of key disagreements. Democrats have demanded protection from deportation of more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children. ""I hope it is just a matter of hours or days.

Speaking in Folkestone, he urged UKIP to put an end to factional infighting. It came after 14 senior figures quit their roles, including Mr Bolton's deputy and assistant deputy. Who is Henry Bolton? Hamilton: Bolton should go UKIP leader splits with partner after texts Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Bolton had been ""pretty stupid"" in the way he had handled the media over claims about his private life. But he said he was ""very pleased"" that the leader was pushing for changes to the party's constitution and the national executive committee, which he said were long overdue. ""If UKIP doesn't change it will not exist in 18 months time,"" he said on his LBC radio show. He said he will ""wait to see"" Henry Bolton's proposals to reform UKIP, before deciding whether to back him staying on as leader. In an interview with Mr Farage, Mr Bolton hit out at those who had quit, saying: ""If they had any interest in the party they would be continuing their jobs - their resignations achieve nothing in that respect."" Asked how he was coping with the media attention, Mr Bolton said: ""In some ways I am enjoying navigating through all this."" UKIP's local government, education, trade and immigration spokesmen have all resigned as Mr Bolton defied growing calls to quit over offensive texts sent by his ex-girlfriend. Nigel Farage has called for reform of the NEC in the past Ex-education spokesman David Kurten said he believed Mr Bolton had ""no chance of surviving"" a vote of party members, saying he did not know what the leader ""hoped to achieve"" by staying on. In a statement to the media, Mr Bolton said he ""respected"" the party's constitutional process, which will see party members decide his future in the coming weeks. But he said the decision to force a vote was a ""distraction"" from what should be the party's focus on May's local elections and achieving ""true independence"" for the UK after Brexit. ""I repeat I shall not be resigning as party leader."" He said he had lost confidence in the NEC, which he said was unable to take the party forward and whose shortcomings he suggested had been recognised by previous leaders. ""The NEC requires significant and urgent reform. To that end, again during the coming weeks, I shall be proposing a new party constitution, with a newly constituted and reformed NEC. ""Likewise, it is now time to put an end to the factional in-fighting within the party and to remove those who have been a part of that. In a single phrase, it is time to 'Drain the Swamp'."" Mr Bolton, who has been under pressure over some of his former girlfriend's comments, has said another leadership contest could be financially ruinous for the party, which has staged three contests in the last 18 months. He has also said he has ended the ""romantic element"" of his relationship with Jo Marney after it emerged that in the past she had sent a text saying Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle would ""taint"" the Royal Family, leading to accusations of racism. Nigel Farage was succeeded as UKIP leader by Diane James - he then took over as interim leader when she quit Nigel Farage: UKIP's long-serving leader announced his resignation on 4 July 2016, saying his ""political ambition has been achieved"" by the Brexit vote Diane James: Lasted less than three weeks after being elected in September 2016 Nigel Farage: Returned as interim leader in October 2016 Paul Nuttall: Elected on 28 November 2016, but quit the following June after UKIP's general election collapse Henry Bolton: Elected on 29 September. Is facing resignations and a vote of no confidence But Mr Bolton has so far failed to convince many of the senior figures in the party - with the NEC's vote of no confidence in him on Sunday followed by a series of resignations on Monday. In his resignation letter as trade spokesman William Dartmouth, a South West England MEP, told Mr Bolton his position was ""untenable"". ""When you became leader you said that you would make the party successful,"" he said. ""If you still feel that way then you should resign forthwith."" Deputy leader Margot Parker, who is an East Midlands MEP, said Mr Bolton's ""personal life took over the job he was elected to do"". Mr Bolton said he split with his girlfriend Jo Marney after the 25-year-old's texts about Meghan Markle came to light She added: ""It would be quicker and cleaner if he came to the conclusion he could go sooner rather than later. ""This is taking time away from doing the job. This puts the party in a limbo situation."" She told Mr Farage, on his LBC programme ""It's a pretty wacky situation we find ourselves in"" and his questioning of his colleagues' loyalty was ""outrageous"". NEC member Paul Oakley told Mr Farage the party had already lost patience with Mr Bolton before the stories about his private life, adding: ""His handling of the media was absolutely atrocious"". Following the vote of no confidence party members who turn up to the EGM will given a vote on whether Mr Bolton should remain in post. UKIP, which has long campaigned to leave the EU, came top in the 2014 European elections and got the third largest vote share in the 2015 general election with 12.6% - but this plummeted to 1.8% in June - the first general election since the UK voted for Brexit.

Epilepsy drug disabilities a 'scandal',"This video can not be played Bridget Buck was born with severe brain damage and spina bifida An MP has said the harm caused to children after their mothers were given the epilepsy drug sodium valproate is an ""extraordinary scandal"". It is thought about 20,000 children in the UK have been left with disabilities caused by valproate since the 1970s. Norman Lamb MP said it was also ""extraordinarily distressing""new research suggested medical problems could be passed through generations.,external Affected families havecalled for a public inquiry and compensation. Sodium valproate, also known as Epilim, can be prescribed by doctors as a treatment for epilepsy and bipolar disorder. It carries a risk of causing physical abnormalities, autism, low IQ and learning disabilities if babies are exposed to the drug while in the womb. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the drug is ""kept under constant review"", while the Department of Health said it expects the MHRA to take further action if a review finds more can be done to highlight the risks associated with it. Many parents have claimed they were not made aware of the risksfrom taking the treatment while pregnant, even after new safety warnings were introduced in 2016. This video can not be played Sue Jenkinson took sodium valproate while she was pregnant with her two daughters Sue Jenkinson, from Liverpool, took the drug while she was pregnant and both of her two daughters developed foetal valproate syndrome. They have since had their own children and they believe they are showing signs of the condition, despite neither taking valproate during their own pregnancies. ""It's because I took that medication, that's why my kids haven't got a normal life and they struggle every single day of their lives,"" Ms Jenkinson said. Her grandson Ryan has medical problems including dyspraxia, learning difficulties and a bowel condition, and is being monitored by Professor of Clinical Neuropsychology Gus Baker. Prof Baker said he is currently identifying Ryan's ""strengths and weaknesses"" and ""trying to map them on to what we understand about sodium valproate and how it affects children"". ""I'll probably be in a good position to provide a formulation of what I think has happened to him and what we might be able to do to ameliorate those difficulties that he is clearly having,"" he said. Sue Jenkinson believes foetal valproate syndrome has been passed through three generations of her family Mr Lamb, a former minister for care and support, is part of a campaign calling for the government to back compensation claims. ""We are in a good dialogue. The minister, Lord O'Shaughnessy, appears to be completely conscious of the need to stop this scandal continuing,"" he said. In France, a charity-led campaign is being supported by the government and Mr Lamb has called for something similar ""to happen here without delay"". The drug's maker Sanofi said valproate had been ""made available to physicians to treat epileptic patients in the 1970s"". ""It was and still is one of the most effective treatments for epilepsy, a serious and complex disease that can be potentially fatal to patients,"" it added. The firm said it was ""aware of the challenging situations faced by families with children with conditions that may be related to their mother's treatment with antiepileptic drugs"". However, they said the drug ""has at all times been supplied in the UK with a warning of the risk of malformations in babies"". This warning has been on the outside of valproate pill packets since 2016 in Britain Research from Konkuk University in South Korea involving mice has also suggested disabilities caused by valproate could afflict successive generations within families. Professor of Pharmacology Chan Young Shin said he found evidence ""the compound could cause autism spectrum disorder trans-generationally"". The MHRA has said the study had ""many limitations"", but some families believe this has happened to them. Mr Lamb said the research into whether the syndrome can pass between generations showed the consequences of taking valproate during pregnancy must be ""extraordinarily distressing for the families affected"". Karen Buck has been told her daughter Bridget only has months to live Any potential help for affected families will probably be too late for Bridget Buck. The 19-year-old, from Stanmore in north-west London, was born with severe medical problems including brain damage and spina bifida after her mother was prescribed sodium valproate. ""I do all Bridget's overall care. I think for Bridget, I talk for Bridget, I walk for Bridget. I live for Bridget,"" her mother Karen said. Yet she has been told the speed her daughter is deteriorating means she will probably only have months to live. ""Mothers shouldn't have to bury their daughter, no mother should do that,"" she said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""Patient safety is always our priority. We want to make sure doctors give women the right information when prescribing these drugs â that's why the medicines regulator is already reviewing how effective measures to highlight these risks have been. ""We expect them to take further action if they find that more can be done."" An NHS Resolution spokesperson said: ""Where claims for clinical negligence are made they will be handled in the normal way and compensation paid where appropriate.""

Children's centres 'being undermined',"Children's centres are a lifeline for families, say campaigners Alka Dass, from High Wycombe, describes her local children's centre as ""a lifeline"". She says professional staff there helped bring her back from postnatal depression and grief after a family bereavement. But the centre, along with 35 others in Buckinghamshire, faces closure under acouncil plan to replace them with nine ""community hubs"" and save Â£3m a year. A new analysis by a children's charity accuses ministers of undermining England's network of children's centres and making them vulnerable to cuts and closures by cash-strapped local authorities. The Action for Children report focuses on the government's decision to suspend full Ofsted inspections of the centres in September 2015. Since then, almost 1,000 centres have been due for their five-yearly inspection - about a third of the total, says the charity. ""If these centres aren't inspected they are invisible and what that means is that it's much easier to close them,"" Action for Children chief executive Sir Tony Hawkhead told the BBC. He says the temporary suspension was originally meant to allow Ofsted to look at how it inspects children's centres and get its inspection framework and standards absolutely right for the 21st Century. In response, the Department for Education said it was determined to improve early years provision, adding that, despite the suspension of full inspections, ""robust and regular"" partial inspections, focusing on early education and childcare at the centres still take place. ""Local authorities which manage children's centres must also ensure that other services provided in the centres have appropriate safeguards in place,"" said a DfE spokeswoman. But after two-and-a-half years, there is no sign of full Ofsted inspections being resumed. ""While it continues to drag its feet, central government is letting down tens of thousands of children and families who need support now,"" said Sir Tony. ""It urgently needs to push through its overdue review of early years services so children's centres have clarity about how they should be working, what they should be achieving and the accountability framework they are working to. Alka Dass is helping lead a campaign to save Buckinghamshire's children's centres Ms Dass says a campaign to save the Buckinghamshire centres has huge local support, with more than 3,000 people signing a petition. She says having a children's centre close by in the weeks after the death of her mother and the birth of her son, was ""massively important"". ""I was quite lost in terms of where to go and not really sure of who I should be speaking to."" At the centre she says she was able to see professionals in a group, ""talking about going through postnatal depression and also the grief I had been through"". Without this support, she says, ""I am not sure how we would have coped and I am not sure we would have coped very well."" She says the clever thing about the centres is that they combine a social setting for parents and children with crucial services including health and developmental checks, mental health support and budgeting and parenting classes. ""I think people undermine the value of having a cup of tea. You are meeting other mothers and it helps with your child's confidence."" Sir Tony says running down the vital early help provided by children's centres is a false economy. ""In the end, we end up spending far more money on helping children at a later stage."" The centres give parents access to an array of experts and services In a statement, Ofsted confirmed that full inspections of children's centres were still suspended, adding that the policy was a matter for the DfE. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, said significant reductions in funding from central government would mean a Â£2bn shortfall for councils by 2020. ""Councils have been forced to redirect the funding that remains to protect those children at immediate risk of harm, leaving less money available for early help services such as children's centres,"" said Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board. Mr Watts agreed that it would be helpful for the government to review its expectations of children's services to make the best use of limited resources and boost social mobility. The DfE spokeswoman said the government had also ""invested Â£200m to develop new and better ways of delivering children's services to ensure they are high quality and meet the needs of families across the country"". ""We believe it is up to local councils to decide how to organise and commission services in their areas. ""They are best-placed to understand local needs and how best to meet them, whether using children's centre buildings, family hubs or delivering services through another model.""

The case for boots on the ground,"As he visits troops bolstering Nato's eastern border in Estonia in response to rising tensions with Russia, General Sir Nick Carter - the British army's top soldier - explains how the armed forces need to win support for their changing mission. Public support in Britain for the Army has been consistently strong. But General Carter says there are risks here as well as benefits. ""That public support,"" he says, ""is very much based upon sympathy and not necessarily upon empathy. ""And I think if we wish to sustain our numbers, and indeed the sort of attitude you would want your army to have, I think it's important that the cursor swings more towards empathy than sympathy, so that people understand more about what an army does and why you need an army, and therefore what its final task might be."" Of course the Army is about much more than that final task - ""closing with and engaging the enemy"". But the unpopularity of some of Britain's recent wars, the lack of understanding about military matters among much of the public, and the increasing sensitivity to casualties, have all meant that the term ""boots on the ground"" - putting soldiers into harm's way - has become almost toxic. General Carter has some sympathy with this view. ""I think the term 'boots on the ground' has become difficult for people to comprehend. ""The trick of course is for boots on the ground to be applied in a way that is not necessarily risk-free, but is done for appropriate gain and benefit."" This issue of the relationship between Britain and her army is a central aspect of General Carter's thinking. He is speaking at an Estonian army base in Tapa, a garrison town a little under 100 miles from the Russian border. The general is visiting the British-led multi-national battle group, which is there as part of a Nato deployment to reassure the Estonians and to demonstrate the alliance's cohesion to Moscow. British soldiers took part in a ceremony welcoming the Nato battalion to Estonia earlier this year ""Young people join an army to be used and that is important to us,"" he says. ""So the opportunity to do something like we are doing up here in Estonia is important. ""But we also need to be prepared to be used in other ways as well, providing we can be used in an effective fashion."" For the British army, this is a period of unprecedented change as it transitions away from a dominant focus on counter-insurgency operations in the heat of Iraq and Afghanistan, and re-builds its capability to fight modern high-intensity combat - the sort of conflict it trained for day-in and day-out during the Cold War years. The strategic picture is also changing dramatically. The potential threats are becoming more complex, the dividing line between peace and war ever less clear. Some people argue that the modern, Western way of war is at arm's-length - exemplified by armed drones and stand-off weapons fired at great distances from their intended targets. By such readings the traditional army - leaving aside maybe the special forces - seems strangely out of step with the apparent new reality. But General Carter disagrees. ""I don't subscribe to the view that we find ourselves in a new era of warfare where you can do it all with stand-off; you can do it all with bombing; you can do it all with special forces and you can do it all with proxies,"" he tells me emphatically. ""Those are all simply fallacies. The bottom line in all of this is that, in the final analysis, people live on land and it is ultimately the land component that has to 'mix it' where people live. History proves that that is a requirement. ""Our policy makers absolutely understand that you have an army because, in the final analysis, armies are the business when it comes to a decision, and ultimately it's about a decision."" Britain's army is of course an awful lot smaller than it once was. How big should it be in part depends upon what the country can afford. So does General Carter think that he has enough soldiers? ""The straightforward answer to that question is that given the tasks that we have currently got, we have adequate numbers,"" he says. ""If the tasks change or the tasks increase then we might have to ask questions about it."" On equipment he is confident that the Army will get things that it needs, though ""how quickly it arrives is always a question"". But the Army itself is going to change even more dramatically in the years ahead. And this too is something that General Carter is pushing forward. Traditionally the Army - like most others - is what he terms ""bottom-fed"". In other words, ""it recruits people who are youngsters and we grow them through a career"". Military personnel paraded on National Armed Forces Day But he believes that as the Army requires and takes on more specialists, it is going to have to offer a very different career structure. ""I suspect,"" he says, ""that maybe as much as 30% of the army may be specialists in the future - and how we supply those specialist career schemes is something we have to think about."" This could mean a lot more of what the Army calls ""lateral entry"" (ie joining at a much later age, probably from an established career) or indeed sharing people with industry. Nonetheless, at least in his lifetime, General Carter does not expect the combat arms of the Army ""to look particularly different"" to the way they do today. ""I think we will still deliver that effect through a bottom-fed delivery system in the way that we understand it."" But he says specialists will need to be recruited differently and that will have significant implications requiring a review of ranks, career structures, working practices and so on. General Carter thinks that the Army is about a year or two away from taking on regular personnel by this lateral entry method. But the core business of the Army is not going to change. While its roles go way beyond just training for high-intensity combat, as here in Estonia, it remains part of the nation's insurance policy. So being so close to the Russian border, what security challenge does the general worry about most? ""Probably the greatest risk at the moment,"" he says, ""is the risk of miscalculation.

Five questions on defence spending,"A distinguished group of former military top brass haswritten an open letter to the prime ministerwarning that Britain's security is at risk unless the armed forces are properly funded. The letter reflects concern right across the ranks. The list includes not just the ""old and the bold"" - retired admirals, generals and air marshals - but former colonels, corporals and academics, too. The reality is that defence is not always top of the list of voters' concerns at an election. These are some of the questions behind the letter: There's always the danger of crying wolf. But few would disagree that the world is dangerous. The letter cites risks from all over the globe - whether from hostile states or extremist groups. Ministers have long argued that Britain's armed forces are the envy of the world and that even outside the European Union they'll play an important role. Some have even suggested that defence and security could be the UK's trump card in the difficult negotiations. The implication being that Europe's own security would suffer if they turned their back on Britain. Those who've signed this letter are not so sure. Brexit has already made the pound weaker. The letter says its fall ""threatens the purchase of meaningful numbers of jets"" for the Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers. Almost $30bn (Â£22bn) worth of foreign military purchases planned by the MOD are exposed to currency fluctuations. That said, Britain is not leaving Nato - and it remains the cornerstone of European defence. The Nato alliance has set a target for its members to spend 2% of their national income, or GDP, on defence. Britain currently meets and is committed to that goal. In fact,Britain is one of the few Nato members to spend at least 2% on defence, according to the alliance's own figures. But MPs on the Commons Defence Committee say it'sbeen reached by ""creative accounting"",external. Those who've signed the letter put it more bluntly. They say it's a deception. In 2015, the government started adding several items of expenditure not previously included, such as military and civil service pensions, contributions to UN peacekeeping missions as well as much of the MOD's Â£1.4bn income. In the words of the letter ""most analysts now agree core defence expenditure for hard military power is well below 2%."" However, the calculations are entirely in accordance with Nato's own rules. It is true that defence spending rose this year. But it follows years of cuts. Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon says the lean years are behind us. He says the MOD is spending Â£178bnon new equipment - including new jets, warships, aircraft carriers and armoured vehicles. Though that money is being spent over the next 10 years and also includes the cost of renewing Britain's Trident weapons system. The Treasury used to help foot that bill. A number of recent reports also question whether the MOD's equipment programme has been fully funded. Earlier this year, the government spending watchdog, the National Audit Office, noted that billions of pounds of efficiencieshad not yet been identified,external. While those who've signed the letter praise the government's2015 Defence and Security Review,externalas setting ""the right path for our long term security"", they say it has not been fully funded. They cite another report by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee who said ""the affordability of the Equipment Plan is at greater risk than at any time since its inception"". Policy tracker: What the parties have promised Election questions, answered Britain's armed forces are now at their smallest since the Napoleonic wars. The size of the army alone has been cut from more than 100,000 to just 82,000. Even then, the army is struggling with recruitment and is still below its fully trained strength. The government would argue that, though smaller, the armed forces are now more capable. Investment has been made in new equipment from body armour to drones. But there are still significant gaps. For example, Royal Navy warships are no longer fitted with any anti-ship missiles. The Navy can't afford them. Some capabilities have been ""hollowed out"". While the Royal Navy will soon have two new aircraft carriers, it's still not clear how many jets the MOD will be able to afford. Or how many new warships will be built to protect them. Those who've signed the letter warn that the armed forces are ""having to seek further very damaging savings in manpower support and training"". The seats where parties are choosing to stand aside Where Britain's parties stand on Brexit The last coalition government accused Labour of leaving a Â£34bn black hole in the MOD's budget. It was the reason why the 2010 Defence Review resulted in such savage cuts. However, during his time as defence secretary, Philip Hammond claimed to have balanced the books. Under Sir Michael Fallon, though, the accounts are under significant pressure. The recentreport by the National Audit Officesaid there's now a real risk of a return to the ""previous practice where affordability could only be maintained by delaying or reducing the cost of projects"". It's probably too early to say whether there's now a new black hole in the MODs accounts. But some estimate a gap of at least Â£10bn and growing. This is by no means the first time that former senior military officers have warned of a crisis in defence. But it's still not clear whether those concerns are shared by the voters, and whether defence features much in the general election.

'World's richest 1% get 82% of the wealth',"The gap between the super rich and the rest of the world widened last year as wealth continued to be owned by a small minority, Oxfam has claimed. Some 82% of money generated last year went to the richest 1% of the global population while the poorest half saw no increase at all, the charity said. Oxfam said its figures - which critics have queried - showed a failing system. It blamed tax evasion, firms' influence on policy, erosion of workers' rights, and cost cutting for the widening gap. Oxfam has produced similar reports for the past five years. In 2017 it calculated that the world's eight richest individuals had as much wealth as the poorest halfof the world. This year, it said 42 people now had as much wealth as the poorest half, but it revised last year's figure to 61. Oxfam said the revision was due to improved data and said the trend of ""widening inequality"" remained. Oxfam chief executive Mark Goldring said its constant readjustment of the figures reflected the fact that the report was based ""on the best data available at the time"". ""However you look at it, this is an unacceptable level of inequality,"" he said. Oxfam's report coincides with the start of the World Economic Forum in Davos, a Swiss ski resort. The annual conference attracts many of the world's top political and business leaders. Inequality typically features high on the agenda, but Mr Goldring said that too often ""tough talk fades away at the first resistance"". It's really hard working out how much wealth the super-rich and the very poor have. The super-rich tend not to publicise their worth and many of the world's poorest countries keep poor statistics. To illustrate that, this time last year, Oxfam told us that eight individuals have as much wealth as the poorest half of the world's population. Now it has revised that figure to 61 people for last year, falling to 42 people this year - that's a pretty big revision. And there are other caveats around the data on which all this is based, such as that the people on the list with the lowest wealth are not necessarily poor at all - they may be highly qualified professionals with large amounts of student debt, for example, or people with high incomes but enormous mortgages. But whether it's eight people, 42 people or 61 people who have the same wealth as half of the world, there is still great wealth inequality around the world, which is the message Oxfam is taking to Davos. The charity is urging a rethink of business models, arguing their focus on maximising shareholder returns over broader social impact is wrong. It said there was ""huge support"" for action with two thirds (72%) of 70,000 people it surveyed in ten countries saying they wanted their governments to ""urgently address the income gap between rich and poor"". But Mark Littlewood, director general at free market think tank The Institute of Economic Affairs, said Oxfam was becoming ""obsessed with the rich rather than the poor"". ""Higher taxes and redistribution will do nothing to help the poor; wealth is not a fixed pie. Richer people are also highly taxed people - reducing their wealth won't lead to redistribution, it will destroy it to the benefit of no one,"" he added. It was a criticism echoed by Sam Dumitriu, head of research at another free market think tank - the Adam Smith Institute - who said the charity's inequality stats ""always paint the wrong picture"". ""In reality, global inequality has fallen massively over the past few decades. ""As China, India and Vietnam embraced neoliberal reforms that enforce property rights, reduce regulations and increase competition, the world's poorest have received a massive pay rise leading to a more equal global income distribution."" Oxfam's report is based on data from Forbes and the annualCredit Suisse Global Wealth databook,,externalwhich gives the distribution of global wealth going back to 2000. The survey uses the value of an individual's assets, mainly property and land, minus debts, to determine what he or she ""owns"". The data excludes wages or income. The methodology has been criticised as it means that a student with high debts, but with high future earning potential, for example, would be considered poor under the criteria used. But Oxfam said even if the wealth of the poorest half of the world was recalculated to exclude people in net debt their combined wealth was still equal to that of just 128 billionaires.

"Children's centres 'being undermined'Hundreds of centres have not faced full inspections in five years, says Action for Children.5h5 hours agoFamily & Education","Children's centres are a lifeline for families, say campaigners Alka Dass, from High Wycombe, describes her local children's centre as ""a lifeline"". She says professional staff there helped bring her back from postnatal depression and grief after a family bereavement. But the centre, along with 35 others in Buckinghamshire, faces closure under acouncil plan to replace them with nine ""community hubs"" and save Â£3m a year. A new analysis by a children's charity accuses ministers of undermining England's network of children's centres and making them vulnerable to cuts and closures by cash-strapped local authorities. The Action for Children report focuses on the government's decision to suspend full Ofsted inspections of the centres in September 2015. Since then, almost 1,000 centres have been due for their five-yearly inspection - about a third of the total, says the charity. ""If these centres aren't inspected they are invisible and what that means is that it's much easier to close them,"" Action for Children chief executive Sir Tony Hawkhead told the BBC. He says the temporary suspension was originally meant to allow Ofsted to look at how it inspects children's centres and get its inspection framework and standards absolutely right for the 21st Century. In response, the Department for Education said it was determined to improve early years provision, adding that, despite the suspension of full inspections, ""robust and regular"" partial inspections, focusing on early education and childcare at the centres still take place. ""Local authorities which manage children's centres must also ensure that other services provided in the centres have appropriate safeguards in place,"" said a DfE spokeswoman. But after two-and-a-half years, there is no sign of full Ofsted inspections being resumed. ""While it continues to drag its feet, central government is letting down tens of thousands of children and families who need support now,"" said Sir Tony. ""It urgently needs to push through its overdue review of early years services so children's centres have clarity about how they should be working, what they should be achieving and the accountability framework they are working to. Alka Dass is helping lead a campaign to save Buckinghamshire's children's centres Ms Dass says a campaign to save the Buckinghamshire centres has huge local support, with more than 3,000 people signing a petition. She says having a children's centre close by in the weeks after the death of her mother and the birth of her son, was ""massively important"". ""I was quite lost in terms of where to go and not really sure of who I should be speaking to."" At the centre she says she was able to see professionals in a group, ""talking about going through postnatal depression and also the grief I had been through"". Without this support, she says, ""I am not sure how we would have coped and I am not sure we would have coped very well."" She says the clever thing about the centres is that they combine a social setting for parents and children with crucial services including health and developmental checks, mental health support and budgeting and parenting classes. ""I think people undermine the value of having a cup of tea. You are meeting other mothers and it helps with your child's confidence."" Sir Tony says running down the vital early help provided by children's centres is a false economy. ""In the end, we end up spending far more money on helping children at a later stage."" The centres give parents access to an array of experts and services In a statement, Ofsted confirmed that full inspections of children's centres were still suspended, adding that the policy was a matter for the DfE. The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, said significant reductions in funding from central government would mean a Â£2bn shortfall for councils by 2020. ""Councils have been forced to redirect the funding that remains to protect those children at immediate risk of harm, leaving less money available for early help services such as children's centres,"" said Richard Watts, chairman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board. Mr Watts agreed that it would be helpful for the government to review its expectations of children's services to make the best use of limited resources and boost social mobility. The DfE spokeswoman said the government had also ""invested Â£200m to develop new and better ways of delivering children's services to ensure they are high quality and meet the needs of families across the country"". ""We believe it is up to local councils to decide how to organise and commission services in their areas. ""They are best-placed to understand local needs and how best to meet them, whether using children's centre buildings, family hubs or delivering services through another model.""

'My husband was murdered for loving me'Kausalya testified against her parents for murder and is fighting to stop all caste discrimination.6h6 hours agoIndia,"In March 2016, a 22-year-old man was hacked to death in daylight on a crowded road in southern India for marrying a woman of a higher caste. His wife survived the attack and went on to testify against her parents and campaign against the scourge of caste, as the BBC's Soutik Biswas reports. On the last day of his life, Shankar and Kausalya woke up around nine in the morning in their village hut. They had been married eight months. It was Sunday, and they travelled in a public bus to a local market in Udumalpet, some 14km (8.6 miles) away. They wanted to shop for new clothes for Shankar, who had to attend a function at his college the next day. The sun was beating down hard when they entered a clothes shop. She spotted a pink shirt and thought her husband would look good in it. As they walked out, Shankar spotted a mannequin in the shop window wearing a green shirt. ""I think I like this shirt better,"" he said. They walked back in again, exchanged the pink for the green, stepped out of the shop and began crossing a crowded road on their way back to take a bus home.  But first, Shankar told Kausalya, he would like to treat her to her favourite chilli snack. ""Another day,"" Kausalya said. She had only sixty rupees (94 cents; 68p) in her purse, and they couldn't afford it. So they decided to return home, where Shankar promised to cook her a special meal. CCTV footage showed the couple walking briskly towards the road. But before they could cross, five men, riding on two bikes, halted behind them. Four of the men sauntered up to the couple and attacked them with long knives. The casualness with which the murderers fell upon them was chilling. They slashed the couple as if they were pruning bushes. CCTV footage broadcast on Indian television channels showed the couple walking on a busy street when they were attacked Bleeding profusely, Shankar scrambled to run away. Kausalya limped towards a stationary SUV, when she was felled again by her assailants. It was all over in 36 seconds.  The men returned to their motorcycles and left leisurely as a crowd began to collect. (The police later found six people came on three bikes, two bearing false number plates. Five of them attacked the couple, while one man kept watch.) An ambulance arrived soon and scooped the couple off the blooded-slicked tarmac. On the way to the hospital, 60km away, the medic inexplicably sat in the front seat. On the metal stretcher, Kausalya, her vision blurring, held the IV drip. Shankar lay still. ""Rest your head on my chest,"" he rasped. Kausalya moved to his side. Minutes later, as the ambulance entered the hospital, Shankar stopped breathing. Six face death penalty for Dalit murder What is India's caste system? The rage and hatred behind a public murder Autopsy surgeons found 34 cuts and stab wounds on Shankar's ""moderately nourished body"". He had died of ""shock and haemorrhage due to multiple cuts and stab injuries"". Kausalya spent 20 days in the hospital, her face swathed in bandages, and waiting for 36 stitches to heal and a bone fracture to repair. She told the police from the hospital bed that her parents were responsible for the attack. ""Why did you love him?"" one of the attackers kept shouting as he stabbed her. ""Why?"" Shankar and Kausalya had broken what writer Arundhati Roy, in her Booker-prize winning novel, The God of Small Things, described as ""Love Laws"" that ""lay down who should be loved â¦ And how â¦ And how much"". An image of Kausalya sitting up in her hospital bed with bloodied bandages went viral in India Shankar was a Dalit (formerly known as untouchable), and the son of a landless daily wage farm worker, who lived in a single room hut with four family members in Kumaralingam village. Kausalya came from a relatively influential Thevar caste, the daughter of a 38-year-old money lender and taxi operator, who lived in a two-storey house in Palani, a small town. When she told her parents she wanted to become an air-hostess, they rejected the idea ""saying I would have to wear short skirts."" After she finished school in 2014, they took her to a family temple to meet men they wanted her to marry. When she refused, they sent her to her a private college to study computer science and engineering. She hated college. ""There were too many restrictions. We could not venture outside the campus. We could not talk to the boys. Male and female students sat separately in the classroom. On the college bus, we sat in different sections. If the security saw us talking to the boys, they would inform our parents. It was very stifling."" But love can happen even in the unlikeliest of places. At the college freshers function, a lanky engineering student walked up to her, introduced himself as Shankar and asked her, ""Are you in love with anyone?"" Kausalya says she didn't answer and walked away, feeling embarrassed. The next day, Shankar went up to her and qualified the unanswered question: ""Are you in love with anyone because I think I love you."" She slunk away again. On the third day, when Shankar again walked up to her, she told him to ""look for another girl"". ""People will know if we go out. It will be difficult to know you,"" she said. She began warming to him slowly though. Shankar had stopped telling her that he loved her, so ""we behaved like ""respectful friends"". ""I also didn't tell him I loved him, but over time it crept up on me"". It was hard-earned love. Since she couldn't step outside her home alone to speak on the phone, they exchanged WhatsApp messages on their college bus rides.  Every day, for 18 months, they exchanged  texts. They spoke about their hopes and dreams. ""I have two dreams,"" he texted her one day. ""Build a proper house for the family. And love you forever."" In her second year, she signed up for Japanese language classes, so she could stay beyond college hours and take a public bus home. Shankar would wait for her, and they began chatting on the bus. But one day in July 2015 the bus conductor saw them chatting, found out where Kausalya lived and informed her mother. The same evening, her parents took away her phone, called up Shankar and warned him to stay away from their daughter. They told her that Shankar would ""make her pregnant and run away"". The next day, they took her out of college. Was Delhi gang rape India's #Metoo moment? The Indian woman using her body to fight for equality The woman who collects clothes of sex assault victims Champion granny first picked up a gun at 60 The India child bride who became a wrestling champion She cried all night and woke up next morning in an empty house - her parents had gone out. She looked for her phone, found it, and called Shankar to tell him about the fight with her parents. She asked him whether he planned to make her pregnant and run away. ""If you feel that way, we can run away right now, and get married,"" Shankar said. Kausalya packed a bag, left home and went to the local bus stop. The next day, on 12 July 2015, they went to a temple and got married. Then they went to the local police station, reported their inter-caste marriage and sought protection. Dalits and tribes-people bear the brunt of caste brutality in Tamil Nadu: there were more than 1,700 reported crimes against them that year alone. Kausalya father (right) was sentenced to death, and her mother acquitted by the court The next eight months, says Kausalya, were ""the freest, happiest time"" of her life. She moved to Shankar's hut - which they shared with his father, two brothers and his grandmother - dropped out of college, and began work as a salesgirl, earning a monthly salary of 5,000 rupees. Her parents and relatives tried hard to separate them: they filed a police complaint saying Shankar had kidnapped their daughter; and a week after her marriage, abducted her and took her to shamans and priests who smeared ash on her face and force-fed her potions, pressuring her to leave her husband. Exhausted, they finally gave up and Shankar took her home. Then her parents offered Shankar a million rupees to leave Kausalya. A week before the murder, Kausalya says, her parents visited their home and ordered her to come with them. She refused to budge. ""If something happens to you after today, we are not responsible,"" her father told her, before leaving. Police found Kausalya's father had hired five men with previous criminal records for 50,000 rupees to kill his daughter and son-in-law in broad daylight ""to send out a public message"" about what happens when a woman falls in love with a lower-caste man. There were 120 witnesses to the murder. Kausalya herself opposed the bail of her parents 58 times in the court. ""My mother threatened me repeatedly that she would kill me. She told me I was better off dead than married to him,"" Kausalya told the judge. Kaushlaya practises a drum traditionally played by Dalits In December, Judge Alamelu Natarajan sentenced six men, including Kausalya's father, to death. Her mother was acquitted along with two others. Kausalya is set to appeal against the acquittal, as she believes her mother was equally guilty. There was a time after Shankar's murder, she said, she would break down frequently, and wanted to take her life. Then she cut her hair short, began learning karate, and reading books on caste.

YouTube denies it should be regulatedSpeaking to Newsbeat its chief business officer says it shouldn't have to stick to rules set by external regulators.1han hour agoNewsbeat,"YouTube has denied its content should be regulated in a way similar to traditional broadcasters. Speaking to Newsbeat, the platform's chief business officer says the site is ""different"" and doesn't have the same ""editorial hand"" broadcasters have. The Google-owned company is about to launch its first original UK-based production on its ad-supported platform, fronted by Jack Whitehall. It will be produced by James Corden and the team behind his US talk show. YouTube's Robert Kyncl has insisted in a rare interview: ""We're not content creators; we're a platform that distributes the content"". There were calls for YouTube to be regulated after a vlog by Logan Paul - one of its biggest stars -showed the bodyof a man who appeared to have killed himself. A screengrab from the video posted by Logan Paul in Japan's Aokigahara forest The upload broke YouTube's community guidelines and the company says it'sputting in measuresto ensure a video like that is never uploaded again. In the UK, licensed broadcasters have to stick to rules set by the regulatorOfcom,external, but YouTube insists it's an open platform. ""It doesn't absolve us of responsibility, we actually take that very seriously,"" Kyncl says. The site's community guidelines act as the ""standards which are a guide on how to behave on YouTube,"" he adds. He also says YouTube's committed to hiring ""up to 10,000"" more people to monitor controversial content - and insists the site is ""constantly evolving"" to cope with new problems. ""The steps we're taking are not steps any government is asking us to do, these are the steps we're choosing to do because we believe that is the right thing to do."" Robert Kyncl admits monitoring an open site is ""one of the hardest things you can do"" but says it's worth doing properly ""because openness brings so many great benefits"". Original programming on the site - like the new comedy Training Days, focusing on what famous footballers get up to when they train - is going to increase. Demi Lovato's documentary Simply Complicated was broadcast on YouTube in 2017 Last year it broadcast Demi Lovato's documentary Simply Complicated, as well as Katy Perry's Witness Worldwide, a Big Brother-style four-day exclusive stream. Kyncl says it's using shows like that to ""drive more interest to YouTube to benefit content creators."" Working with James Corden and his team is no surprise after the success his Late Late Show's Carpool Karaoke feature has had on YouTube. The segment with Adele has had more than 175m views.

Its success ""surprised everybody"" admits Kyncl, who says: ""James is incredibly thoughtful to make sure his show works both on TV and on YouTube"". In 2016, Apple Music bought the rights to a Carpool Karaoke spin-off that YouTube had turned down. ""We figured we already have Carpool Karaoke so we don't need another one,"" Kyncl explains. ""It would be pretty hard to beat the one we already have. It didn't make sense for us - but it made sense for Apple."" Last year was ""difficult"", the company wrotein a blog post,external. There were issues with some of its biggest creators - not just with Logan Paul - but others like PewDiePie who wasaccused of using""a racial slur"". Investigations also revealed that ads for big brands were being regularly shown on racist videos or those that encouraged violence. Brands boycotted the site and pulled sponsorship. YouTube then announced it was going tomake it harderto make money from vlogs. Clips will no longer have adverts attached unless the publisher meets two criteria - that they have: at least 1,000 subscribers more than 4,000 hours of their content viewed by others within the past 12 months Some vloggers criticised the announcement, believing it punishes smaller channels. It's one of the steps YouTube is taking to regulate itself - by continuing to change its guidelines as the platform grows. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He says it's an ""important step"" that will help tackle abuse as when YouTube shuts down a channel for abuse, a new one could be created instantly - and monetised. ""We're protecting the advertiser and we're protecting creators earning a living on YouTube,"" he says. ""We have to make sure we protect both and this gives us the time to do that.""

UKIP deputy resigns in protest to Bolton,"This video can not be played Henry Bolton says he will not be quitting as UKIP leader, adding: ""It is time to drain the swamp"". Henry Bolton has insisted he will not quit as UKIP leader, saying it is ""time to drain the swamp"" of malcontents within the party. He said UKIP's national executive committee, which passed a vote of no confidence in him, was ""not fit for purpose"" and must be reformed. Speaking in Folkestone, he urged UKIP to put an end to factional infighting. It came after 14 senior figures quit their roles, including Mr Bolton's deputy and assistant deputy. Who is Henry Bolton? Hamilton: Bolton should go UKIP leader splits with partner after texts Former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Bolton had been ""pretty stupid"" in the way he had handled the media over claims about his private life. But he said he was ""very pleased"" that the leader was pushing for changes to the party's constitution and the national executive committee, which he said were long overdue. ""If UKIP doesn't change it will not exist in 18 months time,"" he said on his LBC radio show. He said he will ""wait to see"" Henry Bolton's proposals to reform UKIP, before deciding whether to back him staying on as leader. In an interview with Mr Farage, Mr Bolton hit out at those who had quit, saying: ""If they had any interest in the party they would be continuing their jobs - their resignations achieve nothing in that respect."" Asked how he was coping with the media attention, Mr Bolton said: ""In some ways I am enjoying navigating through all this."" UKIP's local government, education, trade and immigration spokesmen have all resigned as Mr Bolton defied growing calls to quit over offensive texts sent by his ex-girlfriend. Nigel Farage has called for reform of the NEC in the past Ex-education spokesman David Kurten said he believed Mr Bolton had ""no chance of surviving"" a vote of party members, saying he did not know what the leader ""hoped to achieve"" by staying on. In a statement to the media, Mr Bolton said he ""respected"" the party's constitutional process, which will see party members decide his future in the coming weeks. But he said the decision to force a vote was a ""distraction"" from what should be the party's focus on May's local elections and achieving ""true independence"" for the UK after Brexit. ""I repeat I shall not be resigning as party leader."" He said he had lost confidence in the NEC, which he said was unable to take the party forward and whose shortcomings he suggested had been recognised by previous leaders. ""The NEC requires significant and urgent reform. To that end, again during the coming weeks, I shall be proposing a new party constitution, with a newly constituted and reformed NEC. ""Likewise, it is now time to put an end to the factional in-fighting within the party and to remove those who have been a part of that. In a single phrase, it is time to 'Drain the Swamp'."" Mr Bolton, who has been under pressure over some of his former girlfriend's comments, has said another leadership contest could be financially ruinous for the party, which has staged three contests in the last 18 months. He has also said he has ended the ""romantic element"" of his relationship with Jo Marney after it emerged that in the past she had sent a text saying Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle would ""taint"" the Royal Family, leading to accusations of racism. Nigel Farage was succeeded as UKIP leader by Diane James - he then took over as interim leader when she quit Nigel Farage: UKIP's long-serving leader announced his resignation on 4 July 2016, saying his ""political ambition has been achieved"" by the Brexit vote Diane James: Lasted less than three weeks after being elected in September 2016 Nigel Farage: Returned as interim leader in October 2016 Paul Nuttall: Elected on 28 November 2016, but quit the following June after UKIP's general election collapse Henry Bolton: Elected on 29 September. Is facing resignations and a vote of no confidence But Mr Bolton has so far failed to convince many of the senior figures in the party - with the NEC's vote of no confidence in him on Sunday followed by a series of resignations on Monday. In his resignation letter as trade spokesman William Dartmouth, a South West England MEP, told Mr Bolton his position was ""untenable"". ""When you became leader you said that you would make the party successful,"" he said. ""If you still feel that way then you should resign forthwith."" Deputy leader Margot Parker, who is an East Midlands MEP, said Mr Bolton's ""personal life took over the job he was elected to do"". Mr Bolton said he split with his girlfriend Jo Marney after the 25-year-old's texts about Meghan Markle came to light She added: ""It would be quicker and cleaner if he came to the conclusion he could go sooner rather than later. ""This is taking time away from doing the job. This puts the party in a limbo situation."" She told Mr Farage, on his LBC programme ""It's a pretty wacky situation we find ourselves in"" and his questioning of his colleagues' loyalty was ""outrageous"". NEC member Paul Oakley told Mr Farage the party had already lost patience with Mr Bolton before the stories about his private life, adding: ""His handling of the media was absolutely atrocious"". Following the vote of no confidence party members who turn up to the EGM will given a vote on whether Mr Bolton should remain in post. UKIP, which has long campaigned to leave the EU, came top in the 2014 European elections and got the third largest vote share in the 2015 general election with 12.6% - but this plummeted to 1.8% in June - the first general election since the UK voted for Brexit.

US Senate struggles to end budget deadlock,"This video can not be played Republican Leader Senator Mitch McConnell accused the Democrats of ""irresponsible political games"" US senators are struggling to agree on a bill to fund the government, which is in its second day of shutdown. A Senate session session adjourned late on Sunday and a vote has been postponed to midday (17:00 GMT) on Monday. Democratic and Republican senators have so far traded blame for the shutdown. Democrats want President Trump to negotiate over immigration as part of a budget deal, but Republicans say no deal is possible while federal government services are closed. Mr Trump has called for a simple majority vote to end the impasse. Under Senate rules, the bill needs 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to overcome blocking tactics by opponents. The Republicans currently have 51 senators and would need some Democratic support to pass a budget. But Mr Trump said the ""nuclear option"" of a simple-majority vote was necessary.

The initial vote on a bill to fund the government until 8 February had been scheduled for 01:00 on Monday (06:00 GMT). But it was postponed as Sunday's session ended. On Monday the closure of many federal services will be felt around the country and hundreds of thousands of federal staff face unpaid leave. The last government shutdown was in 2013, and lasted for 16 days. This is the first time a government shutdown has happened while one party, the Republicans, controls both Congress and the White House. Friday's vote fell 50-49, far short of the 60 needed to advance the bill. Democrats have demanded protection from deportation of more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children. ""I hope it is just a matter of hours or days. But we need to have a substantive answer, and the only person who can lead us to that is President Trump. This is his shutdown,"" Democratic Senator Dick Durbin told the CBS network. Republicans want funding for border security - including the border wall - and immigration reforms, as well as increased military spending. Speaking to US troops in the Middle East, Vice-President Mike Pence reiterated his party's stance. ""We're not going to reopen negotiations on illegal immigration until they reopen the government and give you, our soldiers and your families, the benefits and wages you've earned,"" he said. This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown The US budget must be approved by 1 October - the start of the federal financial year. But Congress has often failed to meet this deadline and negotiations continue well into the new year, with the previous year's funding to federal agencies extended on a temporary basis. Because Congress failed to agree an extension, many federal agencies effectively closed for business as of 00:01 on Saturday (05:01 GMT). Most staff in the departments of housing, environment, education and commerce will be staying at home on Monday.,externalHalf of workers in the treasury, health, defence and transportation departments will also not be going to work. This video can not be played Government workers on what happens during a shutdown But essential services that protect ""life or human property"" will continue, including national security, postal services, air traffic control, inpatient medical services, emergency outpatient medicine, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity generation. And the Trump administration said it planned to keep national parks open - their closure in the 2013 shutdown provoked an angry public reaction. Why the US government has shut down The shutdown began on the first anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. His trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week has also been called into question. Many federal employees were forced to take a leave of absence - officially known as being furloughed - during the 16 days of shutdown. It cost the government $2bn in lost productivity andled to ""significant negative effects on the economy"", the OMB said at the time.,external Museums have already been closed Donald Trump laid the blame for the shutdown with the then president, Barack Obama.,external Federal workers cannot get paid for days worked during a lapse in funding.

'My husband was murdered for loving me',"In March 2016, a 22-year-old man was hacked to death in daylight on a crowded road in southern India for marrying a woman of a higher caste. His wife survived the attack and went on to testify against her parents and campaign against the scourge of caste, as the BBC's Soutik Biswas reports. On the last day of his life, Shankar and Kausalya woke up around nine in the morning in their village hut. They had been married eight months. It was Sunday, and they travelled in a public bus to a local market in Udumalpet, some 14km (8.6 miles) away. They wanted to shop for new clothes for Shankar, who had to attend a function at his college the next day. The sun was beating down hard when they entered a clothes shop. She spotted a pink shirt and thought her husband would look good in it. As they walked out, Shankar spotted a mannequin in the shop window wearing a green shirt. ""I think I like this shirt better,"" he said. They walked back in again, exchanged the pink for the green, stepped out of the shop and began crossing a crowded road on their way back to take a bus home.  But first, Shankar told Kausalya, he would like to treat her to her favourite chilli snack. ""Another day,"" Kausalya said. She had only sixty rupees (94 cents; 68p) in her purse, and they couldn't afford it. So they decided to return home, where Shankar promised to cook her a special meal. CCTV footage showed the couple walking briskly towards the road. But before they could cross, five men, riding on two bikes, halted behind them. Four of the men sauntered up to the couple and attacked them with long knives. The casualness with which the murderers fell upon them was chilling. They slashed the couple as if they were pruning bushes. CCTV footage broadcast on Indian television channels showed the couple walking on a busy street when they were attacked Bleeding profusely, Shankar scrambled to run away. Kausalya limped towards a stationary SUV, when she was felled again by her assailants. It was all over in 36 seconds.  The men returned to their motorcycles and left leisurely as a crowd began to collect. (The police later found six people came on three bikes, two bearing false number plates. Five of them attacked the couple, while one man kept watch.) An ambulance arrived soon and scooped the couple off the blooded-slicked tarmac. On the way to the hospital, 60km away, the medic inexplicably sat in the front seat. On the metal stretcher, Kausalya, her vision blurring, held the IV drip. Shankar lay still. ""Rest your head on my chest,"" he rasped. Kausalya moved to his side. Minutes later, as the ambulance entered the hospital, Shankar stopped breathing. Six face death penalty for Dalit murder What is India's caste system? The rage and hatred behind a public murder Autopsy surgeons found 34 cuts and stab wounds on Shankar's ""moderately nourished body"". He had died of ""shock and haemorrhage due to multiple cuts and stab injuries"". Kausalya spent 20 days in the hospital, her face swathed in bandages, and waiting for 36 stitches to heal and a bone fracture to repair. She told the police from the hospital bed that her parents were responsible for the attack. ""Why did you love him?"" one of the attackers kept shouting as he stabbed her. ""Why?"" Shankar and Kausalya had broken what writer Arundhati Roy, in her Booker-prize winning novel, The God of Small Things, described as ""Love Laws"" that ""lay down who should be loved â¦ And how â¦ And how much"". An image of Kausalya sitting up in her hospital bed with bloodied bandages went viral in India Shankar was a Dalit (formerly known as untouchable), and the son of a landless daily wage farm worker, who lived in a single room hut with four family members in Kumaralingam village. Kausalya came from a relatively influential Thevar caste, the daughter of a 38-year-old money lender and taxi operator, who lived in a two-storey house in Palani, a small town. When she told her parents she wanted to become an air-hostess, they rejected the idea ""saying I would have to wear short skirts."" After she finished school in 2014, they took her to a family temple to meet men they wanted her to marry. When she refused, they sent her to her a private college to study computer science and engineering. She hated college. ""There were too many restrictions. We could not venture outside the campus. We could not talk to the boys. Male and female students sat separately in the classroom. On the college bus, we sat in different sections. If the security saw us talking to the boys, they would inform our parents. It was very stifling."" But love can happen even in the unlikeliest of places. At the college freshers function, a lanky engineering student walked up to her, introduced himself as Shankar and asked her, ""Are you in love with anyone?"" Kausalya says she didn't answer and walked away, feeling embarrassed. The next day, Shankar went up to her and qualified the unanswered question: ""Are you in love with anyone because I think I love you."" She slunk away again. On the third day, when Shankar again walked up to her, she told him to ""look for another girl"". ""People will know if we go out. It will be difficult to know you,"" she said. She began warming to him slowly though. Shankar had stopped telling her that he loved her, so ""we behaved like ""respectful friends"". ""I also didn't tell him I loved him, but over time it crept up on me"". It was hard-earned love. Since she couldn't step outside her home alone to speak on the phone, they exchanged WhatsApp messages on their college bus rides.  Every day, for 18 months, they exchanged  texts. They spoke about their hopes and dreams. ""I have two dreams,"" he texted her one day. ""Build a proper house for the family. And love you forever."" In her second year, she signed up for Japanese language classes, so she could stay beyond college hours and take a public bus home. Shankar would wait for her, and they began chatting on the bus. But one day in July 2015 the bus conductor saw them chatting, found out where Kausalya lived and informed her mother. The same evening, her parents took away her phone, called up Shankar and warned him to stay away from their daughter. They told her that Shankar would ""make her pregnant and run away"". The next day, they took her out of college. Was Delhi gang rape India's #Metoo moment? The Indian woman using her body to fight for equality The woman who collects clothes of sex assault victims Champion granny first picked up a gun at 60 The India child bride who became a wrestling champion She cried all night and woke up next morning in an empty house - her parents had gone out. She looked for her phone, found it, and called Shankar to tell him about the fight with her parents. She asked him whether he planned to make her pregnant and run away. ""If you feel that way, we can run away right now, and get married,"" Shankar said. Kausalya packed a bag, left home and went to the local bus stop. The next day, on 12 July 2015, they went to a temple and got married. Then they went to the local police station, reported their inter-caste marriage and sought protection. Dalits and tribes-people bear the brunt of caste brutality in Tamil Nadu: there were more than 1,700 reported crimes against them that year alone. Kausalya father (right) was sentenced to death, and her mother acquitted by the court The next eight months, says Kausalya, were ""the freest, happiest time"" of her life. She moved to Shankar's hut - which they shared with his father, two brothers and his grandmother - dropped out of college, and began work as a salesgirl, earning a monthly salary of 5,000 rupees. Her parents and relatives tried hard to separate them: they filed a police complaint saying Shankar had kidnapped their daughter; and a week after her marriage, abducted her and took her to shamans and priests who smeared ash on her face and force-fed her potions, pressuring her to leave her husband. Exhausted, they finally gave up and Shankar took her home. Then her parents offered Shankar a million rupees to leave Kausalya. A week before the murder, Kausalya says, her parents visited their home and ordered her to come with them. She refused to budge. ""If something happens to you after today, we are not responsible,"" her father told her, before leaving. Police found Kausalya's father had hired five men with previous criminal records for 50,000 rupees to kill his daughter and son-in-law in broad daylight ""to send out a public message"" about what happens when a woman falls in love with a lower-caste man. There were 120 witnesses to the murder. Kausalya herself opposed the bail of her parents 58 times in the court. ""My mother threatened me repeatedly that she would kill me. She told me I was better off dead than married to him,"" Kausalya told the judge. Kaushlaya practises a drum traditionally played by Dalits In December, Judge Alamelu Natarajan sentenced six men, including Kausalya's father, to death. Her mother was acquitted along with two others. Kausalya is set to appeal against the acquittal, as she believes her mother was equally guilty. There was a time after Shankar's murder, she said, she would break down frequently, and wanted to take her life. Then she cut her hair short, began learning karate, and reading books on caste. She began meeting anti-caste groups and speaking out against caste crimes. She also learned to play the parai, a drum traditionally played by Dalits. Today, she has realised Shankar's dream by constructing a four-room house for his family from the compensation she received from the government, and started a tuition centre for poor students in the village. To run the family, she has taken a clerk's job in a government office.  At weekends, she travels all over Tamil Nadu, speaking at meetings against caste, honour killings and emphasising the ""importance of love"". ""Love is like water, it is a natural thing,"" she says. ""Love happens. And women have to revolt against the caste system, if it has to be stopped."" Many don't like her campaign and post death threats on her Facebook wall, so she has been given police security. After Shankar died, doctors handed his phone over to her. It contains many fond memories of their courtship. ""I don't know what to say, but I miss you,"" Shankar had texted her on a summer evening in 2015. ""Me too,"" she had replied.

US Senate struggles to end budget deadlockThe senators are trying to reach a deal on spending and immigration ahead of a vote on Monday.2h2 hours agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played Republican Leader Senator Mitch McConnell accused the Democrats of ""irresponsible political games"" US senators are struggling to agree on a bill to fund the government, which is in its second day of shutdown. A Senate session session adjourned late on Sunday and a vote has been postponed to midday (17:00 GMT) on Monday. Democratic and Republican senators have so far traded blame for the shutdown. Democrats want President Trump to negotiate over immigration as part of a budget deal, but Republicans say no deal is possible while federal government services are closed. Mr Trump has called for a simple majority vote to end the impasse. Under Senate rules, the bill needs 60 votes in the 100-member chamber to overcome blocking tactics by opponents. The Republicans currently have 51 senators and would need some Democratic support to pass a budget. But Mr Trump said the ""nuclear option"" of a simple-majority vote was necessary.

The initial vote on a bill to fund the government until 8 February had been scheduled for 01:00 on Monday (06:00 GMT). But it was postponed as Sunday's session ended. On Monday the closure of many federal services will be felt around the country and hundreds of thousands of federal staff face unpaid leave. The last government shutdown was in 2013, and lasted for 16 days. This is the first time a government shutdown has happened while one party, the Republicans, controls both Congress and the White House. Friday's vote fell 50-49, far short of the 60 needed to advance the bill. Democrats have demanded protection from deportation of more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children. ""I hope it is just a matter of hours or days. But we need to have a substantive answer, and the only person who can lead us to that is President Trump. This is his shutdown,"" Democratic Senator Dick Durbin told the CBS network. Republicans want funding for border security - including the border wall - and immigration reforms, as well as increased military spending. Speaking to US troops in the Middle East, Vice-President Mike Pence reiterated his party's stance. ""We're not going to reopen negotiations on illegal immigration until they reopen the government and give you, our soldiers and your families, the benefits and wages you've earned,"" he said. This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown The US budget must be approved by 1 October - the start of the federal financial year. But Congress has often failed to meet this deadline and negotiations continue well into the new year, with the previous year's funding to federal agencies extended on a temporary basis. Because Congress failed to agree an extension, many federal agencies effectively closed for business as of 00:01 on Saturday (05:01 GMT). Most staff in the departments of housing, environment, education and commerce will be staying at home on Monday.,externalHalf of workers in the treasury, health, defence and transportation departments will also not be going to work. This video can not be played Government workers on what happens during a shutdown But essential services that protect ""life or human property"" will continue, including national security, postal services, air traffic control, inpatient medical services, emergency outpatient medicine, disaster assistance, prisons, taxation and electricity generation. And the Trump administration said it planned to keep national parks open - their closure in the 2013 shutdown provoked an angry public reaction. Why the US government has shut down The shutdown began on the first anniversary of President Trump's inauguration. His trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, next week has also been called into question. Many federal employees were forced to take a leave of absence - officially known as being furloughed - during the 16 days of shutdown. It cost the government $2bn in lost productivity andled to ""significant negative effects on the economy"", the OMB said at the time.,external Museums have already been closed Donald Trump laid the blame for the shutdown with the then president, Barack Obama.,external Federal workers cannot get paid for days worked during a lapse in funding.

German SPD backs Merkel coalition talksThe Social Democrats vote to open formal negotiations with Chancellor Merkel's conservatives.8h8 hours agoEurope,"Mr Schulz (C) had initially ruled out a new ""grand coalition"" Germany's centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) have agreed to start formal coalition negotiations with Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives. Ever since Germans went to the polls in September, the chancellor's ruling party has tried to form a government. Initially the SPD ruled out going back into government with Mrs Merkel's centre-right CDU and its Bavarian sister party, the CSU. But, after months of stalemate, they voted narrowly for formal talks. In-depth negotiations could start on Monday and Mrs Merkel is keen for them to wrap by 12 February. Merkel's coalition marathon keeps Germany waiting Angela Merkel's quiet power Germany country profile SPD leader Martin Schulz had at first refused to take part in a coalition but changed his mind when CDU/CSU coalition talks with the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens broke down. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) won 94 seats in parliament in September's vote and became the third biggest force in German politics. Jenny Hill in Berlin It's fair to assume Angela Merkel has permitted herself a sigh of relief. Nevertheless the poker face was on for the cameras as she gave a brief statement welcoming the Social Democrats' decision to approve formal coalition talks. This is her last realistic shot at forming a government and avoiding fresh elections. It is far from a done deal. Many Social Democrats blame Mrs Merkel for a poor election result in September and there is still significant opposition within the party to another four years as her junior coalition partner. If and when talks produce a formal agreement, all 440,000 members will be asked - via a postal ballot - to approve the deal.  Mrs Merkel isn't out of the woods just yet. But she is a step closer to delivering the government, the stability she promised. This is Germany's longest post-war period of coalition-building. The SPD has governed jointly with the CDU for eight of the last 12 years. But after historically poor poll results for both parties in September, Mr Schulz had vowed to take his party into opposition. However,pressure mounted on the SPD since November, when Mrs Merkel failed to cobble together a coalition with the liberal FDP and the Greens. This video can not be played How a woman from East Germany became one of the world's most powerful figures The two parties held preparatory talks earlier this month to see if they could overcome key policy differences and establish a framework for how they would govern. Mrs Merkel has said she wants to win back voters who deserted her party for the anti-immigration AfD amid tensions over the influx of asylum seekers while the SPD stood for a more open immigration policy. Earlier this month the parties agreed to limit asylum-seeker arrivals to about 200,000 annually and may also cap at 1,000 a month the number of migrants who will be allowed to join relatives living in Germany. Mrs Merkel and Mr Schulz have both stressed the need to ensure Germany's ""social cohesion"". German official figures show that 280,000 asylum seekers arrived in 2016, a drop of more than 600,000 on the total for 2015. Arrivals fell after EU countries and Turkey tightened border controls. There have also been disagreements over issues such as taxation. German media reported that the parties had agreed to crack down on tax avoidance in the EU, plugging tax loopholes exploited by US tech giants and other big corporations Mrs Merkel could form a less stable minority government with the Greens, with SPD support. However, she has previously said she would prefer a fresh election to that eventuality.

UKIP leader hit by vote of 'no confidence'Party's ruling body wants Henry Bolton out - but members will be given the final say on his future.10h10 hours agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played UKIP chairman Paul Oakden announces that party leader Henry Bolton has lost initial confidence vote UKIP's ruling national executive committee (NEC) has unanimously backed a vote of no confidence in party leader Henry Bolton. Mr Bolton has faced repeated calls to quit over offensive texts sent by his former girlfriend. But he has said he will defy the committee and continue as leader, as a contest would finish the party. Party members will now be given a vote on whether the former Army officer should remain in post. UKIP chairman Paul Oakden said Mr Bolton was ""disappointed"" by the NEC's decision but understood ""that the party has a process to go through"". ""Henry was offered the opportunity to resign but he has made clear that he feels he is the right man to lead the party forward,"" he added, after a three-hour emergency meeting to decide his future. The committee does not have the power to remove him - that can only be done by a vote of the party's membership. Who is Henry Bolton? UKIP MEP quits party over leadership UKIP leader splits with partner after texts Mr Bolton had earlier toured TV and radio studios, saying the committee had no right to pass ""moral"" judgement on his private life. He said he had ended the ""romantic element"" of his relationship with girlfriend Jo Marney after she sent texts saying Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle would ""taint"" the Royal Family, leading to accusations of racism. But he said he would ""support her in rebuilding her life"", which he said had been ""turned on its head"". If the former army officer were to step down it would leave UKIP seeking its fifth leader in 18 months. Mr Bolton warned that another leadership contest could spell the end for the party, which is believed to be heavily in debt, and said calls for his resignation were part of a ""coup"" attempt by a rival faction in the party. ""If the NEC decides to go down the road of months of further in-fighting and further negative media scrutiny by deciding to pass a vote of no confidence in me, I think that the reality is that the party is probably over,"" he told ITV's Peston on Sunday. He said the NEC should be focusing on ensuring the party's ""survival"" rather than discussing his leadership. The 53-year-old party leader, who left his wife prior to his relationship with Ms Marney, 25, became public, said: ""I don't believe I have done anything wrong. ""My own personal life, it's a little bit of a mess at the moment. I need to sort that out, of course."" UKIP said in a statement that, after a discussion of ""recent press coverage"" of the leader, ""the committee took the decision to hold a vote of no confidence in the leadership of Henry Bolton"". It added: ""The vote was carried unanimously, with the exception of the leader."" Under UKIP rules, an emergency general meeting must be staged within 28 days to endorse or reject the no confidence vote. Members will be told about when and where it will be held in the next 10 days. Senior figures have called on Mr Bolton - who won the leadership of the pro-Brexit party in October after a close-fought contest - to stand down to save the party. Neil Hamilton, the party's leader in Wales, said: ""He should now resign from UKIP immediately so we can get on with rebuilding the party without further distraction. ""If he forces us to hold an EGM, he will only humiliate himself further."" Gerard Batten, UKIP MEP for London, said Mr Bolton's position was ""untenable"" and that the controversy was ""damaging"" UKIP, and he offered to step in as interim leader.

Goalkeeper's water bottle 'urinated in',"The Metropolitan Police said a man was charged with throwing an item on to the pitch and will face court A goalkeeper's water bottle was urinated in during a match, prompting police to arrest an opposition fan. A video on social media showed a man throw a bottle on to the pitch behind the QPR goal during their match against Middlesbrough at Loftus Road on Saturday. It is believed the bottle may have been taken earlier by a pitch invader. The Metropolitan Police said a man was charged with throwing an item on to the pitch and will face court. The force's football unit tweeted: ""After an investigation @MPSFootballUnit can confirm that the male arrested at the @QPRFC v @Boro game yesterday has been charged with throwing an item on to the pitch. ""The male has been bailed and will appear at court next month."" Middlesbrough won the game 3-0. Last month, a Sunderland fan was ejected from the Stadium of Light after he was thought to have defecated on his seat - police later said he was merely drunk.

N Korea girl band leader in Olympic visitThe team is on a landmark visit to inspect cultural venues for next month's Winter Olympics.14h14 hours agoAsia,"Hyon Song-wol, pictured centre, was the star attraction during the visit to South Korea A North Korean delegation has arrived in South Korea for a landmark visit to inspect cultural venues for next month's Winter Olympics. It is headed by Hyon Song-wol, leader of the popular Moranbong girl band and a big celebrity in the secretive state. North Korea agreed to send a delegation to the games after the first high-level bilateral talks in two years. The decision is seen as a diplomatic breakthrough after months of tension over its nuclear weapons programme. North v South: A history of sport, bombs and diplomacy Reality Check: How good is North Korea at sport? Local media showed the North Korean delegation crossing the heavily-fortified border on a bus before arriving in the South Korean capital, Seoul. The delegation arrived at the Grand Unification Bridge, from where they crossed into the South The games are seen as a way of easing tension between the North and South Surrounded by hundreds of police officers, they then boarded a train to the eastern city of Gangneung. But it was on Hyon Song-wol that South Korea's cameras were focused. She and her 10-member Moranbong band are the glamorous face of North Korea - and have been described as Pyongyang's answer to the Spice Girls. Often seen wearing miniskirts and high heels, they perform a mixture of Western-style pop and patriotic songs - in a style seen as quaintly provincial by South Koreans, AFP news agency reports. Ms Hyon was once rumoured to have been a former girlfriend of the leader Kim Jong-un, although this has been dismissed by North Korea watchers. She will lead the 140-member Samjiyon art troupe, which is due to give two performances - one in Seoul and another in Gangneung - during the Olympics. North Korea's cheerleading charm offensive The coach who helped North Korea's skaters qualify for the Olympics The delegation's two-day visit is expected to be the first of several to prepare for Pyongyang's participation in the games. It is the first visit by Pyongyang officials to the South for four years, reports say. The delegation includes athletes, officials and cheerleaders. Another team will visit the South this week to check logistics for North Korean athletes, while Seoul will send its own officials to the North's ski resort to inspect the venue.

Hope for âlittle tiger catâWhen does sorry not mean sorry?Fifty and childless: Finding a way forwardCarillion: Six charts that explain what happened,"GÃ¼iÃ±as are considered pests by some people as they can steal chickens It's the smallest cat in the Americas, occupying the smallest area of land. Listed as vulnerable to extinction, the gÃ¼iÃ±a wildcat of Chile has lost much of its natural home as forests are chopped down or converted to farmland. And, like many carnivores, it's at risk from human persecution over fears it might kill livestock. However, new research shows the animal is able to survive near human settlements on agricultural land. Its biggest threat is being squeezed out when land is broken up into smaller areas, say conservationists. The guiÃ±a is known variously as the little tiger cat, little spotted cat or Chilean cat. About half the size of the domestic cat, it is one of the most threatened cat species in South America. GÃ¼iÃ±a wildcat spotted on a camera-trap The wildcat lives only in central and southern Chile and in a narrow strip of Argentina. According to the IUCN, there are only about 10,000 individuals left in the wild. Its natural habitat is rainforest, but it has also been seen in pine or eucalyptus plantations or close to agricultural areas. Research led by the University of Kent, UK, found that habitat fragmentation, and the subdivision of large farms into smaller ones, are the biggest threats facing the animal. ""This is because there is a higher risk of human interaction and persecution in areas where there are more farms; a greater pressure on natural resources through increased timber extraction and livestock grazing; and even competition for food from domestic animals kept as pets,"" said Dr NicolÃ¡s GÃ¡lvez, who is now a lecturer at the Pontificia Universidad CatÃ³lica de Chile. More than two-thirds of Chile's temperate rainforests have been lost over 25 years. However, through a series of questionnaires, camera-trap data and remote-sensed images the researchers found that the gÃ¼iÃ±a is remarkably adaptable to forest loss. They say large, intensive agricultural areas are actually suitable for the gÃ¼iÃ±a and should not be dismissed as poor quality habitat. The wildcat is found primarily in central and southern Chile This is because there are often unfarmed areas that provide refuge, food resources and suitable conditions for rearing young, they say. Another threat is illegal killing by humans. The cat is viewed negatively in rural areas over fears it will kill chickens. Questionnaires showed that 10% of rural inhabitants had killed a gÃ¼iÃ±a over the last decade. ""This suggests that persecution is much less of a threat to their survival than the subdivision of farms,"" said Prof Zoe Davies, from the Durrell Institute of Conservation and Ecology (DICE) at the University of Kent. Theresearch,externalpublished in theJournal of Applied Ecology,externalprovides a clearer picture of how habitat loss, land fragmentation and human interactions together affect the survival of a species such as the wildcat. The approach could be used to help with conservation efforts for small to medium-sized carnivores in other parts of the world. Follow Helenon Twitter,external.

When does sorry not mean sorry?Fifty and childless: Finding a way forwardCarillion: Six charts that explain what happened,"YouTube star Logan Paul is one of many high profile figures to have made a public apology in recent months Sorry seems to be the hardest word. So sang Elton John on one of his biggest 1970s hits - but not every public figure seems to find it so tough to utter that powerful five-letter word. In recent months a broad spectrum of public figures, frompoliticians, toHollywood actorsandYouTube starshave all publicly expressed remorse. In the latest example, the new Conservative vice-chairman for youth, Ben Bradley, has been forced to apologise twice over previous remarks - the latest of which appear to back police brutality,according to the Times,external. But with so much remorse on the airwaves, just how can we differentiate a forced apology from a heartfelt expression of remorse? In its purest form, saying sorry should be an ""act of contrition, a realisation that something you have said or done has hurt someone and you want to make amends"", says psychologist Geraldine Joaquim. Made early, a well-crafted apology can be hugely beneficial and can ""diffuse the situation and takes the wind out of an accuser's sails"", she says. A need to say sorry can arise in someone's public life and equally at home with their family and friends but, whatever the environment, how well it is received depends on how personalised it feels. Experts say the formula for an affective apology can be summed up with the acronym CAR: showconcern demonstrateaction offerreassurance ""People want the response to be personal to them, to feel that they're being listened to and taken seriously,"" says Martin Stone, of PR agency Tank. He says that, in the professional sphere, the phrase ""formal apology"" is often used, but, in reality, the opposite is what is required. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""I apologise"" for NHS difficulties From businesses, governments and organisations, a scripted response will fail to resonate as it will not convey empathy and compassion. ""This is a problem Theresa May has often found but it's interesting to see that her recent apology for the NHS crisis had been notably humanised,"" Stone says. ""It is vital that any business or individual making an apology understands the focus - is it sorry for the way it's acted or is it sorry that the complainant feels the way they do?"" Spontaneity - watch out for the speed of response, the quicker the apology comes, the better indication that the person making it has felt an immediate sense of guilt Body language - if genuine, the person making the apology will be looking for listening clues to see if they are being understood, such as eye contact and facial expressions Vulnerability - performed apologies always have a sense of being ""acted out"", and are often accompanied by too many theatrical gestures. If the person is genuine they will provide ""humbling signals""', such as a lowered head, to indicate remorse and vulnerability Denial gestures - the biggest clues of insincerity can come after the gesture itself, with non-verbal signals that silently reject the words used; this can include looking to the floor and smirking. Perhaps the rise in apologies over recent years can be linked to the rise of social media, which has helped facilitate a ""breakdown in formality"", says Stone. Platforms such as Twitter, and to a lesser extent Facebook, offer the opportunity for immediate engagement and impact. If pitched exactly right, a witty and well-judged apology can even ""go viral"" and end up as a positive for a company that has done wrong but shows it can ""own"" its mistake and put it right. And while this can present fantastic marketing opportunities for companies who strike the right tone between ""witty and irreverent responses to general comments"", it is important to know when to tone it down for more sensitive situations, Stone says. Toby Young said he regrets his ""politically incorrect"" comments Earlier this month, Virgin Trains were left red-faced when an attempted tongue-in-cheek apology to a passengerwas branded sexist. If the wrong move is made, the high level of audience engagement leaves huge potential for reputational damage - which will then only be solved by a further apology that appeases users but draws more attention to the problem. The nature of the internet also means unguarded comments live on for ever - as can controversy years down the line,as Toby Young recently found. The journalist ""unreservedly apologised"" for past tweets of a sexual and misogynistic nature that he said were ""ill-judged or just plain wrong"". In this climate, social media management has become a huge business. Job-hunting platform LinkedIn found that between 2010 and 2013, the number of such roles listed rose tenfold. Whether online or in person, the timing and choice of language in an apology are decisive factors. ""Firstly, it is important to show that you understand and sympathise,"" says Stone. ""Theresa May did this well in her NHS apology by starting sentences with 'I know it's difficult' and 'I know it's frustrating'. Even if you're a massive corporate giant, don't hide from emotion and don't ignore feelings."" Linguistically it is also important to avoid dehumanising statements or promises that can't be kept. ""Don't say that you'll ensure that this will not happen again if you're not confident it won't. It could come back to bite you,"" Stone explains. Equally, the use of ""but"" can hugely change the tone of an apology. As Stone points out: ""I'm sorry butâ¦' sounds like you are making excuses and aren't actually taking any form of responsibility. ""It may be three letters but it can instantly make an apology seem hollow."" Tony Blair apologises over Iraq This video can not be played Tony Blair expresses sorrow, regret and apology for the 2003 Iraq invasion ""This is a masterclass in deflection. He begins with an over-congruent non-verbal apology bordering on the tearful. His voice breaks, he seems to blink back tears and he falters as though about to break down. ""It was a delayed apology too, so not remotely spontaneous. His emotional turn-around is too rapid to suggest genuine feelings of remorse. He flips like a switch, saying there are things he won't apologise for, and his body language flips with it, becoming splayed and defiant, with an accelerated blink-rate suggesting anger.""

""This is a bit like the popstar version of a sick call to work - appearing make-up free to prove her ill health. She's only talking to a camera but she makes it sound personal. ""Her 'really really' sorry could sound fake but not when you factor in her body language. She emphasises her words with a baton hand and then rubs her arm as though sharing the pain of her fans. It's as genuine and sincere as you'd get from a filmed message, but then sincerity is very much Adele's style."" Theresa May apologises to MPs who lost seats in the election This video can not be played Theresa May said she would ""reflect on what we need to do in the future to take the party forward"" ""Her eye contact and eye expression look defiant but the mouth skew hints that she really does feel sorry for what happened.

""She has been told to perform a confident, political, deflected apology but is in fact leaking out suppressed, genuine remorse via her body language.""

Fifty and childless: Finding a way forwardCarillion: Six charts that explain what happened,"""What people don't realise is it's a form of bereavement. There were days I couldn't get out of bed. I just couldn't face the world."" Nicci Fletcher, 50, says she and her husband Andrew felt ""real grief"" at not having children together and wanted to help other people going through the same experience. So they decided to set up an online subscription magazine -The Childless Not By Choice Magazine,external- aimed solely at other people who wanted children but couldn't have them. Nicci and Andrew met in their late 30s. When an unplanned pregnancy ended in miscarriage they were devastated but thought they would be able to conceive again. But Nicci later discovered she had inherited her mother's endometriosis - a condition which can lead to infertility. ""My mother was advised not to have any more children after me but I'd never asked why,"" she said. ""I kick myself now. I had no symptoms at all. My periods were like clockwork, no pain. ""If I'd known then I could have done something about it. I could have had my eggs harvested and frozen. When you're in your 20s, you think you've got all the time in the world."" According to government statistics published in November,,externalnearly one in five women in England and Wales born in 1971 have no children at all - compared to one in 10 of their mother's generation. Although there are no official statistics on how many childless women wanted children, an academic study from Erasmus University Rotterdam in the Netherlands suggested it could be as high as 90%. The situation hit Nicci hard. As well as the pain of not having children, she felt isolated from her friends who were busy with their young families. ""Of my 20 close friends, I was the only one without a child,"" she said. ""I had such a feeling of being marginalised. ""They were supportive as much as they could be supportive but we were in denial, we didn't ask for any support."" Andrew, 52, became despondent at not being able to resolve the situation. ""It's different for men. We don't have the biological imperative that women do - we can supposedly have babies at any age,"" he said. ""But I felt depressed at not being able to help Nicci. I can say the right words, I can rub her back but I can't fix it. Most blokes like to fix things."" Is flexible working biased against non-parents? Soaring childlessness among southern European women - report When childless isn't a choice He also grieved for the future he had planned. ""We bought our farmhouse in France because it would be a marvellous place to bring up children. As a couple you make decisions based on the assumption of having children. It's painful realising you're not going to have the life you expected."" Slowly, Nicci and Andrew began to withdraw from friends and family. ""I'd always been a sociable person, but we became quite reclusive,"" said Andrew. ""Everything felt geared towards children - even adverts on the TV - and so we began to feel completely alone."" For four years, the grief and depression overwhelmed them. It was only by becoming involved in the annual World Childless Week, a global event to bring childfree people together, that Nicci and Andrew realised there were thousands of other people going through exactly the same feelings. ""It really helped us,"" said Nicci. ""For the first time in years we're going around with smiles on her faces. We're members of a club none of us wanted to be part of, but it's a very supportive club."" It was this feeling which made them decide to launch their online subscription magazine for other child-free people. It's just one of a number of ways childfree people are coming together to support each other. Debbie Norman, aged 50, is a member of Gateway Women, an online community of childless women who meet up every month throughout the UK. Before joining, she found it difficult to talk openly about the pain she felt at being childless. ""People would say: 'Why don't you just adopt?' They'd try and fix the problem or sweep it under the carpet. It just made me feel worse because my feelings weren't being validated."" The friendships she's made through Gateway Women have given her ""permission"" to work through her feelings and come to terms with her situation. ""It's not a life sentence,"" she said. ""There is light at the end of the tunnel. It's not the future you planned but it's still light and beautiful. It can still be lovely."" The Institute of Public Policy Research estimates that, by 2030, there will betwo million people aged over 65 without adult children,,externalup from 1.2 million in 2012. Approximately 230,000 of them will be in need of more than 20 hours' care a week and will have no informal support. Ageing without Children, a campaign group founded by Kirsty Woodward for people over 50 who don't have children, is concerned about who will take on the caring responsibilities for childless people as they grow old. A pilot scheme has been launched in Dorset which aims to challenge how services plan for people facing those circumstances. Ms Woodward said: ""Our care system still relies heavily on the younger generation caring for its parents - 95% of care is picked up by the family."" As for Nicci and Andrew, helping and connecting with other people means they can now look forward to the future. ""We've gone from rock bottom to feeling so optimistic and positive about the future,"" said Nicci. ""Helping other people has helped us heal. We've got a reason to get out of bed in the morning - which isn't simply to walk our three dogs.""
