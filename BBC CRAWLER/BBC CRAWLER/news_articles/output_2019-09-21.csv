Louis Theroux: 'I needed to give more of myself',"There's not much Louis Theroux hasn't experienced of humanity. In more than 25 years of documentary making, he's moved in multiple worlds including those of neo-Nazis, Scientologists, pornography stars, those living with dementia - and Jimmy Savile. While his approach has altered over the years, from comic gonzo to sober inquisitor, Theroux's ability to extract uncomfortable truths without confrontation has not. Yet, the one person we don't get to know is Theroux himself. The questions are simple. The expression inscrutable. Only his eyebrows sometimes go rogue. In other words, he gives his interviewee space to show who they are. Louis Theroux is married to Nancy Strang Epithets from ""faux-naive"", ""impenetrable"" and ""wacky"" have been employed in an attempt to define him. Theroux says he can, up to point, understand why. ""I plead guilty to, back in the day of Weird Weekends and When Louis Met, sometimes being a 'wacky' satirist, finding fringe people in marginal, wrongheaded or poisoned lifestyles and having fun with them, making them look a bit silly,"" he says. ""Now I cover stories I'm interested in, funny or not. ""We used to say, 'Where are the laughs?' as a way of eliminating a subject. But it's not about being Jeremy Paxman or David Frost, but being engaging, exciting and interesting and being the best me I can."" As Theroux edges towards 50, his latest project - a memoir - could help unmask the ""real"" him. In Gotta Get Theroux This, he turns the focus inwards, to the workings of his TV world and his complicated mind. The title's pun comes from the ironic ""cult of Louis"" that spawned a range of Theroux-themed merchandise. Theroux wanted to ""repurpose the meme, which never struck me as really that funny. Any pun on my name, I've heard a million times"". Paul Theroux became famous in the 1970s with his travelogue The Great Railway Bazaar ""But a theme of the book is getting through things, so I focused on challenges, things I found difficult: professional failures and worries, feeling I'm not up to it, I'm in over my head."" Theroux goes into forensic detail as he takes us through his childhood, into adulthood and becoming an alumnus of Michael Moore, to the present day. As for his personal life, it's been a rollercoaster of anxiety, self-doubt and emotional detachment. (There's also been a lot of pot smoking.) ""I take my work arguably too seriously. I neglected my personal life to focus on achieving some sort of professional success. The price of my lack of emotional nous was paid by those nearest and dearest to me."" He's had to learn to overcome the commitment issues which contributed to his first marriage's breakdown and almost broke his second to Nancy Strang, mother to his three boys. Given the commitment he's now asking of readers, he felt it necessary to be as open as possible. Marcel Theroux is also a documentary maker and writer ""I owed them something that connects in a deeper way. I needed to be honest and to give more of myself away... feel kind of naked, in a surprising, maybe a shocking way."" Theroux talks about being ""socially awkward"" and not feeling right in his skin. It started young: aged five or six, he was already contemplating his death. There is still room for Theroux to make documentaries with a lighter tone such as Love Without Limits His father is the American writer Paul Theroux. His mother was a BBC World Service producer. Though loving, their parenting was hands off, leaving Louis and older brother Marcel (also a documentary maker and writer) with au pairs. Paul was also a philanderer. The couple divorced in 1993. The young Louis, felt ""freakish"" and had few friends. He was fascinated with the macabre and taboo, and worked and worried himself to ""emotional exhaustion"" at his private school. Academic success was a pacifier when the rest of life felt out of control. He went on to read history at Oxford. Theroux says his early resentment of his parents has mellowed but adds, ""I'm very much the person I was as a child."" ""For me, childhood is the most difficult passage of life. You feel imprisoned, enclosed within the choices made by other people. That can feel overwhelming."" Weird Weekends saw Theroux come up against professional wrestlers Needing distance, Theroux went to America after graduation (he's lived there on and off for several years). There, he was hired by the influential documentary maker Michael Moore - the man who would shape his future. Fronting segments on Moore's satirical TV Nation, the naÃ¯f Theroux delved into the lives of off-the-wall characters and learned the naturalistic tricks of his trade. ""I can't imagine where I would be today were it not for that fateful day when Michael hired me and later told me to get on a plane and interview apocalyptic Christians. I felt completely out of my depth. But he had faith in me at a time when I didn't have faith in myself. I'd never considered being a TV correspondent. I've made sure I thanked him."" His subsequent move to the BBC and Weird Weekends, again set in the US, gave Theroux more doubts. ""I had enough American in me to be concerned that we might be making one of those 'let's make fun of Americans' type programmes."" When Louis Met... the Hamiltons he unwittingly experienced the full glare of being in the limelight Weird Weekends became the vehicle by which Theroux was introduced to the British public. His ""going native"" rapport-building approach told a truer story than hard-nosed interrogation and won him an army of fans. The pay-off for Theroux was escapism: ""When you're on location with people who think the heavens are going to rain down fire, the fact that you haven't renewed your car's tax disc doesn't seem so preoccupying."" However fame and success have sometimes divided Theroux. Even when winning awards, he's been torn between pride and feeling unworthy. The limelight first blindsided him in the When Louis Met celebrity interview strand. The episode with UK politician Neil Hamilton and wife Christine saw him caught in the media commotion surrounding allegations of rape made against them (later discredited). ""I got into TV almost as a way of becoming invisible, in worlds where I was immersed in something remote from my daily concerns. But then I became the subject of tabloids and news reports. It wasn't comfortable,"" says Theroux. Louis Theroux has struggled with his feelings followng the revelations about Jimmy Savile But it's thefirst show he made with Jimmy Savile in 2000that left an indelible mark. Unsurprising, given what we know now. At the time Theroux could only say he felt Savile was ""really odd, like someone with something to hide"". The two struck up a kind of friendship, so the revelations about Savile's serial sexual abuse hit hard. ""I was stressed and upset and had a level of guilt, as part of me resisted believing,"" says Theroux. ""I've come to the conclusion it was an understandable human response. The extent of his offending was so broad, it took a while to get your head around it."" He revisited the story in 2016, concentrating on Savile's victims. Personally, he hoped it might ""exorcise"" the ghosts still haunting him. Louis Theroux looked into the world of mothers who have their new-born babies adopted in 2018's Take My Baby ""His victims have changed the landscape in the UK and how we think about historic sexual abuse or predatory behaviour by powerful people,"" says Theroux. ""But what also came across clearly is the way some victims don't always immediately recognise it."" The seriousness of the programme was illustrative of the shift in tone of Theroux's documentaries over the last decade. Mental illness, adoption, and rape on campus are among the issues he's covered.  The consistency lies in Theroux's human touch. The film-maker says he hopes to be remembered for ""showing human nature in an honest way that connects with people for years to come"". His view of humanity now is ""we are who we are"". ""That can be really positive, altruistic, self-sacrificing and sometimes really bonkers"". As for his attitude towards himself, he says: ""I'm at peace with not being at peace.""

Countdown to 2019 Emmy Awards begins,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Killing Eve star Jodie Comer were among the big British winners at this year's Emmy Awards. The ceremony, which recognises excellence in television, took place in Los Angeles on Sunday. Comer won best leading drama actress for playing Villanelle inKilling Eve. Fleabagstar and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge took home the prize for best leading comedy actress, best comedy series and best comedy writing. Originally made for BBC Three, it is the first British-made show to be named best comedy series. ""It's so wonderful and reassuring to know that a dirty, pervy, angry and messed-up woman can make it to the Emmys,"" Waller-Bridge laughed, referring to the show's lead character. 6 highlights from the Emmys ceremony In pictures: The Emmys red carpet Emmy Awards: The winners and nominees How America fell in love with Fleabag Waller-Bridge also joked that the possibility of winning awards was the reason she wrote the series in the first place. ""I find writing really hard and really painful, but I'd like to say from the bottom of my heart that the reason that I do it isthis,"" she said, holding up the Emmy statuette. ""So it's made it all really worth it guys, thank you so much."" Game of Thrones won the night's most prestigious prize - best drama - despite the eighth and final series receiving a mixed response from fans and critics. One of the HBO fantasy's stars, Peter Dinklage, also took home the prize for best supporting drama actor. Jodie Comer paid tribute to her Killing Eve co-star Sandra Oh Waller-Bridge's win for leading comedy actress was a particular surprise, given that she was nominated against Emmy favourite Julia Louis-Dreyfus. The US actress has previously won in this category six times for her role in Veep, and was widely expected to win again for the show's seventh and final series. Comer's win for her performance as the ruthless assassin Villanelle in BBC America's Killing Eve tops off an extraordinary year for the actress, who also won a TV Bafta in May for the same role. Why Killing Eve's star Jodie Comer 'confuses people' Fleabag: Six things to know about the original play ""I was not expecting to get up on this stage tonight,"" Comer said as she picked up her prize. ""I cannot believe I'm in a category alongside these women, one of them who is my co-star Sandra Oh. ""Safe to say Sandra that this Killing Eve journey has been an absolute whirlwind and I feel so lucky to have shared the whole experience with you."" As Waller-Bridge took to the stage near the end of the ceremony to accept Fleabag's fourth award of the night, for best comedy series, she commented: ""This is getting ridiculous! ""Fleabag started as a one-woman show at the Edinburgh festival in 2014, and the journey has been absolutely mental to get here."" Ben Whishaw was among the other British winners Paying tribute to Fleabag's ""hot priest"", she added: ""Season two would not have exploded in the way that it did if it wasn't for Andrew Scott, who came into our Fleabag world like a whirlwind and gave a performance of such depth and complexity it elevated the whole thing."" The show's director, Harry Bradbeer, won best director for a comedy series. ""For a director, something like Fleabag only comes along once in your life,"" he said. ""Thank you Phoebe for coming into my life like some kind of glorious grenade. Scientists are still trying to work out how someone so incredibly talented can be so utterly lovely."" The second series of Fleabag aired on the BBC earlier this year and has been released by Amazon in the US. Bandersnatch writers Annabel Jones and Charlie Brooker Other British winners include Ben Whishaw, who won best supporting actor in a limited series for his role in BBC One's A Very English Scandal. He played Norman Scott, the man who accused Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe of trying to have him killed. Charlie Brooker won best television movie for Netflix's Bandersnatch, a win he said he was ""quite unprepared for"". The interactive Bandersnatch allowed viewers to choose the way the film's storyline unfolded. In his speech, Brooker thanked his two children, joking: ""I can never limit your video game screen time again, if I do I'm a disgusting hypocrite [because] it sometimes pays off."" British writer Jesse Armstrong, whose work on HBO's Succession won him best writing for a drama series, made reference to the strong UK showing at the ceremony. ""Quite a lot of British winners, maybe too many? Maybe you should have a think about those immigration restrictions,"" he joked. Peter Dinklage was the only Game of Thrones actor to win on Sunday, for playing Tyrion Lannister Another Brit, TV host John Oliver, won outstanding variety talk series for Last Week Tonight. In total, 13 of the night's 27 awards had British involvement, including the three trophies for Chernobyl, which was a Sky/HBO co-production. The series, whichdramatised the 1986 nuclear disaster, took home the prize for best limited series, as well as best writing and directing for a limited series. Elsewhere, the best drama series prize for Game of Thrones and the best supporting drama actor award for Peter Dinklage meant the fantasy epic won 12 Emmys in total, including the trophies it took home at last week's Creative Arts Emmys.

Watson: Labour must back Remain,"This video can not be played Watson: Labour should 'unequivocally back Remain' Labour should ""unequivocally back Remain"" in a fresh Brexit referendum and only then pursue power in a general election, its deputy has said. Tom Watson said there was ""no such thing as a good Brexit deal"" and the 2016 Leave vote had been ""invalidated"". Jeremy Corbyn said he did ""not accept or agree with"" his deputy's view. ""Our priority is to get a general election in order to give the people a chance to elect a government that cares for them,"" he said. The Labour leader wants to hold another referendum once Labour has won power, in which voters would have the choice to remain in the EU alongside a ""credible"" Leave proposal. However, he has said he would only choose a side once the shape of any revised Brexit deal negotiated by a Labour government became clear. The BBC's political correspondent, Chris Mason, said Mr Watson was directly elected as deputy leader by party members, not appointed by Mr Corbyn, and so has a right to roam on policy other shadow cabinet ministers might not get away with it. Watson: What's Corbyn's thinking on Brexit? Labour manifesto to offer vote on Leave and Remain In a speech in London, Mr Watson said while an autumn general election seemed inevitable ""that does not make it desirable"". ""Elections should never be single issue campaigns,"" he argued, suggesting vital issues such as the future of the NHS, economic inequality and crime would be ""drowned out"" by the prime minister's ""do or die"" Brexit message. ""The only way to break the Brexit deadlock once and for all is a public vote in a referendum,"" he said. ""A general election might well fail to solve this Brexit chaos."" In the event of another general election in the coming months, Mr Watson said Labour must be ""crystal clear"" about where it stands on Brexit if it wants to get a hearing for the rest of its domestic policy agenda. ""There is no such thing as a good Brexit deal, which is why I believe we should advocate for Remain. That is what the overwhelming majority of Labour Party members, MPs and trade unions believe."" Mr Watson will said that, though ""very difficult"", he and many others ""respected the result of the 2016 referendum for a long time"". But, he added: ""There eventually comes a point when circumstances are so changed, when so much new information has emerged that we didn't have in 2016, when so many people feel differently to how they felt then, that you have to say, no... the only proper way to proceed in such circumstances is to consult the people again."" The Liberal Democrats, who pushed Labour into third place in May's European elections with a strident anti-Brexit message, are pushing for Brexit to be stopped in its tracks by revoking Article 50 - the legal process for the UK's departure. While stopping short of calling for that himself, Mr Watson said it was not too late for Labour to ""win back"" Remain voters. Would a Labour government cancel Brexit? Where do the parties stand? Labour's hunt for Brexit 'reconciliation' ""My experience on the doorstep tells me most of those who've deserted us over our Brexit policy did so with deep regret and would greatly prefer to come back,"" he added. ""They just want us to take an unequivocal position that whatever happens we'll fight to remain, and to sound like we mean it."" Former Labour leadership contender Owen Smith said Mr Watson was speaking for ""the majority of Labour members and Labour voters"", and that the party ""should be clearing the Brexit issue off the table before we get to an election"". This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn committed to a referendum with a ""credible Leave option"" on Tuesday But another Labour MP, Gareth Snell - one of a group of MPs in the party wanting to bring back an amended version of Theresa May's original withdrawal agreement - said the ""numbers simply don't exist"" in Parliament to approve a further referendum. He told Today: ""The public have no appetite for a second referendum. The doors I knock every weekâ¦ [voters] are not telling me they want to go back to the divisive referendum [but] they want a decision on this process to be taken as soon as possible."" Just 24 hours after Jeremy Corbyn hammered out a deal with the Labour-supporting unions, his deputy, Tom Watson, shattered any fragile unity. Mr Watson and many Labour activists want a clearer commitment to campaign on a Remain platform - especially during a snap election. So, apart from his own scepticism towards an EU that he believes needs reform, what is the thinking behind Jeremy Corbyn's position? Well, it comes down to four things - psephology, party unity, politics and personal authority. Read more from Iain. Unite's Len McCluskey dismissed Mr Watson's intervention, accusing him of ""undermining"" the leadership and suggesting his views ""don't really matter"". The two men, who used to be close friends, fell out spectacularly in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum during an uprising by Labour MPs against Mr Corbyn's leadership. The union leader suggested Mr Watson was ""languishing on the fringes"" of the party, adding: ""It's sad. Now and again Tom pops up from where he has been hiding and comes up with somethingâ¦ which is normally to try and undermine his leader."" The Conservatives said Mr Watson had made it clear he wanted to ""cancel"" the 2016 Brexit referendum result. Labour has voted twice against Boris Johnson's plans for a poll on 15 October. The party's leadership has insisted it is eager for an election after the risk of a no-deal Brexit on 31 October has been ruled out.

"'Step in to save Thomas Cook,' ministers urged","Thomas Cook has hundreds of High Street stores Ministers should be ready to give Thomas Cook ""real financial support"", a union representing staff at the struggling travel company has said. The firm could fall into administration in days unless it finds Â£200m in extra funds needed to secure its future. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) union has called on Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom to save Thomas Cook ""no matter what"". Government sources suggest ministers are reluctant to bail out the company. TSSA general secretary Manuel Cortes told Mrs Leadsom it was up to the government to save thousands of jobs and to allow Thomas Cook to ""flourish"". What's gone wrong at Thomas Cook? Thomas Cook clients fear ruined weddings and trips Why Thomas Cook might struggle to book a bailout He said in a letter: ""It is incumbent upon the government to act if required and save this iconic cornerstone of the British High Street and the thousands of jobs that go with it. ""Thomas Cook can be a highly successful business and must be given every opportunity to flourish. I urge you to stand ready to assist Thomas Cook with real financial support."" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said ""all viable options"" for saving the travel giant should be explored. She added that ""the government must consider stepping in and taking an equity stake to avoid this crisis"". BBC business editor Simon Jack reported on Saturday that government sourceshad questioned the financial wisdom of stepping in to save the company. He said the government did not see its options as being between spending Â£200m to help Thomas Cook with its cash shortfall or Â£600m to repatriate its British customers abroad. Currently there are 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British. Chloe and her fiance Jack are due to fly to Zante for their wedding Chloe Hardy from Leicestershire is due to get married in Zante in October and booked the wedding package with Thomas Cook back in June 2018. Chloe and her fiance will also have 33 family members flying out, with their trips costing more than Â£33,000 in total. With the big day looming, Chloe is frustrated by Thomas Cook's handling of their booking. ""I have emailed the wedding concierge and co-ordinator, neither has got back to me. We are unsure if we will be able to fly. Although, it's Atol-protected I have booked three weeks' leave from work and there's no guarantee that I will be able to get time off if I had to rebook."" ""We've had constant questions from our family that we are unable to answer,"" she added. ""This is causing great concern, worry and stress to all of us involved."" It comes after a noticeable shift in tone from Thomas Cook in its replies to concerned customers on social media. Clients had earlier been told to ignore media speculation on Friday, but are now being reminded they have Atol protection - a sort of industry-backed insurance - ""in the event that Thomas Cook goes into administration"". Thomas Cook, one of the world's largest travel companies, was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and now has annual sales of Â£9bn. It employs 22,000 staff, 9,000 of those in the UK and serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries. Thomas Cook's financial difficulties have mounted over the past year, culminating with the agreement in August of a rescue deal led by its biggest shareholder Fosun. In July, Thomas Cook produced a business plan saying that it needed Â£900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of Â£150m. The Â£900m would come from Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors. The group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional Â£200m on top of the Â£900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to Â£1.1bn. Thomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional Â£200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out and the group of creditors will not come back to the table unless that additional funding is found. A final vote on that deal was due to take place this week, but it has been delayed until next Friday in the face of the latest demand for extra standby funding. Thomas Cook has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit. If you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment. Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating. If you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme. If you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund. When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.

Loyalist parades pass off 'without incident',"The Pride of Govan flute band parade is the largest of four events taking place in Glasgow A series of loyalist parades in Glasgow have taken place. Four marches had been given the go-ahead despite concerns over sectarian violence. Police said there had been no counter-demonstrations and no disorder associated with the marches. Ch Supt Hazel Hendren said: ""All four of today's processions passed off without incident, with no protestors identified on any of the routes or anywhere else in the city."" The events will happen exactly a week aftera protest was held in Glasgow's George Squareover the cancellation of five marches at an emergency meeting of the city's council.

The Prince of Wales joined veterans at the commemorations to the allied assault in the Battle of Arnhem. Veteran Sandy Cortmann, 97, parachuted again over the Dutch city. British, US and Polish forces dropped behind enemy lines in 1944 but failed in their bid to secure eight bridges and open up a route into Germany. About 35,000 troops landed by parachute and gliders in what was then the largest airborne operation in history. The Prince of Wales and Princess Beatrix of The Netherlands mark the 75th anniversary Veterans also attended the commemorative service and wreath-laying at Ginkel Heath The Prince of Wales spoke to the former soldiers Veteran Sandy Cortmann, now 97, jumped with a member of the Red Devils parachute team Prince Charles and Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands and veterans attended a service and wreath-laying at the former landing zone of Ginkel Heath. Soldiers from the Parachute Regiment, of which the prince is colonel-in-chief, were among the 1,500 people who took part in the commemorative parachute drop. The prince later travelled to Driel for a service in honour of Polish forces, who had landed in the town during Operation Market Garden. Mr Cortmann, from Aberdeen,made a tandem jumpwith a parachutist from the Army's Red Devils display team over the Ginkel Heath nature reserve as part of the commemorations. He was just 22 when he parachuted into the same drop zone in September 1944, where he was taken prisoner by the Germans. Thousands of people watching from the ground applauded as Arnhem veteran Mr Cortmann landed. Mr Cortmann, 97, hugs his carer after the parachute jump Prince Charles later laid a wreath at a service for Polish airborne forces in Driel He described the jump as ""thoroughly terrifying"", and added: ""When the door opened I thought, Christ, what a way down."" But he said it was ""absolutely wonderful to see the ground so far below, my God"". Asked if the jump was similar to the one 75 years ago, he said: ""I can't remember much about the jump in 1944, we were just a bunch of young lads out for a good time if you like, but it turned out rather terrifying in the end with the guns and mortars and things opened up. They were all aimed at us.""

Mr Whitwell added: ""The Dutch people are really very, very nice, it's wonderful to be back."" The events at the Battle of Arnhem were portrayed in Richard Attenborough's 1977 Hollywood war epic A Bridge Too Far starring Sean Connery, Robert Redford, Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine. The allies seized bridges and canal crossings at Eindhoven, Nijmegen and Arnhem, but were forced to retreat after German counter-attacks. More than 1,500 allied soldiers were killed and nearly 6,500 captured.  Total German casualties were put at 3,300, although some estimates have them as high as 8,000. The allies captured three bridges in September 1944 before being forced back On Friday, the ashes of two veterans of the Battle of Arnhem were laid to rest alongside their fallen comrades buried in Oosterbeek.

Dozens of arrests in fresh yellow vest protests,"Activists run through clouds of tear gas A peaceful climate march in Paris has been halted after it was infiltrated by other protest groups. Groups of anarchist demonstrators joined in, breaking windows and setting fire to street barricades. Families abandoned the march as violent clashes prompted French police, who have previously been accused of excessive violence, to fire tear gas and make over 100 arrests. A huge security operation involved 7,000 police officers. The march was intended to be festive, family-friendly and peaceful The climate change march and a protest against pension reform were both authorised, while other demonstrations -  including one by the 'yellow vest' anti-government group - went ahead illegally. The story of the gilets jaunes Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Yellow vest violence returns to Paris Much of the violence and vandalism was attributed to the so-called black bloc anarchist group, who wore black scarves, sunglasses and hoods to cover their faces. Yellow vest protesters wore black, abandoning the trademark hi-vis vests The gilets jaunes (yellow vest) movement was sparked ten months ago by a hike in fuel prices and evolved into weekly anti-government protests that continued well into the spring. Most of those protesting on Saturday did not wear the trademark fluorescent jackets, so they could avoid standing out. Police have previously been accused of violence in their response to the yellow vest movement As the violence worsened, police used tear gas to disperse groups of protesters. A video posted on Twitter shows climate change protesters covering their mouths as tear gas from further afield was carried to them by the wind. Allow Twitter content?

A lot of anger was targeted at President Macron from both sides of the protest Greenpeace told climate change protesters to abandon the march as conditions were not appropriate for a non-violent protest. This video can not be played Dramatic footage shows a police crackdown on Paris yellow vest protesters Violent protesters caused havoc on the streets One of Saturday's protesters told French media outlet Le Monde that they continued to protest because of ""injustice"" but said they were worried about the ""bad image"" of the yellow vests. ""I am not a thug,"" the protester insisted. The yellow vest protests, which lost momentum over the summer, were often marred by violence, some of which was blamed on the black blocs. The protests earlier this year prompted Mr Macron to introducereforms including tax cuts and a more decentralised government. Police were heavily decked out in riot gear Saturday's protests interfered with France's annual Heritage Day, when well-known sites open their doors to the public. On Friday, President Macron said it was good that that people could express themselves but asked that the protests proceeded in a ""calm"" manner. He has not yet commented on Saturday's events.

Police have previously been accused of violence in their response to the yellow vest movement As the violence worsened, police used tear gas to disperse groups of protesters. A video posted on Twitter shows climate change protesters covering their mouths as tear gas from further afield was carried to them by the wind. Allow Twitter content?

""I am not a thug,"" the protester insisted. The yellow vest protests, which lost momentum over the summer, were often marred by violence, some of which was blamed on the black blocs. The protests earlier this year prompted Mr Macron to introducereforms including tax cuts and a more decentralised government. Police were heavily decked out in riot gear Saturday's protests interfered with France's annual Heritage Day, when well-known sites open their doors to the public. On Friday, President Macron said it was good that that people could express themselves but asked that the protests proceeded in a ""calm"" manner. He has not yet commented on Saturday's events.

"Louis Theroux: 'I needed to give more of myself'The documentary maker opens up about his anxiety, feeling ""freakish"" and emotional commitment.","There's not much Louis Theroux hasn't experienced of humanity. In more than 25 years of documentary making, he's moved in multiple worlds including those of neo-Nazis, Scientologists, pornography stars, those living with dementia - and Jimmy Savile. While his approach has altered over the years, from comic gonzo to sober inquisitor, Theroux's ability to extract uncomfortable truths without confrontation has not. Yet, the one person we don't get to know is Theroux himself. The questions are simple. The expression inscrutable. Only his eyebrows sometimes go rogue. In other words, he gives his interviewee space to show who they are. Louis Theroux is married to Nancy Strang Epithets from ""faux-naive"", ""impenetrable"" and ""wacky"" have been employed in an attempt to define him. Theroux says he can, up to point, understand why. ""I plead guilty to, back in the day of Weird Weekends and When Louis Met, sometimes being a 'wacky' satirist, finding fringe people in marginal, wrongheaded or poisoned lifestyles and having fun with them, making them look a bit silly,"" he says. ""Now I cover stories I'm interested in, funny or not. ""We used to say, 'Where are the laughs?' as a way of eliminating a subject. But it's not about being Jeremy Paxman or David Frost, but being engaging, exciting and interesting and being the best me I can."" As Theroux edges towards 50, his latest project - a memoir - could help unmask the ""real"" him. In Gotta Get Theroux This, he turns the focus inwards, to the workings of his TV world and his complicated mind. The title's pun comes from the ironic ""cult of Louis"" that spawned a range of Theroux-themed merchandise. Theroux wanted to ""repurpose the meme, which never struck me as really that funny. Any pun on my name, I've heard a million times"". Paul Theroux became famous in the 1970s with his travelogue The Great Railway Bazaar ""But a theme of the book is getting through things, so I focused on challenges, things I found difficult: professional failures and worries, feeling I'm not up to it, I'm in over my head."" Theroux goes into forensic detail as he takes us through his childhood, into adulthood and becoming an alumnus of Michael Moore, to the present day. As for his personal life, it's been a rollercoaster of anxiety, self-doubt and emotional detachment. (There's also been a lot of pot smoking.) ""I take my work arguably too seriously. I neglected my personal life to focus on achieving some sort of professional success. The price of my lack of emotional nous was paid by those nearest and dearest to me."" He's had to learn to overcome the commitment issues which contributed to his first marriage's breakdown and almost broke his second to Nancy Strang, mother to his three boys. Given the commitment he's now asking of readers, he felt it necessary to be as open as possible. Marcel Theroux is also a documentary maker and writer ""I owed them something that connects in a deeper way. I needed to be honest and to give more of myself away... feel kind of naked, in a surprising, maybe a shocking way."" Theroux talks about being ""socially awkward"" and not feeling right in his skin. It started young: aged five or six, he was already contemplating his death. There is still room for Theroux to make documentaries with a lighter tone such as Love Without Limits His father is the American writer Paul Theroux. His mother was a BBC World Service producer. Though loving, their parenting was hands off, leaving Louis and older brother Marcel (also a documentary maker and writer) with au pairs. Paul was also a philanderer. The couple divorced in 1993. The young Louis, felt ""freakish"" and had few friends. He was fascinated with the macabre and taboo, and worked and worried himself to ""emotional exhaustion"" at his private school. Academic success was a pacifier when the rest of life felt out of control. He went on to read history at Oxford. Theroux says his early resentment of his parents has mellowed but adds, ""I'm very much the person I was as a child."" ""For me, childhood is the most difficult passage of life. You feel imprisoned, enclosed within the choices made by other people. That can feel overwhelming."" Weird Weekends saw Theroux come up against professional wrestlers Needing distance, Theroux went to America after graduation (he's lived there on and off for several years). There, he was hired by the influential documentary maker Michael Moore - the man who would shape his future. Fronting segments on Moore's satirical TV Nation, the naÃ¯f Theroux delved into the lives of off-the-wall characters and learned the naturalistic tricks of his trade. ""I can't imagine where I would be today were it not for that fateful day when Michael hired me and later told me to get on a plane and interview apocalyptic Christians. I felt completely out of my depth. But he had faith in me at a time when I didn't have faith in myself. I'd never considered being a TV correspondent. I've made sure I thanked him."" His subsequent move to the BBC and Weird Weekends, again set in the US, gave Theroux more doubts. ""I had enough American in me to be concerned that we might be making one of those 'let's make fun of Americans' type programmes."" When Louis Met... the Hamiltons he unwittingly experienced the full glare of being in the limelight Weird Weekends became the vehicle by which Theroux was introduced to the British public. His ""going native"" rapport-building approach told a truer story than hard-nosed interrogation and won him an army of fans. The pay-off for Theroux was escapism: ""When you're on location with people who think the heavens are going to rain down fire, the fact that you haven't renewed your car's tax disc doesn't seem so preoccupying."" However fame and success have sometimes divided Theroux. Even when winning awards, he's been torn between pride and feeling unworthy. The limelight first blindsided him in the When Louis Met celebrity interview strand. The episode with UK politician Neil Hamilton and wife Christine saw him caught in the media commotion surrounding allegations of rape made against them (later discredited). ""I got into TV almost as a way of becoming invisible, in worlds where I was immersed in something remote from my daily concerns. But then I became the subject of tabloids and news reports. It wasn't comfortable,"" says Theroux. Louis Theroux has struggled with his feelings followng the revelations about Jimmy Savile But it's thefirst show he made with Jimmy Savile in 2000that left an indelible mark. Unsurprising, given what we know now. At the time Theroux could only say he felt Savile was ""really odd, like someone with something to hide"". The two struck up a kind of friendship, so the revelations about Savile's serial sexual abuse hit hard. ""I was stressed and upset and had a level of guilt, as part of me resisted believing,"" says Theroux. ""I've come to the conclusion it was an understandable human response. The extent of his offending was so broad, it took a while to get your head around it."" He revisited the story in 2016, concentrating on Savile's victims. Personally, he hoped it might ""exorcise"" the ghosts still haunting him. Louis Theroux looked into the world of mothers who have their new-born babies adopted in 2018's Take My Baby ""His victims have changed the landscape in the UK and how we think about historic sexual abuse or predatory behaviour by powerful people,"" says Theroux. ""But what also came across clearly is the way some victims don't always immediately recognise it."" The seriousness of the programme was illustrative of the shift in tone of Theroux's documentaries over the last decade. Mental illness, adoption, and rape on campus are among the issues he's covered.  The consistency lies in Theroux's human touch. The film-maker says he hopes to be remembered for ""showing human nature in an honest way that connects with people for years to come"". His view of humanity now is ""we are who we are"". ""That can be really positive, altruistic, self-sacrificing and sometimes really bonkers"". As for his attitude towards himself, he says: ""I'm at peace with not being at peace.""

Climate and Brexit dominate Johnson's UN agenda,"It is Boris Johnson's first visit to the United Nations as prime minister Climate change, instability in the Middle East and Brexit will be on the agenda when Boris Johnson meets other world leaders in New York next week. The prime minister will hold talks with Donald Trump, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel among others at the UN's annual General Assembly. He will also meet India's Narendra Modi and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. The Irish government has said ""quite a wide gap"" remains between it and the UK over a mutually acceptable Brexit deal. Speaking on Friday, its foreign minister Simon Coveney said the ""mood music"" had improved but claims the two sides were inching towards an agreement were ""spin"". The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October unless the bloc agrees to further extend the process. Mr Johnson has said he will not ask for another delay. Brexit secretary: EU and UK share common purpose Thousands join climate change protests across UK Saudi oil attack drones launched in Iran - US officials Although Brexit is not officially on the agenda of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly, a senior government official said they were ""sure it will come up"". Mr Johnson, who will arrive in New York on Sunday, will meet the German and French leaders as well as European Council president Donald Tusk. It is thought theywill discuss a series of ideas put forward bythe UK on Thursday aimed at breaking the current deadlock. ""What this gives the PM an opportunity to do is to talk to them at leader level about what some of our proposals are,"" the government official added. ""At the same time we are under no illusions that there's an awful lot of work to do."" The US and French leaders have very different views about Brexit The General Assembly is the largest gathering of world leaders in a single place - providing a forum to discuss issues of global concern. Nuclear disarmament, sustainable development and global healthcare are among the main issues are on the agenda, while a separate climate summit will start on Monday. Last week's attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia - which Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility for, but which the US blames on Iran - will also be discussed. As well as meeting Mr Trump for the second time since he became PM in July, Mr Johnson is also due to hold one-to-one meetings with the leaders of Turkey, Egypt, Ukraine and Jordan. The PM, who is expected to be accompanied on the trip by his partner Carrie Symonds, said he had three priorities for the upcoming meeting. ""First, how Britain can work with our European and American allies on peace and stability in the Middle East,"" he said. ""Second, how science and new technologies can help the world deal with climate change and the threats to biodiversity. ""And third, how post-Brexit Britain will be a better place to invest in and live in.""

Huge rise in catalytic converter theftsThe Met Police says catalytic converter thefts almost doubled due to precious metal prices rising.Business,"There has been a huge rise in catalytic converters being stolen from cars in 2019, police in London say. For the first six months of 2019, the number of thefts of catalytic converters jumped to 2,894, compared to 1,674 thefts for all of 2018. In a car's exhaust system, catalytic converters clean up harmful gases before they exit the exhaust pipe. In a video seen by the BBC, a criminal gang stole a catalytic converter in under three minutes in broad daylight. The prices of certain precious metals have skyrocketed in the last 18 months - palladium is now worth Â£1,300/oz, while rhodium goes for Â£4,000/oz, according to FJ Church and Sons, a specialist metals merchant that is also the UK's largest specialist in recycling catalytic converters. The police urged vehicle owners ""to be vigilant"" and consider taking safety measures to protect their cars. A catalytic converter is located in a box on the exhaust pipe under a car. In order to steal it, thieves slide under the car and use high-powered cutting tools to detach the box from the pipes around it. Although there are 10,000 different types of converters, the cars that are most often targeted are hybrid vehicles. Since hybrid cars have two power sources - electric and petrol or diesel - the catalytic converter is used less frequently to process pollutants. The metals are less likely to corrode, meaning they are worth more and thus attractive to thieves. Precious metals must be used because the converters have to work efficiently enough to meet emissions standards. The police has advised that vehicle owners consider taking the following safety measures: Mark catalytic converters with a serial number to make it distinctive Place a protective covering over the catalytic converter Install CCTV and alarms Park vehicles so as to prevent access underneath Carmaker Toyota is very concerned about the thefts, and says it is ""doing all [it] can"" to support its customers who have been victims of crime. Besides consulting with the police andoffering customers safety tips,external, Toyota has developed ""Catloc"", a device which makes it harder for thieves to detach the catalytic converter from the bottom of the car. ""Although 'cat theft' is not new, or limited to Toyota products, it has always been comparatively rare; however, the recent rise in the value of such parts for recycling has meant that police forces have seen a very significant rise in these offences in the last few months,"" said a Toyota spokesman. Toyota does not make money when replacing stolen catalytic converters in cars, and it is also bearing the cost to discount the Catloc device for its customers, while it researches more anti-theft technologies, the BBC understands. Honda has a different take on the matter - it says that Honda Accord and Jazz models from 2008 onwards come with a tray under the car to make it harder for thieves to get at the catalytic converter. And in car models from 2015 onwards, the catalytic converter has been placed within the engine bay, so a thief would need to disassemble the car to get at it. Dafydd Dylan, commercial manager of the catalytic converters division at FJ Church and Sons, told the BBC that his firm is constantly receiving calls from members of the public asking how much they could get if they were to sell catalytic converters from car models such as Totoya Prius, Honda Accord and Honda Jazz. ""We do what we can to discourage it - we don't purchase any units from these models unless they come from a reputable dealer,"" he said. He added that there were also ways to tell if suppliers were trying to sell stolen goods: ""When we get a packet, usually there will be a range of low-end and high-end catalytic converters in it. ""We have refused to work with some suppliers for certain packets containing a disproportionate amount of high-grade scrap converters."" Toyota says it is trying to support its customers while consulting with the police to improve anti-theft measures However, although it has been illegal to pay cash for scrap metal since 2013, he says there are some dealers who will pay cash for catalytic converters, which tempts the thieves. ""The police needs to start to put people in jail for paying cash for scrap metal - as soon as they do that, the trade would slow down and stop,"" he said. The British Metals Recycling Association agrees: ""It is unlikely that any stolen catalytic converters will enter a BMRA member yard due to 'know your customer' checks. ""However, there will be yards that operate illegally, willingly take stolen material and pay cash for it. There will also be no record of the transaction. This is due to the lack of enforcement of the Scrap Metals Dealers Act 2013 and its complementary legislation in Scotland, The Air Weapons Licensing Act 2015.""

Mass parachute drop to mark Battle of ArnhemPrince Charles will join veterans in the Netherlands on the 75th anniversary of the WW2 assault.,"This video can not be played Some 1,500 people, including a 97-year-old veteran, took part in the commemorative parachute jump A mass parachute drop has taken place in the Netherlands to mark the 75th anniversary of Operation Market Garden in World War Two. The Prince of Wales joined veterans at the commemorations to the allied assault in the Battle of Arnhem. Veteran Sandy Cortmann, 97, parachuted again over the Dutch city. British, US and Polish forces dropped behind enemy lines in 1944 but failed in their bid to secure eight bridges and open up a route into Germany. About 35,000 troops landed by parachute and gliders in what was then the largest airborne operation in history. The Prince of Wales and Princess Beatrix of The Netherlands mark the 75th anniversary Veterans also attended the commemorative service and wreath-laying at Ginkel Heath The Prince of Wales spoke to the former soldiers Veteran Sandy Cortmann, now 97, jumped with a member of the Red Devils parachute team Prince Charles and Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands and veterans attended a service and wreath-laying at the former landing zone of Ginkel Heath. Soldiers from the Parachute Regiment, of which the prince is colonel-in-chief, were among the 1,500 people who took part in the commemorative parachute drop. The prince later travelled to Driel for a service in honour of Polish forces, who had landed in the town during Operation Market Garden. Mr Cortmann, from Aberdeen,made a tandem jumpwith a parachutist from the Army's Red Devils display team over the Ginkel Heath nature reserve as part of the commemorations. He was just 22 when he parachuted into the same drop zone in September 1944, where he was taken prisoner by the Germans. Thousands of people watching from the ground applauded as Arnhem veteran Mr Cortmann landed. Mr Cortmann, 97, hugs his carer after the parachute jump Prince Charles later laid a wreath at a service for Polish airborne forces in Driel He described the jump as ""thoroughly terrifying"", and added: ""When the door opened I thought, Christ, what a way down."" But he said it was ""absolutely wonderful to see the ground so far below, my God"". Asked if the jump was similar to the one 75 years ago, he said: ""I can't remember much about the jump in 1944, we were just a bunch of young lads out for a good time if you like, but it turned out rather terrifying in the end with the guns and mortars and things opened up.

Huge rise in catalytic converter theftsThe Met Police says catalytic converter thefts almost doubled due to precious metal prices rising.,"There has been a huge rise in catalytic converters being stolen from cars in 2019, police in London say. For the first six months of 2019, the number of thefts of catalytic converters jumped to 2,894, compared to 1,674 thefts for all of 2018. In a car's exhaust system, catalytic converters clean up harmful gases before they exit the exhaust pipe. In a video seen by the BBC, a criminal gang stole a catalytic converter in under three minutes in broad daylight. The prices of certain precious metals have skyrocketed in the last 18 months - palladium is now worth Â£1,300/oz, while rhodium goes for Â£4,000/oz, according to FJ Church and Sons, a specialist metals merchant that is also the UK's largest specialist in recycling catalytic converters. The police urged vehicle owners ""to be vigilant"" and consider taking safety measures to protect their cars. A catalytic converter is located in a box on the exhaust pipe under a car. In order to steal it, thieves slide under the car and use high-powered cutting tools to detach the box from the pipes around it. Although there are 10,000 different types of converters, the cars that are most often targeted are hybrid vehicles. Since hybrid cars have two power sources - electric and petrol or diesel - the catalytic converter is used less frequently to process pollutants. The metals are less likely to corrode, meaning they are worth more and thus attractive to thieves. Precious metals must be used because the converters have to work efficiently enough to meet emissions standards. The police has advised that vehicle owners consider taking the following safety measures: Mark catalytic converters with a serial number to make it distinctive Place a protective covering over the catalytic converter Install CCTV and alarms Park vehicles so as to prevent access underneath Carmaker Toyota is very concerned about the thefts, and says it is ""doing all [it] can"" to support its customers who have been victims of crime. Besides consulting with the police andoffering customers safety tips,external, Toyota has developed ""Catloc"", a device which makes it harder for thieves to detach the catalytic converter from the bottom of the car. ""Although 'cat theft' is not new, or limited to Toyota products, it has always been comparatively rare; however, the recent rise in the value of such parts for recycling has meant that police forces have seen a very significant rise in these offences in the last few months,"" said a Toyota spokesman. Toyota does not make money when replacing stolen catalytic converters in cars, and it is also bearing the cost to discount the Catloc device for its customers, while it researches more anti-theft technologies, the BBC understands. Honda has a different take on the matter - it says that Honda Accord and Jazz models from 2008 onwards come with a tray under the car to make it harder for thieves to get at the catalytic converter. And in car models from 2015 onwards, the catalytic converter has been placed within the engine bay, so a thief would need to disassemble the car to get at it. Dafydd Dylan, commercial manager of the catalytic converters division at FJ Church and Sons, told the BBC that his firm is constantly receiving calls from members of the public asking how much they could get if they were to sell catalytic converters from car models such as Totoya Prius, Honda Accord and Honda Jazz. ""We do what we can to discourage it - we don't purchase any units from these models unless they come from a reputable dealer,"" he said. He added that there were also ways to tell if suppliers were trying to sell stolen goods: ""When we get a packet, usually there will be a range of low-end and high-end catalytic converters in it. ""We have refused to work with some suppliers for certain packets containing a disproportionate amount of high-grade scrap converters."" Toyota says it is trying to support its customers while consulting with the police to improve anti-theft measures However, although it has been illegal to pay cash for scrap metal since 2013, he says there are some dealers who will pay cash for catalytic converters, which tempts the thieves. ""The police needs to start to put people in jail for paying cash for scrap metal - as soon as they do that, the trade would slow down and stop,"" he said. The British Metals Recycling Association agrees: ""It is unlikely that any stolen catalytic converters will enter a BMRA member yard due to 'know your customer' checks. ""However, there will be yards that operate illegally, willingly take stolen material and pay cash for it. There will also be no record of the transaction. This is due to the lack of enforcement of the Scrap Metals Dealers Act 2013 and its complementary legislation in Scotland, The Air Weapons Licensing Act 2015.""

"'Dose of reality needed' over Brexit deal hopesThere is still a wide gap between the UK and EU in talks about a new deal, says the Irish deputy PM.Europe","A no-deal Brexit would be damaging and difficult, says Simon Coveney There is still a ""wide gap"" between the UK and EU in their talks about a new Brexit deal, the Irish deputy prime minister has said. Simon Coveney said ""everyone needs a dose of reality"" after reports had emerged that progress had been made. Speaking on Friday, he said the EU was still waiting for ""serious proposals"" from the UK for an alternative to the Irish border backstop. The backstop has been the key sticking point in the Brexit deal debate. What happens next if PM gets Brexit deal? What are Irish border backstop options? UK shares Brexit documents with EU It is the controversial policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, unless and until another solution is found. It was a key part of the withdrawal agreement struck with the EU by former prime minister Theresa May and some MPs' opposition to the policy led to the deal being rejected three times by Parliament. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Mr Coveney told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There is still quite a wide gap between what the British government have been talking about in terms of the solutions they are proposing and what Ireland and the EU can support. He said that while the ""mood music"" had improved they two sides were ""not close to that deal right now"". ""We've got to be honest... there are serious problems that arise because of the change in approach by the British prime minister,"" he added. ""Asking to remove a very significant section within the withdrawal agreement that solves many of the Irish issues without any serious proposals on how you solve those problems is not going to be the basis for an agreement."" The issue of the Irish border has been the key sticking point in the Brexit talks Mr Coveney also said the Republic of Ireland ""is in no doubt what a a no-deal would mean for us"", adding that it would be ""damaging and difficult and poses huge questions"". Brexit SecretaryStephen Barclay is to hold talks with the EU's chief negotiatorMichel Barnier on Friday. It comes after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said a new Brexit deal could still be reached before the 31 October deadline. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday he did not want to ""exaggerate progress"" but some was being made. He has urged the EU to scrap the backstop and has insisted he wants to leave the EU - with or without a deal - by the end of October. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has suggestedthe North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) could have a rolein finding a solution to the deadlock over the Irish border. It is the main body for cross-border cooperation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson suggested that new arrangements to deal with cross-border trade after Brexit could involve the NSMC. His party has consistently opposed the backstop but has recently softened its language on the matter, saying it would be open to all-island arrangements on issues such as food standards.

Mass parachute drop to mark Battle of Arnhem,"This video can not be played Some 1,500 people, including a 97-year-old veteran, took part in the commemorative parachute jump A mass parachute drop has taken place in the Netherlands to mark the 75th anniversary of Operation Market Garden in World War Two. The Prince of Wales joined veterans at the commemorations to the allied assault in the Battle of Arnhem. Veteran Sandy Cortmann, 97, parachuted again over the Dutch city. British, US and Polish forces dropped behind enemy lines in 1944 but failed in their bid to secure eight bridges and open up a route into Germany. About 35,000 troops landed by parachute and gliders in what was then the largest airborne operation in history. The Prince of Wales and Princess Beatrix of The Netherlands mark the 75th anniversary Veterans also attended the commemorative service and wreath-laying at Ginkel Heath The Prince of Wales spoke to the former soldiers Veteran Sandy Cortmann, now 97, jumped with a member of the Red Devils parachute team Prince Charles and Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands and veterans attended a service and wreath-laying at the former landing zone of Ginkel Heath. Soldiers from the Parachute Regiment, of which the prince is colonel-in-chief, were among the 1,500 people who took part in the commemorative parachute drop. The prince later travelled to Driel for a service in honour of Polish forces, who had landed in the town during Operation Market Garden. Mr Cortmann, from Aberdeen,made a tandem jumpwith a parachutist from the Army's Red Devils display team over the Ginkel Heath nature reserve as part of the commemorations. He was just 22 when he parachuted into the same drop zone in September 1944, where he was taken prisoner by the Germans. Thousands of people watching from the ground applauded as Arnhem veteran Mr Cortmann landed. Mr Cortmann, 97, hugs his carer after the parachute jump Prince Charles later laid a wreath at a service for Polish airborne forces in Driel He described the jump as ""thoroughly terrifying"", and added: ""When the door opened I thought, Christ, what a way down."" But he said it was ""absolutely wonderful to see the ground so far below, my God"". Asked if the jump was similar to the one 75 years ago, he said: ""I can't remember much about the jump in 1944, we were just a bunch of young lads out for a good time if you like, but it turned out rather terrifying in the end with the guns and mortars and things opened up. They were all aimed at us.""
