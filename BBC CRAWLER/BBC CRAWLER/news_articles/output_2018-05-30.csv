Mum 'asked to prove' mixed-race son,"Lindsay Gottlieb and her fiance were asked to prove their son was theirs despite having his passport Southwest Airlines has apologised after one of its employees asked a California basketball coach to prove that she was the mother of her bi-racial son. Lindsay Gottlieb, who is white, and her fiance Patrick Martin, who is African American, were both present and showed the official their son's passport. She says after showing his passport she was asked for further evidence through a Facebook post or birth certificate. The airline said it would use the incident to ""coach"" employees. Ms Gottlieb, who is the head coach of the University of California, Berkeley women's basketball team, called the incident ""demeaning and insensitive, not to mention inefficient"" on Twitter. ""I'm appalled that after approx 50 times flying with my 1 year old son, ticket counter personnel told me I had to 'prove' that he was my son, despite having his passport,"" Ms Gottlieb wrote. ""She said because we have different last name. My guess is because he has a different skin colour."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

British father dies in Turkish airport,"A 30-year-old British man from County Durham has died, apparently after a fall from a balcony at Dalaman airport in Turkey. Andrew Westlake had been on his first foreign holiday with his partner and one-year-old daughter. His relatives have asked to see CCTV footage from the airport to establish what happened. As Mr Westlake did not have travel insurance, the family have been asked to pay a â¬9,000 hospital bill. A Foreign Office spokesman said officials were supporting Mr Westlake's family and were in touch with local authorities investigating the death. Local news agency Dogan said that before his death the British man had been at the airport for three days. Once on a plane he reportedly argued with cabin crew and was subsequently escorted off for ""putting the flight at risk"". His aunt Pauline Butler said: ""We are still in the dark about what has happened."" Perry Sheldon from Dudley, North Tyneside, who boarded the flight with Mr Westlake, said his fellow passenger appeared ""on edge"". Mr Westlake had told Mr Sheldon that he had been kicked off a previous flight due to ""blisters on his feet from sunburn"". ""He said there were signs up saying people should not wash their feet and when they questioned him about it, they said it was an insult to their culture,"" said Mr Sheldon. Twenty minutes after boarding Mr Sheldon says Mr Westlake was removed from the plane. He said: ""He [Mr Westlake] didn't act aggressively in any way, he just stood up and got off. ""All he did was say to the man next to him 'I told you that would happen'."" The airline, Jet2, has released a statement confirming that one of their customers died at the airport. It said the man was not injured on or in the vicinity of their aircraft. A spokesman for Durham Constabulary said: ""Our officers passed the devastating news to the family who we are supporting. Our thoughts are with Andrew's family and friends.""

Why Kim Kardashian was visiting Trump,"Kardashian arrives at the White House on an overcast afternoon Kim Kardashian West has met President Donald Trump to discuss a potential pardon for a 63-year-old great-grandmother who is serving life in prison. Alice Marie Johnson has been behind bars for more than two decades for a first-time drug offence. Mr Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has also been speaking with Mrs Kardashian West about the case for months. President Trump tweeted that they had a ""great meeting"". Allow Twitter content?

Alice Marie Johnson Johnson was sentenced to life in prison without parole in 1996 for a first-time, non-violent drug offence. She was convicted for her role, along with 15 others, in a large cocaine distribution ring in Tennessee. According to her family and supporters, Johnson has been a model inmate who is active in many programmes, including work in the prison hospice. She fitted all of the criteria for former President Barack Obama's Clemency Project 2014, but was denied just days before the end of his term. ""This is the last time I'll put my family through the heartache of expectations,"" Johnson told the BBC at the time. Despite that, Mrs Kardashian West's interest appears to have revitalised the effort. Amy Povah, the founder of CAN-DO Clemency, has been advocating for Johnson's release since 2014 and says she has helped collect signatures from 70 organisations who support the pardon, as well as a letter of support from the retired warden of Johnson's prison. All of that material may be submitted to President Trump. ""She's always stood out to me as being exceptional,"" says Ms Povah. ""She's not bitter or angry, she's this ray of sunshine."" The pardon process is entirely up to the president's discretion, and it is unknown at this point whether he plans to announce a decision to coincide with Mrs Kardashian West's visit. Johnson's daughters remain hopeful that - at least for their family - the long wait may soon be over. ""We are praying for mercy in my mom's caseâ¦ that this nightmare is finally coming to an end,"" Tretessa Johnson told the BBC. Many on social media have been critical of Mrs Kardashian West's unlikely role as a prison reform advocate and say there are thousands of cases that deserve closer examination. Some have questioned her credentials to speak on the subject, suggesting there are more qualified people who should have met Mr Trump. Allow Twitter content?

Disabled woman placed on 18th floor at Grenfell,"This video can not be played Nazanin Aghlani (left): ""It was not only the horrifying fire that took my mum's life that night."" A woman whose disabled mother, Sakineh Afrasiabi, died in Grenfell Tower has criticised the council for housing her on the 18th floor of the block. Nazanin Aghlani said her 65-year-old mother's ""human right to escape"" was impeded by housing her so high up. She said: ""Our mum lost her life not only due to the fire that night, but to the corporate negligence of the very people who were to ensure her safety."" Ms Afrasiabi was partially sighted and got around using a tri-walker. Who were the victims? What can we expect from the inquiry? The Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast with Eddie Mair Speaking on the seventh and final day of the inquiry's commemoration hearings, Ms Aghlani said the council told her mother in 2003 that she should not be housed above the fourth floor of any building. But - ""after being refused many suitable properties"" - in 2016 she moved into a flat on the 18th floor of Grenfell Tower ""out of desperation"". Sakineh Afrasiabia was described by her daughter as a ""vulnerable, physically disabled and partially sighted pensioner"" Her daughter, Ms Aghlani said: ""Every day, again and again, as our mind tries to make sense of this disastrous tragedy, we come to the conclusion that it was not only the horrifying fire that took my mum's life that night. ""The discrimination and failure in duty of care by the housing allocations team which resulted in a vulnerable, physically disabled and partially sighted pensioner being housed on the 18th floor of a tower block equally took the life of my mum. ""The very people who said, years before, that she was not to be housed above the fourth floor of a lifted building. ""She couldn't go down 18 floors of stairs on a good day, let alone in a fire. Her human right to escape was denied even before the fire happened."" Ms Afrasiabi, who was from Iran, moved to the UK in 1997. Fatemeh Afrasiabi (left) died after visiting her sister Sakineh at Grenfell Tower The 65-year-old grandmother died alongside her sister Fatemeh, who had been visiting her. The inquiry had previously heard that on the night of the fireMs Afrasiabi and her older sister Fatemeh had gone to the 23rd floor,where they ""believed that help was coming from above"" to rescue them. The inquiry heard that Fatemah's husband was unable to pay tribute to the mother of five because his immigration application was refused. Day 1: Tribute to baby as Grenfell inquiry opens Day 2: Families walk out as Grenfell video shown Day 3: Victim's son 'prays for death' to join father in heaven Day 4: Grenfell niece tribute distress for aunt Day 5: 'We will never play again' Day 6: Grenfell Tower dad blames firefighters A man who died sheltering six people in his top-floor flat as they tried to escape the Grenfell Tower fire has been hailed a hero by his sister. Raymond ""Moses"" Bernard, 64, gave refuge to neighbours who were unable to find a way down, his sister Bernadette told the inquiry. This video can not be played Ray ""was a hero"" that night as others sought refuge in his flat The father of three ""did not deserve to die by suffocation, cyanide poisoning and ultimately burned"" she said. Ms Bernard said the six people found in her brother's 23rd floor flat included: Deborah Lamprell, 45 Jessica Urbano (Ramirez), 12 Berkti Haftom, 29, and her son Biruk Haftom, 12 Hamid Kani, 61 ""As there was no way down to escape the only alternative was to head to the top floor. There they met Ray and took refuge in his flat,"" Ms Bernard said. Raymond ""Moses"" Bernard lived in a flat on the 23rd floor She said the other residents were found on her brother's bed, while he was beside the bed on the floor. ""This shows the respect he gave to those who lost their lives that night, and we know that he would have given comfort to each of them before they took their last breaths and departed this world,"" she said. ""We know from the detail shared with us by the coroner that Ray was a hero on that tragic night."" She said her brother, who died with his dog Marley, ""should not have been killed in this way"". ""Sadly where there is no justice there is no peace. I will never forget, I will never forgive."" Khadija Khaloufi's brother was unable to pay tribute to his sister because of visa delays Karim Khaloufi, the younger brother of 52-year-old victim Khadija Khaloufi, was also unable to attend the inquiry after delays with his visa. Mrs Khaloufi lived on the 17th floor with her husband of 27 years, Sabah Abdullah, who survived the fire. Her brother said in his statement: ""We had been led to believe that we could be in London for the inquiry, but now does not seem to be the case. ""No-one seems to care about our history or relationship to this case, or to care about our pain, our heartache or our desire for answers."" Counsel to the inquiry Bernard Richmond said ""very strenuous efforts"" were made to try to get him to the hearing. Farah Hamdan, pictured with her husband Omar Belkadi, and baby Leena were found in a stairwell between the 19th and 20th floor Hamdan El Alami wept as he paid tribute to his daughter Farah Hamdan, who died in the fire with her husband Omar Belkadi and their daughters Malak Belkadi, eight, and baby Leena Belkadi. Six-month-old Leena, who died from inhalation of fire fumes, was found dead in her mother's arms in a stairwell between the 19th and 20th floor. Speaking through a translator, Mr El Alami described seeing his family for the last time, saying: ""I did not know that that night was the night when they will die."" Said Essaouini (centre) pays tribute to his wife Isra Ibrahim The husband of 33-year-old Isra Ibrahim, who died alongside her brother and mother on the 23rd floor, told the inquiry he spends two hours at her grave every week. Said Essaouini said: ""I feel like I lost my world. Every Friday I go to the cemetery and I sit down and I talk to her for two hours - I know she is listening to me and I know she loved me to the max as well."" He said he wished he had been with his wife on the night of the fire but she had sent him to the mosque. ""I believe she could have escaped the fire if she wanted to but she didn't want to leave her mother,"" he said. ""I will never find no-one like her, never ever, ever a woman like Isra again, and I am ripped up to pieces."" Meanwhile, a report has found there was a ""badly flawed"" response to the fire. The review by Muslim Aid criticised ""weak leadership"" at Kensington and Chelsea Council andfound volunteers were left ""on the front line"" helping residents find food and shelter. The council said it could not comment due to an ongoing public inquiry. By Duncan Leatherdale, BBC News For seven days, dozens of relatives have spoken, showed videos and offered pen portraits to 67 loved ones. The last day saw each speaker receive a standing ovation at the end of their time on stage, even when it was a solicitor reading the words. The final tribute, a video to the Choucair family, was paused halfway through as a member of the audience required medical treatment. There was then further delay while Nabil Choucair, who was paying tribute to six members of his family, also received medical attention. He was determined to see the tribute through, however, and returned to the stage to a standing ovation and cries of ""we love you Nabil"". The video resumed with a short film made by 13-year-old Mierna Choucair, before she died, about her morning routine. It also featured cameos from her sisters. A video by 13-year-old victim Mierna Choucair was played at the inquiry There were laughs from the audience, especially at the blooper reel, but also a palpable sense that we were seeing three young lives soon to be lost. Nabil's video ended with a picture of his sister, Nadia, waving for help from the window of their flat as it burned. Nabil ended with a national call for justice. The hearing ended with the reading of the 72 names followed by 72 seconds of silence. It was a supremely poignant ending to the commemorations. Getting to know the deceased has finished, next up are the big questions about how they came to die. That starts on Monday. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims?

Top North Korean official arrives in US,"Until recently, Kim Yong-chol (left) was blacklisted in the United States The right-hand man to North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have concluded two days of talks in New York. Gen Kim Yong-chol flew from China on Wednesday to discuss a historic summit between the two nation's leaders. He is the most senior North Korean to visit the US in nearly 20 years. US President Donald Trump has told reporters he expects Gen Kim to come to Washington DC on Friday and deliver a letter from Kim Jong-un. Speaking aboard Air Force One on his way to Texas, Mr Trump said the envoy will ""be coming most likely tomorrow to the White House to present me with a letter from Kim Jong-un"". President Trump cancelled the 12 June summit, but both sides have since made fresh efforts to revive the plan. Scheduled to happen in Singapore, the historic meeting between Mr Trump and Kim Jong-un would be the first between sitting US and North Korean leaders. Thursday's talks concluded early due to progress being made, a US state department official said. Mr Pompeo tweeted after the meeting that the talks had been ""substantive"". Allow Twitter content?

North Korea has strongly objected to statements by Trump administration members comparing North Korean denuclearisation to Libya's. Former Libyan leader Colonel Gaddafi gave up his nuclear programme only for him to be killed by Western-backed rebels a few years later. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders confirmed the US and North Korean leaders still planned to meet next month. ""As the president says, if it happens, we'll certainly be ready,"" she said. They met in an apartment on New York's East Side By Barbara Plett Usher, BBC state department correspondent in New York Just months ago the idea that this powerful North Korean official could visit New York was unthinkable. Until recently Kim Yong-chol was blacklisted in the US. A senior state department official said he and Mr Pompeo were trying to get to know each other after initial meetings in Pyongyang earlier this year. But he also said they needed to reduce the gap between them over the extent and pace of nuclear disarmament before the summit could go ahead. He also acknowledged that the US had to find a way to convince the North Korean leadership it would be secure without such weapons. But this high-level meeting shows that President Trump and Kim Jong-un want the summit to take place, and therefore many believe these two men will find a way to make it happen. North Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui has also met Sung Kim, a former US ambassador to South Korea, at Panmunjom on the border between the two Koreas. The two diplomats have faced one another before during previous denuclearisation negotiations. This video can not be played The nuclear word Trump and Kim can't agree on In Singapore itself, a US team led by White House official Joe Hagin is thought to be meeting Kim Chang-son, the de facto chief of staff to the North Korean leader, to talk about logistics. Analysis: Decoding Trump's letter to Kim 'My country was trying to test Trump' Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov is in Pyongyang for talks with Mr Kim, the first time the North Korean leader has met a senior Russian official. Sergei Lavrov arrived in Pyongyang on Thursday Mr Lavrov extended an invitation to Mr Kim to visit Moscow. Mr Lavrov also spoke to Mr Pompeo for the first time on Wednesday, by phone.

Trump signs drug law for terminally ill,"Nine-year-old Jordan McLinn, who has muscular dystrophy, shook Mr Trump's hand President Donald Trump has signed a bill giving terminally ill patients the right to try experimental treatments not approved by the government. Patients were able to apply to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for access to non-approved drugs before, and most were granted permission. The new bill does not mandate that drug makers give access to unapproved drugs to patients asking for them. Advocacy groups including the American Cancer Society had opposed the bill. ""America is a nation of fighters. We never give up, right?"" Mr Trump said to patients and their families during a bill signing ceremony at the White House on Wednesday. After signing the bill, Mr Trump handed his pen to nine-year-old Jordan McLinn, who has been diagnosed with a form of terminal muscular dystrophy. Jordan, who the bill is named for, has been accepted into a clinical programme in Chicago where he has been receiving weekly infusions. He and his mother, Laura, had travelled from Indianapolis for the White House event. The new Right to Try act allows patients with life-threatening diseases to bypass the FDA's application process for ""compassionate use,external"" of experimental drugs. Patients seeking access to ""investigational drugs"" now need only the approval of their physician and the drug manufacturer. The new bill protects doctors and companies from the legal risks of allowing unapproved treatments unless they intentionally harm a patient. The policy that patients must have exhausted all other approved treatments and clinical trial options remains. Why I injected myself with an untested gene therapy Trump: Other nations extort drug-makers Why some cancers are 'born to be bad' In Mr Trump's State of the Union address in January, he called upon Congress to pass the bill, saying ""patients with terminal conditions, and terminal illness, should have access to experimental treatment immediately"" and ""should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure"". FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, a physician and a cancer survivor,had expressed concerns to Congress last year,externaleven as he said the agency was ready to implement the bill. ""The clinical trial process is crucial to the development of innovative new medical products that can improve or save patients' lives,"" he said to Congress. Dr Gottlieb said there had to be a balance between giving patients access to investigational therapies and testing that ensures new products are safe and effective. Under the FDA's prior rules governing ""compassionate use"",99% of patient applications have been granted,externalsince 2009. Most requests are granted within a few days, and in emergency situations, often immediately via phone. Commissioner Scott Gottlieb expressed concerns about the bill to Congress last year Notably, going through the FDA allows the agency to modify experimental treatments to individuals to improve patient safety. Advocacy groups who opposed the bill claimed it gives patients false hope since pharmaceutical companies are not required to give terminally ill patients the experimental treatments they might request. In a letter,externaladdressed to Speaker Paul Ryan and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, 38 groups said removing the FDA from the equation would ""likely do more harm than good"". Forty states have passed Right to Try laws of their own. In order to be approved by the FDA,drugs must go through several phases of clinical trials,external. The process often means years of testing. First, the drug manufacturer must prove the drug is safe for humans. These trials can have as few as 30 patients, and 70% of drugs move to the next trial. Then, the manufacturer must prove the drug is an effective treatment for the condition it is being marketed for. Importantly, the drug cannot have severe side effects. Only 33% of drugs proposed make it through this stage. During the next phase, which can take up to four years, the company must test the drug on 300 to 3,000 patients with the disease the drug is designed to treat.

Melania Trump tweets to quell rumours,"Mrs Trump did not attend a fitness day event at the White House on Wednesday US First Lady Melania Trump, not seen in public since a hospital operation this month, has sought to scotch rumours about her health and marriage. ""Rest assured, I'm here at the @WhiteHouse w my family,"" a tweet posted on her account says. Gossip has mounted in the 20 days since she was last seen, with President Donald Trump as he welcomed home three US detainees from North Korea. The White House has already dismissed claims about the Trumps' relationship. On Twitter, some suggested her husband had actually written the tweet that appeared on her account on Wednesday.

""The procedure was successful and there were no complications,"" a statement from the White House said after her release on 20 May. Ivanka Trump attended Wednesday's White House event in her stepmother's absence But her five-day hospital stay for what was described as relatively minor surgery did little to stop tongues wagging. She has not been pictured since then, and has only released one previous tweet referring to her medical treatment. Wild theories have circulated online, including that Mrs Trump has moved back to New York with their son, Barron, or that she is co-operating with special counsel Robert Mueller. Mr Trump swings a golf club during Wednesday's event on the White House lawn After she skipped the White House Sports and Fitness Day on Wednesday - an event heavily promoted by former First Lady Michelle Obama - the speculation only intensified.

On Tuesday, the first lady's spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, told Politico: ""Sadly, we deal with conspiracy theories all the time, so this is nothing new, just more silly nonsense. ""She is doing great. I wouldn't characterise it as a long absence. She was hospitalised for almost a week and is now home and recovering."" During her hospital stay, Mrs Trump tweeted about a school shooting in Texas, a Navy Seal who was awarded a Medal of Honor, and in support of the military on Memorial Day. Mrs Trump (left) was last seen welcoming home former US prisoners from North Korea on 10 May She earlier this month launched Be Best, an initiative to teach kindness to children. Weeks ago, the White House rebutted claims the first lady was living away from the White House because she and the president were supposedly estranged. The Washington Post reported on rumours that Mrs Trump was living with her parents, Amalija Knavs and Viktor Knavs, in a Washington suburb. Such political gossip can seem as cyclical in the nation's capital as its cherry blossoms. Unfounded claims were spread in Washington social circles during the last administration that President Barack Obama had filed for divorce from Mrs Obama.

Big business issues Brexit warning to May,"A group of major European companies has warned the Prime Minister they may cut investment without more clarity over the terms of Britain's EU exit. Business leaders, including from BP, BMW, Nestle, and Vodafone, told Theresa May that ""time is running out"". In a statement after the Downing Street meeting, they said that a trade deal with the EU must be ""frictionless as with a customs union"". Downing Street said that the meeting had been ""open and productive"". The industry leaders warned that ""uncertainty causes less investment."" The group, known as the European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT), includes BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg and his Nestle counterpart Paul Bulcke. Others at the meeting were the chief executives of Vodafone, Vittorio Colao, and Royal Mail, Moya Greene. Senior figures from firms including BMW, Phillips, E.On and Ferrovial also attended the meeting with Mrs May and Brexit secretary David Davis. The ERT represents Europe's 50 largest companies, with combined revenues of 2.25 trillion euros (Â£2tn) and millions of employees. Why is the customs union so important?

In its statement, the ERT said: ""The uninterrupted flow of goods is essential to both the EU and UK economies. This must be frictionless as with a customs union. ""We need clarity and certainty, because time is running out. Uncertainty causes less investment."" A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the PM told the business leaders that work was under way on two customs models, ""and underlined the importance of ensuring that our future trading arrangements with the EU are as frictionless as possible"". She restated a commitment to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and allowing the UK to pursue an independent trade policy. ""The PM recognised the necessity of providing certainty for businesses, pointing to the agreement of an implementation period at the European Council in March to provide time to allow businesses to prepare for the new arrangements,"" the spokeswoman said.

Conservatives accused of Islamophobia,"Theresa May should publicly acknowledge that Islamophobia is a problem in the Conservative Party, former party chairman Baroness Warsi has said. Parts of the party had been ""in denial"" about the issue and a ""clear statement"" was needed about what was to be done to tackle it, she told the BBC. The Muslim Council of Britain has urged the Tories to launch an independent inquiry into alleged Islamophobia. A Tory spokesman said it took all incidents of Islamophobia seriously. The Muslim Council of Britain has repeatedly demanded an investigation, and says there are now ""more than weekly incidents"" involving Tory candidates and representatives. In an open letter, it tells chairman Brandon Lewis he must ""ensure racists and bigots have no place"" in the party.

""Up to now, sadly, there are certain parts of the party that have been in denial about this issue.""

Baroness Warsi said a ""clear process"" must be set out - be it an internal inquiry or an independent inquiry whose findings should be published and followed by a ""programme of education"". She also suggested that one of the reasons the Conservatives lost ground in previous elections was because of a loss of support among Muslims and other voters from ethnic minorities.

Goldie fined for Glastonbury assaultThe musician attacked a security guard who refused to let his daughter go backstage at the festival.4h4 hours agoSomerset,"This video can not be played Goldie said he was ""always sorry"" but then asked what he had done Drum and bass star Goldie has been ordered to pay almost Â£2,500 for assaulting a security guard at last year's Glastonbury Festival. The DJ and actor - real name Clifford Joseph Price - attacked bouncer Dennis Poole on 23 June. The court heard Mr Poole was assaulted after he refused to let Price's daughter go backstage. Price, 52, of Tring, Hertfordshire, was fined Â£1,080 at Bristol Magistrates' Court. He was also told to pay compensation of Â£500 and costs of Â£883. Charges against Goldie's daughter Chance Price were dismissed Price was described as acting like a ""raging bull"" when Mr Poole refused him and his daughter access to a restricted area. The court heard Chance Price, 20, and her friend had attempted to gain entry to the restricted area at about 19:00 BST. They had been ""whisked"" into the BBC area, where Price was due to be interviewed by BBC Radio 1's Annie Mac, without passes but were stopped when they tried to re-enter after leaving to buy food. Ms Price phoned her father for assistance but when he arrived it was noted that he also did not have the required wristband for the area. Witnesses described how Price ""puffed his chest out"" before pushing Mr Poole back and placing him in a headlock. Both men ended up on the floor, with the security guard suffering scratches to his face and neck, a sore ear and a grazed elbow. Dennis Poole was attacked after he refused to let Price's daughter go backstage Price initially claimed he had acted in self defence but subsequentlypreviously admitted the offence in March via Facetime from Thailand. He appeared in person alongside his daughter for sentencing on Wednesday. Prosecutors offered no evidence against Ms Price, of Leavesden, Hertfordshire, and the case against her was dismissed. District Judge David Taylor told Price: ""Your entirely unjustified actions demonstrate an arrogant sense of entitlement based on your own self importance. ""The physical injuries sustained by Mr Poole at your hands were relatively minor but the assault has had an emotional and psychological impact on him. ""This was an assault on a man simply doing his job."" In a victim personal statement read to the court, Mr Poole said he had been forced to give up his career of six years. He said: ""He came right up in my face, he was telling me he could do what he wanted."" The actor and producer appeared in Strictly Come Dancing in 2010 Speaking outside the court, Price said he was ""apologising as a man would do"". He added: ""I took a bullet for my daughter, I'm happy. ""Hopefully he can move on and understand if you're doing your job do it right."" Price, who was born in Walsall, West Midlands, made his name as a music producer in the 1990s when the rave scene was at its peak.

White House defiant on Roseanne race row,"This video can not be played White House defends Trump's reaction to Roseanne firing The White House has accused the entertainment industry of ""hypocrisy"" over its condemnation of Roseanne Barr following a racist tweet. Its press secretary suggested liberal TV stars suffered no consequences for saying ""the most horrible things"" about President Donald Trump. The president himself earlier tweeted to suggest a double standard by TV executives. Barr said she was considering fighting back after her show was cancelled. On Wednesday, President Trump broke his silence on Barr, who has been one of his most outspoken supporters. He jabbed on Twitter at Disney chief executive Bob Iger, who apologised to African-American former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett after Barr's Monday night tweet likening her to an ape.

Disney is the parent company of ABC TV network, which on Tuesday dropped the rebooted '90s sitcom ""Roseanne"" amid a ferocious online backlash against its star. At the White House daily press briefing, the president's spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, expanded on Mr Trump's tweet. ""The president pointed to the hypocrisy in the media saying the most horrible things about this president and nobody addresses it,"" said Mrs Sanders. She said Mr Iger did not say sorry for ESPN presenter Jemele Hill calling Mr Trump a white supremacist. Disney also owns ESPN, a sports channel.

""This is a double standard that the president is speaking about,"" Mrs Sanders concluded, ""no one is defending her [Barr's] comments, they're inappropriate."" At the end of the news conference, one reporter shouted: ""Where is the president's apology for the things he's said over the years?"" Mrs Sanders walked out without answering.

The streaming service Hulu also said it would be removing the sitcom from its library. Her revived show's premiere in March pulled in more than 25 million people, with delayed viewing counted in.

Japanese hunters kill 122 pregnant whales,"Activists have called Japan's programme ""an illegal whale hunt"" Japanese hunters caught and killed 122 pregnant minke whales as part of its Antarctic summer ""field survey"". A report sent to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) reveals hunters caught 333 minkes in total. The team left Japan in November 2017 for the Southern Ocean and returned in March 2018. Japan says its whaling programme is for scientific purposes, despite a 2014 UN ruling against its ""lethal research"" and widespread condemnation. In a new research plan published after the UN ruling,Japan said it was ""scientifically imperative"" to understand Antarctica's ecosystem,externalthrough collecting and analysing animals. Japan to resume whaling in Antarctic Why Japan keeps on whaling Is Japan losing the taste for whale meat? The country's New Scientific Whale Research Program in the Antarctic Ocean (NEWREP-A) senta report to the IWC,externaldetailing the 333 minkes caught, 152 male and 181 female, during its ""third biological field survey"" in the area. Japan cut down its catch by two-thirds under its new research plan, and has stuck to taking about 330 whales each year. The data shows that in the 2017/18 hunt, 122 of the female minkes captured were pregnant, while 61 of the males and 53 of the females were not yet adults. After a few weeks of surveys, the team caught all the whales within just 12 weeks before setting off back to Japan. The whale meat is then sold to be eaten. Japan makes no secret of the fact that the meat resulting from its so-called scientific whaling programme ends up on the plate Under Article VIII of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, signed in 1946, countries can ""kill, take and treat whales for purposes of scientific research"", and this is the rule Japan says it follows in its hunts. Aside from its research claims, the Japanese government says whale hunting is an ancient part of Japan's culture. Coastal communities in Chiba prefecture and Ishinomaki in northern Japan have long practised coastal whaling, while Taiji in Wakayama prefecture holds annual dolphin hunts. Once a staple, now a novelty However, expeditions to the Antarctic for whale meat only began after World War Two, when the devastated country depended on whales as its main source of meat. While the meat is still sold, it is increasingly unpopular, with far fewer businesses selling it now than in the past. Figures from charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC) show thatmany countries other than Japan still catch whales,external. The International Whaling Commission (IWC), which regulates the industry, agreed to a moratorium on commercial whaling from the 1985, with exceptions. Norway and Iceland still hunt whales for meat, the former rejecting the moratorium and the latter only partially agreeing. Iceland still hunts whales So-called aboriginal subsistence whaling for local communities continues in Greenland, Russia, the USA, and St Vincent and the Grenadines. But Japan remains the only country to send ships to Antarctica to catch whales, under the scientific research exemption. Japan says it is conducting its research to show the Antarctic whale population is healthy and can be sustainably fished. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) saysthere is insufficient data to determine whether the Antarctic minke whale is threatened,external. While the number of minkes is ""clearly in the hundreds of thousands"", they are investigating a possible decline over the last 50 years. Depending on how significant the drop is, the Antarctic minke could be classified as Least Concern, or as Endangered.

"Pair admit Â£125,000 Grenfell fire fraud","Elaine Douglas and Tommy Brooks claimed they lived on the 19th floor of Grenfell Tower Two illegal immigrants have admitted claiming more than Â£125,000 in relief costs by falsely posing as victims of the Grenfell Tower fire. Elaine Douglas and Tommy Brooks were put up in hotels after claiming they lived on the 19th floor of the block. They were caught when council workers discovered their flat did not exist, Isleworth Crown Court heard. The pair, both aged 51, pleaded guilty to two counts of fraud by false representation. They also admitted one count of obtaining leave to remain in the UK by deception. Seventy-one people died in the west London tower block fire on 14 June last year The court heard the two Jamaican nationals, of no fixed address, were put up in hotels for almost a year and handed pre-paid credit and travel cards, all paid for by the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Douglas and Brooks were also both housed in the Radisson Blu hotel in Kensington. Douglas claimed a total Â£67,123.35 of relief intended for victims of the fire. She spent 276 nights in the Radisson Blu in Kensington, costing the council over Â£55,000. The 51-year-old also spent more than Â£11,000 on a pre-paid credit card she was given when she complained about the hotel's food. Brooks claimed Â£58,396.89 of relief and stayed in the Radisson Blu and another hotel for 243 nights. He also spent over Â£9,000 of charges on a credit card. Douglas and Brooks both stayed in the Radisson Blu hotel in Kensington Prosecutor Benjamin Holt told the court the pair ""claimed to have been together in the fire"". ""Both said they were residing in flat 91 on the 19th floor - flat 91 is actually on the 12th floor."" The court heard Brooks and Douglas had managed to avoid immigration authorities for 16 years after entering the UK illegally in the early 2000s. Mr Holt said they had tried to take advantage of a government policy introduced to allow those with insecure immigration status who had lost their homes in the fire to remain in the country for at least five years. The pair were remanded in custody until sentencing on 13 June.

Big business issues Brexit warning to MayMajor European firms warn the Prime Minister they may cut investment without clarity on Brexit customs plans.25m25 minutes agoBusiness,"A group of major European companies has warned the Prime Minister they may cut investment without more clarity over the terms of Britain's EU exit. Business leaders, including from BP, BMW, Nestle, and Vodafone, told Theresa May that ""time is running out"". In a statement after the Downing Street meeting, they said that a trade deal with the EU must be ""frictionless as with a customs union"". Downing Street said that the meeting had been ""open and productive"". The industry leaders warned that ""uncertainty causes less investment."" The group, known as the European Round Table of Industrialists (ERT), includes BP chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg and his Nestle counterpart Paul Bulcke. Others at the meeting were the chief executives of Vodafone, Vittorio Colao, and Royal Mail, Moya Greene. Senior figures from firms including BMW, Phillips, E.On and Ferrovial also attended the meeting with Mrs May and Brexit secretary David Davis. The ERT represents Europe's 50 largest companies, with combined revenues of 2.25 trillion euros (Â£2tn) and millions of employees. Why is the customs union so important?

In its statement, the ERT said: ""The uninterrupted flow of goods is essential to both the EU and UK economies. This must be frictionless as with a customs union. ""We need clarity and certainty, because time is running out. Uncertainty causes less investment."" A Downing Street spokeswoman said that the PM told the business leaders that work was under way on two customs models, ""and underlined the importance of ensuring that our future trading arrangements with the EU are as frictionless as possible"". She restated a commitment to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and allowing the UK to pursue an independent trade policy. ""The PM recognised the necessity of providing certainty for businesses, pointing to the agreement of an implementation period at the European Council in March to provide time to allow businesses to prepare for the new arrangements,"" the spokeswoman said.

Roseanne blames racist tweet on sedativesTrump weighed in after ABC cancelled Roseanne's show over the tweet about an ex-Obama aide.2h2 hours agoUS & Canada,"This video can not be played President Trump once told supporters Roseanne 'was about us' Roseanne Barr has blamed sleeping pills for her tweet likening an African-American former Obama aide to an ape. The comedian blamed the offensive post on ""ambien tweeting"" - although she has since removed the tweet. Ambien is a sedative pill used as a sleeping aid. ABC cancelled Roseanne's sitcom over the racist tweet. They also apologised to the aide, Valerie Jarrett. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke his silence on Barr, who has been one of his most outspoken supporters. ""Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that 'ABC does not tolerate comments like those' made by Roseanne Barr"", Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday, referring to the former White House senior adviser. ""Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A spokeswoman for Sanofi, the pharmaceutical company that makes Ambien, said in response to Barr's tweets about taking the sedative: ""While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication."" Roseanne Barr's racist tweet backlash Barr's five most controversial moments Valerie Jarrett, centre, was one of President Barack Obama's longest-serving aides On Wednesday, Barr also told former fellow cast member Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner on the show: ""You throw me under the bus. nice!"" She hit back at him after he posted a statement branding her original post ""reprehensible"". Barr's racist tweet came in response to another Twitter user, who accused Mrs Jarrett of helping to conceal purported spying during the Obama administration. Mrs Jarrett was a senior adviser to US President Barack Obama, and worked with him during his early days in Chicago politics. Barr apologised, saying the remark was a ""bad joke"", but the backlash mushroomed. The verdict on Roseanne's return Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington On Tuesday White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders deflected questions about the president's views on the Roseanne Barr controversy by saying that he had been ""extremely focused"" on other things. That seemed a bit hard to swallow. The president had taken pride in the viewership ratings of the rebooted Roseanne Show, claiming in a March rally that its success ""was about us"". He even called Barr - an outspoken supporter of the president - to offer his congratulations. On Wednesday, Mr Trump broke his silence. What he tweeted was that he had been slighted by ABC because he never received an apology for unnamed disparagements. What he didn't express was any sort of condemnation of Barr's racist tweet. Mr Trump has often been criticised for an apparent unwillingness to address episodes of racial discrimination or hostility. Following violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which one counter-protester was killed, the president assigned blame to both sides. He noted that there were ""good people"" among those chanting racist and anti-Semitic slogans in a torchlight rally the night before the clashes. With his tweet, Mr Trump will face renewed pressure to explicitly denounce Barr's comments. After embracing the comedian as a voice for his movement, however, the president may find such a step difficult to manage. The 65-year-old entertainer wrote on Tuesday she was ""leaving Twitter"", but returned shortly after with a string of tweets addressing the cancellation of her sitcom. ""I will handle my sadness the way I want to,"" she said. ""I'm tired of being attacked and belittled more than other comedians who have said worse."" The return of Roseanne was as short-lived as it was spectacular Barr also said that not only had her new series been axed, but also that older reruns of the sitcom had been cancelled by other networks. A spokesman for Viacom, which owns various networks including Paramount, earlier said it would stop airing old episodes. The streaming service Hulu also said it would be removing the sitcom from its library. Roseanne cast: Where are they now? Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She said that Robert Iger, chief executive of Disney, ABC's parent company, had called her to apologise and said he had ""zero tolerance"" for Barr's tweet.

War Horse author reveals cancer battle,"Children's author Sir Michael Morpurgo has spoken of his battle with cancer. The renowned former children's laureate, now 74, had radiotherapy last year to treat cancer of the larynx. He said he had ""excellent prospects for a full recovery"" and his voice was finding ""new strength"". Sir Michael's most famous book, War Horse, about a young boy's attempts to save his horse during the First World War, has been successfully adapted for film and the stage. He had cancelled several public appearances in September due to ill-health but the nature of his illness had not been known. Brain cancer vaccine 'remarkably promising' Morpurgo breaks book prize record In an article for this week's Spectator magazine, Sir Michael said: ""By 74 it is easy to feel that you have seen it all, done it all, that nothing much surprises you any more. ""Even an unwelcome medical diagnosis does not surprise you. You cope because you have to. You know it's what happens to us all."" Reflecting that many suffer illness earlier in life, he added: ""I've been a lucky old parrot"". He spoke of how he kept himself distracted during his treatment at London's Royal Marsden, saying that ""besides Marie Currie,"" he thought of his children, grandchildren and great-grandchild - as well as the young people he taught during 10 years as teacher. ""They were all the hope I needed, lying there in that hospital being healed. It wasn't only the radiotherapy doing the healing. It was the memories of those children too. ""They helped me through, helped me to keep hoping, keep believing. They still do, every day,"" Sir Michael said. He described how his perspective changed when ""suddenly the disease became central to my life at home, and to my work. ""It had to be confronted, dealt with, both surgically and psychologically."" But he said he now has time to reflect on ""how fortunate I have been."" What books are you reading with your children?

Roseanne blames racist tweet on sedatives,"This video can not be played President Trump once told supporters Roseanne 'was about us' Roseanne Barr has blamed sleeping pills for her tweet likening an African-American former Obama aide to an ape. The comedian blamed the offensive post on ""ambien tweeting"" - although she has since removed the tweet. Ambien is a sedative pill used as a sleeping aid. ABC cancelled Roseanne's sitcom over the racist tweet. They also apologised to the aide, Valerie Jarrett. US President Donald Trump on Wednesday broke his silence on Barr, who has been one of his most outspoken supporters. ""Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that 'ABC does not tolerate comments like those' made by Roseanne Barr"", Mr Trump tweeted on Wednesday, referring to the former White House senior adviser. ""Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Barr's tweet described Mrs Jarrett as the child of the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamist group, and the Planet of the Apes film. The television network said on Tuesday: ""Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values and we have decided to cancel her show."" The reboot of her hit sitcom Roseanne had been a ratings winner, and Mr Trump had called to congratulate her personally on its first season back. Eight celebrity social media disasters Barr deleted Monday night's post and said she was leaving Twitter, but has since posted a flurry of tweets including one claiming other comedians ""have said worse"". In another tweet, the TV star tried to explain away the post as having been caused by the effects of Ambien. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A spokeswoman for Sanofi, the pharmaceutical company that makes Ambien, said in response to Barr's tweets about taking the sedative: ""While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects, racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication."" Roseanne Barr's racist tweet backlash Barr's five most controversial moments Valerie Jarrett, centre, was one of President Barack Obama's longest-serving aides On Wednesday, Barr also told former fellow cast member Michael Fishman, who played DJ Conner on the show: ""You throw me under the bus. nice!"" She hit back at him after he posted a statement branding her original post ""reprehensible"". Barr's racist tweet came in response to another Twitter user, who accused Mrs Jarrett of helping to conceal purported spying during the Obama administration. Mrs Jarrett was a senior adviser to US President Barack Obama, and worked with him during his early days in Chicago politics. Barr apologised, saying the remark was a ""bad joke"", but the backlash mushroomed. The verdict on Roseanne's return Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington On Tuesday White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders deflected questions about the president's views on the Roseanne Barr controversy by saying that he had been ""extremely focused"" on other things. That seemed a bit hard to swallow. The president had taken pride in the viewership ratings of the rebooted Roseanne Show, claiming in a March rally that its success ""was about us"". He even called Barr - an outspoken supporter of the president - to offer his congratulations. On Wednesday, Mr Trump broke his silence. What he tweeted was that he had been slighted by ABC because he never received an apology for unnamed disparagements. What he didn't express was any sort of condemnation of Barr's racist tweet. Mr Trump has often been criticised for an apparent unwillingness to address episodes of racial discrimination or hostility. Following violence at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which one counter-protester was killed, the president assigned blame to both sides. He noted that there were ""good people"" among those chanting racist and anti-Semitic slogans in a torchlight rally the night before the clashes. With his tweet, Mr Trump will face renewed pressure to explicitly denounce Barr's comments. After embracing the comedian as a voice for his movement, however, the president may find such a step difficult to manage. The 65-year-old entertainer wrote on Tuesday she was ""leaving Twitter"", but returned shortly after with a string of tweets addressing the cancellation of her sitcom. ""I will handle my sadness the way I want to,"" she said. ""I'm tired of being attacked and belittled more than other comedians who have said worse."" The return of Roseanne was as short-lived as it was spectacular Barr also said that not only had her new series been axed, but also that older reruns of the sitcom had been cancelled by other networks. A spokesman for Viacom, which owns various networks including Paramount, earlier said it would stop airing old episodes. The streaming service Hulu also said it would be removing the sitcom from its library. Roseanne cast: Where are they now? Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Goldie fined for Glastonbury assault,"This video can not be played Goldie said he was ""always sorry"" but then asked what he had done Drum and bass star Goldie has been ordered to pay almost Â£2,500 for assaulting a security guard at last year's Glastonbury Festival. The DJ and actor - real name Clifford Joseph Price - attacked bouncer Dennis Poole on 23 June. The court heard Mr Poole was assaulted after he refused to let Price's daughter go backstage. Price, 52, of Tring, Hertfordshire, was fined Â£1,080 at Bristol Magistrates' Court. He was also told to pay compensation of Â£500 and costs of Â£883. Charges against Goldie's daughter Chance Price were dismissed Price was described as acting like a ""raging bull"" when Mr Poole refused him and his daughter access to a restricted area. The court heard Chance Price, 20, and her friend had attempted to gain entry to the restricted area at about 19:00 BST. They had been ""whisked"" into the BBC area, where Price was due to be interviewed by BBC Radio 1's Annie Mac, without passes but were stopped when they tried to re-enter after leaving to buy food. Ms Price phoned her father for assistance but when he arrived it was noted that he also did not have the required wristband for the area. Witnesses described how Price ""puffed his chest out"" before pushing Mr Poole back and placing him in a headlock. Both men ended up on the floor, with the security guard suffering scratches to his face and neck, a sore ear and a grazed elbow. Dennis Poole was attacked after he refused to let Price's daughter go backstage Price initially claimed he had acted in self defence but subsequentlypreviously admitted the offence in March via Facetime from Thailand. He appeared in person alongside his daughter for sentencing on Wednesday. Prosecutors offered no evidence against Ms Price, of Leavesden, Hertfordshire, and the case against her was dismissed. District Judge David Taylor told Price: ""Your entirely unjustified actions demonstrate an arrogant sense of entitlement based on your own self importance. ""The physical injuries sustained by Mr Poole at your hands were relatively minor but the assault has had an emotional and psychological impact on him. ""This was an assault on a man simply doing his job."" In a victim personal statement read to the court, Mr Poole said he had been forced to give up his career of six years. He said: ""He came right up in my face, he was telling me he could do what he wanted."" The actor and producer appeared in Strictly Come Dancing in 2010 Speaking outside the court, Price said he was ""apologising as a man would do"". He added: ""I took a bullet for my daughter, I'm happy. ""Hopefully he can move on and understand if you're doing your job do it right."" Price, who was born in Walsall, West Midlands, made his name as a music producer in the 1990s when the rave scene was at its peak. Known for his distinctive gold ""grill"" - or row of front teeth - he has also appeared on screen, acting in James Bond film The World Is Not Enough, Guy Ritchie's gangster caper Snatch and EastEnders. More recently, he has cropped up in a number of reality TV shows, including Celebrity Big Brother, Strictly Come Dancing, and Come Dine with Me.

Flying rock crushed Pompeii victim's head,"The unfortunate victim survived the initial eruption - but did not get far Archaeologists at Pompeii have uncovered the remains of an unfortunate man who was decapitated by an enormous rock while fleeing the volcano. Nearby Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, killing many Pompeii residents and famously freezing them in place. This skeleton appears to be from a man who survived the initial explosion and was fleeing the doomed city. A leg injury, however, may have slowed him down before he was crushed by the huge stone hurtling through the air. Pompeii archaeologists say the skeleton shows signs of a bone infection in his leg, which could have made walking - much less running - very difficult. Pompeii's not-so-ancient Roman remains Pompeii guard dog mosaic back on show How many people do volcanoes kill? But it was not slow-moving molten lava that killed most of the people of Pompeii. Instead, a vast cloud of hot gas and fragments - called a pyroclastic flow - surged over the city, killing its inhabitants wherever they were, and burying them in ash, preserving their final moment. Archaeologists believe it was this lethal cloud which struck their newest discovery, throwing him backwards as he turned to look at it. The man's head has yet to be identified - and could still be under the rock The man, believed to be in his 30s, was found on the first floor of a building, above the layer of small stones carried by the cloud. But the force of the erupting gas and rock also picked up an enormous rock - which experts think might have been a door jamb (the vertical part of a door frame) - and hurled it at the victim, crushing his upper body near the throat and possibly removing his head, which is missing. Archaeologist Massimo Osanna said the skeleton was an ""exceptional find"". Apart from the ""emotional impact"" of these discoveries, they allow archaeologists to study the people of the city, and even how they tried to escape the eruption of Vesuvius. This latest discovery is part of fresh excavations in Pompeii undertaken using modern technology.

Trump signs drug law for terminally illPatients with killer diseases will be able to try experimental drugs which have yet to be approved.1han hour agoUS & Canada,"Nine-year-old Jordan McLinn, who has muscular dystrophy, shook Mr Trump's hand President Donald Trump has signed a bill giving terminally ill patients the right to try experimental treatments not approved by the government. Patients were able to apply to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for access to non-approved drugs before, and most were granted permission. The new bill does not mandate that drug makers give access to unapproved drugs to patients asking for them. Advocacy groups including the American Cancer Society had opposed the bill. ""America is a nation of fighters. We never give up, right?"" Mr Trump said to patients and their families during a bill signing ceremony at the White House on Wednesday. After signing the bill, Mr Trump handed his pen to nine-year-old Jordan McLinn, who has been diagnosed with a form of terminal muscular dystrophy. Jordan, who the bill is named for, has been accepted into a clinical programme in Chicago where he has been receiving weekly infusions. He and his mother, Laura, had travelled from Indianapolis for the White House event. The new Right to Try act allows patients with life-threatening diseases to bypass the FDA's application process for ""compassionate use,external"" of experimental drugs. Patients seeking access to ""investigational drugs"" now need only the approval of their physician and the drug manufacturer. The new bill protects doctors and companies from the legal risks of allowing unapproved treatments unless they intentionally harm a patient. The policy that patients must have exhausted all other approved treatments and clinical trial options remains. Why I injected myself with an untested gene therapy Trump: Other nations extort drug-makers Why some cancers are 'born to be bad' In Mr Trump's State of the Union address in January, he called upon Congress to pass the bill, saying ""patients with terminal conditions, and terminal illness, should have access to experimental treatment immediately"" and ""should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure"". FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb, a physician and a cancer survivor,had expressed concerns to Congress last year,externaleven as he said the agency was ready to implement the bill. ""The clinical trial process is crucial to the development of innovative new medical products that can improve or save patients' lives,"" he said to Congress. Dr Gottlieb said there had to be a balance between giving patients access to investigational therapies and testing that ensures new products are safe and effective. Under the FDA's prior rules governing ""compassionate use"",99% of patient applications have been granted,externalsince 2009. Most requests are granted within a few days, and in emergency situations, often immediately via phone. Commissioner Scott Gottlieb expressed concerns about the bill to Congress last year Notably, going through the FDA allows the agency to modify experimental treatments to individuals to improve patient safety. Advocacy groups who opposed the bill claimed it gives patients false hope since pharmaceutical companies are not required to give terminally ill patients the experimental treatments they might request. In a letter,externaladdressed to Speaker Paul Ryan and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, 38 groups said removing the FDA from the equation would ""likely do more harm than good"". Forty states have passed Right to Try laws of their own. In order to be approved by the FDA,drugs must go through several phases of clinical trials,external. The process often means years of testing. First, the drug manufacturer must prove the drug is safe for humans. These trials can have as few as 30 patients, and 70% of drugs move to the next trial. Then, the manufacturer must prove the drug is an effective treatment for the condition it is being marketed for. Importantly, the drug cannot have severe side effects. Only 33% of drugs proposed make it through this stage. During the next phase, which can take up to four years, the company must test the drug on 300 to 3,000 patients with the disease the drug is designed to treat.

Ex-football coach 'was serial abuser'Ex-Southampton FC coach Bob Higgins allegedly abused 24 boys between 1971 and 1996.3h3 hours agoHampshire & Isle of Wight,"Ex-Saints youth coach Bob Higgins is accused of multiple counts of indecent assault against boys A former football coach was a ""serial abuser of young teenage boys"" at professional clubs, a court has heard. Bob Higgins, 65, is accused of groping and other abuse against 24 boys, many of them trainees at Southampton and Peterborough United. The charges, dating between 1971 and 1996, arose after the NSPCC set up a dedicated helpline to deal with sexual abuse in football, the court heard. Mr Higgins denies 50 counts of indecent assault at Salisbury Crown Court. Adam Feest QC, prosecuting, said: ""The telephone started to ring and one name was mentioned over and over again - that of Bob Higgins."" The helpline was set up in response to publicity generated by allegations of abuse in football in a BBC TV programme, Mr Feest said. ""The young footballers came to idolise the defendant,"" he told the jury. ""He held supreme power over their footballing futures, a fact which he made abundantly clear to them."" The charges arose after the NSPCC set up a helpline to deal with sexual abuse in football Mr Feest said if any boy complained, it put their hopes of playing professional football in ""serious jeopardy"". He said the defendant was a ""talented coach, spotting and nurturing many young players who went on to achieve significant success, nationally and internationally"". ""The young teenagers would join in with sexualised behaviour, their infatuation making them blind to the real nature of it,"" he added. ""The boys realised that they needed to impress their coach and, particularly those with slightly less footballing talent, to keep in his good books both on and off the training pitches."" The abuse ranged from fondling the boys when they stayed overnight at his house to more serious sexual assaults during massages, the court heard. Mr Higgins developed a ""perverse affectionate attachment"" to some boys, telling them he loved them, Mr Feest said. The jury was given details of one boy who said he had been forced to perform a sex act on the defendant in a bedroom. He did not report the alleged abuse at the time ""perhaps through fear"", after being threatened by the defendant, Mr Feest said. Bob Higgins denies 50 counts of indecent assault at Salisbury Crown Court Mr Feest said many trainees felt they would not be believed because of the defendant's position and the ""prevailing atmosphere at the time about this type of offending"". The ""predatory paedophile"" gained the trust of the boys and their parents, and acted ""with near impunity"", the court was told. A number of boys were released from their contracts when they fell out of favour, Mr Feest said. The court heard one 15-year-old bought a car to escape Higgins after repeated assaults. Mr Feest said the teenager, who had never driven before, fled from Southampton to his home in the north of England. He added: ""He had no idea where he was going, went through central London, and did nearly all of the journey in first or second gear."" A week later, Mr Higgins told the boy that if he made any accusations, he would make sure he ""would never play football again"", the court heard. One trainee was told he would not have been released had he been ""more affectionate"", the jury was told. Another recalled how he came to accept ""cuddling and kissing goodnight"" from Mr Higgins ""in order to progress his football"". Several alleged victims were subjected to ""naked soapy massages"" at training centres, Mr Feest said. One boy, who later turned professional, said the massages from Mr Higgins were ""more thorough"" than from other coaches. The jury heard Mr Higgins, from Southampton, was found not guilty at a trial for similar offences in the 1990s. The trial continues.

Abandoned on the ice," Morag Connelly watched as the bottle was dropped into the River Clyde. The water was quite calm and as the bottle bobbed around on the surface, she wondered if it would make it out to sea. Morag Connelly Inside it she had sealed a copy of the dreadful story that had brought her and 24 others to Victoria Harbour in Greenock that Saturday afternoon in early April - the story of seven young stowaways, all but one of whom had been starved, brutalised and eventually abandoned on floating ice, thousands of miles from home. John Paul - Morag’s great-great-grandfather - was one of them. Unlike two of his young companions, he survived. But the horror of his experiences was passed down through the generations. “If we ever complained about being cold in the winter my father would say, ‘Just think of John Paul, he walked on the ice in his bare feet,’” says Morag, a retired deputy headteacher. “It was always something that was said in bad weather.” As a boy of 12, John Paul had hidden away on a ship called the Arran, which on 7 April 1868 sailed from the quayside where Morag and other descendants, including John Paul’s 90-year-old granddaughter, Ria, were now standing. The ship was carrying a cargo of coal and oakum - a fibre made by painstakingly untwisting old ropes - and was heading across the Atlantic Ocean to the Canadian province of Quebec. Nobody knows why John Paul and the others decided to stow away, but his descendants say it was common in those days for Greenock boys to smuggle themselves on to ships in the harbour, seeking adventure and hoping to escape from the poverty of their childhoods. Ships were routinely checked for stowaways and any found would be sent back ashore on tugs - but John Paul wasn’t found. The Arran sailed down the Firth of Clyde and into the Irish Sea towards the Atlantic. Dry land was by now far behind and the tugs had long since cast the ship loose. As the ship’s carpenter prepared to batten down the hatches John Paul and another boy, 11-year-old Hugh McEwan, were finally discovered. Then five more stowaways emerged. It was too late to send them back. ‘A rarely told story’ These illustrations come from a graphic novel created by pupils of Ardgowan primary school in Greenock, with Magic Torch Comics writer Paul Bristow and artist Mhairi M Robertson. The aim was to bring the story to a new, younger audience.“We look at the folk tales and stranger things that are associated with the area - the stories that have fallen out of the telling,” Paul says. From then on they were only given a few ship’s biscuits to eat each day, so that even with the few scraps slipped to them in kindness by the cook, and the potato and turnip peelings they scavenged here and there, they had barely enough to survive. So they stole whatever they could lay their hands on from the ship’s stores - currants, oatmeal and more biscuits - but were heavily punished when caught. Once, when a grain barrel was found to have been opened, they immediately fell under suspicion. As punishment they were handcuffed together and given nothing to eat for an entire day. Hunger was not the stowaways' only problem. They were also unprepared for the harsh conditions of the North Atlantic. “The boys were thinly clad, and were not able to stand the severe cold,” one of the ship’s crew wrote to his family in Greenock after the ship had reached Quebec, nearly two months later. “The men could hardly stand it, let alone them. Two of the little ones had bare feet.” John Paul was one of the boys without shoes, the other was Hugh McGinnes, also 12 years old. The two of them would disappear below deck together to escape from the bitter cold, but whenever the ship’s mate realised they were missing he would drag them out and beat them. The stowaways - Hugh McEwan, 11- John Paul, 12- Hugh McGinnes, 12- Peter Currie, 12- James Bryson, 16- David Brand, 16- Bernard Reilly, 22 Another of the boys was singled out for particularly brutal treatment, which began when the crew and other stowaways complained that he was dirty. “He made me take off my jacket, waistcoat, and shirt, leaving only my semmit [vest] on. The coil was about half an inch thick. The mate flogged me for about three minutes and the blows were very painful,” 16-year-old James Bryson said later. “I was screaming. The mate made me strip off the rest of my clothing. I was then made to lie down on the deck. “One of the crew was ordered to draw water in a bucket. Several buckets of water were thrown at me.” “The weather was very cold. The captain then scrubbed me with a hair broom all over my body. The mate was standing over me with a rope in his hand, with which he threatened to strike me if I tried to run away. “The mate then took the broom and scrubbed me harder than the captain. After the scrubbing was finished, I was ordered to the forecastle. I was naked at the time. When I had been there for about an hour my semmit was returned. I suffered very much from exposure.” On another occasion, having been caught stealing currants from the ship’s store, James Bryson was lashed with the lead line - a rope with a lead weight at its end used to determine the depth of water - and then made to strip naked and sweep the decks. A sailor called James Harley witnessed the torture. “I saw Bryson's skin after he had been flogged and it resembled tartan,” he told an Edinburgh court months later, when the mate and captain were put on trial. “It was red and white.” Bryson may have been the only one who was punished in this barbaric way, but all except one of the stowaways - 12-year-old Peter Currie, whose father was a friend of the ship’s mate - were regularly beaten. From then on they were only given a few ship’s biscuits to eat each day, so that even with the few scraps slipped to them in kindness by the cook, and the potato and turnip peelings they scavenged here and there, they had barely enough to survive.

About a month after setting sail, the Arran ran into floating ice between Cape Breton Island and Newfoundland, and on 9 May the ship drifted into Bay St George, off Newfoundland's west coast, and became trapped. With the ship going nowhere, 22-year-old Bernard Reilly - the eldest of the stowaways, who had dreams of making it to Nova Scotia to work on the railways - persuaded James Bryson that it might be worth trying to cross the ice to escape the misery on board the ship. The younger boys were terrified of the idea, but the captain then ordered that all the stowaways except Peter Currie were to be put overboard. “I heard the three little boys crying when they were asked to go,” seaman George Henry said in court. “The ice was broken and rough-looking. Two of the boys were barefooted when they left the ship. The clothes of two of them were very ragged. The distance between the ship and the land, according to the best judgement I could form, was from 10 to 15 miles. “It appeared to me rather unlikely that those without shoes would ever reach the land.” Between eight and nine o’clock in the morning the stowaways set off across the ice. The ship’s mate threw each a biscuit as they left. The floe was made of slabs of various sizes, some as big as a football pitch, others much smaller. Reaching the end of one, the stowaways had to jump on to the next. Hugh McEwan, who had been poorly since leaving Greenock and had been seen spitting blood during the voyage, soon started to lag behind. He slipped into the freezing water once and was pulled free by James Bryson. When he fell in a second time he managed to crawl out himself. But each time he grew weaker. “I saw him fall in the last time. I was in the water too,” John Paul said in court. “He was kicking and trying to get out. He caught hold of me. I kicked and he let me go, then I got out by scrambling on the edge of the ice. I saw his head as the ice closed over it. I did not hear him cry. The ice covered over him, and I never saw him again.” Some hours later, Hugh McGinnes sat down on the ice, his bare feet sore and swollen. He was overcome by exhaustion. “We urged him to come along with us, and said if he did not he would be frozen,” James Bryson said. “He said he could not come any further. We left him there with nothing to protect him - no greatcoat, nothing but his ragged, frozen clothes.” As the remaining four stowaways neared land, the large slabs of ice became rarer. But they struggled on, each in turn slipping and falling into the water, their clothes freezing solid to their bodies. They reached the end of the ice as the sun was going down. They could see a few houses on the shore, but a channel of water and drift ice up to a mile wide lay between them and dry land. Bernard Reilly, the 22-year-old, and 16-year-old David Brand tried to paddle ashore on pieces of ice, using a batten taken from the ship. John Paul and James Bryson, frozen, famished, exhausted and weak, were stranded. They shouted out for help in the hope that someone would hear them.

It’s May 2018 and spring has finally arrived at Highlands on the southern shore of Bay St George. The days are getting warmer and there’s only a dusting of snow left now on the tops of the hills. The Arran may have expected such conditions when it arrived here 150 years ago, instead of the wintry scene that awaited it. “I have seen the sea covered in ice like that many times - it’s a combination of a cold winter and certain winds that blow ice into the bay,” says Taylor Chaffey, president of the local historical society. “But when the boys were put over the side the ice was already decomposing with the spring temperatures so they didn’t have anything very solid to walk on - it really was a very cruel thing to do.” Highlands was once a busy agricultural and fishing community where fishermen lived in little cabins on the beach. There is no harbour, so they fished with boats that were hauled up on a slipway. One of those living here in 1868 was Catherine Ann MacInnis and it was she who saw the boys in the fading daylight, or heard their cries, and raised the alarm. Her great-great-grandson, Don MacInnis, discovered this when he answered the door one sunny summer’s day about 25 years ago, and found in front of him a man from British Columbia, a descendant of one of the Arran stowaways who was searching for a member of the MacInnis family. “Catherine Ann was my great-great-grandmother,” says Don. “But I didn’t know anything about this horrendous story - that six boys had been thrown off a ship here and that two of them had perished on the ice. The story had been lost to our family. It was quite a shock.” Catherine Ann’s family had emigrated to Newfoundland from Loch Morar in the Scottish Highlands in the 1850s and it is thought that her husband, Alexander, would have been among the local men who set out in a boat to rescue the boys. “It’s not easy to see four little boys from a mile away especially at 7.30pm in the evening,” Don says. “If they’d arrived, say, a half hour later, they probably wouldn’t have been seen at all - they were really, really fortunate to survive.” The four frostbitten stowaways recuperated in the villagers’ homes. Blinded by the glare of the ice, it was almost a week before they were able to see properly. It took almost a month for John Paul’s badly lacerated feet to heal. The bodies of Hugh McGinnes and Hugh McEwan, who had perished on the drift ice, were never found. At some point Don told the story to his old friend, Taylor Chaffey. “Why didn’t I know something about this?” Taylor says. “This is not something that we can allow to be lost. We need to find a way to make sure that this part of our history is saved.” And so, like Morag Connelly in Greenock, Don and Taylor in Highlands, Newfoundland, made plans to commemorate the events that took place here. Don designed a bronze plaque which was placed on his great-great-grandmother’s grave during a day of commemorations organised by the local historical society. A piper led a 100-strong crowd down to the spot from where Catherine Ann is thought to have spotted the boys, and the great-grandson of the stowaway David Brand - who emigrated to Australia and established a successful engineering firm there - gave a speech, before three information kiosks telling the story of the stowaways and their rescue were unveiled. David Brand VII and Taylor Chaffey “What a great day,” says David Brand VII, a retired Presbyterian minister who travelled from New South Wales with his wife and son to take part in the celebrations. “The sun shone into every heart. We are so glad we came from Australia to share in this, the memories will last forever.” When the Arran eventually arrived in Quebec, one of the crew sent a letter home to Greenock describing the campaign of cruelty that the stowaways had been subjected to. The news spread quickly around the town. A telegraph was then sent from Scotland asking for more information and the reply came that four of the six boys who had been put down on the ice had survived -  three of them were still in Newfoundland, but the fourth, Bernard Reilly, had already set off to look for work in Nova Scotia. Almost six months after stowing away, the three remaining boys arrived back in Scotland by boat. “One of the boys believed to be alive was named Hugh McGinnes, whose mother is a widow and resides in Nicholson Street, Greenock,” the Scotsman newspaper reported on 5 October 1868. “The poor woman went down expecting to meet her son, when she received the painful information that he had died on the ice from exhaustion. Another lad, named [John] Paul, who was believed to have perished, has returned.” What happened to the other survivors? -James Bryson emigrated to the US, where he became a tram conductor- David Brand started a ship engineering firm in Queensland, Australia, where he died in 1897- Peter Currie,the stowaway who was not put overboard,died of tuberculosis two years after returning home - Bernard Reilly, who went to Nova Scotia, may have never returned to Scotland The Arran was wrecked on Sand Island in the Gulf of Mexico in 1886  while sailing from Greenock to Mobile, Alabama The boys had arrived home just in time to appear as the main witnesses at the trial of the captain and the mate at the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh. The only known picture of John Paul shows him standing between David Brand and James Bryson, three days after their return On its final day (25 November 1868) the Scotsman newspaper reported that “the courtroom was again crowded, and many persons waited outside for several hours in the hope of gaining admission.” James Kerr, the mate, was found guilty of assault and sentenced to four months in prison. The captain, Robert Watt, was charged with culpable homicide - roughly equivalent to the offence of manslaughter in English law - and sentenced to 18 months. “The verdict was received by the audience with loud hisses,” said the Scotsman’s story the following morning. Both men went back to their jobs and sailed for many years after leaving prison. “I remember how on a winter's night my little granny would tell us John Paul's story,” says Ann McVey Haldane. “It's always been there in our family.” Ann and Morag are second cousins - their grandfathers were brothers. But although they knew one another well years ago they haven’t seen each other for decades. Ann left Greenock 28 years ago when her husband got a new job near Basingstoke. In making the journey south, she was in fact following in the footsteps of her great-great-grandfather, John Paul, roughly a century earlier. Seven years after his dreadful experience at sea, the 19-year-old John Paul married and started a family. He had become a riveter, like his father before him, and rose to the rank of foreman in Greenock's shipyards. But after his wife died, in her 40s, he left for Southampton. At a certain point, Ann McVey's parents also made the journey south, to be near their daughter. “And when Dad came down here he started to bang on about John Paul - it reawakened something in him,” Ann says. “‘He's in Southampton,’ he'd say, ‘you need to find him.’” It was family legend that John Paul was buried somewhere in an unmarked grave - there was an element of shame about it, Ann says, so she wanted to find him, for her father, and to put things right. “I can remember my wee granny tutting and saying, ‘Pauper's grave, unmarked,’” she says. Ann eventually discovered that John Paul had been buried in Southampton’s St Mary Extra cemetery. After several unsuccessful attempts, Ann found her great-great-grandfather’s plot, not far from where two large conifer trees lean in from opposite sides of the path. “Finally, there he was in his unmarked grave,” she says. “I stood at the grave and thought about the terrible ordeal John Paul had suffered as a child. I thought about his missing fingers and toes - he lost a few due to frostbite. I thought about the child who stowed away on a ship just looking for adventure, and I said out loud, ‘You daft wee boy, what were you thinking?’” Like her grandmother, Ann assumed that her great-great-grandfather had died a poor man since no headstone was ever placed on his grave. So when another of John Paul’s descendants in the US uncovered a newspaper article describing a grand funeral, with a polished elm coffin covered in beautiful flowers and wreaths, and the large number of people who had assembled at the cemetery to pay their respects - including more than 100 members of the Boilermaker’s Society in full regalia - Ann was very surprised. No-one knows why a stone was never placed on John Paul’s final resting place, but Ann and some of John Paul’s other descendants thought the 150th anniversary of his ordeal at sea was the right moment to erect a headstone. “When you stand there in that desolate little space, it’s desperate,” Ann says. “We don’t want anything lavish, just something simple that says who John Paul was and maybe refers to the Greenock Stowaways so somebody at some point could research this history that was part of this life.” But even though the plot has been unmarked for more than 100 years, Ann discovered that no stone can be installed without permission from the legal owner of the grave. So who was the owner? Ann made some calls to Southampton City Council. She asked whether the owner of John Paul’s grave was the Boilermakers  Society - but was told it wasn’t. “I called again and ran through all of John Paul's children as possible owners of the grave. No joy,” she says. “Then I sat down at the computer and looked at the entries in my family tree and could see there was one more logical guess I could make. The person who purchased John Paul's grave was his second wife, Blanche Martindale Paul.” Ann knows that Blanche outlived at least two more husbands - but has been unable to find any record of Blanche’s death or any will, so Ann cannot prove to whom, if anyone, she bequeathed her estate. This may well ensure that John Paul’s final resting place remains unmarked forever. “Unfortunately there are no exceptions to the rules regarding transferring burial rights. The correct procedures must be adhered to,” a spokesman from Southampton City Council said. “We are unable to consider that the grave be transferred to descendants of John Paul without following transfer procedures.” Built with Shorthand"

Teenager dies after street stabbing,"Keelan Wilson, pictured with his mother Kelly, was taken to hospital where he later died A 15-year-old boy who died after being stabbed just yards from his home in Wolverhampton has been described as an ""angel"" by his grandfather. Keelan Wilson was found following reports of disorder between a group of youths in Langley Road, Merry Hill, at about 23:00 BST on Tuesday. He was taken to hospital where he later died. West Midlands Police said it had launched a murder investigation. George Ellitts said Keelan had raised money for charity and loved cars. Midlands Live: Cable thefts cause trains chaos; New M5-M6 link road plan splits opinion Speaking outside the family home, the boy's grandfather added: ""To me, he was an angel. ""They were all supposed to be going on holiday a week tomorrow, to Egypt. ""He's lived with me all my life. ""He raised a few hundred pounds for Great Ormond Street Hospital a few years back, he had his hair cut, he had the lot off."" A car, thought to belong to a taxi driver who witnessed the trouble, is within the police cordon Mr Ellitts said the teenager's mother Kelly, who also lived at the address just a few metres from the scene of the attack in Strathfield Walk, was ""in a bad way"". Keelan was due to turn 16 in July, he added. Det Ch Insp Chris Mallett said: ""A young boy has tragically been killed and we are determined to find out why this has happened."" He described the death as a ""terrible loss"" adding the boy had his life ahead of him and officers would be ""working round the clock"" to find who was responsible. The BBC's Sarah Bishop said a taxi driver, called to the road to pick up a fare on Tuesday night, told her he saw about four youths approach Keelan and his friend, armed with knives. The taxi driver was wounded in the incident and was taken to hospital with a hand injury. His car remains at the scene and has been cordoned off by police. Neighbours have also told the BBC they heard a commotion outside their homes late on Tuesday evening. CCTV in the area is being checked and detectives are following a number of lines of inquiry We have spoken to the relatives of the victim who say he was due to start college in Birmingham in September. He had also raised money for charity by having all of his hair cut off for Great Ormond Street Hospital. The family we have spoken to here are absolutely devastated. Neighbours have also said how shocked they are about what has happened, while West Midlands Police has pledged to catch those responsible as soon as possible. West Midlands Ambulance Service said its crews arrived just after 23:00 to find Keelan with serious injuries. ""The team of ambulance staff worked quickly to begin administering advanced life support to him at the scene and this continued as he was transferred to New Cross Hospital,"" the spokesman said.

County Durham man dies in Turkish airport,"A 30-year-old British man from County Durham has died, apparently after a fall from a balcony at Dalaman airport in Turkey. Andrew Westlake had been on his first foreign holiday with his partner and one-year-old daughter. His relatives have asked to see CCTV footage from the airport to establish what happened. As Mr Westlake did not have travel insurance, the family have been asked to pay a â¬9,000 hospital bill. A Foreign Office spokesman said officials were supporting Mr Westlake's family and were in touch with local authorities investigating the death. Local news agency Dogan said that before his death the British man had been at the airport for three days. Once on a plane he reportedly argued with cabin crew and was subsequently escorted off for ""putting the flight at risk"". His aunt Pauline Butler said: ""We are still in the dark about what has happened."" Perry Sheldon from Dudley, North Tyneside, who boarded the flight with Mr Westlake, said his fellow passenger appeared ""on edge"". Mr Westlake had told Mr Sheldon that he had been kicked off a previous flight due to ""blisters on his feet from sunburn"". ""He said there were signs up saying people should not wash their feet and when they questioned him about it, they said it was an insult to their culture,"" said Mr Sheldon. Twenty minutes after boarding Mr Sheldon says Mr Westlake was removed from the plane. He said: ""He [Mr Westlake] didn't act aggressively in any way, he just stood up and got off. ""All he did was say to the man next to him 'I told you that would happen'."" The airline, Jet2, has released a statement confirming that one of their customers died at the airport. It said the man was not injured on or in the vicinity of their aircraft. A spokesman for Durham Constabulary said: ""Our officers passed the devastating news to the family who we are supporting. Our thoughts are with Andrew's family and friends.""

Ex-football coach 'was serial abuser',"Ex-Saints youth coach Bob Higgins is accused of multiple counts of indecent assault against boys A former football coach was a ""serial abuser of young teenage boys"" at professional clubs, a court has heard. Bob Higgins, 65, is accused of groping and other abuse against 24 boys, many of them trainees at Southampton and Peterborough United. The charges, dating between 1971 and 1996, arose after the NSPCC set up a dedicated helpline to deal with sexual abuse in football, the court heard. Mr Higgins denies 50 counts of indecent assault at Salisbury Crown Court. Adam Feest QC, prosecuting, said: ""The telephone started to ring and one name was mentioned over and over again - that of Bob Higgins."" The helpline was set up in response to publicity generated by allegations of abuse in football in a BBC TV programme, Mr Feest said. ""The young footballers came to idolise the defendant,"" he told the jury. ""He held supreme power over their footballing futures, a fact which he made abundantly clear to them."" The charges arose after the NSPCC set up a helpline to deal with sexual abuse in football Mr Feest said if any boy complained, it put their hopes of playing professional football in ""serious jeopardy"". He said the defendant was a ""talented coach, spotting and nurturing many young players who went on to achieve significant success, nationally and internationally"". ""The young teenagers would join in with sexualised behaviour, their infatuation making them blind to the real nature of it,"" he added. ""The boys realised that they needed to impress their coach and, particularly those with slightly less footballing talent, to keep in his good books both on and off the training pitches."" The abuse ranged from fondling the boys when they stayed overnight at his house to more serious sexual assaults during massages, the court heard. Mr Higgins developed a ""perverse affectionate attachment"" to some boys, telling them he loved them, Mr Feest said. The jury was given details of one boy who said he had been forced to perform a sex act on the defendant in a bedroom. He did not report the alleged abuse at the time ""perhaps through fear"", after being threatened by the defendant, Mr Feest said. Bob Higgins denies 50 counts of indecent assault at Salisbury Crown Court Mr Feest said many trainees felt they would not be believed because of the defendant's position and the ""prevailing atmosphere at the time about this type of offending"". The ""predatory paedophile"" gained the trust of the boys and their parents, and acted ""with near impunity"", the court was told. A number of boys were released from their contracts when they fell out of favour, Mr Feest said. The court heard one 15-year-old bought a car to escape Higgins after repeated assaults. Mr Feest said the teenager, who had never driven before, fled from Southampton to his home in the north of England. He added: ""He had no idea where he was going, went through central London, and did nearly all of the journey in first or second gear."" A week later, Mr Higgins told the boy that if he made any accusations, he would make sure he ""would never play football again"", the court heard. One trainee was told he would not have been released had he been ""more affectionate"", the jury was told. Another recalled how he came to accept ""cuddling and kissing goodnight"" from Mr Higgins ""in order to progress his football"". Several alleged victims were subjected to ""naked soapy massages"" at training centres, Mr Feest said. One boy, who later turned professional, said the massages from Mr Higgins were ""more thorough"" than from other coaches. The jury heard Mr Higgins, from Southampton, was found not guilty at a trial for similar offences in the 1990s. The trial continues.

Rail industry 'has failed passengers',"Rail passengers, such as these at Manchester Piccadilly, faced huge delays on ""Meltdown Monday"" The transport secretary says the ""rail industry has collectively failed"" passengers after timetable changes caused chaos across the network. Chris Grayling wrote to MPs over the ""wholly unsatisfactory"" service on Govia Thameslink Railway and Northern. GTR said it expected disruption to ease ""over the coming month"" and Northern said it hascommissioned a reportto ""ensure lessons are learned"". Mr Grayling said: ""The way timetabling is done has to change."" Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has criticised rail firms and Network Rail The transport secretary also criticised Network Rail, saying it ""cannot cope"" with the workload, and its performance was ""simply unacceptable"". He added: ""We were aware there might be some disruption in the early stages of any new timetable change but the scale of the problem has far outstripped any expectation."" He said he was now in ""regular contact"" with Network Rail and rail companies to deal with the issues quickly. But a Surrey rail user group earlier blamed the Department for Transport (DfT) for rail problems. GTR runs Thameslink, Southern, Great Northern and the Gatwick Express, while Northern runs services across North of England from Newcastle to Nottingham and in Greater Manchester, Yorkshire, Cumbria and Merseyside. Trains are frequently crowded at stations such as Harpenden, while other services are cancelled Stephen Trigg, of the Reigate, Redhill and District Rail Users Association, said: ""Thameslink is just failing all over the place. ""This morning six out of 12 trains have disappeared from the timetable. That's before any cancellations. How do people get to work?"" Ros Southward, who set up the Hitchin Rail Commuters Group, said there was constant ""stress and disruption"" on the Great Northern line. ""[I'm] beyond words, I don't get it because this is supposed to have been planned for a couple of years,"" she said. Rail timetables overhaul aims to boost frequency and reliability Great Northern, Southern, Thameslink and Northern trains cancelled and delayed Govia Thameslink changes time of every train in shake-up Many services across the country suffered""Meltdown Monday"" on 21 Maywhen new timetables came into force. The shake-up started on 20 Mayand saw every train time on each GTR operation change, affecting an estimated half a million commuters. Allow Twitter content?

Belgium gunman 'had killed the day before',"This video can not be played Shooter caught on camera carrying two guns The man who shot dead two police officers and a civilian in the Belgian city of LiÃ¨ge had killed someone the night before the attacks. Interior Minister Jan Jambon said the gunman, Benjamin Herman, had murdered a former prisoner he met while in jail. Reports say the victim was Michael Wilmet, 30, a convicted drug dealer who was hit repeatedly with a hammer. The two policewomen killed the next day have been identified as Lucile Garcia, 53, and Soraya Belkacemi, 45. The third victim, 22-year-old Cyril Vangriecken, was sitting in the passenger seat of a nearby parked car when he was shot. Prosecutors say they are treating the attacks as ""terrorist murder"". The Islamic State group (IS), which has claimed previous attacks in Belgium, said it was behind the shootings, but has not offered any evidence to support this. Soraya Belkacemi, left, and Lucile Garcia were named as the two police officers killed in the attack The gunman also took a cleaner hostage at a school before being killed by police. She was released unharmed. Named only as Darifa by Belgian media, the cleaner said Herman had burst in and asked her two questions: was she a Muslim, and was she observing Ramadan? She answered yes to both, she said, and he replied that he would not harm her. She then attempted to persuade him he should not be in the school with children. Officials said the 31-year-old man had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"" in Arabic) several times during the attack. He had been freed from prison on temporary release on Monday after serving time for theft and drug offences. Local media report that he may have been radicalised while in jail. This video can not be played Social media footage captured the sound of gunshots ""There are signs he was radicalised in prison, but is it that radicalisation which drove him to commit these acts?"" Mr Jambon asked on RTL radio. ""It could have been because he had nothing to look forward to, because he also killed someone the night before, the guy's psychology and the fact... he may have been on drugs."" The gunman had been in and out of prison since he was a teenager and had had a criminal record that included assault and drug offences, police said. He was released at 07:30 local time on Monday and, under the terms of the temporary release, was expected to return to jail on Tuesday. It was during this period that he launched the attacks. Justice Minister Koen Geens defended the decision to release him, saying it was intended to help him prepare for his full release scheduled for 2020. He added that the attacker had been granted temporary leave numerous times before without incident. But he admitted that he had to ""examine"" his conscience following the attacks. ""The question of whether this man should have been given leave is striking because he killed three completely innocent people with a wish to kill himself,"" he told RTBF radio. ""I feel responsible because I have responsibility for prisons."" People pay tribute to the victims of the shooting The Brussels airport and metro blasts Why was Brussels attacked? Why have IS jihadists targeted Belgium? The shooting unfolded late on Tuesday morning near a cafe in the city centre. Prosecutors said the man had followed and ""savagely"" attacked the two female police officers, stabbing them repeatedly from behind with a knife before taking a gun from them and opening fire. He fatally shot dead Mr Vangriecken, who had almost finished studying to become a teacher, as he sat in the parked car, according to RTBF. The attacker then walked to a nearby school, where he briefly took the cleaner hostage. When armed police officers arrived at the scene, the attacker fired at them in an attempt to escape. Two officers were shot in the leg, leaving one in a serious condition. Two other officers received injuries to their arms before the attacker was shot dead, prosecutors said. Footage on social media showed people running to safety as several gunshots rang out. Children at the school were moved to safety. Belgium remains on alert after a series of jihadist attacks in the country and in neighbouring France. An armed policeman stands guard at the scene on Tuesday A Brussels-based cell was involved in the 2015 Paris attacks which left 130 people dead in several locations. Brussels itself saw three suicide bombings in March 2016, with 32 people killed. As with Tuesday's attacks, both the Paris and Brussels attacks were claimed by IS. Gunshots and sirens blare.

"Flying rock crushed Pompeii victim's headArchaeologists find a man who, fleeing the initial Vesuvius eruption, was hit by a giant boulder.5h5 hours agoEurope","The unfortunate victim survived the initial eruption - but did not get far Archaeologists at Pompeii have uncovered the remains of an unfortunate man who was decapitated by an enormous rock while fleeing the volcano. Nearby Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79 AD, killing many Pompeii residents and famously freezing them in place. This skeleton appears to be from a man who survived the initial explosion and was fleeing the doomed city. A leg injury, however, may have slowed him down before he was crushed by the huge stone hurtling through the air. Pompeii archaeologists say the skeleton shows signs of a bone infection in his leg, which could have made walking - much less running - very difficult. Pompeii's not-so-ancient Roman remains Pompeii guard dog mosaic back on show How many people do volcanoes kill? But it was not slow-moving molten lava that killed most of the people of Pompeii. Instead, a vast cloud of hot gas and fragments - called a pyroclastic flow - surged over the city, killing its inhabitants wherever they were, and burying them in ash, preserving their final moment. Archaeologists believe it was this lethal cloud which struck their newest discovery, throwing him backwards as he turned to look at it. The man's head has yet to be identified - and could still be under the rock The man, believed to be in his 30s, was found on the first floor of a building, above the layer of small stones carried by the cloud. But the force of the erupting gas and rock also picked up an enormous rock - which experts think might have been a door jamb (the vertical part of a door frame) - and hurled it at the victim, crushing his upper body near the throat and possibly removing his head, which is missing. Archaeologist Massimo Osanna said the skeleton was an ""exceptional find"". Apart from the ""emotional impact"" of these discoveries, they allow archaeologists to study the people of the city, and even how they tried to escape the eruption of Vesuvius. This latest discovery is part of fresh excavations in Pompeii undertaken using modern technology.

Goldie fined for Glastonbury assaultThe musician attacked a security guard who refused to let his daughter go backstage at the festival.,"This video can not be played Goldie said he was ""always sorry"" but then asked what he had done Drum and bass star Goldie has been ordered to pay almost Â£2,500 for assaulting a security guard at last year's Glastonbury Festival. The DJ and actor - real name Clifford Joseph Price - attacked bouncer Dennis Poole on 23 June. The court heard Mr Poole was assaulted after he refused to let Price's daughter go backstage. Price, 52, of Tring, Hertfordshire, was fined Â£1,080 at Bristol Magistrates' Court. He was also told to pay compensation of Â£500 and costs of Â£883. Charges against Goldie's daughter Chance Price were dismissed Price was described as acting like a ""raging bull"" when Mr Poole refused him and his daughter access to a restricted area. The court heard Chance Price, 20, and her friend had attempted to gain entry to the restricted area at about 19:00 BST. They had been ""whisked"" into the BBC area, where Price was due to be interviewed by BBC Radio 1's Annie Mac, without passes but were stopped when they tried to re-enter after leaving to buy food. Ms Price phoned her father for assistance but when he arrived it was noted that he also did not have the required wristband for the area. Witnesses described how Price ""puffed his chest out"" before pushing Mr Poole back and placing him in a headlock. Both men ended up on the floor, with the security guard suffering scratches to his face and neck, a sore ear and a grazed elbow. Dennis Poole was attacked after he refused to let Price's daughter go backstage Price initially claimed he had acted in self defence but subsequentlypreviously admitted the offence in March via Facetime from Thailand. He appeared in person alongside his daughter for sentencing on Wednesday. Prosecutors offered no evidence against Ms Price, of Leavesden, Hertfordshire, and the case against her was dismissed. District Judge David Taylor told Price: ""Your entirely unjustified actions demonstrate an arrogant sense of entitlement based on your own self importance. ""The physical injuries sustained by Mr Poole at your hands were relatively minor but the assault has had an emotional and psychological impact on him. ""This was an assault on a man simply doing his job."" In a victim personal statement read to the court, Mr Poole said he had been forced to give up his career of six years. He said: ""He came right up in my face, he was telling me he could do what he wanted."" The actor and producer appeared in Strictly Come Dancing in 2010 Speaking outside the court, Price said he was ""apologising as a man would do"". He added: ""I took a bullet for my daughter, I'm happy. ""Hopefully he can move on and understand if you're doing your job do it right."" Price, who was born in Walsall, West Midlands, made his name as a music producer in the 1990s when the rave scene was at its peak. Known for his distinctive gold ""grill"" - or row of front teeth - he has also appeared on screen, acting in James Bond film The World Is Not Enough, Guy Ritchie's gangster caper Snatch and EastEnders. More recently, he has cropped up in a number of reality TV shows, including Celebrity Big Brother, Strictly Come Dancing, and Come Dine with Me.

A report sent to the International Whaling Commission (IWC) reveals hunters caught 333 minkes in total. The team left Japan in November 2017 for the Southern Ocean and returned in March 2018. Japan says its whaling programme is for scientific purposes, despite a 2014 UN ruling against its ""lethal research"" and widespread condemnation. In a new research plan published after the UN ruling,Japan said it was ""scientifically imperative"" to understand Antarctica's ecosystem,externalthrough collecting and analysing animals. Japan to resume whaling in Antarctic Why Japan keeps on whaling Is Japan losing the taste for whale meat? The country's New Scientific Whale Research Program in the Antarctic Ocean (NEWREP-A) senta report to the IWC,externaldetailing the 333 minkes caught, 152 male and 181 female, during its ""third biological field survey"" in the area. Japan cut down its catch by two-thirds under its new research plan, and has stuck to taking about 330 whales each year. The data shows that in the 2017/18 hunt, 122 of the female minkes captured were pregnant, while 61 of the males and 53 of the females were not yet adults. After a few weeks of surveys, the team caught all the whales within just 12 weeks before setting off back to Japan. The whale meat is then sold to be eaten. Japan makes no secret of the fact that the meat resulting from its so-called scientific whaling programme ends up on the plate Under Article VIII of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, signed in 1946, countries can ""kill, take and treat whales for purposes of scientific research"", and this is the rule Japan says it follows in its hunts. Aside from its research claims, the Japanese government says whale hunting is an ancient part of Japan's culture. Coastal communities in Chiba prefecture and Ishinomaki in northern Japan have long practised coastal whaling, while Taiji in Wakayama prefecture holds annual dolphin hunts. Once a staple, now a novelty However, expeditions to the Antarctic for whale meat only began after World War Two, when the devastated country depended on whales as its main source of meat. While the meat is still sold, it is increasingly unpopular, with far fewer businesses selling it now than in the past. Figures from charity Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC) show thatmany countries other than Japan still catch whales,external. The International Whaling Commission (IWC), which regulates the industry, agreed to a moratorium on commercial whaling from the 1985, with exceptions. Norway and Iceland still hunt whales for meat, the former rejecting the moratorium and the latter only partially agreeing. Iceland still hunts whales So-called aboriginal subsistence whaling for local communities continues in Greenland, Russia, the USA, and St Vincent and the Grenadines. But Japan remains the only country to send ships to Antarctica to catch whales, under the scientific research exemption. Japan says it is conducting its research to show the Antarctic whale population is healthy and can be sustainably fished. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) saysthere is insufficient data to determine whether the Antarctic minke whale is threatened,external. While the number of minkes is ""clearly in the hundreds of thousands"", they are investigating a possible decline over the last 50 years. Depending on how significant the drop is, the Antarctic minke could be classified as Least Concern, or as Endangered.

"Sanitary product pilot to be rolled outThe Scottish government pilot for free sanitary products for women on low incomes began in Aberdeen.5h5 hours agoNE Scotland, Orkney & Shetland","A project to provide free sanitary products to women from low income households in Aberdeen is to be rolled out across the country. The Scottish government scheme - designed to tackle ""period poverty"" - waslaunched in July last year. The six-month pilot was continued in March, and has distributed free products to more than 1,000 women. Equalities Secretary Angela Constance has announced the project will be extended across Scotland. In ""I, Daniel Blake"", single mother Katie (Hayley Squires) struggles to afford essentials items The campaign to provide free feminine hygiene products was, in part, inspired by the 2016 film I, Daniel Blake. The film,a 2016 film directed by Ken Loach- includes a scene where an impoverished female character shoplifts a packet of tampons. Scots scriptwriter Paul Laverty wrote the scene after meeting women who struggled to afford essential hygiene products. The pilot scheme was led by the Community Food Initiatives North East (CFINE) social enterprise, and was welcomed by anti-poverty campaigners, including The Trussell Trust. It follows a growing campaign demanding ""dignity"" for women whose budgets do not stretch to sanitary protection. Girlguides join period poverty campaign UK girls 'too poor to afford tampons' The cheapest way to deal with your period Ms Constance visited CFINE to hear about the work, and announced that, following the successful pilot in Aberdeen, the charity FareShare will distribute sanitary products from sites around the country, reaching an estimated 18,800 people. Ms Constance said: ""It is unacceptable that anyone in Scotland should be unable to access sanitary products and I am pleased that we are able to work with FareShare to make products available more widely through the services delivered by their partners."" Gillian Kynoch, head of FareShare in Scotland, said: ""We are excited to be working with the Scottish government to use our network to make sanitary products available to people across Scotland."" Labour MSP Monica Lennon welcomed the extension of the scheme, but called for a statutory requirement to ensure free provision in schools, colleges and universities as well as ""placing a duty on the Scottish government to deliver a free universal system of access"". She said: ""Scotland can be a world leader in tackling period poverty if we are bold enough to take these radical steps."" Is this really a problem in Scotland? In 2016,the Trussell Trust,externalcharity said of the 133,000 people who used Scotland's food banks in the previous financial year, ""thousands"" received feminine hygiene products. The charity's Scotland network manager, Ewan Gurr, said Scots were relying on food banks for essential toiletries after finding themselves in ""difficult financial circumstances"" - often due to benefit sanctions, delayed wages or low incomes. The charity worker said some women had even resorted to using toilet roll, socks or newspaper because they were unable to afford female sanitary products.

Ribena waste used to make hair dyes,"Blackcurrant skins can be used for pink, red, purple, violet and blue colours A natural hair dye based on the blackcurrant waste from the production of Ribena has been created by scientists. The dyes use waste created after the berries have been pressed for juice. A new technique by University of Leeds scientists extracts natural colouring from the leftover skins to make dyes. Dr Richard Blackburn said the berries ""represent a sustainable supply of raw material because of how much blackcurrant cordial we drink"". More about this and other stories from Yorkshire About 90% of the British blackcurrant crop is used to make the branded drink, according to the manufacturer. Dr Blackburn, a colour chemist, said the university wanted ""to develop biodegradable alternatives that minimise potential risks to health"" due to concerns about conventional dyes. Almost all of the British blackcurrant crop is used to make the drink The blackcurrant skins have high concentrations of anthocyanins, pigments that provide colour to many berries, flowers, fruits and vegetables. Dr Blackburn said: ""They are non-toxic, water soluble and responsible for pink, red, purple, violet and blue colours and are widely used as natural food colourants all over the world. ""We knew they bound strongly with proteins - hair is a protein - so we thought if we could find an appropriate source of these natural colours, we might be able to dye hair."" 'Crunch' heard before sinkhole opened Mooed awakening as 40 cows invade street Champion cheese-roller breaks record The patented technology enables the pigment to be extracted and provide intense colours on hair. The research in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry said colours last for at least 12 washes, similar to other semi-permanent dyes. The blackcurrant-based dyes should go on sale this summer through a university spin-off company.

"Don't choose Viagogo, minister warns","A minister has told consumers not to use Viagogo, one of the big four secondary ticket resellers. Digital Minister Margot James told BBC Radio 5 live that if fans had to use a secondary site to buy tickets, ""don't choose Viagogo - they are the worst"". The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has referred Viagogo to National Trading Standards to investigate. The ASA says Viagogo has been breaking UK advertising rules by failing to make additional fees clear. ""Viagogo continues to mislead consumers by not being upfront and clear about additional booking fees and delivery charges that are added at the end of the booking process,"" said the ASA. It has now handed the case over to National Trading Standards, which will undertake any necessary enforcement against Viagogo. ""We have now launched an investigation into Viagogo, which will look at all legal options to bring them into compliance with the law,"" said a trading standards spokesman. It has the power to prosecute firms for breaching ASA rulings, with penalties including fines or even closing offending firms. Geneva-based Viagogo was one of four ticket brokers subject to ASA action in March. The advertising watchdog saidViagogo had agreed to make compulsory fees ""sufficiently clear""by 26 May, but had failed to do so. The other three big resellers - StubHub, Seatwave and GetMeIn - were also subject to the action against ""drip pricing"", where VAT, booking and delivery fees were added at the end of the booking process.

""It was also claiming to be an official site on Google paid advertisements and that again by the Advertising Standard Authority was deemed to be a breach of the code, so there is a long history here of Viagogo being non-compliant,"" he told 5 live. Last month the Competition and Markets Authority saidViagogo would face legal actionafter failing to make changes it had demanded. Its rivals StubHub, GetMeIn and Seatwave had agreed to provide better information about the tickets sold on their sites. They must warn if buyers risk being denied entry, the exact seats they will get and who was selling the tickets. However, the consumer watchdog said Viagogo had failed to give the same undertakings. Viagogo has not responded to a BBC request for comment.

Rockers' basement pool plan row rolls onRobbie Williams' plans are deferred after his Led Zeppelin guitarist neighbour voices fears.,"Jimmy Page attended the Kensington and Chelsea Council's planning meeting to voice his concerns A planning battle between music icons Robbie Williams and Jimmy Page is to drag on after a council failed to reach a decision on the singer's swimming pool plans for his west London home. Former Led Zeppelin guitarist Page had opposed Williams' proposals for a basement with pool at his home. Neighbour Page argued that excavations would be ""catastrophic"" for his Grade I listed Gothic-style Tower House. But Kensington and Chelsea Council's planning committee deferred a decision. Disagreements between Page, 74, and Williams, 44, began four years ago when the former Take That singer bought the house next to Page - which used to belong to Michael Winner. Robbie Williams is seeking permission to build an underground swimming pool and gym A drawing from the planning application to develop the basement at the property Page, who has lived in the Victorian Tower House since 1972, objected to Williams' plans to renovate, voicing concern that vibrations could cause irreversible damage. Builders working for Williams were fined Â£3,000 for disturbing Page's peace by taking apart a shed on a Sunday. At war with next door: When musician neighbours fall out Jimmy Page denies stealing Stairway to Heaven riff Robbie Williams and Rod Stewart tour bus to be homeless shelter Williams submitted proposals to the council in January to excavate a basement and build a swimming pool and gym facilities under his home. In response, Page wrote a two-page letter to the council objecting to the project and outlining his concerns about the potential impact of digging on his home, which he described as ""one of the most historic buildings in the borough"". Jimmy Page made a statement at a planning meeting at Kensington and Chelsea Town Hall ""Having protected the Tower House for over 40 years, I am now continuing the fight against a new threat to this precious and unique building,"" Page wrote. Page attended the council meeting where Williams' planning application - which had been recommended for approval by council officers - was discussed. He told councillors: ""I feel it is my duty to protect that house, I really do."" But the committee decided to defer a decision to consider what conditions and regulations might be appropriate. After the meeting Mr Page said he was ""very pleased"" with the decision, adding: ""I think the deferment was a very good conclusion.""

Neo-Nazi sentenced over LGBT attack plot,"Ethan Stables expressed his hatred of gay people as well as Muslims and Jews A white supremacist who planned to carry out an attack at a pub's gay pride night has been sentenced to an indefinite hospital order. Ethan Stables was arrested on a visit to the New Empire in his home town of Barrow, Cumbria, last summer. Facebook posts on far-right pages revealed he was ""going to war"" and wanted to carry out a ""slaughter"". Stables was found guilty of preparing an act of terrorism, threats to kill and possessing explosives. Following his detention on June 23, officers discovered a machete, an axe and knives at his home. He claimed he posted comments on Facebook to impress far-right friends andwas ""ashamed"" as he was bisexual. This video can not be played White supremacist Ethan Stables burned rainbow flag A trial at Leeds Crown Court heard the then-20-year-old had researched firearms and looked into methods for making a bomb. Jurors were told how Stables, who had been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome prior to his arrest, promoted homophobic, racist and Nazi views online. Ethan Stables: Bisexual terrorist who hated himself He communicated his hatred for Muslims and Jews on his phone, with one WhatsApp message reading: ""My country is being raped. ""I might just become a skinhead and kill people."" The trial was shown a photo of Stables posing in front of a Nazi flag New Empire landlady Lorraine Neale was ""shaking with fear"" when police told her of the plot The Recorder of Leeds, Judge Peter Collier QC, described Stables as ""a risk to the public"" and added he had caused ""alarm and distress"" by virtue of the plans he had made. Following his conviction in February, his barrister Patrick Upward QC told the court Stables led a ""melancholy life"" up to the day of his arrest and lived in ""almost squalid conditions"". Mr Upward added that Stables ""bears no comparison with the men who attacked Corporal (Lee) Rigby,"" and that he did not have the ""wherewithal"" to follow through on the plan.

C4 shortlists seven cities for new HQ,"Channel 4 has revealed the shortlist of seven cities and regions that could be the home of its new national HQ. The company wants to move 300 of its 800 staff out of London to a national headquarters and two ""creative hubs"". The seven shortlisted locations could house either the national HQ or a creative hub. They are Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, Greater Manchester, Leeds, Liverpool and the West Midlands. Six more areas are also in the running, but to be a creative hub only. They are Belfast, Brighton, Newcastle-Gateshead, Nottingham, Sheffield and Stoke-on-Trent. More than 30 bids were submitted from around the UK. Channel 4 currently has 30 staff based outside London - 25 salespeople in Manchester and five employees in Glasgow. Channel 4's chief commercial officer Jonathan Allan, who's leading the pitch process, said they had been ""incredibly impressed"" by the number of submissions and the ""high quality"" of the applicants. The current headquarters is on London's Horseferry Road He said those shortlisted ""are best able to meet our vision for our new hubs in the nations and regions"". The final locations will then be chosen in October, with the new headquarters and hubs due to open next year. It will have a new studio, which has ""the potential to be a base for daily programmes"", said Channel 4. Its current Horseferry Road offices will remain as the channel's London HQ. Although 300 jobs will move initially, the channel says it wants that number to grow over time.

Grenfell Inquiry: What is it?,"This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? The Grenfell Tower Inquiry is hearing from victims' families this week, nearly a year after a huge fire engulfed the west London tower block. The fire was reported at the 24-storey block in North Kensington at 00:54 BST on 14 June 2017. It started in a Hotpoint fridge freezeron the fourth floor. Police say it was not started deliberately. It took until 01:14 BST the following day to bring the fire under control, killing 72 people and destroying 151 homes, both inside the block and nearby. The fire's ""unexpected"" ferocity led to questions about the Â£8.6m refurbishment of the tower block, andin particular the cladding. Prime Minister Theresa Mayordered a full public inquirythe day after the fire. ""We need to know what happened, we need to have an explanation of this,"" she said at the time. The inquiry has been set up to determine three things: what happened, why, and what can be done to prevent anything similar happening again. There will be two phases of the inquiry: the first will examine how the blaze developed and the second will look at how the tower became exposed to the risk of a major fire. It is separate to any police investigation. A retired judge, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, was chosen by the prime minister to lead the public inquiry in June 2017. He opened the inquiry exactly three months after the fireon 14 September 2017. At the time, he said: ""The inquiry process is not adversarial, it's not to punish anyone or award compensation. It's simply to get to the truth."" According to the inquiry, 547 individuals and organisationshave been granted core participant status,external. Sir Martin is supported bya team of 35 people,external, including a legal team, civil servants and three assessors. Nine expert witnesses have so far been announced, focusing on the spread of the fire, the regulation of the building, the fire brigade's role and the impact of gas and water supplies to the building. By March, some 267,000 documentswere received and reviewed,externalby the inquiry. Survivors have pushed hard for more diversity on the inquiry panel Many of the survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire wereunhappy with the choice of Sir Martin. As a former judge, he was considered too ""establishment"" and out of step with the sentiments of the local community. Grenfell United, which represents survivors and the bereaved, said they feared the inquiry would be a ""whitewash"". Critics were also angry atSir Martin's refusal to appoint a person from the Grenfell communityto an advisory panel that will consider the evidence with him. More than 156,000 peoplesigned a petition,externalcalling for individuals from a range of backgrounds to sit on a panel. Following pressure from victims' families, the prime minister agreed on 11 May thattwo experts will sit with Sir Martin in phase two of the inquiry. All the families of those who died. They have been invited to take part in the inquiry as ""core participants"". They will receive all the relevant evidence in advance of the hearing and can suggest lines of questioning that they would like to see pursued. The inquirywill also hear from survivors, Grenfell residents, firefighters and expert witnesses. Sir Martin has faced hostility from the bereaved and survivors of the Grenfell Tower On 16 November 2017, officials said71 victims of the fire had been identified, including baby Logan Gomes, who was stillborn in hospital after the fire. However, the deaths of 72 people will be looked at by the inquiry, including Maria Del Pilar Burton, 74, who died in January 2018. She had been in hospital since she was rescued from the 19th floor. Nine days of commemoration hearings began on Monday, 21 May with a 72-second silence for the victims. Organisers say it is ""an opportunity for the families of those who lost their lives in the fire to provide a tribute of them for the inquiry record"". The first tribute on the opening day of the inquirywas from the father of a baby stillborn after his parents escaped the blaze. Five others were also remembered on the first day. The inquiry is then scheduled to hear from its firstexpert witnesses on 18 June.,external Evidence from firefighterswho worked on the scene will be heard in late June and early July. Survivors, the bereaved and local residents are set to give their evidence at the beginning of September. Closing statements of phase one of the inquiry are not expected until the end of October. The second phase is not expected to begin until the new year when Sir Martin will be joined by the two additional panel members, who have yet to be named. Part two of the inquiry will focus on the construction, refurbishment and management of the building prior to the fire. After the inquiry has heard all of the relevant evidence, Sir Martin will prepare a report for the prime minister, who has promised to publish the findings in full.

Sanitary product pilot to be rolled out,"A project to provide free sanitary products to women from low income households in Aberdeen is to be rolled out across the country. The Scottish government scheme - designed to tackle ""period poverty"" - waslaunched in July last year. The six-month pilot was continued in March, and has distributed free products to more than 1,000 women. Equalities Secretary Angela Constance has announced the project will be extended across Scotland. In ""I, Daniel Blake"", single mother Katie (Hayley Squires) struggles to afford essentials items The campaign to provide free feminine hygiene products was, in part, inspired by the 2016 film I, Daniel Blake. The film,a 2016 film directed by Ken Loach- includes a scene where an impoverished female character shoplifts a packet of tampons. Scots scriptwriter Paul Laverty wrote the scene after meeting women who struggled to afford essential hygiene products. The pilot scheme was led by the Community Food Initiatives North East (CFINE) social enterprise, and was welcomed by anti-poverty campaigners, including The Trussell Trust. It follows a growing campaign demanding ""dignity"" for women whose budgets do not stretch to sanitary protection. Girlguides join period poverty campaign UK girls 'too poor to afford tampons' The cheapest way to deal with your period Ms Constance visited CFINE to hear about the work, and announced that, following the successful pilot in Aberdeen, the charity FareShare will distribute sanitary products from sites around the country, reaching an estimated 18,800 people. Ms Constance said: ""It is unacceptable that anyone in Scotland should be unable to access sanitary products and I am pleased that we are able to work with FareShare to make products available more widely through the services delivered by their partners."" Gillian Kynoch, head of FareShare in Scotland, said: ""We are excited to be working with the Scottish government to use our network to make sanitary products available to people across Scotland."" Labour MSP Monica Lennon welcomed the extension of the scheme, but called for a statutory requirement to ensure free provision in schools, colleges and universities as well as ""placing a duty on the Scottish government to deliver a free universal system of access"". She said: ""Scotland can be a world leader in tackling period poverty if we are bold enough to take these radical steps."" Is this really a problem in Scotland? In 2016,the Trussell Trust,externalcharity said of the 133,000 people who used Scotland's food banks in the previous financial year, ""thousands"" received feminine hygiene products. The charity's Scotland network manager, Ewan Gurr, said Scots were relying on food banks for essential toiletries after finding themselves in ""difficult financial circumstances"" - often due to benefit sanctions, delayed wages or low incomes. The charity worker said some women had even resorted to using toilet roll, socks or newspaper because they were unable to afford female sanitary products.

Hotter years 'mean lower exam results',"In years with hotter weather pupils are likely to perform less well in exams, says a major study from researchers at Harvard and other US universities. There is a ""significant"" link between higher temperatures and lower school achievement, say economic researchers. An analysis of test scores of 10 million US secondary school students over 13 years shows hot weather has a negative impact on results. The study says a practical response could be to use more air conditioning. Students taking exams in a summer heat wave might have always complained that they were hampered by the sweltering weather. But this study, from academics at Harvard, the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) and Georgia State University, claims to have produced the first clear evidence showing that when temperatures go up, school performance goes down. Researchers have tracked how secondary school students performed in tests in different years, between 2001 and 2014, across the different climates and weather patterns within the US. The study, published by the US National Bureau of Economic Research,external, found that students were more likely to have lower scores in years with higher temperatures and better results in cooler years. This applied across the many different types of climate - whether in cooler northern US states or in the southern states where temperatures are typically much higher. The study, Heat and Learning, suggested that hotter weather made it harder to study in lessons in school and to concentrate on homework out of school. Researchers calculated that for every 0.55C increase in average temperature over the year, there was a 1% fall in learning. Colder days did not seem to damage achievement - but the negative impact began to be measurable as temperatures rose above 21C. The reduction in learning accelerated once temperatures rose above 32C and even more so above 38C. The study also found the impact of the heat was much greater on low income families and students from ethnic minorities. There were suggestions that wealthier families and schools in disadvantaged areas were more likely to intervene if pupils were slipping behind and to find ways to compensate, such as extra tuition. But it says a ""simpler explanation"" might be greater access to air conditioning in more affluent families and the schools their children attend. Joshua Goodman, associate professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, and his co-authors provide evidence that the ""heat's disruption of instruction or homework time is responsible for the observed drop in test scores"". He says students were incrementally more likely to be ""distracted, agitated and find it harder to focus"". But Mr Goodman says it would have been harder to carry out similar studies in the education systems in the UK, because the differences in weather conditions would have been much narrower. The wide range of weather conditions in the US allows comparisons within the same year group as well as with test performances in previous years. Mr Goodman says the findings also raise bigger questions about whether climate change and global warming will have implications for school achievement. More fromGlobal education Does the UN mean anything to the young? Gordon Brown launches $10bn global school fund London ranked top city for students Why do young workers have so many more accidents? The study also asks whether heat plays a part in the huge regional differences in achievement within the US. Northern states such as Massachusetts have very high levels of achievement in international tests, such asthe OECD's Pisa tests,which compare teenagers' ability in reading, maths and science. Butsouthern states such as Alabama and Mississippi are at a level below European countries and closer to Turkey and Mexico. The researchers also argue there are implications for the ethnic achievement gaps - with black and Hispanic students more concentrated in hotter states of the US. ""We argue that heat effects account for up to 13% of the US racial achievement gap,"" says the study, because of where black and Hispanic students live and because their test scores seem to be disproportionately disrupted by the changes in temperature. Mr Goodman says the researchers also want to examine the long-term consequences of a hot year on a cohort of students. If students happen to take important exams in a heatwave year, does that mean they are more likely to miss out on exam results and university places? Mr Goodman says that policymakers and parents have under-estimated the significance of temperatures in schools and overheated classrooms. ""Teachers and students already know it's a problem - because they've had to live it,"" he said. Ananas Kumar in India:Weather always affects the result of an exam. Having experienced both summer and winter exams I can say that summer affects your performance more due to hot temperatures, dehydration and sunstroke. John Hammond:As a retired teacher, I don't think this is news at all. The simple fact is that it is little to do with the actual exams and far more to do with the weather in the run up to the exams and this starts as soon as Easter. I taught in a school on the south coast and we dreaded a good Easter because the pupils all went to the beach to revise rather than stay at home and doing it properly. The study should have concentrated on the IQs of the kids involved; usually the brighter ones were more capable of resisting the pull of the beach. Haidab Hany in Ghana:I would like to challenge the Harvard research that heat-waves affect students during exams. I live in Ghana which is a tropical country. We have very hot weather from December to April and students in schools all over the country write exams and do well. Some pupils of course don't do well, but that's not due to the heat just poor preparation. I've studied in Ghana and during heat waves and had no issues. Afbell:As someone who took O-levels and A-levels more than 40 years ago, I have known this for over 40 years! I personally had the double whammy of suffering from hay-fever so had to put up with warm weather and the accompanying high pollen count. Antihistamines were considerably less effective in the mid-70s so I just had to suffer. My recollection of this period also includes trying to revise during very hot weather. This was actually worse than the exams; exams had a finish time, revising seemed to be endless in the heat. Joe Field:I have been teaching since 1972, I have no doubt that test results during a heat-wave are lower than in cooler weather. Learning in general is worse during a heat wave. This appears to be one reason for the long summer school holidays in the UK, US and elsewhere.

School shooting video game sale pulled,"Active Shooter is no longer listed at the Steam store A game pitched as a ""school shooting simulation"" has been ditched from Steam's online store ahead of release. The title had been criticised by parents of real-life school shooting victims,and an online petition opposing,externalits launch had attracted more than 180,000 signatures. Steam's owner, Valve, said it had dropped the game because its developer had a history of bad behaviour. But the individual named has denied involvement. Active Shooter came to prominenceafter the BBC revealed that an anti-gun violence charityhad described it as ""appalling"" last week. CNNsubsequently reported that the families,externalof two students killed in February's high school attack in Parkland, Florida had described the game as being ""despicable"" and ""horrific"". It also drew the ire of Florida's senior senator Bill Nelson, who called it ""inexcusable"",adding that the developer should,externalbe ""ashamed"". Other US officials had also expressed concern.

Valve subsequently emailed the media to say it had taken action ahead of Active Shooter's scheduled 6 June release. ""This developer and publisher is, in fact, a person calling himself Ata Berdiyev, who had previously been removed last fall when he was operating as '[bc]Interactive' and 'Elusive Team',"" said Valve in a statement. ""Ata is a troll, with a history of customer abuse, publishing copyrighted material, and user review manipulation. ""His subsequent return under new business names was a fact that came to light as we investigated the controversy around his upcoming title. We are not going to do business with people who act like this towards our customers or Valve. ""The broader conversation about Steam's content policies is one that we'll be addressing soon."" Steam store school-shooting game 'appalling' Girls' school video game banned in the UK Trump holds games violence meeting Sony blocks Super Seducer video game The BBC contacted Active Shooter's publisher for a reaction at an email address it had provided for press enquiries. A person identifying himself as Arthur Belkin sent a brief reply. ""Ata is my good friend, but past games I've created are mine. I'm still waiting for Steam's reply regarding the whole topic."" He also provided aTwitter account address for Mr Berdyev,external. The publisher has denied Mr Berdyev was Active Shooter's developer and declined to comment further pending the publication of an interview given to PC Mag. The PC game's publisher had tried to distance itself from the controversy ahead of Valve's intervention. Screenshots had provided a tally of the number of civilians killed Although the original listing had explicitly described the title as being a ""school shooting simulation"", the reference was dropped. In addition, a promise that gamers could ""slaughter as many civilians as possible"" if they chose to control the attacker rather than a police officer, was also removed. The publisher had also sought to downplay a post in which it had apparently confirmed that the title would feature non-player characters (NPCs) modelled to look like children, who could be targeted. The publisher struck out an earlier comment made about featuring children in the game ""That was bad sarcasm on my part. Sorry, but English is my third language,"" it said in a post to Steam's discussion forums,which remains online,external. Elsewhere, the publisher accused the media of ""twisting its words"" and claimed it was ""absurd"" that people were petitioning for the product to be banned. In particular, it drew attention to the fact that other mass shooting-themed titles had been sold via Steam for several years. ""Games like Hatred, Postal and Carmageddon are literally about mentally unstable people slaying dozens of people,"" it posted. ""You cannot simply say OK to one and not OK to another."" President Trump is among those who have previously suggested that violence in video games could encourage real-world attacks. But making such a link is controversial andgames industry leadersdeny there is evidence to support it. Even so, the organiser of the Change.org campaign against Active Shooter has celebrated a ban in this instance on the grounds that school shootings should not be depicted for entertainment.

"Boy, 15, dies after street stabbing","Keelan Wilson, pictured with his mother Kelly, was taken to hospital where he later died A 15-year-old boy who died after being stabbed just yards from his home in Wolverhampton has been described as an ""angel"" by his grandfather. Keelan Wilson was found following reports of disorder between a group of youths in Langley Road, Merry Hill, at about 23:00 BST on Tuesday. He was taken to hospital where he later died. West Midlands Police said it had launched a murder investigation. George Ellitts said Keelan had raised money for charity and loved cars. Midlands Live: Cable thefts cause trains chaos; New M5-M6 link road plan splits opinion Speaking outside the family home, the boy's grandfather added: ""To me, he was an angel. ""They were all supposed to be going on holiday a week tomorrow, to Egypt. ""He's lived with me all my life. ""He raised a few hundred pounds for Great Ormond Street Hospital a few years back, he had his hair cut, he had the lot off."" A car, thought to belong to a taxi driver who witnessed the trouble, is within the police cordon Mr Ellitts said the teenager's mother Kelly, who also lived at the address just a few metres from the scene of the attack in Strathfield Walk, was ""in a bad way"". Keelan was due to turn 16 in July, he added. Det Ch Insp Chris Mallett said: ""A young boy has tragically been killed and we are determined to find out why this has happened."" He described the death as a ""terrible loss"" adding the boy had his life ahead of him and officers would be ""working round the clock"" to find who was responsible. The BBC's Sarah Bishop said a taxi driver, called to the road to pick up a fare on Tuesday night, told her he saw about four youths approach Keelan and his friend, armed with knives. The taxi driver was wounded in the incident and was taken to hospital with a hand injury. His car remains at the scene and has been cordoned off by police. Neighbours have also told the BBC they heard a commotion outside their homes late on Tuesday evening. CCTV in the area is being checked and detectives are following a number of lines of inquiry We have spoken to the relatives of the victim who say he was due to start college in Birmingham in September. He had also raised money for charity by having all of his hair cut off for Great Ormond Street Hospital. The family we have spoken to here are absolutely devastated. Neighbours have also said how shocked they are about what has happened, while West Midlands Police has pledged to catch those responsible as soon as possible. West Midlands Ambulance Service said its crews arrived just after 23:00 to find Keelan with serious injuries. ""The team of ambulance staff worked quickly to begin administering advanced life support to him at the scene and this continued as he was transferred to New Cross Hospital,"" the spokesman said. ""Sadly, shortly after arrival at hospital it became apparent nothing could be done to save him and he was confirmed deceased."" Ch Supt Jayne Meir urged communities, parents and young people to come together to stop the violence CCTV in the area is being checked and detectives said they are following a number of active lines of inquiry and urged anyone with information to contact the force. Ch Supt Jayne Meir, in charge of police in the city of Wolverhampton, said she wanted the cycle of violence to stop. ""This isn't unique to Wolverhampton and unfortunately it's not unique to the West Midlands, it's happening in cities across the country and we need it to stop,"" she said. ""But, if we don't stand together and do something about it, it will get worse and we can't do it on our own.

Warnings as flood risk remains,"This video can not be played Properties were evacuated and roads flooded in Kent Motorists are being warned not to drive through flood water after thunderstorms and torrential rain brought parts of Kent and London to a standstill. The Environment Agency has said further rainfall over the next few days could lead to more localised flooding. The warning comes after south-east England received a month's worth of rain in a few hours on Tuesday. Some roads remain closed due to the flooding, fallen trees and sewage overflow. Parts of Chatham remain underwater A spokesman for the Environment Agency said: ""We remind people not to drive through flood water as just 30cm can move your car, and to check our active alerts and warnings - which are updated every 15 minutes - online. ""Our teams remain out on the ground, checking and operating defences and we are ready to support local authorities in responding to surface-water flooding."" Helen Whately MP tweeted the clear-up was getting under way London Fire Brigade confirmed it received more than 100 flood-related calls on Tuesday. Some train services were cancelled as railway lines were submerged and a number of flights from Gatwick Airport were also affected. Almost the entire May average of 50mm (2in) of rain fell in a matter of hours. A spokesman for Kent Highways said teams were still out working to clear flood water from roads on Wednesday. The worst problems were in Maidstone, Gravesham and Swale, in the north-east of the county. In Medway, Veolia is working to clear debris from roads around Walderslade. Capstone Road remains closed and Medway Council is liaising with Southern Water about repairs.

SSE to raise gas and electricity prices,"SSE has become the last of the ""big six"" energy companies to announce early summer price rises, with a 6.7% average increase in gas and electricity bills. The move will see gas prices rise by 5.7% and electricity prices go up by 7.7% on 11 July for SSE customers on variable deals. This will mean an average Â£76 per year rise for 2.36 million customers. The company said the price rise was the result of increasing costs ""largely outside our control"". ""We deeply regret having to raise prices and have worked hard to withstand the increasing costs,"" said Stephen Forbes, chief commercial officer at the company. ""The cost of supplying energy is increasing and this ultimately impacts the prices we are able to offer customers."" All the major domestic energy suppliers have announced some form of price rise in recent weeks. Some 4.1 million British Gas customers faced a 5.5% hike as of Tuesday, adding an average of Â£60 to bills. The move was branded as""unjustified"" by the governmentwhen it was announced. Scottish Power is increasing prices by 5.5%, or Â£63 on average, for nearly one million people from 1 June. EDF has a 2.7%, or Â£16, electricity price rise coming into effect on 7 June for 1.2 million customers. Npower's 5.3% increase, an average of Â£64, will hit one million people from 17 June. E.On has made changes to how it bills customers which took effect in April. They will amount to a rise in the average standard variable rate of Â£22. Last week, SSE - which is planning to merge its retail arm with rival Npower - announced that it profits fell last year as it lost 430,000 customers. SSE pointed to competitive pressures as the number of domestic energy accounts fell from 7.23 million to 6.8 million. The government has criticised the price rise announced by the company, ahead of a cap on some variable rate tariffs. Energy minister Claire Perry said: ""It is extremely disappointing that SSE has decided to announce this unjustified price rise - the highest yet from the Big Six - ahead of the new law coming into effect later this year. ""Consumers should vote with their feet. Switching suppliers will always help consumers get the best deal. An average consumer can save around Â£300 by switching from a default tariff offered by the Big Six to one of the cheapest deals in the market."" Peter Earl, from price comparison website comparethemarket.com, which makes it money from consumers switching, said: ""With the company announcing last week that it lost 430,000 customers in the past year, it is clear that people are realising that many tariffs offered by these energy giants are fundamentally bad value.""

Kremlin critic freed after Spain arrest,"Mr Browder has campaigned against corruption in Russia for years Financier Bill Browder, a high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been briefly arrested in Spain on a Russian arrest warrant. After an hour in custody he was released because the warrant was no longer valid, Spanish police said. Mr Browder had earlier tweeted that he had been arrested on a Russian Interpol arrest warrant. Interpol rejected the claim, saying: ""There is not, and never has been, a Red Notice for Mr Bill Browder."" The agency said in a statement: ""Mr Browder is not wanted via Interpol channels."" But there were multiple accounts about how the confusion arose, and why Mr Browder was detained. A police spokesman told AFP: ""An arrest warrant has a date limit and when that expires, it must be deleted from the computer programme and in this case Interpol hadn't deleted it."" The financier taking on Russiaâs oligarchy Russia jails investor Browder in absentia But the US-born financier, who is a British citizen, tweeted that a new notice had been issued. ""Spanish National Police just released me after Interpol General Secretary in Lyon advised them not to honor the new Russian Interpol Red Notice,"" he said. ""This is the sixth time that Russia has abused Interpol in my case."" Interpol had previously refused to enforce a 2013 warrant for the investor,external, deeming it ""predominantly political in nature"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Browder is widely credited with the creation of the Magnitsky Act - a 2012 range of sanctions from the United States on top Russian officials accused of corruption. The act was named after his former lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered an alleged tax fraud in Moscow - and died in a Russian prison in 2009. Since then, Mr Browder has campaigned for investigations into the alleged fraud. He was put on trial in absentia in 2013 for tax evasion - inthe same trial where the deceased Magnitsky faced charges, which  was labelled ""absurd"" by observers. Mr Browder was once one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia, controlling Hermitage Capital Management. Russian prosecutors accused him of creating a firm for tax fraud purposes. Mr Browder has always said that the charges against him are politically motivated. British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said he spoke to Mr Browder and was ""very glad that he has now been released"". ""Moscow should concentrate on bringing those responsible for the murder of #Magnitsky to justice,"" he tweeted. Mr Browder was in Madrid to give evidence to a Spanish prosecutor about money from the Magnitsky case that was moved to Spain. He said the arrest while on such a trip was ironic, but added: ""Now that I'm released my mission carries on.""

Rockers' basement pool plan row rolls on,"Jimmy Page attended the Kensington and Chelsea Council's planning meeting to voice his concerns A planning battle between music icons Robbie Williams and Jimmy Page is to drag on after a council failed to reach a decision on the singer's swimming pool plans for his west London home. Former Led Zeppelin guitarist Page had opposed Williams' proposals for a basement with pool at his home. Neighbour Page argued that excavations would be ""catastrophic"" for his Grade I listed Gothic-style Tower House. But Kensington and Chelsea Council's planning committee deferred a decision. Disagreements between Page, 74, and Williams, 44, began four years ago when the former Take That singer bought the house next to Page - which used to belong to Michael Winner. Robbie Williams is seeking permission to build an underground swimming pool and gym A drawing from the planning application to develop the basement at the property Page, who has lived in the Victorian Tower House since 1972, objected to Williams' plans to renovate, voicing concern that vibrations could cause irreversible damage. Builders working for Williams were fined Â£3,000 for disturbing Page's peace by taking apart a shed on a Sunday. At war with next door: When musician neighbours fall out Jimmy Page denies stealing Stairway to Heaven riff Robbie Williams and Rod Stewart tour bus to be homeless shelter Williams submitted proposals to the council in January to excavate a basement and build a swimming pool and gym facilities under his home. In response, Page wrote a two-page letter to the council objecting to the project and outlining his concerns about the potential impact of digging on his home, which he described as ""one of the most historic buildings in the borough"". Jimmy Page made a statement at a planning meeting at Kensington and Chelsea Town Hall ""Having protected the Tower House for over 40 years, I am now continuing the fight against a new threat to this precious and unique building,"" Page wrote. Page attended the council meeting where Williams' planning application - which had been recommended for approval by council officers - was discussed. He told councillors: ""I feel it is my duty to protect that house, I really do."" But the committee decided to defer a decision to consider what conditions and regulations might be appropriate. After the meeting Mr Page said he was ""very pleased"" with the decision, adding: ""I think the deferment was a very good conclusion.""

Grenfell disaster response 'badly flawed',"Voluntary organisations filled the void left by a lack of official direction following the fire, the report found Volunteers were left to help Grenfell Tower residents amid a ""badly flawed"" council response to the disaster, a report has found. Those without shelter turned to aid groups in the wake of theblaze that killed 72 peopleon 14 June 2017, the review by Muslim Aid said. It said charities ""on the front line"" filled the gap created by Kensington and Chelsea Council's ""slow response"". The authority, which was criticised for ""weak leadership"", declined to comment. It said the ongoing public inquiry prevented it from doing so. Muslim Aid's review found those seeking refuge and information about their relatives after the blaze faced ""limited co-ordination"". By the next day, no council helpline had been set up so several charities established their own to fill in the gap, it said. ""Weak leadership"" of the initial council response compounded the consequences of the disaster, the report said. The authority was ""slow to provide direction, co-ordination and information and to address multiple pressing needs,"" the report said. The fire ripped through the west London tower block on 14 June last year It warned the tragedy could play out again ""at a time when the frequency of disasters in the UK is likely to increase due to climate change, vulnerability to terror attacks and the inherent risks of life in crowded, unequal cities"". Muslim Aid CEO Jehangir Malik said he would have ""expected this chaos in a developing country"" with poor infrastructure. ""I honestly thought we had better disaster preparedness and response systems here in the UK,"" he said. The report also recognised the voluntary sector ""came up short"" in certain areas, ""with some systems, structures and approaches not fit for purpose"". Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Listen: The Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast Grenfell Fire: Grief remains raw Grenfell Tower insulation 'never passed fire safety test' Peter Herbert, the founder of BMELawyers4Grenfell, told the Today programme the council was ""ill equipped"". ""There's a race dynamic to this,"" he added. ""These were not only people who lived in a social housing in a tower block and so on the margins of society in London, but also they were a large proportion for minority and diverse communities."" However, author Andrew O'Hagan who has been investigating what happened, told the BBC that criticism of the council leadership ""didn't stand up to the evidence"". ""The council actually responded as well as they could under these incredibly difficult circumstances,"" Mr O'Hagan said. ""People are away with the fairies if they think people who work for the council hate the poor."" More than 200 firefighters and 40 fire engines responded to the fire at the 24-storey block in North Kensington In response to the report from Muslim Aid, the council said it did not think it appropriate to comment further as itwas a matter for the current public inquiry. However, the council confirmed it was to replace doors in social housing across the borough after failed safety tests. Grenfell Tower's doors failed to withstand fire for the required 30 minutes, according to the council. The authority estimates it will need to replace about 4,000 front doors at a cost of about Â£3.5m under orders from Secretary of State James Brokenshire. He has said ""all Manse doors across the country must be replaced, but stated that 'the risk to public safety remains low'"", the council said in a statement. This video can not be played Marcio and Andreia Gomes tell the story of how they managed to escape the fire The Grenfell Inquiry has been hearing from survivors and relatives of those who died. Marcio Gomes, whose son was stillborn after his parents fled the blaze, said losing his child ""felt like our hearts had broken"". ""He was going to be my superstar,"" he said. Hamid Ali Jafari lost his father Ali Yawar Jafari, 82, in the fire. Speaking at the inquiry, he said he now asks friends ""to pray that I die soon to join my father"" in heaven.

Grenfell 'hero' sheltered others in flat,"This video can not be played Nazanin Aghlani (left): ""It was not only the horrifying fire that took my mum's life that night."" A woman whose disabled mother, Sakineh Afrasiabi, died in Grenfell Tower has criticised the council for housing her on the 18th floor of the block. Nazanin Aghlani said her 65-year-old mother's ""human right to escape"" was impeded by housing her so high up. She said: ""Our mum lost her life not only due to the fire that night, but to the corporate negligence of the very people who were to ensure her safety."" Ms Afrasiabi was partially sighted and got around using a tri-walker. Who were the victims? What can we expect from the inquiry? The Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast with Eddie Mair Speaking on the seventh and final day of the inquiry's commemoration hearings, Ms Aghlani said the council told her mother in 2003 that she should not be housed above the fourth floor of any building. But - ""after being refused many suitable properties"" - in 2016 she moved into a flat on the 18th floor of Grenfell Tower ""out of desperation"". Sakineh Afrasiabia was described by her daughter as a ""vulnerable, physically disabled and partially sighted pensioner"" Her daughter, Ms Aghlani said: ""Every day, again and again, as our mind tries to make sense of this disastrous tragedy, we come to the conclusion that it was not only the horrifying fire that took my mum's life that night. ""The discrimination and failure in duty of care by the housing allocations team which resulted in a vulnerable, physically disabled and partially sighted pensioner being housed on the 18th floor of a tower block equally took the life of my mum. ""The very people who said, years before, that she was not to be housed above the fourth floor of a lifted building. ""She couldn't go down 18 floors of stairs on a good day, let alone in a fire. Her human right to escape was denied even before the fire happened."" Ms Afrasiabi, who was from Iran, moved to the UK in 1997. Fatemeh Afrasiabi (left) died after visiting her sister Sakineh at Grenfell Tower The 65-year-old grandmother died alongside her sister Fatemeh, who had been visiting her. The inquiry had previously heard that on the night of the fireMs Afrasiabi and her older sister Fatemeh had gone to the 23rd floor,where they ""believed that help was coming from above"" to rescue them. The inquiry heard that Fatemah's husband was unable to pay tribute to the mother of five because his immigration application was refused. Day 1: Tribute to baby as Grenfell inquiry opens Day 2: Families walk out as Grenfell video shown Day 3: Victim's son 'prays for death' to join father in heaven Day 4: Grenfell niece tribute distress for aunt Day 5: 'We will never play again' Day 6: Grenfell Tower dad blames firefighters A man who died sheltering six people in his top-floor flat as they tried to escape the Grenfell Tower fire has been hailed a hero by his sister. Raymond ""Moses"" Bernard, 64, gave refuge to neighbours who were unable to find a way down, his sister Bernadette told the inquiry. This video can not be played Ray ""was a hero"" that night as others sought refuge in his flat The father of three ""did not deserve to die by suffocation, cyanide poisoning and ultimately burned"" she said. Ms Bernard said the six people found in her brother's 23rd floor flat included: Deborah Lamprell, 45 Jessica Urbano (Ramirez), 12 Berkti Haftom, 29, and her son Biruk Haftom, 12 Hamid Kani, 61 ""As there was no way down to escape the only alternative was to head to the top floor. There they met Ray and took refuge in his flat,"" Ms Bernard said. Raymond ""Moses"" Bernard lived in a flat on the 23rd floor She said the other residents were found on her brother's bed, while he was beside the bed on the floor. ""This shows the respect he gave to those who lost their lives that night, and we know that he would have given comfort to each of them before they took their last breaths and departed this world,"" she said. ""We know from the detail shared with us by the coroner that Ray was a hero on that tragic night."" She said her brother, who died with his dog Marley, ""should not have been killed in this way"". ""Sadly where there is no justice there is no peace. I will never forget, I will never forgive."" Khadija Khaloufi's brother was unable to pay tribute to his sister because of visa delays Karim Khaloufi, the younger brother of 52-year-old victim Khadija Khaloufi, was also unable to attend the inquiry after delays with his visa. Mrs Khaloufi lived on the 17th floor with her husband of 27 years, Sabah Abdullah, who survived the fire. Her brother said in his statement: ""We had been led to believe that we could be in London for the inquiry, but now does not seem to be the case. ""No-one seems to care about our history or relationship to this case, or to care about our pain, our heartache or our desire for answers."" Counsel to the inquiry Bernard Richmond said ""very strenuous efforts"" were made to try to get him to the hearing. Farah Hamdan, pictured with her husband Omar Belkadi, and baby Leena were found in a stairwell between the 19th and 20th floor Hamdan El Alami wept as he paid tribute to his daughter Farah Hamdan, who died in the fire with her husband Omar Belkadi and their daughters Malak Belkadi, eight, and baby Leena Belkadi. Six-month-old Leena, who died from inhalation of fire fumes, was found dead in her mother's arms in a stairwell between the 19th and 20th floor. Speaking through a translator, Mr El Alami described seeing his family for the last time, saying: ""I did not know that that night was the night when they will die."" Said Essaouini (centre) pays tribute to his wife Isra Ibrahim The husband of 33-year-old Isra Ibrahim, who died alongside her brother and mother on the 23rd floor, told the inquiry he spends two hours at her grave every week. Said Essaouini said: ""I feel like I lost my world. Every Friday I go to the cemetery and I sit down and I talk to her for two hours - I know she is listening to me and I know she loved me to the max as well."" He said he wished he had been with his wife on the night of the fire but she had sent him to the mosque. ""I believe she could have escaped the fire if she wanted to but she didn't want to leave her mother,"" he said. ""I will never find no-one like her, never ever, ever a woman like Isra again, and I am ripped up to pieces."" Meanwhile, a report has found there was a ""badly flawed"" response to the fire. The review by Muslim Aid criticised ""weak leadership"" at Kensington and Chelsea Council andfound volunteers were left ""on the front line"" helping residents find food and shelter. The council said it could not comment due to an ongoing public inquiry. By Duncan Leatherdale, BBC News For seven days, dozens of relatives have spoken, showed videos and offered pen portraits to 67 loved ones. The last day saw each speaker receive a standing ovation at the end of their time on stage, even when it was a solicitor reading the words. The final tribute, a video to the Choucair family, was paused halfway through as a member of the audience required medical treatment. There was then further delay while Nabil Choucair, who was paying tribute to six members of his family, also received medical attention. He was determined to see the tribute through, however, and returned to the stage to a standing ovation and cries of ""we love you Nabil"". The video resumed with a short film made by 13-year-old Mierna Choucair, before she died, about her morning routine. It also featured cameos from her sisters. A video by 13-year-old victim Mierna Choucair was played at the inquiry There were laughs from the audience, especially at the blooper reel, but also a palpable sense that we were seeing three young lives soon to be lost. Nabil's video ended with a picture of his sister, Nadia, waving for help from the window of their flat as it burned. Nabil ended with a national call for justice. The hearing ended with the reading of the 72 names followed by 72 seconds of silence. It was a supremely poignant ending to the commemorations. Getting to know the deceased has finished, next up are the big questions about how they came to die. That starts on Monday. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims?

Grenfell Inquiry: What is happening?,"This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? The Grenfell Tower Inquiry is hearing from victims' families this week, nearly a year after a huge fire engulfed the west London tower block. The fire was reported at the 24-storey block in North Kensington at 00:54 BST on 14 June 2017. It started in a Hotpoint fridge freezeron the fourth floor. Police say it was not started deliberately. It took until 01:14 BST the following day to bring the fire under control, killing 72 people and destroying 151 homes, both inside the block and nearby. The fire's ""unexpected"" ferocity led to questions about the Â£8.6m refurbishment of the tower block, andin particular the cladding. Prime Minister Theresa Mayordered a full public inquirythe day after the fire. ""We need to know what happened, we need to have an explanation of this,"" she said at the time. The inquiry has been set up to determine three things: what happened, why, and what can be done to prevent anything similar happening again. There will be two phases of the inquiry: the first will examine how the blaze developed and the second will look at how the tower became exposed to the risk of a major fire. It is separate to any police investigation. A retired judge, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, was chosen by the prime minister to lead the public inquiry in June 2017. He opened the inquiry exactly three months after the fireon 14 September 2017. At the time, he said: ""The inquiry process is not adversarial, it's not to punish anyone or award compensation. It's simply to get to the truth."" According to the inquiry, 547 individuals and organisationshave been granted core participant status,external. Sir Martin is supported bya team of 35 people,external, including a legal team, civil servants and three assessors. Nine expert witnesses have so far been announced, focusing on the spread of the fire, the regulation of the building, the fire brigade's role and the impact of gas and water supplies to the building. By March, some 267,000 documentswere received and reviewed,externalby the inquiry. Survivors have pushed hard for more diversity on the inquiry panel Many of the survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire wereunhappy with the choice of Sir Martin. As a former judge, he was considered too ""establishment"" and out of step with the sentiments of the local community. Grenfell United, which represents survivors and the bereaved, said they feared the inquiry would be a ""whitewash"". Critics were also angry atSir Martin's refusal to appoint a person from the Grenfell communityto an advisory panel that will consider the evidence with him. More than 156,000 peoplesigned a petition,externalcalling for individuals from a range of backgrounds to sit on a panel. Following pressure from victims' families, the prime minister agreed on 11 May thattwo experts will sit with Sir Martin in phase two of the inquiry. All the families of those who died. They have been invited to take part in the inquiry as ""core participants"". They will receive all the relevant evidence in advance of the hearing and can suggest lines of questioning that they would like to see pursued. The inquirywill also hear from survivors, Grenfell residents, firefighters and expert witnesses. Sir Martin has faced hostility from the bereaved and survivors of the Grenfell Tower On 16 November 2017, officials said71 victims of the fire had been identified, including baby Logan Gomes, who was stillborn in hospital after the fire. However, the deaths of 72 people will be looked at by the inquiry, including Maria Del Pilar Burton, 74, who died in January 2018. She had been in hospital since she was rescued from the 19th floor. Nine days of commemoration hearings began on Monday, 21 May with a 72-second silence for the victims. Organisers say it is ""an opportunity for the families of those who lost their lives in the fire to provide a tribute of them for the inquiry record"". The first tribute on the opening day of the inquirywas from the father of a baby stillborn after his parents escaped the blaze. Five others were also remembered on the first day. The inquiry is then scheduled to hear from its firstexpert witnesses on 18 June.,external Evidence from firefighterswho worked on the scene will be heard in late June and early July. Survivors, the bereaved and local residents are set to give their evidence at the beginning of September. Closing statements of phase one of the inquiry are not expected until the end of October. The second phase is not expected to begin until the new year when Sir Martin will be joined by the two additional panel members, who have yet to be named. Part two of the inquiry will focus on the construction, refurbishment and management of the building prior to the fire. After the inquiry has heard all of the relevant evidence, Sir Martin will prepare a report for the prime minister, who has promised to publish the findings in full.

UK drone users face safety tests or fines,"UK drone users may have to pass online safety tests under legislation being introduced to the Commons on Wednesday. Restrictions around airport boundaries have also been clarified stopping any drone flying within 1km of them. The changes, which are set to come into effect between July 2018 and November 2019, follow a rise in the number of drone near-misses with aircrafts. Aviation Minister Baroness Sugg said the measures were needed to ""protect"" aircraft and their passengers. In addition to the safety tests, people who own drones weighing 250g or more will have to register with the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Police drone and jet had 'near-miss' Drones used to disrupt FBI hostage situation Some drones, usually cheaper models, weigh less than 250g. But most - especially those with built-in cameras - weigh more. Before, the regulations had applied to aircraft that weigh 20kg or less. All drones will also be banned from flying above 400ft (121.9m), a rule which had been mentioned previously in the CAA's Drone Code but will now be enshrined in law. This video can not be played How drones could help save lives at sea Users who fail to adhere to the flight restrictions could face unlimited fines, up to five years in prison, or both. Owners of drones over 250g, who do not register with the CAA or complete the safety test, could be fined up to Â£1,000. By BBC Reality Check The number of aircraft incidents involving drones has grown dramatically in the past few years. In 2013 there were zero incidents, but that grew to almost 100 last year. Civilian drones have grown increasingly popular as their price has fallen. Technological improvement has meant components are smaller, faster and cheaper than ever before. The UK Airprox Board assesses incidents involving drones and keeps a log of all reports. In one incident last year, for example, a pilot flying over Manchester saw a red ""football-sized"" drone passing down the left hand side of the aircraft. In another incident, a plane leaving Glasgow narrowly missed a drone. The pilot, in that case, said the crew only had three seconds of warning and there was ""no time to take avoiding action"". There were 89 incidents involving aircraft and drones in the UK in 2017 - a 25% increase on the previous year. A report by PricewaterhouseCoopers,externalreleased this week estimated drones could add Â£42bn to the UK economy by 2030 - and Baroness Sugg stressed the government was keen not to stunt the growth of the sector. She added, however, that it was important to ""ensure drones are used safely and responsibly"". Chris Woodroofe, chief operating officer at Gatwick Airport, said the changes should leave ""no doubt"" that drones must be kept ""well away from aircraft, airports and airfields"". The number of active commercial drone licences in the UK increased from 2,500 to 3,800 in 2017. How drones could help save lives at sea.

Lucas to step down as Green co-leader,"This video can not be played Four things about Caroline Lucas Caroline Lucas is to step down as the co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales in September. The party's first and only MP - for Brighton Pavilion - has shared the role with Jonathan Bartley since 2016. In anarticle for the Guardian,external, Ms Lucas said Greens ""must always be an insurgent force for good, consistently asking the big questions that matter"". She said a new leadership team ""will step up to the challenge that our increasingly febrile times present"". Ms Lucas, 57, said she would be ""focusing even more"" on her work in Parliament and in her constituency, rather than standing for re-election. Green Party leaders are elected for two years and a fresh election is due to take place this summer, with nominations opening in June and a result announced in September. Profile: Green Party co-leaders She took Brighton Pavilion from Labour in the 2010 general election. ""I believe that Jonathan and I have shown the power of working together, since we became joint Green Party leaders in September 2016, and it's now time for me to show the power of letting go,"" she wrote. Ms Lucas has shared the leadership role with Jonathan Bartley since September 2016 Ms Lucas said the party's structures had been updated in the last two years, which was one of the co-leaders' priorities in 2016. She added that the Green Party must consistently ask ""the big questions that matter... and give the people of this country the bold alternative that is so desperately needed"". Most politicians only get one shot at leading their party, but Caroline Lucas has managed two stints in charge of the Greens. Although she claims not to rule anything out, this appears to be the end of her time at the top alongside co-leader Jonathan Bartley. The party had its best ever local election results in May, and at the last general election Caroline Lucas increased her majority as an MP. Awareness of plastic pollution is high and affordable housing, long championed by the Greens, is something mainstream parties are at pains to prioritise. But beyond local councils and a lone voice in parliament, the party can struggle to be heard. Caroline Lucas is the Green party's most recognisable figure, its only member of parliament and so the big question now is; who's next? Whoever is elected will need patience, perseverance and persistence to make gains in an electoral system stacked against them. In 2007, the Greens moved away from their longstanding tradition of having two principal speakers in favour of electing a leader every two years. A former MEP, Ms Lucas won leadership elections in 2008 and 2010 but decided against standing in 2012, when she was succeeded by Natalie Bennett who served until 2016. Mr Bartley, elected as a councillor in May, has yet to say whether he will stand again. Paying tribute to Ms Lucas on Twitter, he said he was ""so proud"" of what the duo had achieved over the last two years. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The party's share of the vote dropped by 2% at the 2017 general election, but it won 39 council seats - an increase of eight - inMay's local electionsin England. Speaking at the time, Ms Lucas said: ""The Green Party has taken a significant step forward with just a fraction of the resources of the bigger parties. We are now established as one of the four major English parties - and an electoral force right across the nation."" Greens prepare for leadership contest Lucas 'proud' of Green Party campaign.

Copperfield not liable for Briton's injuries,"David Copperfield is the world's highest paid magician US magician David Copperfield was negligent but not financially responsible for a UK man's injuries during a trick, a jury says. The jury in Nevada says Gavin Cox caused his own injuries during the famous vanishing act at a show in Las Vegas in 2013. Mr Cox filed a negligence lawsuit after falling during the show. He said he suffered brain and other injuries. The ruling means that he cannot seek financial damages from the illusionist. Mr Copperfield,the world's highest paid magician, has performed the ""Lucky#13"" trick thousands of times without any problems. The illusion involves making 13 audience members - chosen at random - disappear on stage. The grand surprise comes when the illusionist reveals the 13 at the back of the auditorium. Last month, Mr Copperfield was forced to reveal in court that after curtains come down on the participants on stage, they are hurried through passageways that lead them around the Las Vegas MGM resort. They leave the building and enter again at the back of the theatre. Mr Cox, a 58-year-old from Kent, fell while being led through these passages by stagehands. He was taken to hospital with a dislocated shoulder. He said doctors later diagnosed a brain lesion. Mr Cox's lawsuit claimed he had spent more than $400,000 (Â£302,000) on medical bills. It alleged there was construction debris in the passageways he used, but Mr Copperfield said he walked the same path earlier and it was clear. The Las Vegas resort MGM and Mr Copperfield's company were also defendants in the lawsuit. They were also found negligent - but not financially liable for Mr Cox's injuries.

Ukraine blames Russia for reporter's death,"Arkady Babchenko had fought in the Chechen wars Update: After this story was published it subsequently became clear that Arkady Babchenko was still alive andthere is a new story reflecting this. Ukraine's Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman has accused Russia of being behind the killing in Kiev of the Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko. ""I am confident that the Russian totalitarian machine did not forgive him his honesty and principled stance,"" the prime minister posted on Facebook. A Kremlin critic, Babchenko was gunned down outside his apartment on Tuesday. Russia has called for an investigation but said ""bloody crimes"" had become routine for the ""Kiev regime"". Relations between Russia and Ukraine remain tense following Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the seizure of parts of eastern Ukraine by pro-Russian forces. Babchenko, 41, was found bleeding at the entrance to his block of flats by his wife and died in an ambulance. He was reportedly shot several times in the back. Ukrainian lawmaker Anton Herashchenko said the journalist had gone out to buy some bread, and that the killer was waiting for him. Kiev police chief Andriy Kryshchenko told local media they suspected Babchenko was killed because of his ""professional activities"". The entrance to the apartment block in Kiev where Babchenko was shot dead In his last Facebook post just hours before the attack, Babchenko recalled a lucky escape four years ago - exactly to the day. He wrote that he had planned to fly with Ukrainian soldiers on a helicopter to the war zone in Ukraine's east. He was not allowed on board, because there was not enough space. The helicopter was shot down by pro-Russian rebels, leaving 14 people dead. Babchenko reported for the BBC about the helicopter crash. ""I was lucky. A second birthday, it turns out"", he wrote in his recent Facebook post. Reality Check: Are journalists increasingly under attack? In his reaction, the Ukrainian prime minister referred to Babchenko's last Facebook post. ""This is the last post of Arkady Babchenko. Ten hours ago he wrote about his second birthday. And then they killed him. ""I am confident that the Russian totalitarian machine did not forgive him his honesty and principled stance. He was a true friend of Ukraine who told the world the truth about Russian aggression."" Mr Groysman added: ""The killers should be punished."" Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement: ""We demand that the Ukrainian authorities make every effort to promptly investigate."" It added: ""Bloody crimes and total impunity had become routine for the Kiev regime"", while offering condolences to Babchenko's family and friends. Journalists and politicians have also been reacting to Babchenko's murder. Independent Russianjournalist Yevgenia Albats tweeted,external(in Russian): ""There was not a single reason for Arkady Babchenko's murder apart from what he wrote. No other reason."" Russian oppositionpolitician Dmitry Gudkov tweeted:,external""I'm so tired of finding out that my friends, acquaintances and people I know keep getting killed."" Babchenko covering the Maidan protests in Kiev in 2014 While studying law in Moscow aged 18, Babchenko was conscripted into the Russian army and served during the Chechen wars from 1994 to 2000. His memoir, One Soldier's War, chronicles his experiences in the conflict, which claimed the lives of tens of thousands on both sides. He then became a journalist, working for a number of different outlets. A well-known Kremlin critic, he stood inunofficial elections organised by the oppositionin 2012 and denounced Russia's actions in Syria and eastern Ukraine. In December 2016,Babchenko wrote a Facebook post (in Russian),externalabout a crashed Tu-154 transport plane, which crashed into the Black Sea while carrying a Red Army choir to Syria. 'All die' in Russia Black Sea plane crash Pilot error blamed in Russian air crash He claimed this Facebook post, in which he described Russia as an ""aggressor"", led to death threats and abuse from the Russian state. He wrote ina piece for The Guardian,externalthat this forced him to leave ""a country I no longer feel safe in"". He first moved to Prague and later to the Ukrainian capital. A former war correspondent, he worked in Kiev as a presenter on Ukraine's channel ATR TV. More on Arkady Babchenko from BBC Monitoring,external Kiev has in recent years seen a number of deadly attacks on high-profile figures, including journalists and politicians. Most of them were vocal critics of the Kremlin. The leading Belarusian journalist and Kremlin critic, Pavel Sheremet, was killed by a car bomb in Kiev in July 2016. Another car bomb killed Ukrainian military intelligence officer Col Maxim Shapoval in June 2017 in what the Ukrainian authorities called a terrorist act. In March of the same year, former Russian MP Denis Voronenkov was shot dead outside a hotel in Kiev.

Belgium gunman 'killed day before attack',"This video can not be played Shooter caught on camera carrying two guns The man who shot dead two police officers and a civilian in the Belgian city of LiÃ¨ge had killed someone the night before the attacks. Interior Minister Jan Jambon said the gunman, Benjamin Herman, had murdered a former prisoner he met while in jail. Reports say the victim was Michael Wilmet, 30, a convicted drug dealer who was hit repeatedly with a hammer. The two policewomen killed the next day have been identified as Lucile Garcia, 53, and Soraya Belkacemi, 45. The third victim, 22-year-old Cyril Vangriecken, was sitting in the passenger seat of a nearby parked car when he was shot. Prosecutors say they are treating the attacks as ""terrorist murder"". The Islamic State group (IS), which has claimed previous attacks in Belgium, said it was behind the shootings, but has not offered any evidence to support this. Soraya Belkacemi, left, and Lucile Garcia were named as the two police officers killed in the attack The gunman also took a cleaner hostage at a school before being killed by police. She was released unharmed. Named only as Darifa by Belgian media, the cleaner said Herman had burst in and asked her two questions: was she a Muslim, and was she observing Ramadan? She answered yes to both, she said, and he replied that he would not harm her. She then attempted to persuade him he should not be in the school with children. Officials said the 31-year-old man had shouted ""Allahu Akbar"" (""God is greatest"" in Arabic) several times during the attack. He had been freed from prison on temporary release on Monday after serving time for theft and drug offences. Local media report that he may have been radicalised while in jail. This video can not be played Social media footage captured the sound of gunshots ""There are signs he was radicalised in prison, but is it that radicalisation which drove him to commit these acts?"" Mr Jambon asked on RTL radio. ""It could have been because he had nothing to look forward to, because he also killed someone the night before, the guy's psychology and the fact... he may have been on drugs."" The gunman had been in and out of prison since he was a teenager and had had a criminal record that included assault and drug offences, police said. He was released at 07:30 local time on Monday and, under the terms of the temporary release, was expected to return to jail on Tuesday. It was during this period that he launched the attacks. Justice Minister Koen Geens defended the decision to release him, saying it was intended to help him prepare for his full release scheduled for 2020. He added that the attacker had been granted temporary leave numerous times before without incident. But he admitted that he had to ""examine"" his conscience following the attacks. ""The question of whether this man should have been given leave is striking because he killed three completely innocent people with a wish to kill himself,"" he told RTBF radio. ""I feel responsible because I have responsibility for prisons."" People pay tribute to the victims of the shooting The Brussels airport and metro blasts Why was Brussels attacked? Why have IS jihadists targeted Belgium? The shooting unfolded late on Tuesday morning near a cafe in the city centre. Prosecutors said the man had followed and ""savagely"" attacked the two female police officers, stabbing them repeatedly from behind with a knife before taking a gun from them and opening fire. He fatally shot dead Mr Vangriecken, who had almost finished studying to become a teacher, as he sat in the parked car, according to RTBF. The attacker then walked to a nearby school, where he briefly took the cleaner hostage. When armed police officers arrived at the scene, the attacker fired at them in an attempt to escape. Two officers were shot in the leg, leaving one in a serious condition. Two other officers received injuries to their arms before the attacker was shot dead, prosecutors said. Footage on social media showed people running to safety as several gunshots rang out. Children at the school were moved to safety. Belgium remains on alert after a series of jihadist attacks in the country and in neighbouring France. An armed policeman stands guard at the scene on Tuesday A Brussels-based cell was involved in the 2015 Paris attacks which left 130 people dead in several locations.

Nuisance call bosses face crackdown,"Bosses of firms which bombard people with nuisance calls could be fined up to Â£500,000 under government proposals to make them personally liable. A consultation is being launched about the plan - although the idea was first unveiled by government in 2016 and was meant to be in force by spring 2017. Consumers received 3.9 billion nuisance phone calls and texts last year. At the moment, only the companies themselves are liable for fines of up to Â£500,000 if they break the law. Since 2010, the data protection watchdog has struggled to recover fines because some firms have gone into liquidation to avoid paying. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) said it had collected just 54% of the Â£17.8m in fines issued over the past eight years because some directors ""try to escape paying penalties by declaring bankruptcy - only to open up again under a different name"". Nuisance calls: Your questions answered Call blocking given to most vulnerable In a consultation document, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) says it wants to give the ICO the ""powers it needs to hold company directors directly responsible"". Margot James, minister for Digital and the Creative Industries, said: ""Nuisance calls are a blight on society and we are determined to stamp them out. ""For too long a minority of company directors have escaped justice by liquidating their firms and opening up again under a different name."" ICO deputy commissioner Steve Wood welcomed the latest announcement. ""We have been calling for a change to the law for a while to deter those who deliberately set out to disrupt people with troublesome calls, texts and emails. ""These proposed changes will increase the tools we have to protect the public."" The consultation closes in August. The government plans to amend thePrivacy and Electronic Communications Regulations.,external But theDCMS first promised to clamp down on what it called ""nuisance call crooks"",externalin October 2016. That plan is thought to have been sidelined while the government concentrated on the recent Data Protection Act 2018. Nevertheless, the intention to resurrect the idea was welcomed by consumer groups and the industry. Alex Neill, managing director of Which? said making company directors personally responsible would be a major way to stop ""dodgy practices"". The proposals also won support from the marketing industry. The Direct Marketing Association, which represents official telemarketing firms, said it had long supported personal liability. John Mitchison, the DMA's director of policy and compliance, said: ""It should come as no surprise that individuals willing to skirt the law when it suits them are also ready to do the same to avoid paying their debts. ""The introduction of these new laws would target the individuals profiting from these rogue businesses, making them think twice about breaking the law if there is a real threat that they may be personally liable.""

'Ban cartoon characters' on unhealthy food,"Cartoon or fictional characters, like Tony the Tiger and the Milky Bar Kid, should no longer be used to promote unhealthy food, a group of MPs says. The proposed ban would also mean that film or TV characters like superheroes could no longer appear on such foods. But characters like the Jolly Green Giant could still promote healthy food,the health select committee says.,external Other recommendations include a ban on junk food adverts before the 9pm TV watershed. The MPs' report comes afterfigures showed that one in 25 children aged 10 or 11 in England were now classed as ""severely obese"". The committee also calls for: supermarkets to be forced to remove sweets, chocolate and other unhealthy snacks from the ends of aisles and checkout areas junk food price promotions, like multi-buys, should be restricted local authorities should have the power to limit the number of fast food outlets opening in their areas government to ban sponsorship of sports clubs, venues, youth leagues and tournaments by brands associated with unhealthy products social media firms like Facebook should reduce children's exposure to junk food advertising Dr Sarah Wollaston, Conservative MP and chairwoman of the committee, said: ""Children are becoming obese at an earlier age and staying obese for longer. ""The consequences for these children are appalling and this can no longer be ignored."" The government has already introduceda sugar tax on fizzy drinks,but the MPs called on it to go further with ""fiscal measures"". That includes extending the sugar tax to milk-based drinks such as milkshakes. Dr Max Davie, officer for health promotion for the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: ""The committee is right, the key to a reduction of obesity is prevention and we must not hang around, action must be taken now."" But Stephen Woodford, chief executive of the Advertising Association, said the UK had ""among the strictest rules in the world"" on promoting products that are high in fat, sugar and salt to under-16s. ""We remain of the view that measures such as a 9pm watershed would be ineffective in tackling the complex root causes of childhood obesity which are linked to a whole range of factors, including socio-economic background, ethnicity and educational attainment,"" he said. The Department of Health said its plan to tackle childhood obesity was ""the most ambitious in the world"". ""We are in the process of working up an updated plan, and will be in a position to say more shortly."" What does it mean if a child is 'severely obese'? Will the sugar tax work?

Grenfell dad blames firefighters,"This video can not be played 'My Isaac would be here today' - Grenfell father A five-year-old boy ""would likely be alive"" had firefighters not told his family to stay put, the boy's father has told the Grenfell Tower inquiry. Paulos Tekle said he had to ""live with the guilt"", after the fire brigade repeatedly told his family to stay in their 13th floor flat. Mr Tekle said he was told to stay put more than an hour after the fire began. After eventually leaving the flat, his son, Isaac Paulos, died after reportedly getting lost in the smoke. Speaking on the sixth day of the Grenfell commemoration hearings, Mr Tekle told the inquiry: ""Our friends and neighbours were calling me and telling me to get out, the fire is spreading too fast up the building,"" he said. Mr Tekle called his friends to warn them of the fire, and they all lived. But he was told to stay in his flat after speaking to the fire brigade over the phone on two separate occasions. Who were the victims? What can we expect from the inquiry? Listen: Grenfell Tower inquiry podcast - Commemoration: Day 6 At 02:00, firefighters reached his family's flat, but Mr Tekle said they were told again to stay where they were. It wasn't until 45 minutes later they were told to leave. ""I listened to the authority and that makes me angry,"" Mr Tekle said. ""Why we were kept inside for so long? I want answers. I want to know why I was physically stopped from leaving the flat at 2am. ""If I had not listened to the fire brigade my son would have likely be alive today."" In July,BBC Newsnight reportedthat the ""stay put"" advice lasted almost two hours after the fire was reported. The advice is based on the assumption that fire can be contained, and won't spread to other flats, which are protected by their walls and doors. Sakineh Afrasiabi and her younger sister Fatima Afrasiabi had managed to reach the higher floors of the tower, thinking they would be rescued In another tribute, the eldest daughter of Sakineh Afrasiabi, who died with her sister Fatemeh Afrasiabi, said she had lost her ""only friend and protector"". In a statement read by the family's solicitor, Shiva Aghlani said: ""Losing a mother who was your only shield from the world is something else."" The inquiry heard that, on the night of the fire, despite living on the 18th floor, Ms Afrasiabi and her sister reached the 23rd floor, where ""she believed that help was coming from above to rescue her"". Ms Aghlani said ""a tooth and a piece of her jaw bone"" was all she buried of her mother. ""I wish I could have been there that night,"" she said. ""I would have saved you and your sister, I would have helped you down the stairs."" Berkti Haftom, 29, with her son Biruk, 12, who both died in the fire The family of Berkti Haftom, 29, and her 12-year-old son Biruk also gave a series of emotional tributes. A statement read by her sisters revealed Ms Haftom was 10 weeks pregnant at the time of her death. Her only surviving son Nahom Tesfay, 18, said he now felt ""alone"". Nahom grew up in Eritrea, where he was raised by his grandmother, but would speak regularly to his mother in the UK and was due to join her in London. ""I was looking forward to living with my mum and my little brother but the fire changed everything,"" he said. Day 1: Tribute to baby as Grenfell inquiry opens Day 2: Families walk out as Grenfell video shown Day 3: Victim's son 'prays for death' to join father in heaven Day 4: Grenfell niece tribute distress for aunt Day 5: 'We will never play again' The girlfriend of Mohammad Alhajali, 23, told the inquiry how she received a message from him just before the fire took hold, saying: ""Hey, are you sleeping? I'm home now."" Mr Alhajali - a Syrian refugee - had fled his home country and had been in London for three years. His girlfriend Amal said the couple had hoped to marry. ""He liked his life here. He enjoyed it, but Syria was his home. He missed it so much,"" she said in a video tribute. ""He was a huge part of my life. He taught me to love myself. Right now when I think about my future, I don't really see anything."" Mohammad Alhajali came to London as a refugee having fled his home country of Syria Former flatmate and friend Mahmoud Al-Karad, said Mr Alhajali had spoken to him during the fire on 14 June. ""He was in there with a mother and her child. I told him to get out, that he should leave. ""His reply shows the kind of man that he was. He said: 'How can I leave? How can I leave the child?'"" This video can not be played Mariem Elgwahry 'did not reveal danger in final phone call' Ahmed Elgwahry described a final phone call with sister Mariem, 27, and mother Eslah, 64, who were both trapped on the building's highest floor. He said he stood helpless outside the tower and only disconnected the call an hour after they had fallen silent. ""On my final call with Mariem - despite her suffering, despite her gradual deterioration, despite her gradual loss of consciousness - she persisted in letting me know that she was still there,"" he said. ""She started fading away from me rather rapidly... she started to mumble, started banging the floor, and then finally no longer responsive."" He said he then heard his mother's final words: ""I can't breathe, I can't breathe."" Hamid Kani will be remembered for his smile, Masoud Shahabeddin said Hamid Kani, 61, ""will not be remembered for the way he died - but for the way he lived,"" his cousin Masoud Shahabeddin said. The two came to London in the 1970s from Iran. ""He fell in love with London and its people,"" Mr Shahabeddin said. Mr Kani worked as an actor and later a chef and spent 22 ""happy years"" living in Grenfell Tower. Mr Shahabeddin said his friend would be remembered for his sense of humour, warmth, his love of family and his compassion for others. Gloria Trevisan was a ""beautiful girl"", whose kindness and big heart ""didn't go unnoticed for anyone"" The mother of Italian architect Gloria Trevisan, who died alongside her fiance Marco Gottardi, urged families and survivors to use their anger as ""the catalyst for finding the truth, because that is what everybody really wants"". Speaking through an interpreter, Emmanuella Trevisan said she asked her daughter to come home to Italy for an anniversary on the same day as the fire, but Gloria decided to travel later. She said she hoped those ""who took the decision to put that cladding on that tower"" will ""feel it in their conscience, the pain and the grief caused to all of us"". This video can not be played Abu Baker Ibrahim was applauded at the inquiry, as were other victims' relatives A man who lost his mother, brother and sister in the fire, gave an emotional tribute to his family. Fathia Ahmed, 71, was found on the 23rd floor with her children Abufars Ibrahim, 39, and Isra Ibrahim, 33. Abu Baker Ibrahim said he missed ""everything"" about his mother. The family came to England from Sudan, after his father was killed in the 1980s. ""We enjoyed our time in England... My mother worked hard in a foreign land to keep us together... (she) was given flat 206 in Grenfell Tower in 2007."" Describing his grief, he said: ""You can sit and pretend that it's OK, but the minute you close that door and you're by yourself, it's horrible. ""I miss them. It's like having a clear vision and now it's just pure darkness."" Hassan Awadh Hassan paid tribute to his wife Rania Ibrahim and their two daughters Hassan Awadh Hassan paid a tearful tribute to his wife Rania Ibrahim and daughters Fethia, four, and Hania, three. Supported by his family and friends, Mr Hassan - who was in Egypt when the fire happened - wore a t-shirt printed with a picture of his wife and daughters and the words ""I love you"". He said the family had moved into the tower in 2015. However, even before they started living there, he said his wife expressed concerns about fire safety. Mr Hassan said: ""When I spoke to my friend I asked him my wife's question: 'If there is a fire, what do we have to do?' and he tells me 'Hassan, don't worry, this building is safe - if the flat next to you is on fire then nothing happens to your flat'."" Rania Ibrahim and her daughters Fethia, four, and Hania, three, died in the fire By Jennifer Scott, BBC News If you think about the first thing you would save in a fire, many of us would reach for the photo albums. The precious memories encapsulated in those pages mean the world to those who took them. But we all hope to never have to make that call. Hassan Adwah Hassan shared those moments today to show the Grenfell Inquiry what he had lost - his wife, Rania Ibrahim, and his two daughters, Fethia and Hania. People watched the emotional slideshow with pictures of his wedding day, the birth of his babies and the celebrations as they grew older. They smiled as the two little girls demanded papa cut the birthday cake, played in the bath or showed off their art from nursery. And they cried as they saw him embracing his girls on holidays, picnicking in the park and spending time with the family and friends they loved, knowing they could never be repeated. They are all scenarios we cherish with our own loved ones, and Hassan's life after Grenfell is one we cannot begin to imagine. This week is half-term and some of the survivors of the tragedy have brought their children with them. After such a moving tribute, they were sure to have been holding their families that little bit closer.

Key Italy talks amid fears of snap poll,"PM-designate Carlo Cottarelli (left) and President Sergio Mattarella talked on Wednesday morning Fresh talks to overcome political turmoil in Italy - the EU's fourth largest economy - are being held. Stock markets have been hit because there is still no government three months after elections. Reports suggest PM-designate Carlo Cottarelli may be stepping back from forming a technocratic government. But there are also reports a snap election might be called, or that two populist parties could try again to form an administration. However, they seem to disagree on whether an election or a new government now is the best option. Italy has been without a government since elections in March because no political group can form a majority. The two big winners in that election - Five Star and The League - attempted to join forces on Sunday but abandoned efforts after President Sergio Matarella vetoed their choice of finance minister. Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio (L) and The League leader Matteo Salvini Mr Mattarella said he could not appoint the Eurosceptic Paolo Savona to the post, citing concern from investors at home and abroad, and tasked Mr Cottarelli with forming a government instead. The rare move by the president to veto the choice of finance minister sparked fury from both populist parties, who say they will reject Mr Cottarelli's nomination in parliament. What is Italy's political crisis all about? Call to impeach Italian president Italy pays higher price in government debt sale After the president blocked Mr Savona's appointment, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio urged parliament to impeach the president. Impeachment of three previous Italian presidents has been attempted but failed. Impeachment is approved by a simple majority of both houses of parliament, but the final decision rests with the constitutional court. Mr Di Maio later called for peaceful protests and urged his supporters to unite and ""make some noise"". The League's chief Matteo Salvini also criticised the president's decision, calling for mass protests and accusing Brussels and Germany of meddling. One is that Five Star and The League try again to present an administration acceptable to the president. A Five Star source told Reuters on Wednesday morning that an attempt was being made to find ""a point of compromise on another name"" for finance minister. This scenario would also see the impeachment threat against the president withdrawn. But fresh elections still seem a possibility, with 29 July being mentioned. The League's Matteo Salvini, in a sign of differences with Five Star, said on Wednesday morning: ""Let's have a vote as soon as possible, but not at the end of July."" The League's Mr Salvini wants fresh elections President Mattarella may choose to skip the appointment of a stop-gap government and call elections. His choice for prime minister, Mr Cottarelli, an ex-IMF economist, appears to have failed to secure support from major political parties and may not even bother to be sworn in. Latest reports in Italian media quote Mr Cottarelli as favouring ""a political government"" and saying he is waiting for ""further developments"". He appears to have suspended his own efforts to form an interim administration and could instead be giving Five Star and The League a second chance, says BBC Rome Correspondent James Reynolds. Current opinion polls suggest that the populist parties are in a strong position should an early vote be called. Italy's relationship with the EU will likely be a central issue in any new election. Other parties also appear keen to see a fresh poll. ""It would be best to go to elections as quickly as possible, as early as July,"" said Andrea Marcucci, who leads the centre-left Democratic Party in the Italian senate. Investors are once again worried about the stability of the eurozone should Eurosceptic parties form the next government. The League argues that fiscal rules used in the eurozone are ""enslaving"" Italians. Five Star has denied it wants Italy out of the euro. Italy populists: What you should know Italy's economy in charts The markets are also worried about government spending rising in a country which already has high debts. As the crisis deepened this week,Italy offered the highest returns in four years for government bonds. The costs of servicing Italy's debt have risen, but the BBC World Service economics correspondent, Andrew Walker, says we are not yet near the levels of financial stress that were evident in the peak of the eurozone financial crisis in 2011-12. Italy was one of the six founding members of what later became the European Union, and a Eurosceptic government would be seen by many as a setback for the bloc.

Kremlin critic Browder arrested in Spain,"Mr Browder has campaigned against corruption in Russia for years Financier Bill Browder, a high-profile critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, has been briefly arrested in Spain on a Russian arrest warrant. After an hour in custody he was released because the warrant was no longer valid, Spanish police said. Mr Browder had earlier tweeted that he had been arrested on a Russian Interpol arrest warrant. Interpol rejected the claim, saying: ""There is not, and never has been, a Red Notice for Mr Bill Browder."" The agency said in a statement: ""Mr Browder is not wanted via Interpol channels."" But there were multiple accounts about how the confusion arose, and why Mr Browder was detained. A police spokesman told AFP: ""An arrest warrant has a date limit and when that expires, it must be deleted from the computer programme and in this case Interpol hadn't deleted it."" The financier taking on Russiaâs oligarchy Russia jails investor Browder in absentia But the US-born financier, who is a British citizen, tweeted that a new notice had been issued. ""Spanish National Police just released me after Interpol General Secretary in Lyon advised them not to honor the new Russian Interpol Red Notice,"" he said. ""This is the sixth time that Russia has abused Interpol in my case."" Interpol had previously refused to enforce a 2013 warrant for the investor,external, deeming it ""predominantly political in nature"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr Browder is widely credited with the creation of the Magnitsky Act - a 2012 range of sanctions from the United States on top Russian officials accused of corruption. The act was named after his former lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who uncovered an alleged tax fraud in Moscow - and died in a Russian prison in 2009. Since then, Mr Browder has campaigned for investigations into the alleged fraud. He was put on trial in absentia in 2013 for tax evasion - inthe same trial where the deceased Magnitsky faced charges, which  was labelled ""absurd"" by observers. Mr Browder was once one of the biggest foreign investors in Russia, controlling Hermitage Capital Management. Russian prosecutors accused him of creating a firm for tax fraud purposes. Mr Browder has always said that the charges against him are politically motivated. British Foreign Minister Boris Johnson said he spoke to Mr Browder and was ""very glad that he has now been released"". ""Moscow should concentrate on bringing those responsible for the murder of #Magnitsky to justice,"" he tweeted. Mr Browder was in Madrid to give evidence to a Spanish prosecutor about money from the Magnitsky case that was moved to Spain. He said the arrest while on such a trip was ironic, but added: ""Now that I'm released my mission carries on.""

Coffee cups ban in government buildings,"From next week, hot drinks will be served in reusable mugs instead of disposable cups The Scottish government is banning single-use coffee cups in its main buildings in a bid to cut plastic pollution. From 4 June, hot drinks will only be served in reusable mugs. It is hoped the move will prevent 450,000 cups from being thrown away every year. Staff were informed of the changes and the alternatives from the beginning of May to give them time to prepare for the change. The ban will apply to all hot drinks purchased in St Andrew's House, Saughton House, Victoria Quay, Atlantic Quay, Marine Lab and Buchanan House restaurants and cafes. Drinks will be served in reusable ceramic mugs for those sitting in and staff are being encouraged to bring their own cups for takeaways. Dame Sue Bruce and Roseanna Cunningham MSP are leading the war against single use plastic Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham said: ""The Scottish government is determined to lead by example when it comes to tackling the scourge of plastic littering our countryside and polluting our seas. ""By removing single use coffee cups from our main buildings, we will prevent 450,000 cups from being thrown away every year. ""That's enough cups to cover the distance between Edinburgh and Dundee. ""We support the EU's vision to reduce single use plastics as far as possible and ensure any single use plastics are easily recyclable by 2030. ""We are currently considering what other single-use items can be reduced and removed from Scottish government buildings later this year. ""Our newly appointed expert panel is considering what further action we can take to fight against our throwaway culture, and this will include looking at disposable cups and plastic straws and considering any potential implications for disabled people."" Kezia Dugdale and straw campaigner Kate Forbes welcomed the straw ban at Holyrood The panel is made up of experts from retail, waste and chemical industries, the public sector and academics. Electoral Commissioner Dame Sue Bruce is chair of the Expert Panel on Environmental Charges and Other Measures.

Complaints about loans see sharp rise,"Concerns have been raised about lenders' treatment of customers with high-cost loans, following a record number of complaints to an ombudsman. The Financial Ombudsman Service said that complaints about borrowing - ranging from store cards to payday loans - had risen by 40% in a year. More than a third of these complaints were upheld by the ombudsman. The report comes a day before the results of a major review of the sector by the Financial Conduct Authority. Essential bill arrears 'more likely among women' Banks 'charging more' for overdrafts than payday lenders Excluding complaints about payment protection insurance, almost one in four complaints to the ombudsman service was about consumer credit. These complaints have increased by 40% in the last financial year to just over 36,300, the service said. The ombudsman upheld 61% of complaints about payday loans, prompting concern that customers were not being treated fairly. Some 58% of cases were also upheld following complaints about high-cost instalment loans - many of which saw existing debts refinanced and then repaid over a longer period of time. Caroline Wayman, chief ombudsman, said: ""People buy a whole range of things on credit - from everyday household appliances to a car - and in many cases it is manageable and affordable. ""For some people, borrowing may be a necessity rather than a choice. There can be a very fine line between getting by and going under. Even people who seem to be on top of their finances can quickly become vulnerable."" Jason Wassell, chief executive of the Consumer Finance Association, which represents short-term lenders including some payday loan companies, said: ""There are a number of reasons why we are seeing such figures reported, including the historic nature of these complaints, strongly held disagreements with the Financial Ombudsman Service on interpretations and the growing involvement of claims management companies looking to generate complaints. ""What we can say, is that most customers borrow without any problem. Changes in recent years mean that people are paying less to borrow, they are less likely to attract additional fees and costs are capped."" The report is the first by the Financial Ombudsman since it announced it had commissioned an independent review following accusations that some consumers' claims were not decided correctly. The claims were made in an investigation byChannel 4's Dispatches,externalinto the service.

What's the crisis all about?,"Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio: A media frenzy over Italy's future Italy is embroiled in a power struggle between Eurosceptic populists - winners of the March election - and pro-EU establishment politicians. It took weeks of negotiations for a populist coalition to take shape, but the president has controversially vetoed it, so Italy is now back to square one. Now the country faces an interim government - not yet in office - before fresh elections. Italy's economy - the eurozone's third-largest - has been anaemic for years. The EU and global markets are watching nervously. The eurozone's 2010-2011 debt crisis was patched up, but not solved. President Sergio Mattarella's rejection of the populists' choice for finance minister - Prof Paolo Savona - exposed tensions over the euro. The 81-year-old economist had advocated a ""Plan B"" for Italy to exit the euro. The anti-establishment populists - the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League - were enraged by President Mattarella's veto. The new prime minister-designate, Carlo Cottarelli, is an International Monetary Fund (IMF) veteran close to Brussels technocrats, solidly pro-euro and pro-austerity. He is known in Italy as ""Mr Spending Review"" and ""Mr Scissors"". Pretty high. But Italy is no stranger to political turmoil. It has had 64 governments since World War Two. M5S leader Luigi Di Maio called for President Mattarella to be impeached. League leader Matteo Salvini suggested that Germany was behind the president's veto; but Italy was not a ""colony"", he said. Frustrated populists: Five Star Movement's Luigi Di Maio (left) and the League's Matteo Salvini This stand-off is new territory for Italy, because populists won an unprecedented popular mandate to govern - the first time they have achieved that since WW2. So the proposed caretaker government will have to tread carefully. Mr Cottarelli says new elections will be held in early 2019, or after August if he fails to survive a confidence vote. The latter appears the most likely. Italian papers predict that Carlo Cottarelli will have a tough time forming a government, and that once in power he will struggle to execute his plans. The leftistManifestonewspaper says: ""It is not easy to find people ready to stay in the government for several months, without trust in parliament, and crucified by the two strongest parties ready to open fire."" The centrist dailyCorriere Della Serasuggests that Mr Cottarelli will be a ""steady hand at the wheel, in market waters that promise to be rough"", but that it will be difficult for him operate because he will be ""a prime minister without trust"". Read press roundup in full by BBC Monitoring.,external Italy president names stop-gap PM Italy populists: What you should know Italian election: Its economy in charts Some Italians already suspect an EU-engineered plot, after what happened in 2011. Back then Italy was getting punished by global markets - it risked default as interest rates on its government bonds soared. Then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was ousted and replaced by former EU commissioner Mario Monti. Not immediately. Mr Di Maio's call for his impeachment is unlikely to get majority support in parliament. The constitution envisages impeachment only for ""high treason"" or for ""acting against the constitution"". President Mattarella has certainly shown that his job is much more than ceremonial. It is up to him to appoint the government. But rejecting the M5S-League team was politically risky. Their anti-establishment appeal to voters may grow even stronger now, as the interim government is accused of doing Brussels's bidding. Italy has a government debt burden of â¬2.3tn (Â£2tn; $2.7tn). That is a colossal 132% of GDP and the second-highest debt level in the EU, after Greece's. The League's Matteo Salvini insists that ""nobody ever thought of exiting the euro - it wasn't in our manifestos, nor in Savona's manifestos"". His M5S partners dislike the euro but no longer plan to hold a referendum on the single currency. However,the euro is very much on the populists' agenda,external, because they promise a renegotiation of key eurozone agreements, such asthe Stability and Growth Pact,externalandthe Fiscal Compact,external. Those pacts commit states to budget discipline and strict targets set by Brussels. They want to shift EU priorities away from free-market liberalism, towards social welfare. They plan to pump billions more euros into social policies in Italy, such as boosting pensions and benefits for the poor. Opinion polls suggest that the League's popularity has risen since the election. So another election within months might give the League - right-wing and anti-immigration - a commanding position. The latest quick fix in Italian politics is unlikely to reassure the rest of the EU.

President names stop-gap PM,"Carlo Cottarelli met President Mattarella on Monday morning Italian President Sergio Mattarella has asked an ex-IMF economist to form a government as the country faces fresh political turmoil. Carlo Cottarelli became known as ""Mr Scissors"" for his cuts to public spending in Italy. His appointment came after efforts by Italy's two populist parties to form a coalition government collapsed. But the move is a temporary measure and the PM-in-waiting says he will hold new elections by early next year. The prospect of elections as early as September hit European financial markets on Monday with analysts suggesting the move might simply delay a future populist government that wants to renegotiate key eurozone debt agreements. Should Europe be scared? What is Italy's political crisis all about? Italy, the EU's fourth-biggest economy, has been without a government since elections in March because no political group can form a majority. Two of the big winners from the vote - Five Star and the League - attempted to join forces but abandoned efforts after the president vetoed their choice of finance minister. Mr Mattarella said he could not appoint the Eurosceptic Paolo Savona to the post, citing concern from investors at home and abroad. The rare move by the president sparked fury from both parties, who say they will reject Mr Cottarelli's nomination in parliament. After the president blocked Mr Savona's appointment, Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio called on parliament to impeach the president. ""Why don't we just say that in this country it's pointless that we vote, as the ratings agencies, financial lobbies decide the governments?"" he asked in a video on Facebook. Mr Di Maio later called for peaceful protests and urged his supporters to unite and ""make some noise"". ""It is important that we do so all together,"" he said. Italy populists: What you should know Italy's economy in charts He said walks and rallies would be organised in Italian cities, including an event in Rome on 2 June - a national holiday celebrating when the country became a republic in 1946. Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio (L) and Lega leader Matteo Salvini Meanwhile the League's chief Matteo Salvini also criticised the president's decision, calling for mass protests and accusing Brussels and Germany of meddling. Although the president's role is largely ceremonial, he enjoys powers such as appointing heads of government and the ability to dissolve parliament that have proven key with Italy seeing frequent political instability and numerous changes of government. After meeting the president, Mr Cottarelli said he would present a programme to parliament, including a budget, to take Italy into new elections ""at the beginning of 2019"". If he was unable to pass a programme, which appears likely at this stage, ""the government would resign immediately... until elections are held after the month of August"", he added. The BBC's James Reynolds in Rome says early elections are exactly what the two populist parties want, giving them a chance to rally support behind their claim that the Italian and the wider European establishments are getting in the way of the will of the people. A source from Five Star told Reuters the party could campaign with the League in a fresh vote. What is Italy's crisis all about?

"Lucas to step down as Green co-leaderThe Brighton Pavilion MP says the party will remain a ""bold alternative"" under a new leadership.3h3 hours agoUK","This video can not be played Four things about Caroline Lucas Caroline Lucas is to step down as the co-leader of the Green Party of England and Wales in September. The party's first and only MP - for Brighton Pavilion - has shared the role with Jonathan Bartley since 2016. In anarticle for the Guardian,external, Ms Lucas said Greens ""must always be an insurgent force for good, consistently asking the big questions that matter"". She said a new leadership team ""will step up to the challenge that our increasingly febrile times present"". Ms Lucas, 57, said she would be ""focusing even more"" on her work in Parliament and in her constituency, rather than standing for re-election. Green Party leaders are elected for two years and a fresh election is due to take place this summer, with nominations opening in June and a result announced in September. Profile: Green Party co-leaders She took Brighton Pavilion from Labour in the 2010 general election. ""I believe that Jonathan and I have shown the power of working together, since we became joint Green Party leaders in September 2016, and it's now time for me to show the power of letting go,"" she wrote. Ms Lucas has shared the leadership role with Jonathan Bartley since September 2016 Ms Lucas said the party's structures had been updated in the last two years, which was one of the co-leaders' priorities in 2016. She added that the Green Party must consistently ask ""the big questions that matter... and give the people of this country the bold alternative that is so desperately needed"". Most politicians only get one shot at leading their party, but Caroline Lucas has managed two stints in charge of the Greens. Although she claims not to rule anything out, this appears to be the end of her time at the top alongside co-leader Jonathan Bartley. The party had its best ever local election results in May, and at the last general election Caroline Lucas increased her majority as an MP. Awareness of plastic pollution is high and affordable housing, long championed by the Greens, is something mainstream parties are at pains to prioritise. But beyond local councils and a lone voice in parliament, the party can struggle to be heard. Caroline Lucas is the Green party's most recognisable figure, its only member of parliament and so the big question now is; who's next? Whoever is elected will need patience, perseverance and persistence to make gains in an electoral system stacked against them. In 2007, the Greens moved away from their longstanding tradition of having two principal speakers in favour of electing a leader every two years. A former MEP, Ms Lucas won leadership elections in 2008 and 2010 but decided against standing in 2012, when she was succeeded by Natalie Bennett who served until 2016. Mr Bartley, elected as a councillor in May, has yet to say whether he will stand again. Paying tribute to Ms Lucas on Twitter, he said he was ""so proud"" of what the duo had achieved over the last two years. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The party's share of the vote dropped by 2% at the 2017 general election, but it won 39 council seats - an increase of eight - inMay's local electionsin England.

"Russian journalist shot dead in KievArkady Babchenko, a critic of the Kremlin, was shot near his home, Ukraine's police say.5h5 hours agoEurope","Arkady Babchenko was a prominent Russian journalist and veteran of the Chechen wars Russian journalist Arkady Babchenko has died after being shot near his home in Kiev,  Ukrainian police say. Mr Babchenko, 41, was found bleeding at the entrance to his block of flats by his wife and died in an ambulance. After writing about a crashed Russian military plane in 2016, Mr Babchenko said he received death threats and left his home country. He first moved to Prague and later to the Ukrainian capital. He was an outspoken critic of the Kremlin. A former war correspondent, he worked in Kiev as a presenter on Ukraine's channel ATR TV. Speaking to the BBC, Ukrainian police spokesman Yaroslav Trakalo confirmed Mr Babchenko's death. The journalist was reportedly shot several times in the back. Kiev police chief Andriy Kryshchenko told local media they suspected Mr Babchenko was killed because of his ""professional activities"". A criminal investigation is now under way. Ukrainian police guard the entrance to Arkady Babchenko's block of flats Ukrainian lawmaker Anton Herashchenko said the journalist went out to buy some bread, and that the killer was waiting for him near his flat. Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman described Mr Babchenko as a ""true friend of Ukraine, who was telling the world about Russian aggression"". ""The killers should be punished,"" Mr Groysman said. Russia's foreign ministry said in a statement: ""We demand that the Ukrainian authorities make every effort to promptly investigate"" the killing. The ministry also offered condolences to Mr Babchenko's family and friends. In his last Facebook post just hours before the attack, Mr Babchenko recalled how lucky he was four years ago - exactly to the day. He wrote that he had planned to fly with Ukrainian soldiers on a helicopter in the war zone in Ukraine's east. He was not allowed on board, because there was not enough space. The helicopter was shot down by pro-Russian rebels, leaving 14 people dead. ""I was lucky. A second birthday, it turns out"", Mr Babchenko wrote. A well-known Kremlin critic, he stood inunofficial elections organised by the oppositionin 2012 and denounced Russia's actions in Syria and eastern Ukraine. In December 2016,Mr Babchenko wrote a Facebook post (in Russian),externalabout a crashed Tu-154 transport plane, which fell into the Black Sea while carrying a Red Army choir to Syria. The plane crashed into the Black Sea on 25 December 2016 'All die' in Russia Black Sea plane crash Pilot error blamed in Russian air crash He claimed this Facebook post, in which he described Russia as an ""aggressor"", led to death threats and abuse from the Russian state, writing ina piece for The Guardian,externalthat this forced him to leave ""a country I no longer feel safe in"". While studying law in Moscow aged 18, Mr Babchenko was conscripted into the Russian army and served during the Chechen wars from 1994-2000. His memoir, One Soldier's War, chronicles his experiences in the conflict, which claimed the lives of tens of thousands on both sides. He then became a journalist, working for a number of different outlets. Mr Babchenko also wrote for the BBC,reporting from the sceneof a Ukrainian army helicopter shot down in the east of the country in 2014. Kiev has in recent years seen a number of deadly attacks on high-profile journalists and politicians. Most of them were vociferous critics of the Kremlin.

'Harder' to appeal wrongful convictions,"Fresh evidence has emerged in the case of Eddie Gilfoyle, who spent 18 years in jail after being convicted of killing his wife People claiming wrongful imprisonment are finding it harder to overturn convictions because the burden of proof is too high, a former appeal court judge says. Former Lord Justice Sir Anthony Hooper said the challenge to establish innocence is tougher than ever before. The claim comes in a BBC Panorama programme which reveals fresh evidence in two notorious cases. The programme looked at the cases of two convicted murderers. Eddie Gilfoyle and Kevin Lane each served nearly 20 years in prison for crimes they insist they did not commit. The cases had previously been turned down by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body which investigates wrongful convictions. Convicted wife killer loses legal action Kevin Lane fails to clear his name Sir Anthony said he believed the CCRC had become more cautious of how cases were being treated by the Court of Appeal - which can overturn decisions made in criminal court - meaning the CCRC was referring fewer cases. He said: ""It's become much more difficult for an appellant to succeedâ¦ and, therefore that will no doubt influence [the CCRC] on what cases they send through."" Lawyers working in criminal appeals also said the CCRC had become timid in the face of criticism from the court over cases it referred, and was failing to properly investigate cases because it had become ""moribund and deskbound"". Kevin Lane spent almost 20 years in prison for the gangland murder of Robert Magill in 1994 Eddie Gilfoyle spent 18 years in jail after being convicted of killing his heavily pregnant wife Paula in 1992, and faking her suicide. Mrs Gilfoyle was eight-and-a-half months pregnant when she was found hanged in the garage of the couple's home in Upton, Wirral. Her husband, now aged 56, always claimed to be innocent but was only released in 2010 on parole. Diaries written by Paula Gilfoyleformed part of Mr Gilfoyle's last submissions to the CCRC, which also considered letters giving an insight into Paula Gilfoyle's state of mind shortly before her death. It still rejected the case. Paula Gilfoyle was aged 32 when she was found hanging in the garage of the couple's home in 1992 Pregnancy mental health expert Dr Trudi Seneviratne, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, was asked by Panorama to examine the diaries and she said they showed ""someone who had an exceptionally difficult time"". ""We also know that she had a history of taking an overdose, when she was a teenagerâ¦ so that's really relevant."" Dr Seneviratne said if Mrs Gilfoyle had been asked routine mental health questions asked of pregnant women today, it could have identified risk factors for depression and suicide. Eddie Gilfoyle's lawyer Matt Foot said Dr Seneviratne's evidence was ""incredibly significant"" and that her assessment of Paula Gilfoyle was""the complete opposite of how she was presented at trial by the prosecution [in 1993]"". The CCRC said Mr Gilfoyle was welcome to submit a new application. Kevin Lane spent almost 20 years in prison for the gangland murder of Robert Magill in 1994 after his palm print was found alongside a single particle of gunshot residue in a pipe inside a car linked to the shooting. But experts Panorama spoke to think the gunshot evidence is now worthless. Angela Shaw, of Forensic Firearms Consultancy, said: ""In today's terms there would be no evidential strength placed on the finding of a single particle. ""I certainly wouldn't have concluded that a gun had been placed within the pipe."" Mr Lane now intends to submit a new application the CCRC. The CCRC has the power to refer cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland back to the Court of Appeal, but can only do so if it believes there is a real possibility the court will quash the conviction. Scotland has a separate commission, with a significantly higher referral rate than in the rest of the UK. There were 12 referrals by the CCRC out of more than 1,563 cases (0.77%) between 2016-17, down from 33 out of 1,797 (1.84%) between 2015-16. Internal board minutes going back three years, passed to Panorama by the Centre for Criminal Appeals - a charity working with alleged miscarriage cases - revealed that: Case review managers struggle to cope with ""large, sometimes unworkable portfolios"", typically managing 24 cases at any one time A senior commissioner doubted whether the work previously required to uncover certain miscarriages of justice was being done today Minutes from 2015 reveal the CCRC was worried about a culture where staff believed finding new evidence, was actually seen as ""troublesome"" because of the work involved Lord Justice Sir Anthony Hooper said it has become ""much more difficult for an appellant [someone appealing to the High Court] to succeed"" The CCRC, a public body with a budget of around Â£5m annually, said: ""The board [minutes] showâ¦ we share our concerns within the organisation and take them seriously. ""Our workload has increased in recent years and budgets have not. ""We've taken all the steps we can to make sure the quality of our investigations andâ¦decision making has not been adversely affected. ""Our relationship with [the Court of Appeal]... is central to our roleâ¦ so we are bound to carefully consider the tone and content of its judgements.""

Who are Italy's populists?,"Populists poised to govern: Five Star Movement's Luigi Di Maio (L) and League's Matteo Salvini Italy's new populist government has been sworn in, ending months of political uncertainty. The anti-establishment Five Star Movement and right-wing League have gone into coalition, preparing to set the eurozone's third biggest economy on a path of tax cuts, a guaranteed basic income for the poor and deportations of 500,000 migrants. They reject years of EU austerity and want to renegotiate Italy's debt. So what will this government, led by law professor Giuseppe Conte, mean for Italy and the rest of Europe? Neither Five Star nor The League are fans of the single currency. League leader Matteo Salvini said not long ago that the euro was ""a mistake"" for Italy's economy, while Five Star had wanted a referendum on Italy's future membership. But they have dropped their initial ambition of exit from the euro and now talk of trying to reform it from within. Not everyone is convinced by their change of heart. France's Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire earned a rebuke from the leader of The League by warning the populist parties to respect Italy's budget commitments. The markets are wary, too. Italy's borrowing costs have touched levels not seen since 2016. Italy was ravaged by the 2008 financial crisis that left the economy some 6% smaller and three million more people in poverty. The answer for The League and Five Star is to move Italians out of poverty. But their policies will cost tens of billions of euros, for a country with the second biggest public debt in the EU after Greece. It stands at 132% of national output. Poor families will get a â¬780 (Â£682; $919) basic monthly income, provided recipients actively seek work, the parties say. It is a popular idea but one that will cost an estimated â¬17bn to implement. Its most expensive policy is the idea of two ""flat tax"" rates set at 15% and 20%. Families would receive a â¬3,000 annual tax deduction based on household income. Sales and excise tax increases next year, worth â¬12.5bn, will be scrapped. The 58-page joint pact, or ""contract"", does not explain how all the extra spending will be financed,external. But economists estimate it could cost some â¬50bn in lost revenue. The minimum monthly pension is to be set at â¬780. The plan abolishes the current pension reform that raises the retirement age in phases. Instead, a new points system would combine people's total years of social security contributions with their age. The total must be at least 100, meaning that someone who has paid into the system for 41 years, for example, could retire at 59. Italy's new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is a political novice The populist parties say they want revisions to the EU's Stability and Growth Pact, which sets a tough budget deficit limit of 3% of GDP. The plan aims to reduce debt through ""the revival of internal demand"", not by continuing austerity. Italy's populists are not just aiming to reset the economy and revisit the EU's rules on debt. The League is strongly anti-immigration and their joint plan reflects that. It demands more EU help for Italy - the main destination for migrants arriving from North Africa - and it insists that the estimated 500,000 undocumented migrants in Italy must be deported ""as a priority"". Italian election: Its economy in charts What exactly is populism? That would require the creation of ""temporary stay facilities"" throughout Italy for migrants earmarked for expulsion, the parties say. Italy's capacity to house migrants has been stretched to the limits The plan calls for effective relocation of asylum-seekers EU-wide - a scheme already rejected by some EU states. And it demands stronger co-operation to fight people-smuggling gangs. The populist leaders disagree with the EU sanctions on Russia and want them lifted. They do not see Russia as a military threat, but as ""a potential partner for the EU and Nato"". They want to work with Russia against the smuggling of migrants across the Mediterranean and the continuing influence of violent Islamists. They also see Russia as a key player in ending the wars in the Middle East. The EU and US accuse Russia of hostile anti-Western activities and relations became icy after Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014.

What is Italy's political crisis all about?,"Five Star leader Luigi Di Maio: A media frenzy over Italy's future Italy is embroiled in a power struggle between Eurosceptic populists - winners of the March election - and pro-EU establishment politicians. It took weeks of negotiations for a populist coalition to take shape, but the president has controversially vetoed it, so Italy is now back to square one. Now the country faces an interim government - not yet in office - before fresh elections. Italy's economy - the eurozone's third-largest - has been anaemic for years. The EU and global markets are watching nervously. The eurozone's 2010-2011 debt crisis was patched up, but not solved. President Sergio Mattarella's rejection of the populists' choice for finance minister - Prof Paolo Savona - exposed tensions over the euro. The 81-year-old economist had advocated a ""Plan B"" for Italy to exit the euro. The anti-establishment populists - the Five Star Movement (M5S) and the League - were enraged by President Mattarella's veto. The new prime minister-designate, Carlo Cottarelli, is an International Monetary Fund (IMF) veteran close to Brussels technocrats, solidly pro-euro and pro-austerity. He is known in Italy as ""Mr Spending Review"" and ""Mr Scissors"". Pretty high. But Italy is no stranger to political turmoil. It has had 64 governments since World War Two. M5S leader Luigi Di Maio called for President Mattarella to be impeached. League leader Matteo Salvini suggested that Germany was behind the president's veto; but Italy was not a ""colony"", he said. Frustrated populists: Five Star Movement's Luigi Di Maio (left) and the League's Matteo Salvini This stand-off is new territory for Italy, because populists won an unprecedented popular mandate to govern - the first time they have achieved that since WW2. So the proposed caretaker government will have to tread carefully. Mr Cottarelli says new elections will be held in early 2019, or after August if he fails to survive a confidence vote. The latter appears the most likely. Italian papers predict that Carlo Cottarelli will have a tough time forming a government, and that once in power he will struggle to execute his plans. The leftistManifestonewspaper says: ""It is not easy to find people ready to stay in the government for several months, without trust in parliament, and crucified by the two strongest parties ready to open fire."" The centrist dailyCorriere Della Serasuggests that Mr Cottarelli will be a ""steady hand at the wheel, in market waters that promise to be rough"", but that it will be difficult for him operate because he will be ""a prime minister without trust"". Read press roundup in full by BBC Monitoring.,external Italy president names stop-gap PM Italy populists: What you should know Italian election: Its economy in charts Some Italians already suspect an EU-engineered plot, after what happened in 2011. Back then Italy was getting punished by global markets - it risked default as interest rates on its government bonds soared. Then-Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was ousted and replaced by former EU commissioner Mario Monti. Not immediately. Mr Di Maio's call for his impeachment is unlikely to get majority support in parliament. The constitution envisages impeachment only for ""high treason"" or for ""acting against the constitution"". President Mattarella has certainly shown that his job is much more than ceremonial. It is up to him to appoint the government. But rejecting the M5S-League team was politically risky. Their anti-establishment appeal to voters may grow even stronger now, as the interim government is accused of doing Brussels's bidding. Italy has a government debt burden of â¬2.3tn (Â£2tn; $2.7tn). That is a colossal 132% of GDP and the second-highest debt level in the EU, after Greece's. The League's Matteo Salvini insists that ""nobody ever thought of exiting the euro - it wasn't in our manifestos, nor in Savona's manifestos"". His M5S partners dislike the euro but no longer plan to hold a referendum on the single currency. However,the euro is very much on the populists' agenda,external, because they promise a renegotiation of key eurozone agreements, such asthe Stability and Growth Pact,externalandthe Fiscal Compact,external. Those pacts commit states to budget discipline and strict targets set by Brussels. They want to shift EU priorities away from free-market liberalism, towards social welfare. They plan to pump billions more euros into social policies in Italy, such as boosting pensions and benefits for the poor. Opinion polls suggest that the League's popularity has risen since the election. So another election within months might give the League - right-wing and anti-immigration - a commanding position. The latest quick fix in Italian politics is unlikely to reassure the rest of the EU.

Italy crisis hits financial marketsFears over political unrest in Italy spread to Wall Street after Europe's main markets close lower.3h3 hours agoBusiness,"Former IMF official Carlo Cottarelli was named prime minister-designate Fears over Italy's political upheaval spread to Wall Street after Europe's financial markets closed lower. The prospect of fresh electionsand the possibility of eurosceptic parties strengthening their position has raised concern about the eurozone's stability. The Dow Jones index shed 1.6% and the S&P 500 lost 1.2%, coming after Italy's FTSE MIB closed down 2.7% and Europe's other main markets shed well over 1%. A sell-off in Italian bonds saw the yield on two-year debt breach 2%. It meant that short-term Italian bonds suffered their biggest one-day jump in 26 years. Movements in bond prices are important as they affect the cost of borrowing for the government. Italy's debt currently stands at 130% of its economic output. The bond sell-off hit the share prices of European banks exposed to government debt, especially those in Italy. Banco BPM, Banco Generali, Unicredit  and BPER Banca closed down between 5% and 6.7%. On Wall Street, JP Morgan was down 3.7%, and Bank of America and Citigroup were just more than 3% lower. Morgan Stanley fell 5.3%. Falling bank shares dragged down Europe's main share markets. At the close the UK's FTSE 100 fell almost 1.3%, while Germany's Dax was down 1.5% and France's Cac 1.3% lower. ""It's a market that is totally in panic"", said Giuseppe Sersale, a fund manager at Anthilia Capital Partners, who noted ""a total lack of confidence in the outlook for Italian public finances"". Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz in the US, said:  ""If the political situation in Italy worsens, the longer-term spillovers would be felt in the US via a stronger dollar and lower European growth."" What is Italy's political crisis all about? Call to impeach Italian president Italy's economy in charts The turmoil was precipitated after the anti-establishment Five Star and League political parties abandoned their attempts to form a ruling coalition after a standoff with President Sergio Mattarella. He had vetoed their choice of a eurosceptic economy minister, and appointed former International Monetary Fund official Carlo Cottarelli as interim prime minister with the task of trying to form a government. But his term is likely to be cut short, as he will almost certainly lose a parliamentary vote of confidence. If he does, then new elections would soon follow. How bad is the financial situation in Italy? There is no question that the political crisis has led financial market investors to judge that the risks have increased markedly. The rise in Italian government bond yields has been very sharp and tells us that there is increased nervousness about the outlook. But we are not - not yet at least - anywhere near the levels of financial stress that were evident in the peak of the eurozone financial crisis in 2011-12. At the time there was an informal rule of thumb sometimes used, that countries were likely to need a bailout if the yield on their ten year bonds - essentially the annual cost of borrowing money for ten years - was sustained at more than 7%. Italy did hit that level briefly in that earlier episode.  But it's currently around 3%. Higher than it was - but not yet flashing red. Five Star and the League won 33% and 17% of votes respectively in March's election, and could increase their combined majority in a new national poll. ""We've seen a steep sell-off in risk assets as the Italian political troubles deepen, with investors seemingly dumping their exposure to Italy,"" said Neil Wilson, chief analyst for Markets.com ""The moves this morning warrant attention as we are seeing some incredible price action in Italian bonds with the market moving at speeds not seen since the worst of the eurozone debt crisis. ""The big question is whether this is just an Italian problem or one that risks significant spill-over into the rest of Europe."" Italian papers predict that Carlo Cottarelli will have a tough time forming a government, and that once in power he will struggle to execute his plans. The leftistManifestonewspaper says: ""It is not easy to find people ready to stay in the government for several months, without trust in parliament, and crucified by the two strongest parties ready to open fire.""
