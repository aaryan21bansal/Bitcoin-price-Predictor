WWE referee Charles Robinson said Patterson was ""a hero to many"". ""One of the greatest minds in the business and just an all around great guy. I will miss him and his karaoke! RIP my friend,"" he tweeted. Patterson began his career in Canada in 1958. In his 2016 autobiography Accepted, Patterson wrote about how he was thrown out of his house in Montreal at the age of 17 after telling his parents he was in love with another man. He moved to the San Francisco Bay area, where he worked for nearly two decades. He then joined the WWE, and was said by the company to have made an ""immediate impact"", becoming the first Intercontinental Champion in September 1979. His most memorable rivalry - and a highlight of his wrestling career - was his ongoing battle with Sgt Slaughter, the WWE said. Around the time he hung up his boots in 1984, he began commentating for the industry and in 1988 he created the Royal Rumble Match, described by the WWE as ""one of the ring's most ground-breaking ideas"". He was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 1996.

"Daughter and mum, 95, share first hug since March","Christine Colburn said embracing her mother, Audrey Cornell, was ""just like the old days"" A daughter has hugged her elderly mother at a care home for the first time in nine months. Christine Colburn had a rapid lateral flow Covid test, which produces results in 30 minutes, at the home in Bampton, Devon, so she could embrace her 95-year-old mother, Audrey Cornell. The home is one of several across the South West taking part in a pilot scheme for rapid testing. Ms Colburn said it felt ""amazing"" to hug her mother again. ""It's really exciting,"" she said. ""Just like the old days, just brilliant. ""It'll be even nicer when we can touch skin [without PPE] but this is pretty good."" Ms Cornell said it was ""grand"" to be able to hug her daughter again Since the pandemic started, Ms Colburn has only be able to call her mother on Skype or talk to her through a screen - travelling the one hour and 45 minute journey from her home in Dorchester. Ms Cornell said it was ""grand"" to be able to hug her daughter again. The manager of Castle Grove care home, Lucy Bull, said the pilot scheme has gone well but they ""do worry about getting enough tests and the added costs, especially for smaller homes"". ""I think it will be expensive because we'll have to up-skill our staff,"" she said. ""It's also quite hard to recruit care staff at the moment."" The lateral flow testing that Ms Colburn had involves a swab of the nose and throat to collect a sample, which is then inserted into a tube of liquid for a short time. Drops of liquid are added to the test strip and after about half an hour a result will be shown. Mass testing with lateral flow testsbegan in Liverpool on 6 November.

Ex-French President ValÃ©ry Giscard D'Estaing dies,"ValÃ©ry Giscard d'Estaing, France's president from 1974 to 1981, has died at the age of 94. He died of complications from coronavirus, surrounded by his family at his estate in central France. A centre-right, pro-Europe politician, Giscard d'Estaing also liberalised laws on divorce, abortion and contraception during his seven years in power. President Emmanuel Macron said his presidency had transformed France and his direction still guided its way. ""A servant of the state, a politician of progress and freedom, his death has plunged the French nation into mourning,"" he said in a statement. The late president's family said his funeral would take place amid ""strict intimacy"". In later life, Giscard d'Estaing liked to portray himself as the grand old man of French politics. As one of France's youngest presidents - he was 48 when he came to power, he had a longer career in politics after he left high office than he had enjoyed on his way to the ÃlysÃ©e Palace. He was seen by many as arrogant and aloof; his presidential popularity was short-lived and he was eventually squeezed out of office by a strengthening of opposition from both the left and the right. He was also caught up in a scandal surrounding his support for a corrupt African dictator. ValÃ©ry Marie RenÃ© Georges Giscard d'Estaing was born on 2 February 1926 in Koblenz, in what was then French-occupied Germany. His father was a civil servant who worked for the French occupying forces, while his mother was descended from King Louis XV of France via one of his mistresses. Giscard d'Estaing's education was disrupted by World War Two. He was just a teenager when he joined a French resistance group in occupied Paris before enlisting in a tank battalion in 1944, earning the Croix de Guerre in the last months of the war. He worked for a while as a teacher in Montreal before graduating from the Ecole Nationale d'Administration and joining the tax and revenue service. In 1955 he spent some time on the staff of prime minister Edgar Faure before winning the seat of Puy-de Dome in the National Assembly, the area from which his mother's family came. Political allies in 1969, Giscard d'Estaing (l) and Jacques Chirac would later become rivals for the presidency He became secretary of state for finances in 1959, a post he held for almost four years until his party broke with the ruling Gaullists with whom they were in a coalition. However, Giscard d'Estaing refused to leave the government and founded the Independent Republicans, which allied itself to the majority Gaullists. He was sacked from the cabinet in 1966 but, as chairman of the National Assembly committee that scrutinised the country's finances, he remained a powerful voice, latterly increasingly critical of the De Gaulle government. Thrown out of his chairmanship by the Gaullists in 1968, he gained his revenge by supporting Georges Pompidou in the 1969 presidential elections, whereupon he was reappointed to the finance ministry. When Pompidou died suddenly in 1974, Giscard d'Estaing announced he would run for the  ÃlysÃ©e Palace, presenting himself as a modern and moderate alternative to the austere conservatism of Gaullism. He successfully gained the support of the centre while, at the same time, taking advantage of divisions among the Gaullists, some of whom - notably Jacques Chirac - announced their support for Giscard d'Estaing as the only hope of defeating the left. Giscard d'Estaing narrowly defeated the socialist FranÃ§ois Mitterrand in the second round of voting with just 50.7% of the poll, becoming the third youngest president in French history. After years of Gaullist stagnation, he made his intentions plain: ""You want a deep political, a deep economic and a deep social change. You will not be disappointed,"" he said. At home, he made several reforms early on in his term in office. The voting age was lowered from 21 to 18, while divorce and abortion laws were relaxed, in spite of fierce opposition from the Catholic Church. The newly elected French president was committed to European unity He also saw through laws on equal pay and opportunities for women, reduced the retirement age to 60 and allowed Paris to elect its own mayor. Although he voiced his opposition to the death penalty, he refused to commute three of the death sentences passed during his term, and the last use of the guillotine in France took place in 1977. A fan of technology, Giscard d'Estaing was a strong advocate of the French high-speed train network, the TGV, construction of which began in earnest in 1976. He was also an enthusiastic supporter of the drive to increase France's dependence on nuclear power, following the oil crisis of 1973. Giscard d'Estaing was committed to the European ideal and developed a close relationship with Germany's Chancellor Helmut Schmidt. Together they turned their dream of a more integrated Europe into reality. His main contribution was the formation of the European Council in 1974 - bringing together the heads of states of all member countries - which, in 1979, pushed forward a European monetary system. However, his domestic reforms worried his more conservative political allies, with Jacques Chirac resigning as prime minister in 1976. His successor, Raymond Barre, introduced a programme of austerity and unemployment began to rise. The right won a majority in the 1978 coalition elections and Giscard d'Estaing responded by founding the Union for French Democracy (UDF). Giscard d'Estaing was heavily criticised for his support of Jean-Bedel Bokassa. Giscard d'Estaing's popularity began to wane. His standing was not enhanced after he was accused of accepting a gift of diamonds from the self-styled Emperor of the Central African Republic, Jean-Bedel Bokassa. Bokassa's brutal dictatorial regime had received a great deal of support from the French government, with Giscard D'Estaing declaring in 1975 that he was a ""friend and family member"" of Bokassa. France played a major part in Bokassa's lavish coronation ceremony in 1977, which cost more than the annual gross domestic product of the impoverished country. In 1979, the French satirical magazine, Le Canard enchaÃ®nÃ©, alleged that Giscard d'Estaing had received the diamonds in 1973, when he was finance minister. His initial explanation that he had sold them and given the proceeds to a number of charities was undermined when one of the alleged recipients, the Red Cross, denied having received any funds. Giscard d'Estaing lost the 1981 presidential election to Francois Mitterrand. He defeated Jacques Chirac in the first round of voting, but Chirac's failure to call on his supporters to support Giscard d'Estaing in the second round widened the gulf between the former allies. Subsequently, he based himself in his political heartland - the Auvergne region of central France - delivering regular pronouncements to newspapers and on television about the state of the nation. His national standing sank so low that he became known as Monsieur Ex in Parisian political circles. He lost the 1981 presidential election to his socialist rival Francois Mitterrand His hopes of becoming prime minister under Mitterrand in 1986 were dashed and he refused to support either right-wing candidate in the 1988 presidential elections. Between 1989 and 1993, he served as a member of the European Parliament and seemed destined to end his days in political obscurity. But, in 2002, he returned to the  limelight when he was chosen to head up the convention tasked with drawing up a constitution for the European Union His selection for the job was the result of intensive lobbying by French President Jacques Chirac, who is said to have insisted on it at the EU's summit in the Belgian town of Laeken in December 2001. Many criticised the choice of a man in his late 70s for a job designed to bring the EU closer to the people, and especially the young. There was also criticism over Giscard d'Estaing's reported demands for a salary in excess of â¬20,000 per month, plus expenses. He is said to have asked for a luxury suite of rooms in a Brussels hotel for a year and for a handpicked private staff. However, he denied that he was being greedy. ""It is simply that things should be comfortable,"" he told Le Monde newspaper. In 2004, European heads of state signed a European Constitution that was based primarily on the work carried out by Giscard d'Estaing's convention. His somewhat aloof nature did not endear him to ordinary people A year later, and to Giscard d'Estaing's profound embarrassment, the constitution was roundly rejected by the French people. He later complained that ""the rejection of the Constitutional treaty by voters in France was a mistake that should be corrected"". In 2005, he and his brother purchased the castle of Estaing in the French district of Aveyron, which had previously been owned by Admiral d'Estaing. Giscard d'Estaing's family had no direct connection with the deceased naval officer and there was much criticism that he was attempting to buy his way into the nobility. In 2009, he published a novel about a relationship between a fictional French president and the fictional Princess of Cardiff. It led to speculation that it was based on a relationship between Giscard d'Estaing and Diana, Princess of Wales, although he eventually poured cold water on those suggestions. Earlier this year,he was accused of groping a German reporterduring a 2018 interview - charges he denied. Valery Giscard d'Estaing was something of an enigma. Intellectually gifted, he lacked the common touch and never became popular with the French people. His single-minded approach to greater European integration was not to everyone's taste and his aloof nature meant he often fell out with his allies. Bitterly disappointed that Britain decided to leave the European Union in 2016, he described it as a ""backward step"". But the enthusiastic architect of European unity was, by now, in his nineties. He felt, he said, inclined to take the long view. ""We functioned without Britain during the first years of the European Union,"" he said, with a Gallic shrug. ""So we will rediscover a situation that we have already known."" At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Probe as lottery comes up 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10","South Africans have been questioning the result of the draw (file picture) An unusual sequence of numbers drawn in South Africa's national lottery has sparked accusations of fraud after 20 people won a share of the jackpot. Tuesday's PowerBall lottery saw the numbers five, six, seven, eight and nine drawn, while the PowerBall itself was, you have guessed it, 10. The organisers say the sequence is often picked. But some have alleged a scam and an investigation is under way. It is extremely rare for multiple winners to share the jackpot. The organisers said 20 people purchased a winning ticket and won 5.7m rand ($370,000; Â£278,000) each. Another 79 ticketholders won 6,283 rand each for guessing the sequence from five up to nine but missing the PowerBall. What do lottery winners spend their money on? The chances of winning South Africa's PowerBall lottery are one in 42,375,200 - the number ofdifferent combinations when selecting five balls from a set of 50, plus an additional bonus ball from a pool of 20,external. The odds of the draw resulting in the numbers seen in Tuesday's televised live event are the same as any other combination. Competitions resulting in multiple winners are rare, but this may have something to do with this particular sequence.

Shoppers out in force under new England tier rules,"This video can not be played Shoppers queue as stores reopen in Birmingham Shoppers have returned to the High Street in England, after non-essential retailers opened their doors at the end of a four-week national lockdown. Athree-tiered system of Covid-19 rules has now come into forcein the nation, with gyms and businesses such as hairdressers also able to open. More than 55 million people are in the strictest two tiers and cannot mix indoors with those in other households. The government said it would ""safeguard the gains made during the past month"". At a Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he accepted that the tiered system was ""tough"", but insisted that regional restrictions and mass testing were the way to ""keep the virus under control"". He said he hoped that places would be able ""to come down the tiers"" before Easter, while stressing that the tier restrictions would continue to be a ""very important"" part of battling coronavirus. Government publishes data behind stricter tiers Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? Keeping pools closed 'a catastrophe for health' 'We've lost a day of trade' over lockdown end date There were queues outside stores across England early on Wednesday as shoppers returned to High Street giants such as Primark. And people arrived promptly to take advantage ofa stock clearance sale at Debenhams department storefrom 07:00 GMT. Some retailers are extending their trading hours to try to recoup the loss in sales over the lockdown. It comes after a period which has seenthe collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia group,women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ©and the failure ofDebenhams to secure a buyer- putting a total of more than 25,000 jobs at risk. Footfall at UK shops was up by 64.5% compared to last week, butdown by 24.1%on the same day last year, according to analyst Springboard. Queues were seen outside Primark in Birmingham early on Wednesday Shoppers also headed to London's Oxford Street A swimmer takes to the water at London's Serpentine Swimming Club as outdoor swimming pools are also allowed to reopen Jordan Roberts, 19, was among a dozen people queuing outside Selfridges in London's Oxford Street before the department store opened its doors - and shoppers were welcomed by store workers dressed as elves on roller skates. She said she was there to do her Christmas shopping, adding: ""It feels more enjoyable being in a store and things run out of stock online."" Another London shopper, Tamara Rass, 44, said she hit the stores early as she expected they would be busy. ""For me, it's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and getting back to normality,"" she said. ""There are things in store that I can't get online and I like to treat my daughter once a month."" Elsewhere, there were also reports of ""steady"" footfall in England's town centres.

Transport for London said 760,000 journeys were made on the London Underground network on Wednesday from the start of service until 10:00 GMT - up 14% on last week, but only 31% of normal demand. There were 970,000 bus journeys made. This was up 8% on last week and 57% of pre-pandemic levels. British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said businesses were looking forward to welcoming back customers,with billions lost in sales during the lockdown, adding ""every purchase we make is a retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported"". The government has also announced that people living in care homes in England willbe able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas, if the visitors test negative for coronavirus. And later on Wednesdayabout 10,000 fans will be allowed into six games in the English Football Leaguefor the first time, other than a few pilot games, since March. England's new tiered system wasbacked by MPs in a Commons votejust hours before it came into effect, despite 55 Tories voting against PM Boris Johnson's plan. The latest restrictions are tougher than the previous tier system that was in place before the lockdown was introduced on 5 November. Under the system every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers. In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors. And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues.

PM aims for world-leading UK emissions cuts,"The UK prime minister is set to declare one of the most ambitious targets in the world for tackling climate change. BBC News understands Boris Johnson's goal will be to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 68% or 69% by the end of the decade, based on 1990 levels. This will mean an even faster pace of decarbonisation for industries, transport and homes. It might, for instance, mean a faster switch away from gas boilers for home heating. Or it could, under another scenario, lead to the phase-out of gas-guzzling SUVs. The targets are known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). They're at the heart of the Paris Agreement, the international pact signed in 2016 that's intended to cut emissions with the aim of keeping global temperature rise well under 2C. Humans waging 'suicidal war' on nature - UN chief The year 2020 set to be in top three warmest A really simple guide to climate change NDCs represent the commitments by each country - under the Paris pact - to reduce their own national emissions and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Mr Johnson hopes that the UKâs new targets will set an example to other nations, which will join a virtual climate pledges summit on 12 December. This virtual event will occur in place of annual UN climate talks, which were set to have taken place in Glasgow this year, but were postponed because of Covid-19. The UK has assumed the presidency at the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP) meeting - in partnership with Italy. The full meeting will take place at the end of next year. The 68% cut was deemed by the EU to be Britainâs fair share towards combating climate change. By adding another percentage point, the PM would attract favourable headlines from some environmentalists â although others think the number should be higher still, given the apparent impact of climate change on the world already. Green groups have called for a 75% cut, and research by consultancy Cambridge Econometrics, commissioned by the Prince of Wales corporate leaders group, said a target of a 70% by 2030 was necessary. Tim Crosland, from the pressure group Extinction Rebellion, said 100% emissions cuts in the UK should be made by 2025 if the world was to avoid over-shooting the 1.5C temperature threshold agreed by the UN. The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said it wouldnât comment until it had seen the official figures. The true value of the PMâs target wonât be clear until details about background assumptions are revealed officially in coming days. One question is whether the UK could use international credits for achieving its target - in effect paying other nations to cut emissions on its behalf. The government's advisory Climate Change Committee has told the PM that credits would only be allowable if the target is more ambitious than 68%. It says in a letter: ""This trajectory for UK emissions is eminently achievable, provided effective policies are introduced across the economy without delay. These would bring significant benefits for the UK's economic recovery. ""The NDC is more than just a number. It should be accompanied by wider climate commitments, including the development of a policy package and Net Zero Strategy to deliver against the UK goal, clear commitments to reduce international aviation and shipping emissions, and greater support for climate finance, particularly for developing countries. ""It is also imperative that the NDC is accompanied by strengthened climate change adaptation plans."" The 2030 date is important because CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere are cumulative. That means that if the UK doesnât radically reduce emissions by that date, it wonât be able to achieve its long-term aim of net zero emissions by mid-century. Net zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and balancing any further releases by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. Only a handful of countries have submitted revised NDCs so far.

EasyJet to charge for overhead luggage lockers,"EasyJet customers who want to use overhead luggage lockers will have to buy more expensive tickets. In a move which provoked criticism on social media, EasyJet said the changes to its luggage policy will start on 10 February. Customers who don't buy the more expensive tickets will be restricted to putting a small carry-on bag under their seat. EasyJet said the changes would improve punctuality. But some customers reacted with dismay on Twitter, with one calling it an ""absolutely terrible move"". ""Like Ryanair, [they are] monetising every opportunity in a race to the bottom,""they said,external. Another accused,externalthe airline of changing the conditions of their ticket after they had bought it. ""I imagine there is some small letter in the terms to allow you to do it, but it is not right is it?"" But some customers welcomed the move, saying it would free up storage space. Currently, all customers are allowed to fly with a cabin bag measuring up to 56 x 45 x 25cm, enabling them to put small wheelie suitcases into overhead lockers. But under the new rules, passengers who want to travel with an additional bag of this size as hand luggage must buy a more expensive ticket such as an Up Front or Extra Legroom seat. Prices range from Â£7.99 more expensive than a standard fare, up to Â£29.99 on longer flights. EasyJet slumps to first annual loss amid pandemic People who also buy a more expensive Flexi fare or are members of the carrier's frequent flyer scheme will also continue to be allowed to take one small and one large item of hand luggage with them, subject to space on board. EasyJet customers with an existing booking for travel from February 10 who do not want to pay more will be able to check in a larger cabin bag in the aircraft hold free of charge. Easyjet previously used its luggage allowance to differentiate it from competitors Robert Carey, chief commercial and customer officer for EasyJet said: ""Punctuality is important to our customers and we know that if they have their bags placed into the hold at the gate due to the limited space onboard this can cause flight delays, and it can be frustrating for them too. ""Our new policy will improve boarding and punctuality for everyone, as well as give our customers certainty of what they will have with them onboard."" EasyJet previously used its luggage allowance to differentiate it from competitors. Ryanair limits passengers to one small item of hand luggage without an extra fee, while British Airways' cheapest fares include one large and one small item of hand luggage. Airlines have been hit hard by coronavirus crisis travel restrictions, and have been looking for ways to cut costs. In November, EasyJetreported its first annual loss in the airline's 25-year history. The airline made a loss of Â£1.27bn for the year to 30 September as revenues more than halved. EasyJet expects to fly at just 20% of normal capacity into next year. A spokesperson said the change in baggage allowance had been under consideration since before the pandemic.

Baby born from record-setting 27-year-old embryo,"Not yet two months old, Molly Gibson has already set a record When Molly Gibson was born in October of this year, it was 27 years in the making. Her embryo was frozen in October 1992, and stayed that way until February 2020, when Tina and Ben Gibson of Tennessee adopted it. Molly is believed to have set a new record for the longest-frozen embryo to have resulted in a birth, breaking a record set by her older sister, Emma. ""We're over the moon,"" Ms Gibson said. ""I still get choked up."" ""If you would have asked me five years ago if I would have not just one girl, but two, I would have said you were crazy,"" she said. The family struggled with infertility for nearly five years before Ms Gibson's parents saw a story about embryo adoption on a local news station. ""That's the only reason that we share our story. If my parents hadn't seen this on the news then we wouldn't be here,"" Ms Gibson, 29, said. ""I feel like it should come full-circle."" Ms Gibson, an elementary school teacher and her husband, a 36-year-old cyber security analyst, connected with the National Embryo Donation Center (NEDC), a Christian non-profit in Knoxville that stores frozen embryos that in vitro fertilisation patients decided not to use and chose to donate instead. Families like the Gibsons can then adopt one of the unused embryos and give birth to a child that is not genetically related to them. There are an estimated one million frozen human embryos stored in the US right now, according to the NEDC. Q&A: Surrogate babies Why I chose to go it alone with IVF 'One boy stood out to me - he's now my son' Mark Mellinger, the NEDC's marketing and development director, said that experience with infertility is common among families who seek embryo donations. ""I'd say probably 95% have encountered some sort of infertility"", he said. ""We feel honoured and privileged to do this work"", and help these couples grow their families. After their first embryo adoption, Ms Gibson gave birth to Emma in 2017, swapping sleepless nights praying for children with the sleepless nights of motherhood. ""It's the best kind of tired and it's the best kind of exhausted,"" she said. Founded 17 years ago, the NEDC has facilitated more than 1,000 embryo adoptions and births, and now conducts around 200 transfers each year.  Similar to a traditional adoption process, couples can decide if they would like a ""closed"" embryo adoption or an ""open"" one - allowing for some form of contact with the donor family. This contact ranges between a couple of emails each year to a cousin-like relationship, Mr Mellinger said. Couples are presented with 200-300 donor profiles, complete with the donor family's demographic history. The Gibsons had wanted a child for so long, the options were overwhelming. ""We did not care what this baby looked like, where it came from,"" Ms Gibson said. She sought advice from the NEDC where an employee told her to pick something ""silly"" and go from there. ""My husband and I are smaller people, and so we went through and narrowed it down by height and weight and looked for something similar to ours. That narrowed it down at ton,"" she said. This video can not be played After years searching, I found my sister next door The Gibson's children, Molly and Emma, are genetic siblings. Both embryos were donated and frozen together in 1992, when Tina Gibson was around a year old. According to the NEDC, Emma's 24-year-old embryo was the oldest in history to have been born, until Molly came along this year. Emma loves her new little sister, Ms Gibson said. ""She introduces her to anyone that sees her as 'my little sister Molly.'"" And Ms Gibson has loved seeing the similarities between her girls, including a tiny wrinkle between their eyebrows when they're mad or upset. According to the NEDC, the shelf-life for frozen embryos is infinite. The time-frame is limited, however, by the age of the technology - the first baby born from an embryo frozen after IVF was born in Australia in 1984. ""It's entirely possible that there will someday be a 30-year-old embryo that comes to birth,"" Mr Mellinger said.

Amazon's AI box lets firms check if staff use masks,"The system can be used to check if workers are wearing masks and are staying far enough away from each other Amazon plans to sell companies a way to detect when staff are not wearing face masks or socially distancing. Beyond the pandemic, the system could also be used to track compliance of other workplace rules or to monitor the public - for example, to check the number of customers queuing in a store. It involves retrofitting a box to existing security cameras that can then draw on off-the-shelf AI apps. But privacy campaigners have raised concerns. Remote working has already led to an increase in the use of software that checks up on employees, but Amazon's new solution is focused on tracking people and products in factories, shops and other traditional workplaces. 'I monitor my staff with software that takes screenshots' Is my boss allowed to spy on me? Amazon refutes the characterisation of its new product as a surveillance tool. A spokeswoman told the BBC it was designed to improve industrial operations and workplace safety, and that how it is used is up to customers. ""For example, AWS Panorama does not include any pre-packaged facial recognition capabilities,"" she said. All its machine learning functions can happen on the device ""and [relevant data] never has to leave the customer's facility"", she added. The AWS Panorama appliance plugs into internet protocol (IP) cameras - a standard type of digital video camera used by a huge range of companies on their sites. The technology can be added on to existing CCTV hardware It can automate inspection tasks, such as detecting manufacturing defects or tracking the movement of barcodes and labels. But the tool can also be applied to people. For example, in a retail shop, it could count the number of customers, track their movements and check the length of queues, Amazon has suggested. 'Hundreds injured at Amazon UK warehouses' Amazon spends $500m on bonuses for Christmas staff In a factory or other workplace, the same tech can be used to monitor employees ""and get notified immediately about any potential issues or unsafe situations so you can take pre-emptive action"", the company said. In the promotional material for the product, Fender guitars says it uses the product to ""track how long it takes for an associate to complete each task in the assembly of a guitar"". The Financial Times reports,externalthat AWS Panorama can detect vehicles bring driven in places they are not supposed to be. Some major companies are already trialling the system, including Siemens and Deloitte, the FT added. The AWS Panorama Appliance boxes need to be installed on the same network as the cameras they are linked to It is still, however, in preview, and not yet widely available. The Trades Union Congress (TUC), the umbrella group for UK unions, this week published its report intothe use of AI-powered tools used by employers,external. ""The announcement of this new monitoring tool is another example of how this revolution at work is picking up pace,"" said policy officer Mary Towers. But she warned that it must not gloss over workers' needs. This video can not be played Is your boss spying on you as you work from home? ""In our report, we warn about the potentially negative effects that intrusive technology of this type can have on workers' well-being, right to privacy, data protection rights and the right not be discriminated against."" Polling suggested that workers were already concerned about CCTV cameras being used to monitor performance when they were supposed to have been installed for security, she said. Silkie Carlo, director of privacy group Big Brother Watch, said automated monitoring of workplaces ""rarely results in benefits for employees"". ""It's a great shame that social distancing has been leapt on by Amazon as yet another excuse for data collection and surveillance,"" she said. Amazon has already faced scrutiny over how its warehouse employees are monitored. In September,a report from a US research group said Amazon used extensive worker surveillance,externalto limit union organising activity. And the company has clashed with some of itsemployees who have accused it treating them ""like robots"". This week, Microsoft apologised for allowing individuals' activity to be monitored by their employers through a ""productivity score"" designed to give high-level oversights.

Piers Corbyn guilty of lockdown rules breach,"Corbyn addressed supporters outside the court after the judgement was handed down Piers Corbyn has been found guilty of breaching coronavirus restrictions at an anti-lockdown gathering. The 73-year-old brother of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was arrested when he refused to leave the event in Hyde Park, London, on 16 May. He was given an absolute discharge after Westminster Magistrates' Court heard he had spent 12 hours in police custody after his arrest. Addressing supporters outside, Corbyn said it had been ""a tremendous result"". District Judge Sam Goozee dismissed a second count of the same charge - linked to a protest on 30 May - after hearing police had issued a fixed penalty notice earlier that day. Prosecutor David Povall had described Corbyn as a ""poster boy for disparate groups"" attending both events near Speakers Corner. Piers Corbyn 'disregarded police protest advice' He told the court there was no reasonable excuse for ""breaching clear and emphatic regulations that were in force at the time"". Corbyn's defence had argued his arrest on 16 May was a ""disproportionate and unnecessary"" contravention of his right to peaceful protest. Returning his decision, judge Mr Goozee said Corbyn's actions would have been lawful if lockdown regulations had not been in force at the time. But their enforcement had been necessary for public health, he said, concluding that police ""took a measured response"". ""You, however, didn't engage with police - police action in arresting you was necessary and proportionate,"" he said.

High Street attacker guilty of one-punch killing,"Daryl Bunn's family and fiancÃ©e have been left devastated by his death, police said A man who launched an unprovoked attack on a husband-to-be has been convicted of his manslaughter. Daryl Bunn, 27, was attacked in Maldon, Essex, after a meeting to discuss best man speeches at another friend's wedding. Chelmsford Crown Court heard Sonny Hazell, 25, knocked him to the ground with a single punch, inflicting a traumatic brain injury. Hazell was found guilty of the 29 June 2019 killing after a trial. Mr Bunn had met his friend and fellow best man earlier that afternoon before meeting up with another group at two pubs. As the men made their way home they ""became involved in an altercation"" outside a branch of Iceland, the force said. Mr Bunn hit his head on the ground, causing a traumatic brain injury. He was airlifted to hospital in Cambridge where he died eight days later. Det Ch Insp Lee Morton said: ""The case shows that any act of violence can lead to someone being seriously injured and even killed. ""Daryl Bunn's death was needless and completely avoidable, and his family and fiancÃ©e have been left devastated. ""They have been in court throughout the trial and heard how Daryl did nothing to instigate or provoke the incident that led to him losing his life."" Mr Bunn's family previously said they had been left ""totally heartbroken"". ""Everyone who knew him would say what a lovely, beautiful soul he had inside and out, with a heart of gold, and he will be truly missed,"" they said in a statement. Hazell and Jordan Hooper, 24, of Princes Avenue, Southminster were cleared of a grievous bodily harm charge in relation to Mr Bunn's friend, who suffered a broken jaw. Hazell, of Waterside Road, Southminster, near Maldon, is due to be sentenced on 8 January. Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

Supermarkets repay rates relief after backlash,"Tesco and Morrisons will together hand back more than Â£850m worth of business rates relief they received as support during the coronavirus crisis. Tesco said it would repay Â£585m after it was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders. Morrisons subsequently announced it had ""brought forward"" a decision on rates relief and would pay back Â£274m. Tesco said the help to retailers had been a ""game-changer"" and hugely important at the time. But it added that its business had proven ""resilient"" and it had now decided to return the money in full. ""We will work with the UK government and devolved administrations on the best means of doing that,"" it said. In October, Tesco defended paying a Â£315m dividend to shareholders after reporting a 29% increase in profits for the first half of the year. Finance chief Alan Stewart told reporters it was the right policy. Meanwhile, Morrisons said it would announce its dividend when it knows how much it has made this year. Commenting on the decision to pay back the rates relief, Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said the supermarket chain had ""done its best work"" to meet the ""enormous challenges"" the pandemic had brought. ""We are grateful for the government's swift action at the start of the pandemic which enabled the whole sector to face squarely into the challenges and disruption caused by Covid-19,"" he said. Business rates relief was extended to all retailers as part of a package of measures announced in March. Tesco profits surge as online orders double In March, Tesco was accused of ""whipping up a huge lobbying operation"" against a decision not to give its biggest stores in Wales financial help. The Welsh government changed its mind and decided to grant business rate relief to all retail, hospitality and leisure firms. Tesco is understood to have asked the Welsh government for an explanation of its thinking rather than a change in policy. ""The decision to repay business rates relief is one for individual companies to consider for themselves,"" said Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium. ""Many have used this money to cover increased costs as a result of Covid - hiring extra staff and making significant investment in the safety and protection of their premises. As such, there are many firms who simply cannot afford to repay this government relief."" While most of the public focus has - for obvious reasons - been on the furlough scheme, the business rates holiday for retailers and hospitality companies has been one of the main ways the government has tried to keep alive the companies most affected by pandemic closures. Like all coronavirus schemes, however, the rates relief was a blunt instrument - it went also to retailers who have stayed open throughout. When those retailers decided to pay dividends to shareholders, there was an understandable outcry. Tesco was the object of most opprobrium; it said it would pay Â£315m to investors after reporting that pandemic trading had been buoyant. Directors at the supermarket chain have obviously read the headlines. The company said it would repay the Â£585m it has had so far this year in business rates relief, while pointing out in passing that it estimated the pandemic had brought it Â£725m in additional costs. The question now is whether other essential retailers - especially the big grocery chains such as Sainsbury's and Asda - will follow Tesco's lead. It would be surprising if they did not. And while the repayments might appear like a public-spirited move, bear in mind the board may have had other motivations: in particular, a desire not to have the public support they have received hanging over them and preventing them from exercising their normal commercial judgement in paying dividends, approving bonuses and making deals. Tesco said the money meant that it had had the immediate confidence, in the face of significant uncertainty, to invest in colleagues and support its customers and suppliers. ""Every penny of the rates relief we have received has been spent on our response to the pandemic. Our latest estimate at our interim results in October was that Covid would cost Tesco [about] Â£725m this year - well in excess of the Â£585m rates relief received. ""Ten months into the pandemic, our business has proven resilient in the most challenging of circumstances. While all businesses have been impacted - many severely so - we have been able to continue trading throughout, serving many millions of customers every day and although uncertainties still exist, some of the potential risks faced earlier in the year are now behind us."" Chief executive Ken Murphy said: ""Giving this money back to the public is absolutely the right thing to do by our customers, colleagues and all of our stakeholders.""

"It's nearly now or never for UK-EU trade dealAs pizza-fuelled talks continue into the night, there appears to be stuff worth chewing over.UK Politics","Talks appeared to be going late into the evening as the pizzas arrived in Westminster Whether they were double pepperonis, Hawaiians, or even just basic cheese and tomato, there was a tell-tale suggestion tonight that the Brexit negotiating teams were hard at it. They don't work late into the night if there is nothing to talk about, and if there is no pressure. So a delivery of boxes and boxes of pizza arriving at the venue where the talks are taking place in central London suggest, at least, they believe there is stuff that's worth chewing over (sorry) and that needs to be concluded urgently. And while I have every sympathy if you read this and just feel you have seen it all before, there is more than just the takeaway that tells us it's nearly now or never. Are both sides running out of road for a Brexit deal? What happens next with Brexit? After months and months, and yes, months of talks, several sources have told me on Wednesday that the process is likely to be concluded in the next few days. One ambassador told me there was a hope the agreement could be finalised on Friday, with another diplomatic source confirming a deal at the end of this week is a possibility - suggesting the agreement is basically done, even though ""it could all still fall apart"". As my colleague, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler, wrote earlier, the EU chief negotiator updated the bloc's members in a video call today, and it's certainly the case there are nerves on that side about how much he might give away. It's certainly not the case though the negotiators have managed to find ingenious solutions to every single issue raised in these vast talks that will placate both sides 100%. But there are two very good reasons - aside from whispers from those involved - that a conclusion is now very near. There is a real fear that the deal, if it's done, can't be turned into law in time unless that process starts by the middle of next week. The deal will have to go through Parliament here, and in the EU, before the transition period ends in a few weeks' time. There's always been a mythical threat around this - and be wary of a politician claiming a deadline - but simply, given the number of days that Parliament is due to sit between now and the end of the year, it becomes pretty much impossible unless it gets going next week. It is also the case that if there isn't a deal, which still could come to pass, then ministers are worried about scrambling to get businesses prepared to cope with what might happen. They are concerned about that frankly in any case, because even with an agreement, a big change is on the way. But one cabinet minister confident that a deal will be done by early next week, told me Boris Johnson had become increasingly worried about reaping the political consequences of failing to reach a deal - he doesn't want queues of lorries in Kent to be blamed on him. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. There is another technical reason for speed now, as alongside that, the government plans to bring in a new Taxation Bill and continue its fight over the UK Internal Market Bill soon too. The first might make an appearance in the middle of next week, and happilythe BBC's economics editor, Faisal Islam, has written about it here. And the UKIM -that caused such a stink over ministers' admissions that it could lead them to breach international law - is likely to be back in the Commons the week after next. Those draft laws could provoke such a storm in the EU - essentially undermining the deal the UK did with Brussels last year - that they could torpedo the talks at the last moment. Two well-placed EU sources were clear in conversation today that if the government pressed ahead with the controversial clauses in those bits of legislation before a deal had been done, it would kill the chances stone dead. But, despite nudges and winks around the place that the process is nearly there, despite the solid reasons that point to a finale in the next few days, there is still a question about whether the two sides have ever come to understand each other. One minister involved in one of the tricky aspects of the talks is absolutely adamant the EU was still being downright unreasonable. One member state source told me that it feels like ""doing a pre-nup agreement"", adding: ""We want a long and stable marriage, but Boris Johnson is trying to get enough freedom to cheat."" It seems like the two sides are just about ready to commit. But the mantra we have learned in this last four years is as instructive as it was at the start - ""nothing is agreed until everything is agreed"" - and more pizza nights might still be required. P.S. If a deal is done, then as I mentioned, it will have to then pass through Parliament, which will throw up its own intrigue. There is likely, of course, to be some belly aching among the true believers in the Brexit camp. There have been fears about Boris Johnson conceding too much, so don't expect there to be no pushback. But given this time last year Tory MPs were elected on their promise to ""Get Brexit Done"", it seems unlikely - unless the deal is a true shocker from their point of view - that the prime minister will have significant trouble from his own side. What will also be interesting to watch, however, is how Labour responds. Most of the party's MPs thought the idea of leaving the EU was crackers, and their leader, Sir Keir Starmer, was one of the strongest voices pushing for another referendum. But, given the choice in Parliament before them will hypothetically be between a deal or not having an agreement at all, it seems most likely they will choose to back an agreement and move on. However, there is likely to be tension over the decision, with some senior voices perhaps pushing to abstain. P.P.S. It's worth saying that theoretically there might not have to be a vote on the treaty. But the government has already made it clear that there will be legislation that will need at least one vote, and in fact likely a whole series of votes. It is not clear exactly what kind of votes there will be, and as it's Parliament and Brexit, there's probably likely to be a row about exactly how it unfolds. But from a political point of view, both Labour and the Tories are already discussing whether to back 'the deal', even though the process once it hits the Commons may be more complex than that.

Flaw allowed iPhone hack remotely through wi-fiThe vulnerability has been fixed in an update since May this year.Technology,"Ian Beer demonstrated the hack in a YouTube video Researchers have revealed a flaw that allowed Apple iPhones to be hacked from afar without the owner doing anything. Usually, smartphone hacks rely on user error - by clicking on a suspicious link, opening a message or downloading a malicious app - to gain control. But Google Project Zero researcher Ian Beer has revealed how attackers could steal emails, photos, messages - and even access the camera and microphone. Apple fixed the issue in May. And all up-to-date devices are secure. The hack was possible because Apple's devices use a technology called Apple Wireless Direct Link. This uses wi-fi to allow users to send files and photos over Apple's AirDrop technology and easily share screens with other iOS devices. Mr Beer exploited this network to show how hackers could gain access to a device from a distance. In a blog post,external, he explained how he was able to complete the hack, which he spent six months investigating. He found no evidence the vulnerability had been ""exploited in the wild"", although said some people tweeted when the bug was fixed in May.

It's nearly now or never for UK-EU trade deal,"Talks appeared to be going late into the evening as the pizzas arrived in Westminster Whether they were double pepperonis, Hawaiians, or even just basic cheese and tomato, there was a tell-tale suggestion tonight that the Brexit negotiating teams were hard at it. They don't work late into the night if there is nothing to talk about, and if there is no pressure. So a delivery of boxes and boxes of pizza arriving at the venue where the talks are taking place in central London suggest, at least, they believe there is stuff that's worth chewing over (sorry) and that needs to be concluded urgently. And while I have every sympathy if you read this and just feel you have seen it all before, there is more than just the takeaway that tells us it's nearly now or never. Are both sides running out of road for a Brexit deal? What happens next with Brexit? After months and months, and yes, months of talks, several sources have told me on Wednesday that the process is likely to be concluded in the next few days. One ambassador told me there was a hope the agreement could be finalised on Friday, with another diplomatic source confirming a deal at the end of this week is a possibility - suggesting the agreement is basically done, even though ""it could all still fall apart"". As my colleague, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler, wrote earlier, the EU chief negotiator updated the bloc's members in a video call today, and it's certainly the case there are nerves on that side about how much he might give away.

Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK next week,"The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination. Britain's medicines regulator, the MHRA, says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe to be rolled out. The first doses are already on their way to the UK, with 800,000 due in the coming days, Pfizer said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS will contact people about jabs. Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff. But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine is wasted. A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the public not to get ""carried away with over optimism or falling into the naive belief that our struggle is over"". He tolda Downing Street news conference that, while the ""searchlights of science"" had created a working vaccine, significant logistical challenges remained. What are the safety checks for vaccines How will I get a vaccine? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years. The UK has already ordered 40 million doses of the jab - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. The doses will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Mr Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland will be immunised on Tuesday. Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the rollout of the Pfizer jab to care homes would be particularly difficult because of how it needs to be stored. Mr Gething said that it was not possible to transport the Pfizer vaccine to more than 1,000 care homes across Wales. The bulk of the rollout across the UK will be next year, Mr Hancock said, adding: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better."" There is a clear priority list for who gets the vaccine first - and care home residents and staff are top of it. But operational complexities mean the reality will be somewhat different. When the vaccines arrives, it will be sent straight to major hospitals who have the ultra-cold facilities to store it. From there it can be moved just once - and when it is, it must be kept in batches of 1,000. That means sending it out to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents in some places, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted. Because of that, the NHS, which is in charge of distributing the vaccine, will run clinics from hospitals at first. This will allow NHS and care home staff to get immunised first as well as, perhaps, some of the older age groups who come into hospital. It looks like it will not be until much more of the Pfizer vaccine is available or the Oxford University one, which is easier to distribute, is approved that care home residents will be able to get it. While Mr Hancock said that the government does not yet know how many people need to be vaccinated before restrictions can start being lifted, he added: ""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy."" Mr Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again."" Downing Street press secretary Allegra Stratton said Mr Johnson would not rule out receiving the vaccine jab live on television, though she said he would not want to take a jab meant for someone more vulnerable. The free vaccine will not be compulsory and there will be three ways of vaccinating people across the UK: Hospitals Vaccination centres ""a bit like the Nightingales project and including some of the Nightingales"", said Mr Hancock In the community, with GPs and pharmacists Around 50 hospitals are on stand-by and vaccination centres - in venues such as conference centres or sports stadiums - are being set up now. It is thought the vaccination network could start delivering more than one million doses a week once enough doses are available. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""This is a day to remember and, frankly, a year to forget"" NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the health service was preparing for ""the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country's history"". But experts said people still need to remain vigilant and follow rules to stop the virus spreading - including with social distancing, face masks and self-isolation. ""We can't lower our guard yet,"" said the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty. The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations and decided by the government. Mass immunisation of everyone over 50, as well as younger people with pre-existing health conditions, can happen as more stocks become available in 2021. Pfizer confirmed that the first stocks of the vaccine will be for the NHS, which will give them out for free based on clinical need. People in the UK will not be able to bypass this and buy the vaccine privately to jump the queue. The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. Most of the side effects are very mild, similar to the side effects after any other vaccine and usually last for a day or so, said Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chairman of the Commission on Human Medicine expert working group. The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people, he said. The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said that - despite the speed of approval - no corners have been cut. Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said. This video can not be played Dr June Raine from the MHRA: ""The safety of the public will always come first"" Giving the analogy of climbing a mountain, she said: ""If you're climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became available on 10 November we were at base camp. ""And then when we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us to today."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters The Pfizer/BioNTech was the first vaccine to publish positive early results from final stages of testing. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials. Covid vaccine: How will we keep it cold enough? Because the vaccine must be stored at around -70C, it will be transported in special boxes of up to 5,000 doses, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. And once out of the fridge it needs to be used within six hours. Other coronavirus vaccines are also being developed: One from Moderna uses the same mRNA approach as the Pfizer vaccine and offers similar protection - the UK has pre-ordered seven million doses that could be ready by the spring The UK has ordered 100 million doses of a different type of Covid vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca Russia has been using another vaccine, called Sputnik, and the Chinese military has approved another one made by CanSino Biologics. The World Health Organization's Dr David Nabarro said the Pfizer vaccine would not replace the other measures ""for a number of months, even a year, so we'll have to keep doing physical distancing, mask wearing, hygiene and isolating ourselves when we're sick"". He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme ""the vaccine will only start to dent the size of the pandemic somewhat later in the year"". The pace has been breathtaking. From an unknown virus at the start of the year to a vaccine approved by the regulator and ready to use in early December is an unprecedented timescale. At the Downing Street briefing, the MHRA's chief executive said it was like climbing Everest, with preparations starting in June and a team working ""night and day"" assessing early data and reaching ""base camp"" by early November when Pfizer/BioNtech published the trial results. At the same time, the MHRA was adamant that the process had been robust with safety considerations paramount. A rapid emergency approval process was used by the UK regulator. The European Medicines Agency is taking longer to reach a view and there has been some sniping from European politicians arguing their processes are more reliable and authoritative. But the MHRA is an internationally respected independent watchdog and for now those about to receive the first jabs will rely on its ruling.

The government's plan will mean students taking hands-on courses such as medicine or performing arts returning from 4 to 18 January. Other subjects would be taught online at the start of term, with students back between 25 January and 7 February. Students are being promised Covid tests when they return next term. It means some students heading home in the next few days will not be in university again for nine weeks. The National Union of Students said students would still have to pay rent on ""properties they are being told not to live in"". The plan, to avoid a surge of students and the risk of spreading coronavirus, will see a staggered return for students over five weeks in the new year - with most courses starting online before a return to in-person teaching. Mass testing for students gets underway in universities Two Covid tests for students and then leave in 24 hours Testing for Christmas holidays to start from 30 November The first students returning will be for practical courses which are difficult to teach solely online - which will include medicine, nursing and dentistry; sciences which need to use laboratories; or music, dance and drama. Courses are going to be online at the start of next term for many students Those starting later will include subjects such as English literature, history and maths. Students will be offered two lateral-flow Covid tests when they arrive back - similar to the process for their departure. ""This planâ¯willâ¯enable a safer returnâ¯forâ¯all students,"" Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said, who also announced a Â£20m student hardship fund. The UCU lecturers' union, which has called for teaching to be online to avoid the spread of infection, said the plan for a delayed start to in-person teaching was a ""step forward"". Vanessa Wilson, leader of the University Alliance group, welcomed the ""clarity"" about next term - and also the recognition that campus facilities would have to be kept open for students not going home at Christmas. Emma Hardy, Labour's shadow universities minister, said ""the delay in providing this guidance has caused huge, unnecessary stress for students and universities"". The arrangements have been announced on the eve of students being able to return home for Christmas - with the ""travel window"" for students opening on Thursday. Louis will be part of the logistical challenge to get students home this week Louis Chambers, a first year studying geology at the University of Hull, will be among the students heading home this week. HIs parents are coming to take him back to Norfolk - and the university is running a system of one-hour slots for students to be collected, which he says will mean ""not so many leaving at once"". ""It will be a relief to get back home,"" he says, as he has been able to see his family only once this term, because of Covid restrictions. But he thinks the Covid testing and ""travel window"" have been uncomplicated so far - and he has enjoyed his first term. And many students will already have left. Out of the six in Louis's flat, he says, three have already gone home. The ""window"" for students to travel home begins on Thursday University of Hull student services director Anji Gardiner has been organising the staggered departures through the Christmas ""travel window"". As well as slots for those being collected by car - which run from 07:00 to 20:00 - there are coaches being laid on and a booking system for the limited capacity on trains, with the numbers travelling spread out across the week. ""We want to keep it safe - we didn't want a logjam of people trying to get home,"" Dr Gardiner says. The mass Covid testing of students began in universities on Monday - with temporary testing centres set up in sports halls and in rooms on campus. Before leaving for Christmas, students have been encouraged to have two tests three days apart - and to travel within 24 hours of receiving a second negative test result. The ""travel window"", in which students are expected to move out of university, will run from 3 to 9 December. In England, about 1.2 million students will be travelling from a university to a home address in another part of the country, including: 235,000 leaving the South East 217,000 leaving London 126,000 leaving the East Midlands 122,000 leaving the West Midlands 119,000 leaving the North West 110,000 leaving the South West 88,000 leaving the East 64,000 leaving the North East Universities UK welcomed the plans for more testing for students when they returned after Christmas. ""The high demand for tests from students shows they understand the important role testing can play in keeping themselves and their communities safe,"" said a spokesman.

How will we keep it cold enough?,"The government has begun distributing the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. However, it needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C. Most other vaccines do not need this, so how will this be made to work? In the short-term, Pfizer has a plan. The vaccine will be distributed from its own centres in the US, Germany and Belgium. It will need to travel both on land and by air and possibly be stored in distribution centres, before being delivered to anywhere the vaccine will be given. Pfizer hasdeveloped a special transport box,externalthe size of a suitcase, packed with dry ice and installed with GPS trackers. Each reusable box can keep up to 5,000 doses of the vaccine at the right temperature for 10 days, if it remains unopened. Wiltshire-based firm Polar Thermals makes similar boxes for other vaccines and counts Pfizer among its clients, but not yet for this particular purpose. Polar Thermal's ""thermal shipper"" can be reused thousands of times The box is not likely to be cheap. Head of sales Paul Harrison says a standard chilled transport box, which will retain a temperature of up to -8C for five days and is big enough to hold 1,200 vaccines, costs about Â£5,000 per unit - although they can be reused thousands of times. His firm uses aerogel as insulation, rather than dry ice - which could be handy if a global carbon dioxide shortage from earlier this year continues to affect the availability of related products, such as dry ice. The US Compressed Gas Association, however, has saidit is committed to meeting demand.,external The vaccine can survive for a further five days once thawed, Pfizer has said, but this does not buy a great deal of extra time. In the longer-term, Public Health England says that in the UK ""national preparations"" are under way regarding both central storage and distribution of the vaccine across the country, but has not given details. As it stands, extreme cold storage is certainly not commonplace, and your local GP is unlikely to have it. Some institutions, such as universities and research labs, do have the right storage capacity. In the UK, universities shared resources at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, including PPE-making equipment and ventilators. How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine?

Students told to take two tests,"Students in England will be urged to take two Covid tests three days apart, to cut the risk of spreading infection when they travel home for Christmas. These are lateral flow tests with rapid results - with those testing negative expected to leave university within the following 24 hours, according to the latest guidelines seen by the BBC. The pre-Christmas testing will start in many universities early next week. But testing will remain voluntary - and not all universities will offer tests. The National Union of Students said there should be capacity for all students who wanted a test to get one before Christmas. More than a million students in England will leave their university addresses to spend the Christmas holidays in another part of the country - and plans for testing are intended to stop this migration from spreading coronavirus. Testing for Christmas holidays to start from 30 November Universities to oversee exodus of students at end of term Rapid mass testing plan to get students home at Christmas It is understood that most universities, but not all, are taking part in the government's plans for the mass testing of students using lateral flow tests, starting on 30 November. Students will be encouraged to take two tests Durham University, which has piloted testing, says about 2,000 students have already booked tests ahead of the Christmas departures. The government guidelines recommend a double test to increase accuracy, three days apart, in the form of swab tests administered by the students themselves, at centres being set up by universities. The results will be sent by text or email - with students who are not infected expected to leave their term-time accommodation ""immediately"", which is defined as within 24 hours of the second negative test. Getting students to leave soon after they get results is intended to cut the risk of infections post-testing. ""The closer to your travel time the better,"" says Professor Jacqui Ramagge, who is leading on testing for Durham University. And at her university, the two tests will be seven days apart rather than three. Ministers are urging students to take Covid tests before travelling, as a way of protecting their families, but it is not compulsory and not all universities will offer the testing. Those who do not take tests, or only have one test, will still be able to leave at the same time - with an encouragement to ""travel home as safely as possible"" during the ""travel window"" of 3 to 9 December, which the government has identified as when it expects most students to leave university for Christmas. This will be after the current lockdown ends on 2 December, and ahead of universities switching to online teaching for the end of term. Students who test positive will be directed towards taking another type of test - a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test to confirm whether they are infected - and will have to stay and self-isolate while waiting for the result. But those who test positive from this PCR test will be required to stay in their term-time accommodation for 10 days of self-isolation - which should still leave enough time to get back before Christmas. The ""window"" for students to travel home begins from 3 December Teesside University is among those opening testing centres from 30 November - and is encouraging students to book for two lateral flow tests at its Middlesbrough campus. Pro Vice-Chancellor Professor Mark Simpson said it would provide a ""quick and easy testing option to our students and enable them to make an informed decision about returning home for the upcoming Christmas break"". He said it would help to address the ""considerable anxiety and a need for reassurance"" about the safety of travel ahead of the end of term. Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said: ""Testing will offer further assurances that students can keep their families safe this winter, and I urge all students who can to take the tests on offer."" â¨ Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Flaw allowed iPhone hack remotely through wi-fi,"Ian Beer demonstrated the hack in a YouTube video Researchers have revealed a flaw that allowed Apple iPhones to be hacked from afar without the owner doing anything. Usually, smartphone hacks rely on user error - by clicking on a suspicious link, opening a message or downloading a malicious app - to gain control. But Google Project Zero researcher Ian Beer has revealed how attackers could steal emails, photos, messages - and even access the camera and microphone. Apple fixed the issue in May. And all up-to-date devices are secure. The hack was possible because Apple's devices use a technology called Apple Wireless Direct Link. This uses wi-fi to allow users to send files and photos over Apple's AirDrop technology and easily share screens with other iOS devices. Mr Beer exploited this network to show how hackers could gain access to a device from a distance. In a blog post,external, he explained how he was able to complete the hack, which he spent six months investigating. He found no evidence the vulnerability had been ""exploited in the wild"", although said some people tweeted when the bug was fixed in May. ""As we all pour more and more of our souls into these devices, an attacker can gain a treasure trove of information on an unsuspecting target,"" he said. Apple has not yet responded to a BBC News request for comment. Prof Daniel Dresner, cyber security expert at the University of Manchester, said the lack of known exploitation was reassuring, as was the quick reactions of those involved in detection and remediation. ""It's significant given how new services could be exploited, as devices become more connected,"" he said. ""As phones seem to be the pivot point of always-on online living, they are rich pickings for finding these vulnerabilities to exploit."" ""This showed you didn't have to be very close at all to the phone to hack it,"" Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey, said. ""It's a very simple hack. You don't even really have to understand what's going on inside the device to be able to remove a considerable amount of data from it."" Last year, Mr Beer revealed a ""sustained effort""to hack iPhones, using booby-trapped websites, said to have been visited thousands of times per week. Once on an iPhone, the implant could access an enormous amount of data, including (though not limited to) contacts, images and global-positioning-system (GPS) location data, and relay it to an external server every 60 seconds. In response,Apple accused Google of fear-mongering, as the investigation had been published six months after it had fixed the issues. However, it is common practice for responsible security researchers not to publish their findings until after a company has been given the chance to fix a flaw. This video can not be played Cyber-security researchers show off how they have ""fooled"" the iPhone X's Face ID system Another Apple flaw was alsorevealed in March by mobile security company ZecOps. Their research said a bug in the Mail app had made devices susceptible to sophisticated attacks. At the time, an Apple representative told Reuters news agency a fix would be included in upcoming software updates. Google's Android devices have also previously had vulnerabilities revealed. Watchdog Which? suggested more than a billion Android devices were at risk of being hackedbecause they were no longer protected by security updates. Anyone using an Android phone released in 2012 or earlier should be especially concerned, it said.

NHS staff: 'It's a game changer',"Dr Daniel Olaiya, Dr Sara Otung and Dr Mohammed Khaki ""This vaccine is more than good news, it's a game changer,"" Dr Mohammed Khaki tells Newsbeat. Today it was announced the Covid-19 vaccine could be rolled outas early as next week- with NHS staff among the first to get it. It's after the UK approved the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine for widespread use. Dr Khaki, who works as a GP and in A&E, says for doctors it'll hopefully mean the return to a normal situation. ""Hopefully we'll be able to see patients face-to-face and hold their hands again,"" he says. The British regulator, the MHRA, says the jab offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19. ""It hopefully means we're able to move away from lockdowns, a world restricted by masks where conversation is difficult, where movement is difficult and working is stifled,"" Mohammed says. He's looking forward to a world where we can travel and see friends again. For many NHS workers, a vaccine will mean they can see vulnerable family members and friends again. ""I've been isolating from vulnerable family members since the beginning of March,"" Dr Sara Otung, who's been treating Covid patients in Cardiff, tells Newsbeat. ""The hope of getting a vaccine and getting that extra layer of protection is really exciting. Vaccines can save lives,"" the 27-year-old junior doctor says. ""It feels like a glimmer hope on what's been such a difficult year."" Covid Pfizer vaccine approved for use next week in UK Who will get the Covid vaccine first? Covid vaccines: Who decides if they are safe? ""I was ecstatic to hear the news a vaccine is now becoming possible and we're getting closer to it,"" Dr Daniel Olaiya tells Newsbeat. The 28-year-old works at a busy hospital in London treating Covid patients. Dr Daniel Olaiya says the rollout of the vaccine is ""monumental progress"" ""For clinical staff working in Covid areas, you can wear as much PPE as possible and be as careful as possible, but at the end of the day we are at risk. ""Having another barrier of protection, a weapon of armoury, is exactly what we need."" ""We needed a glimmer of hope and it's come at the best time - Christmas, New Year and new beginnings."" Lucy works as nurse administering the flu jab to NHS colleagues. The 23-year-old says she expects to be on the frontline giving fellow NHS workers the Covid-19 vaccine in the next few weeks. Around 50 hospitals are on standby and vaccination centres in venues such as conference centres are being set up now. ""If you're asymptomatic, you don't know if you've got the Covid virus ,so it's a really good way to stop the spread and protect those vulnerable around you.""

Did Brexit help?,"The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine is expected to be rolled out in the UK next week Health Secretary Matt Hancock has claimed Brexit allowed the UK to approve a Covid vaccine more quickly than other European Union (EU) countries. ""We do all the same safety checks and the same processes, but we have been able to speed up how they're done because of Brexit,"" he said in an interview with Times Radio. And the Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, tweeted: ""We could only approve this vaccine so quickly because we have left the EU."" Allow Twitter content?

The EU - through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - has yet to approve a coronavirus vaccine. But the idea that Brexit enabled the UK to press ahead and authorise one is not right. It was actually permitted under EU law, a point made by the head of the UK's medicines regulator on Wednesday. Under European law a vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but individual countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine for temporary use in their domestic market. Britain is still subject to those EU rules during the post-Brexit transition period which runs until the end of the year. The UK's own medicines regulator, the MHRA, confirmed this ina statement last month,external. And its chief executive, Dr June Raine, said on Wednesday that ""we have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January"". This video can not be played Dr June Raine from the MHRA: ""The safety of the public will always come first"" We asked Mr Rees-Mogg about his comment that: ""Last month we changed the regulations so a vaccine did not need EU approval which is slower."" He replied with part of the text of an ""explanatory memorandum"" which accompanied new laws passed by Parliament last month. ""The regulation of human medicines is an area of shared competence between the EU and Member States under article 4 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU),"" it reads. ""But in light of the EU's comprehensive exercise of the competence, Member States are precluded from exercising the competence nationally."" It is true that, in general, regulation of new medicines is done on an EU-wide basis. But that does not take account of the emergency provisions in EU law which Dr Raine refers to. At the government briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked whether the UK's vaccine approval was down to a ""Brexit bonus"". He refused to answer directly and thanked the NHS and the Vaccine Taskforce instead. The MHRA is well-regarded as a world leader in the regulation of medicine, and it has certainly chosen to move faster with vaccine approval than the EMA. ""Our speed or our progress has been totally dependent on the availability of data in our rolling review, and the rigorous assessment and independent advice we have received,"" Dr Raine said. But again, the MHRA didn't have to rely on Brexit to do that. For example, the European Commission confirmed earlier this week thatHungary - an EU member - could use a Russian Covid vaccine,externalin its domestic market if it chose to do so. The EMA appeared to criticise the UK approach in a statement which said it is using a slightly slower method for licensing Covid vaccines than the UK. An initial batch of 800,000 doses of the vaccine will be shipped to the UK from Pfizer's facilities in Belgium It considers this approach to be ""the most appropriate regulatory mechanism for use in the current pandemic emergency, to grant all EU citizens access to a vaccine and to underpin mass vaccination campaigns"". The agency said this longer process was based on a wider body of evidence. The EMA has said it will decide by 29 December whether to grant provisional approval to the vaccine manufactured by Pfizer and BioNTech. That means distribution of the vaccine across the EU - if it is approved - won't start until January, when the relevant EU laws will no longer apply in the UK. The government says it can be more nimble outside the EU, amidst an ongoing debate about how closely it should stick to EU regulations in all sorts of policy areas. But the fact that the UK is the first country in the world to approve this vaccine has got nothing directly to do with Brexit.

The year 2020 set to be in top three warmest,"The Sun shining through the heat haze from a wildfire in California The Earth continued to endure a period of significant heating in 2020 according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). Its provisional assessment suggests this year will be one of the three hottest, just behind 2016 and 2019. The warmest six years in global records dating back to 1850 have now all occurred since 2015. The most notable warmth was in the Siberian Arctic, where temperatures were 5C above average. UN climate change goal now 'within reach' Covid pandemic has little impact on rise in CO2 Can sending fewer emails really save the planet? Warmer winters linked to increased drowning risk To work out the annual rise in temperatures for their State of the Climate report, the WMO uses information from five different global datasets. They then compare modern readings to temperatures taken between 1850-1900. This baseline figure is sometimes referred to as pre-industrial levels. With data available from January to October this year, the WMO says 2020 is  set to be around 1.2C above the baseline, but  with a margin of error of 0.1C. All five datasets currently have 2020 as the second warmest, behind 2016 and ahead of 2019, based on comparisons with similar periods in previous years. However the expectation from scientists is that the temperature data from November and December will likely see enough cooling to push 2020 into third spot. That's because aLa NiÃ±a weather event has developedin the Pacific Ocean and this normally depresses temperatures. The biggest differences from the long term average temperature were seen in the Siberian Arctic Despite this, the WMO is certain that 2020 will remain one of the warmest three. ""Record warm years have usually coincided with a strong El NiÃ±o event, as was the case in 2016,"" said Prof Petteri Taalas, WMO Secretary General. ""We are now experiencing a La NiÃ±a, which has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but has not been sufficient to put a brake on this year's heat."" These relatively similar global temperature figure recorded over the past few years hide considerable differences at local level. In 2020, Siberia saw temperatures around 5C above average, which culminated in a reading of38C at Verkhoyansk on the 20th June, which is provisionally the highest known temperature recorded anywhere north of the Arctic Circle. Icebergs off Greenland as the Arctic summer melt was second largest on record January to October was also the warmest such period on record in Europe. But some places were below average including parts of Canada, Brazil, India and Australia. Overall though the 2020 figure reinforces the view that climate warming, driven by human activities is persisting. The decade from 2011 to 2020 is the warmest yet recorded. The majority of the excess heat generated from warming gases in the atmosphere ends up in the oceans. This is putting added strain on the seas, with around 80% of global waters experiencing at least one marine heatwave this year.  These events, similar to heatwaves on land, see prolonged exposure to high temperatures which can have devastating impacts on marine creatures and ecosystems. Along-running heatwaveoff the coast of California, known as ""the blob"", was said to have killed up to a million seabirds in 2015-16. Researchers say that these events have become more than 20 times more frequent over the past 40 years. ""About 90% of the heat accumulating within the climate system from anthropogenic climate change is stored in the ocean,"" said Prof John Church from the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. ""This latest update from WMO clearly shows the oceans are continuing to warm, and at an accelerating rate, contributing to sea-level rise. This means climate change has significant momentum committing us to further change over the coming decades."" The WMO says that warming continues to drive melting in many parts of the world, including Greenland where around 152 billion tonnes of ice was lost from the ice sheet in the year to August 2020. There were 30 named storms during the North Atlantic hurricane season, breaking the record for the number of such events. Europe saw another record-breaking summer in 2020, making life uncomfortable for travellers As well as record numbers,new evidence suggestedthat hurricanes get stronger when they hit land because of rising temperatures. Other impacts noted by the WMO this year included wildfires in Siberia, Australia and along the US West Coast and South America, which saw plumes of smoke circumnavigate the globe. Floods in Africa and South East Asia displaced large numbers of people and undermined food security for millions. The findings of the WMO report won't come as a surprise to most observers. This video can not be played What is climate change? ""The state of the global climate? Parlous,"" said Prof Dave Reay from University of Edinburgh, UK. ""These annual updates of deteriorating planetary health always make for bleak reading; this year's is a full red alert. Surging heat, intensifying droughts and rampant wildfires all speak of the acute impacts of climate change in 2020.  They also warn of the chronic undermining of global carbon sinks - the oceans, trees and soils around the world - that is underway. ""Throw yet more emissions and warming at them and they will rip the Paris climate goals from our grasp forever. The year ahead will be defined by our recovery from Covid-19, the centuries ahead will be defined by how green that recovery actually is."" Hurricane Iota left destruction in its trail in Nicaragua Environmental campaigners say the report adds urgency to calls for the recovery, post-Covid, to focus on climate change and the environment. ""Although the pandemic will have been the biggest concern to many people in the developed world in 2020, for millions in climate vulnerable places the climate emergency remains the biggest threat and sadly there is no simple vaccine to fix the climate. But keeping fossil fuels in the ground would be a good start,"" said Dr Kat Kramer, from Christian Aid. ""These findings show just how important it is to ensure the government's economic recovery measures don't entrench the fossil fuel economy but act to accelerate the transition to a zero-carbon world."" According to a new report from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN), climate change is now the biggest threat to the most important world heritage sites. The IUCN says that 83 such sites are now threatened by rising temperatures, including the Great Barrier Reef where ocean warming, acidification and extreme weather have all contributed to a dramatic decline.

"Daughter and mum, 95, share first hug since MarchChristine Colburn embraces her mum for the first time in months after taking a rapid Covid test.Devon","Christine Colburn said embracing her mother, Audrey Cornell, was ""just like the old days"" A daughter has hugged her elderly mother at a care home for the first time in nine months. Christine Colburn had a rapid lateral flow Covid test, which produces results in 30 minutes, at the home in Bampton, Devon, so she could embrace her 95-year-old mother, Audrey Cornell. The home is one of several across the South West taking part in a pilot scheme for rapid testing. Ms Colburn said it felt ""amazing"" to hug her mother again. ""It's really exciting,"" she said. ""Just like the old days, just brilliant. ""It'll be even nicer when we can touch skin [without PPE] but this is pretty good."" Ms Cornell said it was ""grand"" to be able to hug her daughter again Since the pandemic started, Ms Colburn has only be able to call her mother on Skype or talk to her through a screen - travelling the one hour and 45 minute journey from her home in Dorchester. Ms Cornell said it was ""grand"" to be able to hug her daughter again. The manager of Castle Grove care home, Lucy Bull, said the pilot scheme has gone well but they ""do worry about getting enough tests and the added costs, especially for smaller homes"". ""I think it will be expensive because we'll have to up-skill our staff,"" she said. ""It's also quite hard to recruit care staff at the moment."" The lateral flow testing that Ms Colburn had involves a swab of the nose and throat to collect a sample, which is then inserted into a tube of liquid for a short time. Drops of liquid are added to the test strip and after about half an hour a result will be shown. Mass testing with lateral flow testsbegan in Liverpool on 6 November.

Man convicted of 'one-punch' High Street killing,"Daryl Bunn's family and fiancÃ©e have been left devastated by his death, police said A man who launched an unprovoked attack on a husband-to-be has been convicted of his manslaughter. Daryl Bunn, 27, was attacked in Maldon, Essex, after a meeting to discuss best man speeches at another friend's wedding. Chelmsford Crown Court heard Sonny Hazell, 25, knocked him to the ground with a single punch, inflicting a traumatic brain injury. Hazell was found guilty of the 29 June 2019 killing after a trial. Mr Bunn had met his friend and fellow best man earlier that afternoon before meeting up with another group at two pubs. As the men made their way home they ""became involved in an altercation"" outside a branch of Iceland, the force said. Mr Bunn hit his head on the ground, causing a traumatic brain injury. He was airlifted to hospital in Cambridge where he died eight days later. Det Ch Insp Lee Morton said: ""The case shows that any act of violence can lead to someone being seriously injured and even killed. ""Daryl Bunn's death was needless and completely avoidable, and his family and fiancÃ©e have been left devastated. ""They have been in court throughout the trial and heard how Daryl did nothing to instigate or provoke the incident that led to him losing his life."" Mr Bunn's family previously said they had been left ""totally heartbroken"". ""Everyone who knew him would say what a lovely, beautiful soul he had inside and out, with a heart of gold, and he will be truly missed,"" they said in a statement. Hazell and Jordan Hooper, 24, of Princes Avenue, Southminster were cleared of a grievous bodily harm charge in relation to Mr Bunn's friend, who suffered a broken jaw.

"Two women injured in stabbing at M&S storeA man was detained by ""brave"" passers-by and arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, police say.","Police were called to a report of a stabbing inside Marks and Spencer A staff member and a shopper have been injured in a stabbing at a Marks & Spencer store. The two women were hurt in the attack in the St James Street store in Burnley at 09:30 GMT, Lancashire Police said. A force spokesman said both were taken to hospital but their injuries were not believed to be life-threatening. Supt Stasia Osiowy praised the ""brave actions"" of passers-by, who detained a 57-year-old man, who was then arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. She said the attack was ""not being treated as a terrorism incident, but due to some comments made at the scene, counter-terrorism detectives will be leading on the investigation"". Detectives were ""keeping an open mind as to motivation"", she said, but were ""considering the mental health background"" of the arrested man. Supt Osiowy thanked ""members of the public who acted very quickly, and without regard to their own safety, in order to detain the attacker"". ""Without their brave actions, this incident, while serious, could have been so much worse,"" she said. The force spokesman said the two women, a staff member in her 40s and a customer in her 60s, had ""thankfully"" not been seriously injured. A knife was recovered at the scene. A police cordon is in place outside the store as inquiries continue Carl Stredder, who was shopping with his wife at the time, had stopped at the cash machine opposite Marks & Spencer when he heard shouting coming from the store. He told the BBC he saw a man ""holding down"" another man before the emergency services arrived at the scene. ""Within a couple of minutes, the police had arrived. There were six or seven police cars, sirens all over the place,"" he said. ""Then within another five or so minutes, an ambulance came. It was apparent by then that some sort of major incident had occurred."" He added: ""It was a bit of a frightener when we came home and realised in the cold light of day what could have happened."" A Marks & Spencer spokesman said the company was ""incredibly grateful"" to the emergency services and pleased both victims were ""now in good care"".

Amazon's AI box lets firms check if staff use masksAWS Panorama adds a range of employee monitoring powers to existing workplace camera systems.Technology,"The system can be used to check if workers are wearing masks and are staying far enough away from each other Amazon plans to sell companies a way to detect when staff are not wearing face masks or socially distancing. Beyond the pandemic, the system could also be used to track compliance of other workplace rules or to monitor the public - for example, to check the number of customers queuing in a store. It involves retrofitting a box to existing security cameras that can then draw on off-the-shelf AI apps. But privacy campaigners have raised concerns. Remote working has already led to an increase in the use of software that checks up on employees, but Amazon's new solution is focused on tracking people and products in factories, shops and other traditional workplaces. 'I monitor my staff with software that takes screenshots' Is my boss allowed to spy on me? Amazon refutes the characterisation of its new product as a surveillance tool. A spokeswoman told the BBC it was designed to improve industrial operations and workplace safety, and that how it is used is up to customers. ""For example, AWS Panorama does not include any pre-packaged facial recognition capabilities,"" she said. All its machine learning functions can happen on the device ""and [relevant data] never has to leave the customer's facility"", she added. The AWS Panorama appliance plugs into internet protocol (IP) cameras - a standard type of digital video camera used by a huge range of companies on their sites. The technology can be added on to existing CCTV hardware It can automate inspection tasks, such as detecting manufacturing defects or tracking the movement of barcodes and labels. But the tool can also be applied to people. For example, in a retail shop, it could count the number of customers, track their movements and check the length of queues, Amazon has suggested. 'Hundreds injured at Amazon UK warehouses' Amazon spends $500m on bonuses for Christmas staff In a factory or other workplace, the same tech can be used to monitor employees ""and get notified immediately about any potential issues or unsafe situations so you can take pre-emptive action"", the company said. In the promotional material for the product, Fender guitars says it uses the product to ""track how long it takes for an associate to complete each task in the assembly of a guitar"". The Financial Times reports,externalthat AWS Panorama can detect vehicles bring driven in places they are not supposed to be. Some major companies are already trialling the system, including Siemens and Deloitte, the FT added. The AWS Panorama Appliance boxes need to be installed on the same network as the cameras they are linked to It is still, however, in preview, and not yet widely available. The Trades Union Congress (TUC), the umbrella group for UK unions, this week published its report intothe use of AI-powered tools used by employers,external. ""The announcement of this new monitoring tool is another example of how this revolution at work is picking up pace,"" said policy officer Mary Towers. But she warned that it must not gloss over workers' needs. This video can not be played Is your boss spying on you as you work from home? ""In our report, we warn about the potentially negative effects that intrusive technology of this type can have on workers' well-being, right to privacy, data protection rights and the right not be discriminated against."" Polling suggested that workers were already concerned about CCTV cameras being used to monitor performance when they were supposed to have been installed for security, she said. Silkie Carlo, director of privacy group Big Brother Watch, said automated monitoring of workplaces ""rarely results in benefits for employees"". ""It's a great shame that social distancing has been leapt on by Amazon as yet another excuse for data collection and surveillance,"" she said.

Tesco to repay rates relief after payout backlash,"Tesco and Morrisons will together hand back more than Â£850m worth of business rates relief they received as support during the coronavirus crisis. Tesco said it would repay Â£585m after it was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders. Morrisons subsequently announced it had ""brought forward"" a decision on rates relief and would pay back Â£274m. Tesco said the help to retailers had been a ""game-changer"" and hugely important at the time. But it added that its business had proven ""resilient"" and it had now decided to return the money in full. ""We will work with the UK government and devolved administrations on the best means of doing that,"" it said. In October, Tesco defended paying a Â£315m dividend to shareholders after reporting a 29% increase in profits for the first half of the year. Finance chief Alan Stewart told reporters it was the right policy. Meanwhile, Morrisons said it would announce its dividend when it knows how much it has made this year. Commenting on the decision to pay back the rates relief, Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said the supermarket chain had ""done its best work"" to meet the ""enormous challenges"" the pandemic had brought. ""We are grateful for the government's swift action at the start of the pandemic which enabled the whole sector to face squarely into the challenges and disruption caused by Covid-19,"" he said. Business rates relief was extended to all retailers as part of a package of measures announced in March. Tesco profits surge as online orders double In March, Tesco was accused of ""whipping up a huge lobbying operation"" against a decision not to give its biggest stores in Wales financial help. The Welsh government changed its mind and decided to grant business rate relief to all retail, hospitality and leisure firms. Tesco is understood to have asked the Welsh government for an explanation of its thinking rather than a change in policy. ""The decision to repay business rates relief is one for individual companies to consider for themselves,"" said Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium. ""Many have used this money to cover increased costs as a result of Covid - hiring extra staff and making significant investment in the safety and protection of their premises. As such, there are many firms who simply cannot afford to repay this government relief."" While most of the public focus has - for obvious reasons - been on the furlough scheme, the business rates holiday for retailers and hospitality companies has been one of the main ways the government has tried to keep alive the companies most affected by pandemic closures. Like all coronavirus schemes, however, the rates relief was a blunt instrument - it went also to retailers who have stayed open throughout. When those retailers decided to pay dividends to shareholders, there was an understandable outcry. Tesco was the object of most opprobrium; it said it would pay Â£315m to investors after reporting that pandemic trading had been buoyant. Directors at the supermarket chain have obviously read the headlines. The company said it would repay the Â£585m it has had so far this year in business rates relief, while pointing out in passing that it estimated the pandemic had brought it Â£725m in additional costs. The question now is whether other essential retailers - especially the big grocery chains such as Sainsbury's and Asda - will follow Tesco's lead. It would be surprising if they did not. And while the repayments might appear like a public-spirited move, bear in mind the board may have had other motivations: in particular, a desire not to have the public support they have received hanging over them and preventing them from exercising their normal commercial judgement in paying dividends, approving bonuses and making deals. Tesco said the money meant that it had had the immediate confidence, in the face of significant uncertainty, to invest in colleagues and support its customers and suppliers. ""Every penny of the rates relief we have received has been spent on our response to the pandemic. Our latest estimate at our interim results in October was that Covid would cost Tesco [about] Â£725m this year - well in excess of the Â£585m rates relief received. ""Ten months into the pandemic, our business has proven resilient in the most challenging of circumstances. While all businesses have been impacted - many severely so - we have been able to continue trading throughout, serving many millions of customers every day and although uncertainties still exist, some of the potential risks faced earlier in the year are now behind us."" Chief executive Ken Murphy said: ""Giving this money back to the public is absolutely the right thing to do by our customers, colleagues and all of our stakeholders.""

He told the BBC he saw a man ""holding down"" another man before the emergency services arrived at the scene. ""Within a couple of minutes, the police had arrived. There were six or seven police cars, sirens all over the place,"" he said. ""Then within another five or so minutes, an ambulance came. It was apparent by then that some sort of major incident had occurred."" He added: ""It was a bit of a frightener when we came home and realised in the cold light of day what could have happened."" A Marks & Spencer spokesman said the company was ""incredibly grateful"" to the emergency services and pleased both victims were ""now in good care"". ""Our focus is on ensuring that our colleagues in Burnley receive all the support they need,"" he added. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

WW2 mine found in Clyde had 350kg of explosives,"This video can not be played WW2 mine blown up off Scottish coast A World War Two mine found in the Firth of Clyde contained about 350kg (771 lbs) of explosives, the Royal Navy has said. The ""pristine"" German-laid mine was discovered by the crew of a Marine Scotland research boat near Wemyss Bay on Wednesday. Seven crew members were evacuated by lifeboat before their vessel was sailed to Ettrick Bay on the Isle of Bute. Bomb disposal experts then carried out a controlled explosion of the mine. The unexploded mine was said to be in pristine condition Lieutenant Commander Mark Shaw, Commanding Officer of of the Royal Navy's Northern Diving Group, said the submarine-laid mine was in ""remarkable"" condition considering it had been in the water for 80 years. He added: ""From the initial pictures, we were able to easily identify the mine type and importantly determine that the explosive fill was intact and therefore presented a significant hazard. ""This highlights the remaining presence of historic ordnance. Even small items can be unstable and present an explosive hazard. ""Carrying-out a controlled explosion is the only safe way of dealing with them and neutralising the hazard."" He said that anyone who comes across a suspected piece of ordnance should not interfere with it and immediately contact the emergency services. The mine was found by the crew of a Marine Scotland research boat The Scottish government said the marine research ship had quickly alerted the emergency services and other agencies once the mine had been discovered. A spokesperson said: ""The safety of our staff and crew remained of paramount importance as we worked with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency to coordinate the emergency response.

What are the safety checks?,"More than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. There are different approved types and brands available and all have undergone rigorous testing and safety checks. Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. The principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. When will I get a coronavirus vaccine? If the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech,the first to be approved in the UK. Half are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. The Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. Approval is only given if regulators are happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. Checks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. In the UK, independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it after approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Scientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge. The UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can befast-tracked for approvalif needed. No corners will be cut, with safety paramount. But lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed. Instead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used. Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. They do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus. Vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective. Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against. Some people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine. Common reactions,externalthat may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles. It is rare to find that health problems occurring following a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Events may be coincidental and unrelated to vaccination. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has beenlinked to very rare cases of blood clots,external. This is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. The chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK have been offered alternative Covid vaccines. Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients arelisted.,external There have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. As a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. Be aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). People will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid in the past. That's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection. Guidance,externalsays there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with ""long"" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. Some vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. The Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products. TheBritish Islamic Medical Association,externalsays there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example. How will the vulnerable be protected from Covid?

"Humans waging 'suicidal war' on nature - UN chiefSecretary General Antonio Guterres says our ""war"" on the natural world will come back to haunt us.","This video can not be played United Nations chief Antonio Guterres issues a stark warning to world leaders about the state of the planet ""Our planet is broken,"" the Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, has warned. Humanity is waging what he describes as a ""suicidal"" war on the natural world. ""Nature always strikes back, and is doing so with gathering force and fury,"" he told a BBC special event on the environment. Mr Guterres wants to put tackling climate change at the heart of the UN's global mission. In a speech entitled State of the Planet, he announced that its ""central objective"" next year will be to build a global coalition around the need to reduce emissions to net zero. Net zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and balancing any further releases by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. Mr Guterres said that every country, city, financial institution and company ""should adopt plans for a transition to net zero emissions by 2050"". In his view, they will also need to take decisive action now to put themselves on the path towards achieving this vision. The objective, said the UN secretary general, will be to cut global emissions by 45% by 2030 compared with 2010 levels. Has the world started to take climate change fight seriously? 'Earthshot': William and Attenborough launch prize to save planet You've got cheap data, how about cheap power too? Here's what Mr Guterres demanded the nations of the world do: Put a price on carbon Phase out fossil fuel finance and end fossil fuel subsidies Shift the tax burden from income to carbon, and from tax payers to polluters Integrate the goal of carbon neutrality (a similar concept to net zero) into all economic and fiscal policies and decisions Help those around the world who are already facing the dire impacts of climate change Our war on the natural world will come back to haunt us, says Mr Guterres It is an ambitious agenda, as Mr Guterres acknowledged, but he said that radical action is needed now. ""The science is clear,"" Mr Guterres told the BBC, ""unless the world cuts fossil fuel production by 6% every year between now and 2030, things will get worse. Much worse."" This video can not be played Is it possible to reverse the climate crisis? The BBC's Justin Rowlatt explains Climate policies have yet to rise to the challenge, the UN chief said, adding that ""without concerted action, we may be headed for a catastrophic three to five-degree temperature rise this century"". The impact is already being felt around the world. ""Apocalyptic fires and floods, cyclones and hurricanes are the new normal,"" he warned. ""Biodiversity is collapsing. Deserts are spreading. Oceans are choking with plastic waste."" Mr Guterres said the nations of the world must bring ambitious commitments to cut emissions to the international climate conference the UK and Italy are hosting in Glasgow in November next year. As well as pressing for action on the climate crisis, he urged nations to tackle the extinction crisis that is destroying biodiversity and to step up efforts to reduce pollution. We face, he said, a ""moment of truth"". But he does discern some glimmers of hope.

He acknowledged that the European Union, the US, China, Japan, South Korea and more than 110 other countries have committed to become carbon neutral by the middle of this century. He said he wants to see this momentum turned into a movement. Technology will help us to reach these targets, Mr Guterres said he believes. Technology could help forge a more sustainable path, says Antonio Guterres ""The coal business is going up in smoke,"" because it costs more to run most of today's coal plants than it does to build new renewable plants from scratch, he told the BBC. ""We must forge a safer, more sustainable and equitable path"", the UN chief concluded. He said it is time for this war against the planet to end, adding: ""We must declare a permanent ceasefire and reconcile with nature.""

Amazon's AI box lets firms check if staff use masksAWS Panorama adds a range of employee monitoring powers to existing workplace camera systems.,"The system can be used to check if workers are wearing masks and are staying far enough away from each other Amazon plans to sell companies a way to detect when staff are not wearing face masks or socially distancing. Beyond the pandemic, the system could also be used to track compliance of other workplace rules or to monitor the public - for example, to check the number of customers queuing in a store. It involves retrofitting a box to existing security cameras that can then draw on off-the-shelf AI apps. But privacy campaigners have raised concerns. Remote working has already led to an increase in the use of software that checks up on employees, but Amazon's new solution is focused on tracking people and products in factories, shops and other traditional workplaces. 'I monitor my staff with software that takes screenshots' Is my boss allowed to spy on me? Amazon refutes the characterisation of its new product as a surveillance tool. A spokeswoman told the BBC it was designed to improve industrial operations and workplace safety, and that how it is used is up to customers. ""For example, AWS Panorama does not include any pre-packaged facial recognition capabilities,"" she said. All its machine learning functions can happen on the device ""and [relevant data] never has to leave the customer's facility"", she added. The AWS Panorama appliance plugs into internet protocol (IP) cameras - a standard type of digital video camera used by a huge range of companies on their sites. The technology can be added on to existing CCTV hardware It can automate inspection tasks, such as detecting manufacturing defects or tracking the movement of barcodes and labels. But the tool can also be applied to people. For example, in a retail shop, it could count the number of customers, track their movements and check the length of queues, Amazon has suggested. 'Hundreds injured at Amazon UK warehouses' Amazon spends $500m on bonuses for Christmas staff In a factory or other workplace, the same tech can be used to monitor employees ""and get notified immediately about any potential issues or unsafe situations so you can take pre-emptive action"", the company said. In the promotional material for the product, Fender guitars says it uses the product to ""track how long it takes for an associate to complete each task in the assembly of a guitar"". The Financial Times reports,externalthat AWS Panorama can detect vehicles bring driven in places they are not supposed to be. Some major companies are already trialling the system, including Siemens and Deloitte, the FT added. The AWS Panorama Appliance boxes need to be installed on the same network as the cameras they are linked to It is still, however, in preview, and not yet widely available. The Trades Union Congress (TUC), the umbrella group for UK unions, this week published its report intothe use of AI-powered tools used by employers,external. ""The announcement of this new monitoring tool is another example of how this revolution at work is picking up pace,"" said policy officer Mary Towers. But she warned that it must not gloss over workers' needs. This video can not be played Is your boss spying on you as you work from home? ""In our report, we warn about the potentially negative effects that intrusive technology of this type can have on workers' well-being, right to privacy, data protection rights and the right not be discriminated against."" Polling suggested that workers were already concerned about CCTV cameras being used to monitor performance when they were supposed to have been installed for security, she said. Silkie Carlo, director of privacy group Big Brother Watch, said automated monitoring of workplaces ""rarely results in benefits for employees"". ""It's a great shame that social distancing has been leapt on by Amazon as yet another excuse for data collection and surveillance,"" she said. Amazon has already faced scrutiny over how its warehouse employees are monitored. In September,a report from a US research group said Amazon used extensive worker surveillance,externalto limit union organising activity. And the company has clashed with some of itsemployees who have accused it treating them ""like robots"".

"EasyJet to charge for overhead luggage lockersCustomers who want to use overhead storage must buy more expensive tickets, the airline says.BusinessComments","EasyJet customers who want to use overhead luggage lockers will have to buy more expensive tickets. In a move which provoked criticism on social media, EasyJet said the changes to its luggage policy will start on 10 February. Customers who don't buy the more expensive tickets will be restricted to putting a small carry-on bag under their seat. EasyJet said the changes would improve punctuality. But some customers reacted with dismay on Twitter, with one calling it an ""absolutely terrible move"". ""Like Ryanair, [they are] monetising every opportunity in a race to the bottom,""they said,external. Another accused,externalthe airline of changing the conditions of their ticket after they had bought it. ""I imagine there is some small letter in the terms to allow you to do it, but it is not right is it?"" But some customers welcomed the move, saying it would free up storage space. Currently, all customers are allowed to fly with a cabin bag measuring up to 56 x 45 x 25cm, enabling them to put small wheelie suitcases into overhead lockers. But under the new rules, passengers who want to travel with an additional bag of this size as hand luggage must buy a more expensive ticket such as an Up Front or Extra Legroom seat. Prices range from Â£7.99 more expensive than a standard fare, up to Â£29.99 on longer flights. EasyJet slumps to first annual loss amid pandemic People who also buy a more expensive Flexi fare or are members of the carrier's frequent flyer scheme will also continue to be allowed to take one small and one large item of hand luggage with them, subject to space on board. EasyJet customers with an existing booking for travel from February 10 who do not want to pay more will be able to check in a larger cabin bag in the aircraft hold free of charge. Easyjet previously used its luggage allowance to differentiate it from competitors Robert Carey, chief commercial and customer officer for EasyJet said: ""Punctuality is important to our customers and we know that if they have their bags placed into the hold at the gate due to the limited space onboard this can cause flight delays, and it can be frustrating for them too. ""Our new policy will improve boarding and punctuality for everyone, as well as give our customers certainty of what they will have with them onboard."" EasyJet previously used its luggage allowance to differentiate it from competitors. Ryanair limits passengers to one small item of hand luggage without an extra fee, while British Airways' cheapest fares include one large and one small item of hand luggage. Airlines have been hit hard by coronavirus crisis travel restrictions, and have been looking for ways to cut costs. In November, EasyJetreported its first annual loss in the airline's 25-year history. The airline made a loss of Â£1.27bn for the year to 30 September as revenues more than halved. EasyJet expects to fly at just 20% of normal capacity into next year. A spokesperson said the change in baggage allowance had been under consideration since before the pandemic.

"Man convicted of 'one-punch' High Street killingPolice have described the attack as ""needless and completely avoidable"".","Daryl Bunn's family and fiancÃ©e have been left devastated by his death, police said A man who launched an unprovoked attack on a husband-to-be has been convicted of his manslaughter. Daryl Bunn, 27, was attacked in Maldon, Essex, after a meeting to discuss best man speeches at another friend's wedding. Chelmsford Crown Court heard Sonny Hazell, 25, knocked him to the ground with a single punch, inflicting a traumatic brain injury. Hazell was found guilty of the 29 June 2019 killing after a trial. Mr Bunn had met his friend and fellow best man earlier that afternoon before meeting up with another group at two pubs. As the men made their way home they ""became involved in an altercation"" outside a branch of Iceland, the force said. Mr Bunn hit his head on the ground, causing a traumatic brain injury. He was airlifted to hospital in Cambridge where he died eight days later. Det Ch Insp Lee Morton said: ""The case shows that any act of violence can lead to someone being seriously injured and even killed. ""Daryl Bunn's death was needless and completely avoidable, and his family and fiancÃ©e have been left devastated. ""They have been in court throughout the trial and heard how Daryl did nothing to instigate or provoke the incident that led to him losing his life.""

As it happened: UK regulator approves Covid vaccine use,"PM says ""the scientists have done it"" after UK becomes first country in world to approve Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine for widespread use But he warns the tier system remains crucial and people must continue to follow the rules as it will take time to roll out the vaccine England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam says ""people need to get on this train"" and get the jab when it is offered to them Regulator Dr June Raine says that ""no corners have been cut"" in approving the vaccine Priority list of those who will get the vaccine first is published - care home residents at the top Meanwhile, new three-tier system of restrictions has come into force in England, as four-week lockdown ends WHO issues stricter guidance on mask-wearing indoors and outside France to carry out random border checks to deter citizens from going abroad on ski holidays Nearly 64m cases of coronavirus globally and more than 1.4m deaths, according to latest Johns Hopkins University figures We are pausing our live coverage of the coronavirus outbreak for now. Thanks for joining us, we'll be back in the morning to bring you more updates. Today's coverage has been brought to you by: Marie Jackson, Becky Morton, Joshua Cheetham, Katie Wright, Jennifer Scott, Sean Fanning, Claire Heald and Suzanne Leigh. Our live coverage will be coming to a close shortly, on a day which has been dominated by the news that a vaccine will begin being rolled out in the UK next week. Here is a round-up of the main developments: Prof
Peter Openshaw, a government adviser and medical expert at Imperial College
London, said people should beware fake news and rumours about the safety of the
vaccine. He
told the BBC: ""If people do not want to have it that is completely up to
them."" He
added: ""I really believe it is a safe way to get vaccinated and
protected."" The
UK's regulator, the MHRA, says all of the vital checks and measures have been
done and no corners have been cut, meaning the jab is safe to recommend. A
snap poll by YouGov of 5,321 British adults suggests the majority of the public
is confident about the vaccine. Reality Check There have been claims that Brexit allowed the UK to approve a vaccine more quickly than the EU, but is that correct? The EU - through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - has yet to approve a coronavirus vaccine. But the idea that Brexit enabled the UK to press ahead and authorise one is not right. Under European law a vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but individual countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine for temporary use in their domestic market. Britain is still subject to those EU rules during the post-Brexit transition period which runs until the end of the year. The UK's own medicines regulator, the MHRA, confirmed this ina statement last month,external. And its chief executive, Dr June Raine, said today that ""we have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January"". It is true that, in general, regulation of new medicines is done on an EU-wide basis. But that does not take account of the emergency provisions in EU law which Dr Raine refers to.

But as clubs in certain areas of England open their turnstiles for the first time in almost nine months, a BBC Sport poll suggestsfans are dividedover whether they should be allowed to return before a Covid-19 vaccine is rolled out. In a Savanta ComRes poll of 2,100 football fans, 52% said they should be allowed to return to watch matches in person before a vaccine is available, while 45% said they should not. The poll also shows:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Students will have staggered starting dates for returning to universities in England after Christmas- with some not back until 7 February. The government's plan would see students on hands-on, practical courses such as medicine going back from 4 to 18 January. Other subjects would be taught online until face-to-face teaching begins between 25 January and 7 February. Students are being promised Covid tests when they return to university next term. The plan, to avoid a surge of students and the risk of spreading coronavirus, will mean a staggered return for students over five weeks in the new year - with most courses starting online before a return to in-person teaching. Students will be offered two lateral flow Covid tests when they arrive back - similar to the process for their departure. The arrangements for next term have been announced on the eve of students being able to return home for Christmas. Labour's leader is calling for all parties to work together over the rollout of the vaccine. Speaking after the Downing Street press conference, Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""really important... whatever our political party, [we] work together to make sure that the rollout is
swift, safe and fair, and the people have confidence in it"". He says he has asked Boris Johnson to share No 10's plan for communicating the rollout. Sir Keir added: ""Then we will work
together so that the public can see cross-party consensus on this. ""This
rollout is one of the biggest logistical exercises since the Second World War. We need the best of Britain, we need parties pulling together, and I'm very
happy to put my party behind that effort."" The UK prime minister's press conference has just come to an end. So what did we learn from Boris Johnson, Simon Stevens and Jonathan Van-Tam? Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent ""It may be a
good thing, but on the other hand..."" The prime minister
doesn't seem very impressed with Jonathan Van-Tam's claim that coronavirus
safety measures may be with us long term. Boris Johnson
looked a bit baffled and says people want to reclaim their lives. ""I didn't mean
to challenge you,"" he says before the deputy chief medical officer then
clarifies his point that he hopes we'll get back to a much more
normal world as soon as possible. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the big unknowns about this vaccine â and the
others being developed â is whether it prevents transmission. It is possible that people who are vaccinated can still
pass on the virus to others. It will take time to establish to what extent this is
stopped. If it does stop transmission, once you have about 2/3 of
the population vaccinated it is possible you then reach herd immunity and the
virus stops spreading completely. But even if that doesnât happen, vaccinating all over 65s
- 12m people - will have a major impact on deaths. More than 90% of people who
have died have been over that age. That in itself would be enough to lead to significant
lifting of restrictions. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter The Pfizer vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective
at stopping people from becoming ill from the virus â the first priority for
getting life back to normal. But we donât yet know whether this vaccine stops people
spreading the virus. Both deputy chief medical officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam and NHS England head Simon Stevens stressed this point during todayâs
briefing. They are âvery hopefulâ it will also stop vaccinated people
from spreading the virus to others. And thereâs good precedent for this â the flu and MMR
(measles, mumps and rubella) jabs both stop vaccinated people from infecting
others. But for now, Van-Tam says, you canât watch others get it (the jab) and hope it will protect you. He encouraged everyone who is invited to be given the
vaccine to take up this opportunity, adding that low take-up of the vaccine will
âalmost certainly make restrictions last longerâ. In the final question, Van-Tam is asked if he can envisage a world where we can cast aside our masks and hand sanitiser for good. The deputy chief medical officer says he doesn't think we will eradicate coronavirus ""ever"", adding: ""It will be with humankind forever"". He also thinks it may become ""a seasonal problem"", like flu. ""Do I think there will be a big moment where we have a big party and throw off our masks? No I don't,"" says Van-Tam. Instead, he thinks the ""personal habit"" may carry on for some years, even if the government doesn't insist on the measures. And asked about the MPs that rebelled against the new tier system, the PM concludes the press conference saying: ""I totally understand people's frustrations with the tiering system. ""But we will make sure we are as local and as sensitive as we can possibly be [on restrictions]."" Asked whether the current coronavirus restrictions could be ended
early, the prime minister says the vaccine news âfor now makes absolutely no
differenceâ. However, he adds that there will come a moment to relax the ânon- pharmaceutical interventionsâ but âweâre not there yetâ. He stresses the moment when it is time to relax the rules is theoretical and there is âweeks,
months of work to goâ before we are in that position. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This is the day we have been waiting for. But it is clear listening to NHS England chief executive
Simon Stevens and deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van Tam that
there are some huge logistical challenges from here on in. First of all, supply. The UK is expecting 800,000 doses
in the next few days. But given there are 15 million people over the age of 65
and working in health and care sectors, and all need two doses, it is clear
getting more into the country is essential. Rollout is also difficult. Through a combination of the
need to keep the vaccine at ultra cold storage and the fact that the jab comes
in batches of 975 that cannot be split up at the moment, immunisation will only
be offered from a network of 50 hospitals to start with. It is why there is still so much hope pinned to the
Oxford University vaccine, that regulators are currently reviewing. That does
not need to be kept in ultra cold storage and so can be distributed much more
easily. Plus there are already millions of doses in the country. Then there is vaccine hesitancy. Officials have been at
pains to stress that despite the vaccine being developed in record time the
full testing and regulatory process has been followed. But the more people donât come forward, the longer
restrictions have to remain in place. There is a long way to go yet. Next up is a question on the vaccine roll-out again and about what stage it will be right to lift all the restrictions? Stevens says the ""goal"" of the vaccination programme is to ""protect vulnerable individuals"" - hence the graduated list of who will get it when - and to stop people spreading it. But we don't know yet if that vaccine will have the power to stop transmission. Van Tam points to the priority list, working down the ages and at risk groups, saying it is ""not an accident"" they take out 99% of groups linked to Covid related mortality deaths in the UK. Johnson says the reason the UK got the vaccine ahead of other countries is down to the vaccine task force's work. But they are ""global efforts of scientists around the world"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The prime minister
loves a colourful metaphor and so does Jonathan Van-Tam. Boris Johnson began
the briefing by saying science had performed a kind of biological jiu jitsu -
turning the virus on itself to make this vaccine. Soon after the
government's deputy chief medical officer likened it to a train arriving at a
station which people needed to get on and compared the vaccine to a yoghurt,
saying it couldn't be taken in and out of the fridge. Tabloid headline
writers will be able to take their pick. Beth Rigby from Sky News asks whether we should all still
prepare for restrictions to run until April. Boris Johnson says he accepts that the new tier system in
England is âtoughâ but he says the way forward is local restrictions and mass
testing to âkeep the virus under controlâ. He says he hopes places are able âto come down the tiersâ
before Easter, adding that it is necessary to have these measures alongside the
vaccine. Asked whether the PM expects to roll over the tier system at
the start of February, Johnson says the situation will be judged on the data but
âfor the time being youâve got to take it that tiering will be a very, very
important part of our campaign against coronavirus."" The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is the first one in the UK to be approved for use, with hopes people can start receiving the injection within a week. In the video below BBC health correspondent Laura Foster helps explain some of the logistics around how it will be rolled out. This video can not be played The next question is on care home residents, as despite scientists calling for them to get the vaccine first, the government says they may not. Johnson says: ""Of course we want to get it into care homes as fast as we possibly can"". But the issue is in distributing the cases of the vaccine. Each case has 975 vaccines in it, but you cannot currently divide it up, so the government wants to ""avoid wastage"". The PM says they are waiting to hear more, but they ""certainly"" want to get it to ""the most vulnerable"". Van-Tam says remarks about failure on care homes are ""extremely unfair when one considers a new virus emerged less than 12 months ago and we now have our first vaccine"". He adds: ""This is a complex product. It is not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in several times."" Now we turn to questions from journalists, and the BBCâs Fergus
Walsh asks, how important is this moment? Boris Johnson says itâs a âhuge momentâ and he agrees with
Jonathan Van-Tam that itâs also âa very moving thingâ. He says he is âlost in admirationâ for the way scientists can
solve problems. However, he adds that although itâs a fantastic moment, âthe
worst thing now would be to think that this the moment when we can relax our
guard and think that itâs game over"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
PM hails vaccine but warns it is 'not game over',"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It will be some months before the most vulnerable are protected"" People should not get ""carried away with over optimism"" after the UK approved its first coronavirus vaccine, Boris Johnson has warned. The PM said it did not mean ""our struggle is over"", saying parts of the economy still faced tough restrictions. England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam urged patience over the rollout of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, which begins early next week. But care home residents will have to wait due to logistical challenges. And it could take until April for all those most at-risk to receive the new vaccine, according to the head of NHS England. A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported. What are the safety checks for vaccines? How will I get a vaccine? Did Brexit speed up the process? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' Speaking at a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson saidthe decision to approve the Pfizer jab by regulator MHRAcame amid ""immense logistical challenges"" in getting doses to vulnerable groups. The vaccine needs to be stored at around -70C and comes in packs of 975 doses, which cannot yet be split into smaller batches. Those who receive it will need a a second dose 21 days later to receive full protection. ""It's going to continue to be tough for some sectors - but until the vaccine is deployed our plan relies on all of us making sacrifices to protect the ones we love,"" Mr Johnson said. Meanwhile, Labour's leader Sir Keir Starmer said the vaccine roll-out would require the ""best of Britain"" as he called for cross-party consensus on communications about the effort. This is the day we have been waiting for. But it is clear listening to NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens and England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam that huge logistical challenges remain. First of all, supply. The UK is expecting 800,000 doses in the next few days. But given there are 15 million people over the age of 65 and working in health and care sectors, and all need two doses, getting more into the country is essential. Millions more doses are promised - but how quickly they arrive remains to be seen. Roll-out is also difficult. Through a combination of the need to keep the vaccine at ultra-cold storage and the fact that the jab comes in batches of 975 that cannot be split up at the moment, immunisation will only be offered from a network of 50 hospitals to start with. That's because sending it to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted. It is why there is still so much hope pinned to the Oxford University vaccine, that regulators are currently reviewing. That does not need to be kept in ultra-cold storage and so can be distributed much more easily. Plus there are already millions of doses in the country. Prof Van-Tam said he became emotional when the UK became the first country to approve the Pfizer vaccine, but he too warned that social-distancing rules would have to remain in place. ""If we relax too soon it will create a tidal wave of infections,"" he said. ""I don't think we are going to eradicate coronavirus ever. I think it's going to be with humankind forever,"" he added. Prof Van-Tam also said that those offered the vaccine ""must take it"". ""We need people to take it. This vaccine isn't going to help you if you don't take it,"" he said. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the vaccine would be rolled out to 50 hospital hubs in England, with the over-80s, care home staff and front-line NHS staff being the first to receive it from next week. Sir Simon said vulnerable people with outpatient appointments scheduled were likely to be among the very first to be offered the jab. The NHS is ""raring to go"" to vaccinate people in care homes, hopefully this month, Sir Simon said, but he admitted they would not be among the first to receive it. Setting out the difficulties faced in getting the vaccine into care homes, he noted that the jab can only be moved a few times, and that each pack of doses cannot be easily split. The 975 doses they contain would be too many for individual care homes, meaning the vaccine would be wasted, he explained. Both Pfizer and BioNTech have said the jab can be sent to care homes, as long as the vaccine travels for no more than six hours after it leaves cold storage and is then put in a normal fridge at 2C to 8C. This video can not be played England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer: 'I don't think we are going to eradicate coronavirus ever' The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the steps that normally span 10 years. The UK has already ordered 40 million doses - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. These will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said earlier, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland would be immunised on Tuesday, while Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the roll-out to care homes would be particularly difficult. The bulk of the roll-out across the UK will be next year. BioNTech's chief commercial officer Sean Marett said the UK was likely to receive at least 5 million doses of vaccine by the end of the year. Sir Simon said most of the at-risk population would be vaccinated between January and March or April. The order in which people will get the jab has been recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations. But the final decision onwho gets the coronavirus vaccineis made by the government. BBC medical editor Fergus Walsh said Pfizer's plan to get doses to hard-to-reach places such as individual care homes had yet to be approved by the MHRA. The NHS will begin contacting people about getting vaccinated, with GP practices to work together to operate local vaccination centres. Aside from the Pfizer vaccine, the UK has options to buy doses of six other candidate jabs. At least four of these have proceeded to phase-three trials. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

"No, it won't alter your DNA","We've looked into some of the most widely shared false vaccine claims - everything from alleged plots to put microchips into people to the supposed re-engineering of our genetic code. The fear that a vaccine will somehow change your DNA is one we've seen aired regularly on social media. The BBC asked three independent scientists about this. They said that the coronavirus vaccine would not alter human DNA. Some of the newly created vaccines, includingthe one now approved in the UK developed by Pfizer/BioNTech,use a fragment of the virus's genetic material - or messenger RNA. ""Injecting RNA into a person doesn't do anything to the DNA of a human cell,"" says Prof Jeffrey Almond of Oxford University. It works by giving the body instructions to produce a protein which is present on the surface of the coronavirus. The immune system then learns to recognise and produce antibodies against the protein. Claims that Bill Gates plans to use a vaccine to ""manipulate"" or ""alter"" human DNA have been widely shared This isn't the first time we've looked into claims that a coronavirus vaccine will supposedly alter DNA.We investigated a popular video spreading the theoryback in May. Posts have noted that messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology ""has never been tested or approved before"". It is true that no mRNA vaccine has been approved before now, but multiple studies of mRNA vaccines in humans have taken place over the last few years. And, since the pandemic started, the vaccine has been tested on tens of thousands of people around the world and has gone through a rigorous safety approval process. Like all new vaccines, it has to undergo rigorous safety checks before it can be recommended for widespread use. What are the safety checks for vaccines? In Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, vaccines are tested in small numbers of volunteers to check they are safe and to determine the right dose. In Phase 3 trials they are tested in thousands of people to see how effective they are. The group who received the vaccine and a control group who have received a placebo are closely monitored for any adverse reactions - side-effects. Safety monitoring continues after a vaccine has been approved for use. Next, a conspiracy theory that has spanned the globe. It claims that the coronavirus pandemic is a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips and that the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is behind it. There is no vaccine ""microchip"" and there is no evidence to support claims that Bill Gates is planning for this in the future. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told the BBC the claim was ""false"". One TikTok user created a video about being ""microchipped"" and called a vaccine the ""mark of the beast"" Rumours took hold in March when Mr Gates said in an interview that eventually ""we will have some digital certificates"" which would be used to show who'd recovered, been tested and ultimately who received a vaccine. He made no mention of microchips. This led to one widely shared article headlined: ""Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus."" The article makes reference to a study, funded by The Gates Foundation, into a technology that could store someone's vaccine records in a special ink administered at the same time as an injection. However, the technology is not a microchip and is more like an invisible tattoo. It has not been rolled out yet, would not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database, says Ana Jaklenec, a scientist involved in the study. The billionaire founder of Microsoft has been the subject of many false rumours during the pandemic. He's been targeted because of his philanthropic work in public health and vaccine development. Despite the lack of evidence, in May aYouGov poll of 1,640 people,externalsuggested 28% of Americans believed Mr Gates wanted to use vaccines to implant microchips in people - with the figure rising to 44% among Republicans. Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? How will I get the coronavirus vaccine? Covid vaccine update: When will one be ready? We've seen claims that vaccines contain the lung tissue of an aborted fetus. This is false. ""There are no fetal cells used in any vaccine production process,"" says Dr Michael Head, of the University of Southampton. One particular video that was posted on one of the biggest anti-vaccine Facebook pages refers to a study which the narrator claims is evidence of what goes into the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. But the narrator's interpretation is wrong - the study in question explored how the vaccine reacted when introduced to human cells in a lab. Confusion may have arisen because there is a step in the process of developing a vaccine that uses cells grown in a lab, which are the descendants of embryonic cells that would otherwise have been destroyed. Thetechnique was developed in the 1960s, and no fetuses were aborted for the purposes of this research. Many vaccines are made in this way, explains Dr David Matthews, from Bristol University, adding that any traces of the cells are comprehensively removed from the vaccine ""to exceptionally high standards"". The developers of the vaccine at Oxford University say they worked with cloned cells, but these cells ""are not themselves the cells of aborted babies"". The cells work like a factory to manufacture a greatly weakened form of the virus that has been adapted to function as a vaccine. But even though the weakened virus is created using these cloned cells, this cellular material is removed when the virus is purified and not used in the vaccine. We've seen arguments against a Covid-19 vaccine shared across social media asking why we need one at all if the chances of dying from the virus are so slim. A meme shared by people who oppose vaccination put the recovery rate from the disease at 99.97% and suggested getting Covid-19 is a safer option than taking a vaccine. BBC Bitesize: Finding the facts in a pandemic A meme using images of rapper Drake has been used to promote false vaccine claims To begin with, the figure referred to in the meme as the ""recovery rate"" - implying these are people who caught the virus and survived - is not correct. About 99.0% of people who catch Covid survive it, says Jason Oke, senior statistician at the University of Oxford. So around 100 in 10,000 will die - far higher than three in 10,000, as suggested in the meme. However, Mr Oke adds that ""in all cases the risks very much depend on age and do not take into account short and long-term morbidity from Covid-19"". It's not just about survival. For every person who dies, there are others who live through it but undergo intensive medical care, and those who sufferlong-lasting health effects. This can contribute to a health service overburdened with Covid patients, competing with a hospital's limited resources to treat patients with other illnesses and injuries. Concentrating on the overall death rate, or breaking down the taking of a vaccine to an individual act, misses the point of vaccinations, says Prof Liam Smeeth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It should be seen as an effort by society to protect others, he says. ""In the UK, the worst part of the pandemic, the reason for lockdown, is because the health service would be overwhelmed. Vulnerable groups like the old and sick in care homes have a much higher chance of getting severely ill if they catch the virus"".

"Pfizer vaccine judged safe for use in UK next weekThe UK is the first country to approve the Pfizer vaccine - with 800,000 doses due to arrive soon.HealthComments","The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination. Britain's medicines regulator, the MHRA, says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe to be rolled out. The first doses are already on their way to the UK, with 800,000 due in the coming days, Pfizer said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS will contact people about jabs. Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff. But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine is wasted. A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the public not to get ""carried away with over optimism or falling into the naive belief that our struggle is over"". He tolda Downing Street news conference that, while the ""searchlights of science"" had created a working vaccine, significant logistical challenges remained. What are the safety checks for vaccines How will I get a vaccine? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years. The UK has already ordered 40 million doses of the jab - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. The doses will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Mr Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland will be immunised on Tuesday. Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the rollout of the Pfizer jab to care homes would be particularly difficult because of how it needs to be stored. Mr Gething said that it was not possible to transport the Pfizer vaccine to more than 1,000 care homes across Wales. The bulk of the rollout across the UK will be next year, Mr Hancock said, adding: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better."" There is a clear priority list for who gets the vaccine first - and care home residents and staff are top of it. But operational complexities mean the reality will be somewhat different. When the vaccines arrives, it will be sent straight to major hospitals who have the ultra-cold facilities to store it. From there it can be moved just once - and when it is, it must be kept in batches of 1,000. That means sending it out to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents in some places, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted. Because of that, the NHS, which is in charge of distributing the vaccine, will run clinics from hospitals at first. This will allow NHS and care home staff to get immunised first as well as, perhaps, some of the older age groups who come into hospital. It looks like it will not be until much more of the Pfizer vaccine is available or the Oxford University one, which is easier to distribute, is approved that care home residents will be able to get it. While Mr Hancock said that the government does not yet know how many people need to be vaccinated before restrictions can start being lifted, he added: ""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy."" Mr Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again."" Downing Street press secretary Allegra Stratton said Mr Johnson would not rule out receiving the vaccine jab live on television, though she said he would not want to take a jab meant for someone more vulnerable. The free vaccine will not be compulsory and there will be three ways of vaccinating people across the UK: Hospitals Vaccination centres ""a bit like the Nightingales project and including some of the Nightingales"", said Mr Hancock In the community, with GPs and pharmacists Around 50 hospitals are on stand-by and vaccination centres - in venues such as conference centres or sports stadiums - are being set up now. It is thought the vaccination network could start delivering more than one million doses a week once enough doses are available. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""This is a day to remember and, frankly, a year to forget"" NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the health service was preparing for ""the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country's history"". But experts said people still need to remain vigilant and follow rules to stop the virus spreading - including with social distancing, face masks and self-isolation. ""We can't lower our guard yet,"" said the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty. The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations and decided by the government. Mass immunisation of everyone over 50, as well as younger people with pre-existing health conditions, can happen as more stocks become available in 2021. Pfizer confirmed that the first stocks of the vaccine will be for the NHS, which will give them out for free based on clinical need. People in the UK will not be able to bypass this and buy the vaccine privately to jump the queue. The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. Most of the side effects are very mild, similar to the side effects after any other vaccine and usually last for a day or so, said Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chairman of the Commission on Human Medicine expert working group. The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people, he said. The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said that - despite the speed of approval - no corners have been cut. Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said. This video can not be played Dr June Raine from the MHRA: ""The safety of the public will always come first"" Giving the analogy of climbing a mountain, she said: ""If you're climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became available on 10 November we were at base camp. ""And then when we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us to today."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters The Pfizer/BioNTech was the first vaccine to publish positive early results from final stages of testing. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials. Covid vaccine: How will we keep it cold enough? Because the vaccine must be stored at around -70C, it will be transported in special boxes of up to 5,000 doses, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. And once out of the fridge it needs to be used within six hours. Other coronavirus vaccines are also being developed: One from Moderna uses the same mRNA approach as the Pfizer vaccine and offers similar protection - the UK has pre-ordered seven million doses that could be ready by the spring The UK has ordered 100 million doses of a different type of Covid vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca Russia has been using another vaccine, called Sputnik, and the Chinese military has approved another one made by CanSino Biologics. The World Health Organization's Dr David Nabarro said the Pfizer vaccine would not replace the other measures ""for a number of months, even a year, so we'll have to keep doing physical distancing, mask wearing, hygiene and isolating ourselves when we're sick"". He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme ""the vaccine will only start to dent the size of the pandemic somewhat later in the year"". The pace has been breathtaking. From an unknown virus at the start of the year to a vaccine approved by the regulator and ready to use in early December is an unprecedented timescale. At the Downing Street briefing, the MHRA's chief executive said it was like climbing Everest, with preparations starting in June and a team working ""night and day"" assessing early data and reaching ""base camp"" by early November when Pfizer/BioNtech published the trial results. At the same time, the MHRA was adamant that the process had been robust with safety considerations paramount. A rapid emergency approval process was used by the UK regulator. The European Medicines Agency is taking longer to reach a view and there has been some sniping from European politicians arguing their processes are more reliable and authoritative. But the MHRA is an internationally respected independent watchdog and for now those about to receive the first jabs will rely on its ruling.

PM hails vaccine but warns it is 'not game over'Boris Johnson says virus curbs will remain despite the UK approving its first coronavirus jab.UK,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""It will be some months before the most vulnerable are protected"" People should not get ""carried away with over optimism"" after the UK approved its first coronavirus vaccine, Boris Johnson has warned. The PM said it did not mean ""our struggle is over"", saying parts of the economy still faced tough restrictions. England's deputy chief medical officer Jonathan Van-Tam urged patience over the rollout of the Pfizer/BioNTech jab, which begins early next week. But care home residents will have to wait due to logistical challenges. And it could take until April for all those most at-risk to receive the new vaccine, according to the head of NHS England. A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported. What are the safety checks for vaccines? How will I get a vaccine? Did Brexit speed up the process? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' Speaking at a Downing Street news conference, Mr Johnson saidthe decision to approve the Pfizer jab by regulator MHRAcame amid ""immense logistical challenges"" in getting doses to vulnerable groups. The vaccine needs to be stored at around -70C and comes in packs of 975 doses, which cannot yet be split into smaller batches. Those who receive it will need a a second dose 21 days later to receive full protection. ""It's going to continue to be tough for some sectors - but until the vaccine is deployed our plan relies on all of us making sacrifices to protect the ones we love,"" Mr Johnson said. Meanwhile, Labour's leader Sir Keir Starmer said the vaccine roll-out would require the ""best of Britain"" as he called for cross-party consensus on communications about the effort. This is the day we have been waiting for. But it is clear listening to NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens and England's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam that huge logistical challenges remain. First of all, supply. The UK is expecting 800,000 doses in the next few days. But given there are 15 million people over the age of 65 and working in health and care sectors, and all need two doses, getting more into the country is essential. Millions more doses are promised - but how quickly they arrive remains to be seen. Roll-out is also difficult. Through a combination of the need to keep the vaccine at ultra-cold storage and the fact that the jab comes in batches of 975 that cannot be split up at the moment, immunisation will only be offered from a network of 50 hospitals to start with. That's because sending it to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted. It is why there is still so much hope pinned to the Oxford University vaccine, that regulators are currently reviewing. That does not need to be kept in ultra-cold storage and so can be distributed much more easily. Plus there are already millions of doses in the country. Prof Van-Tam said he became emotional when the UK became the first country to approve the Pfizer vaccine, but he too warned that social-distancing rules would have to remain in place. ""If we relax too soon it will create a tidal wave of infections,"" he said. ""I don't think we are going to eradicate coronavirus ever. I think it's going to be with humankind forever,"" he added. Prof Van-Tam also said that those offered the vaccine ""must take it"". ""We need people to take it. This vaccine isn't going to help you if you don't take it,"" he said. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the vaccine would be rolled out to 50 hospital hubs in England, with the over-80s, care home staff and front-line NHS staff being the first to receive it from next week. Sir Simon said vulnerable people with outpatient appointments scheduled were likely to be among the very first to be offered the jab. The NHS is ""raring to go"" to vaccinate people in care homes, hopefully this month, Sir Simon said, but he admitted they would not be among the first to receive it. Setting out the difficulties faced in getting the vaccine into care homes, he noted that the jab can only be moved a few times, and that each pack of doses cannot be easily split. The 975 doses they contain would be too many for individual care homes, meaning the vaccine would be wasted, he explained. Both Pfizer and BioNTech have said the jab can be sent to care homes, as long as the vaccine travels for no more than six hours after it leaves cold storage and is then put in a normal fridge at 2C to 8C. This video can not be played England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer: 'I don't think we are going to eradicate coronavirus ever' The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the steps that normally span 10 years.

These will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said earlier, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland would be immunised on Tuesday, while Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the roll-out to care homes would be particularly difficult. The bulk of the roll-out across the UK will be next year. BioNTech's chief commercial officer Sean Marett said the UK was likely to receive at least 5 million doses of vaccine by the end of the year. Sir Simon said most of the at-risk population would be vaccinated between January and March or April. The order in which people will get the jab has been recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations. But the final decision onwho gets the coronavirus vaccineis made by the government. BBC medical editor Fergus Walsh said Pfizer's plan to get doses to hard-to-reach places such as individual care homes had yet to be approved by the MHRA. The NHS will begin contacting people about getting vaccinated, with GP practices to work together to operate local vaccination centres. Aside from the Pfizer vaccine, the UK has options to buy doses of six other candidate jabs. At least four of these have proceeded to phase-three trials. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Man is arrested after pipe bomb explosion,"A resident from the Enniskeen estate described hearing a ""very large bang"" on Tuesday evening A man injured after a pipe bomb partially exploded in Craigavon has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, police have said. The incident happened at about 21:30 GMT in the Enniskeen area on Tuesday. The man suffered non-life threatening injuries to his chest and hands and had to be taken to hospital for treatment. A number of homes were evacuated, but residents have since been allowed to return. Det Insp Simpson said the alert was triggered after police received a report of an explosion at the rear of a house in the estate. ""Upon arrival officers found a man in the vicinity of where the explosion was reported to have occurred being treated by paramedics for injuries received after the device exploded,"" he said. ""The injured man, who has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of an explosive device with intent to endanger life, currently remains in hospital receiving treatment for his injuries which are described as not life threatening."" Remnants of a pipe bomb-type device have been taken away for forensic examination, the officer added. The security alert is now over and police thanked local residents for their patience during the incident. An Enniskeen estate resident described hearing a ""very large bang"" shortly before 21:30 on Tuesday, which he believed was a pipe bomb explosion. He added that a while later, the police helicopter flew over the area. Police at the scene of the incident Upper Bann MP Carla Lockhart told BBC News NI the people of Enniskeen had been subjected to attacks for quite some time and did not want them to continue. Ms Lockhart described the explosion as ""a very worrying development"". The Democratic Unionist Party politician praised St Saviour's Church for providing shelter to people whose homes were evacuated and called on anyone with information about the attack to contact police. ""Obviously information is key to answering all the questions as to what happened in Enniskeen,"" she said. ""Those who cause hurt and disruption in our communities must be brought to justice."" Local representatives said the Enniskeen estate was a ""close-knit community"" SDLP councillor Thomas Larkham said: ""This is the last thing that anyone in Enniskeen wants or needs. ""This is a close-knit community full of people trying to get on with their lives during a difficult time for us all."" Alliance Party councillor EÃ³in Tennyson said: ""The patience of residents who have had to leave their homes as police work to make the area safe is greatly appreciated. ""Those behind this have nothing to offer only misery and destruction."" Mr Tennyson added: ""These kinds of devices have no place in our streets, there's no support in the community for this kind of activity. ""I would utterly condemn those responsible, they've been reckless in their behaviour and have shown total disregard for local residents.""

Did Brexit speed up the UK's vaccine approval?,"The Pfizer BioNTech vaccine is expected to be rolled out in the UK next week Health Secretary Matt Hancock has claimed Brexit allowed the UK to approve a Covid vaccine more quickly than other European Union (EU) countries. ""We do all the same safety checks and the same processes, but we have been able to speed up how they're done because of Brexit,"" he said in an interview with Times Radio. And the Leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, tweeted: ""We could only approve this vaccine so quickly because we have left the EU."" Allow Twitter content?

The EU - through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - has yet to approve a coronavirus vaccine. But the idea that Brexit enabled the UK to press ahead and authorise one is not right. It was actually permitted under EU law, a point made by the head of the UK's medicines regulator on Wednesday. Under European law a vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but individual countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine for temporary use in their domestic market. Britain is still subject to those EU rules during the post-Brexit transition period which runs until the end of the year. The UK's own medicines regulator, the MHRA, confirmed this ina statement last month,external. And its chief executive, Dr June Raine, said on Wednesday that ""we have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January"". This video can not be played Dr June Raine from the MHRA: ""The safety of the public will always come first"" We asked Mr Rees-Mogg about his comment that: ""Last month we changed the regulations so a vaccine did not need EU approval which is slower."" He replied with part of the text of an ""explanatory memorandum"" which accompanied new laws passed by Parliament last month. ""The regulation of human medicines is an area of shared competence between the EU and Member States under article 4 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU),"" it reads. ""But in light of the EU's comprehensive exercise of the competence, Member States are precluded from exercising the competence nationally."" It is true that, in general, regulation of new medicines is done on an EU-wide basis. But that does not take account of the emergency provisions in EU law which Dr Raine refers to. At the government briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson was asked whether the UK's vaccine approval was down to a ""Brexit bonus"". He refused to answer directly and thanked the NHS and the Vaccine Taskforce instead. The MHRA is well-regarded as a world leader in the regulation of medicine, and it has certainly chosen to move faster with vaccine approval than the EMA. ""Our speed or our progress has been totally dependent on the availability of data in our rolling review, and the rigorous assessment and independent advice we have received,"" Dr Raine said. But again, the MHRA didn't have to rely on Brexit to do that. For example, the European Commission confirmed earlier this week thatHungary - an EU member - could use a Russian Covid vaccine,externalin its domestic market if it chose to do so. The EMA appeared to criticise the UK approach in a statement which said it is using a slightly slower method for licensing Covid vaccines than the UK. An initial batch of 800,000 doses of the vaccine will be shipped to the UK from Pfizer's facilities in Belgium It considers this approach to be ""the most appropriate regulatory mechanism for use in the current pandemic emergency, to grant all EU citizens access to a vaccine and to underpin mass vaccination campaigns"". The agency said this longer process was based on a wider body of evidence. The EMA has said it will decide by 29 December whether to grant provisional approval to the vaccine manufactured by Pfizer and BioNTech. That means distribution of the vaccine across the EU - if it is approved - won't start until January, when the relevant EU laws will no longer apply in the UK. The government says it can be more nimble outside the EU, amidst an ongoing debate about how closely it should stick to EU regulations in all sorts of policy areas. But the fact that the UK is the first country in the world to approve this vaccine has got nothing directly to do with Brexit.

Should pregnant women be vaccinated? And other questions,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals.

How do we know the vaccine is safe? And other questions,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom.

How will we keep the vaccine cold enough?,"The government has begun distributing the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. However, it needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C. Most other vaccines do not need this, so how will this be made to work? In the short-term, Pfizer has a plan. The vaccine will be distributed from its own centres in the US, Germany and Belgium. It will need to travel both on land and by air and possibly be stored in distribution centres, before being delivered to anywhere the vaccine will be given. Pfizer hasdeveloped a special transport box,externalthe size of a suitcase, packed with dry ice and installed with GPS trackers. Each reusable box can keep up to 5,000 doses of the vaccine at the right temperature for 10 days, if it remains unopened. Wiltshire-based firm Polar Thermals makes similar boxes for other vaccines and counts Pfizer among its clients, but not yet for this particular purpose. Polar Thermal's ""thermal shipper"" can be reused thousands of times The box is not likely to be cheap. Head of sales Paul Harrison says a standard chilled transport box, which will retain a temperature of up to -8C for five days and is big enough to hold 1,200 vaccines, costs about Â£5,000 per unit - although they can be reused thousands of times. His firm uses aerogel as insulation, rather than dry ice - which could be handy if a global carbon dioxide shortage from earlier this year continues to affect the availability of related products, such as dry ice. The US Compressed Gas Association, however, has saidit is committed to meeting demand.,external The vaccine can survive for a further five days once thawed, Pfizer has said, but this does not buy a great deal of extra time. In the longer-term, Public Health England says that in the UK ""national preparations"" are under way regarding both central storage and distribution of the vaccine across the country, but has not given details. As it stands, extreme cold storage is certainly not commonplace, and your local GP is unlikely to have it. Some institutions, such as universities and research labs, do have the right storage capacity. In the UK, universities shared resources at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, including PPE-making equipment and ventilators. How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine?

How does the Pfizer vaccine work?,"The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is one of two being rolled out across the UK. The government aims to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by mid-February and has got off to a strong start, with more than four million jabs administered. The vaccine trains the immune system to fight coronavirus. It is a new type of jab called an RNA vaccine and uses a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack. The genetic material is encased in a tiny protective bubble of fat to get it into cells. The exact ingredients of the vaccine have not been made public, but other vaccines can contain other ingredients, like aluminium, to make them stable or more effective. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? This is the first RNA vaccine to be approved for use in humans. The concept has been researched before and people have been given them in clinical trials for other diseases. The vaccine will be considered by regulatory agencies around the world, who will decide whether the jab can be approved for use. NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, and the over 80s are first in line to receive the two vaccines being rolled out in the UK - Pfizer and Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab. About half of over-80s in the UK have now been vaccinated. People in England in their 70s, and those listed as clinically extremely vulnerable, are now beginning to receiving their offers of a jab. Out of the nine priority groups, those aged 50-54 are at the bottom of the current list. There will be a second phase, which will offer the vaccine to the other groups in the population. The vaccine was initially delivered in hospitals. It is now also being administered through GPs and care homes, as well as local vaccination centres in venues such as sports halls andmass vaccination hubsin places like cathedrals and sports halls. However, there are logistical challenges for the Pfizer vaccine: It must be keptat -70C during transportation The jab must be thawed before it is given to a patient It can be stored in a normal fridge for a few days before being used How do the Covid vaccines compare? It is impossible to know and we will find out only by waiting. If immunity does not last then it may be necessary to have annual vaccines, as we do for flu. The vaccine appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old and data from its phase three trial suggestsit works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities. Early evidencesuggests the Pfizer vaccine is likely to protect against a coronavirus variant that is spreading around the UK. Some people - such as those with a weak immune system - will not be able to have the vaccine. Nothing in medicine is 100% safe - even something we take without thinking, like paracetamol, poses risks. The data so far is reassuring - trials on 43,500 people discovered no safety concerns, although mild side effects, such as headaches and muscle aches, have been reported. If there were highly dangerous and common consequences of this vaccination, they should have become apparent. However, rarer side effects may emerge as millions of people are immunised. Hopefully yes, but not for some time. If enough people are immune then the virus would stop spreading and we would not need other measures. However, the manufacture and distribution of a vaccine will take some time. So testing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing are going to be a feature of our lives for a while yet. The vaccine has been designed and developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, and they own the intellectual property. They already have the manufacturing capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of this year, but could partner with others to increase capacity even further. We do not know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or just stops you from getting ill. We also don't know how protective the vaccine is in different age groups. These will be crucial for understanding how it will be used. About a dozen vaccines are in the final development stages. The Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab is also being used in the UK, and supplies of the approved Moderna vaccine should arrive in the spring.

How do the Covid vaccines compare?,"Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. A range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. The restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are ""the"" exit strategy from the pandemic. The three vaccine frontrunners are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. All three are supposed to be given as two doses. When will I get my Covid jab? How many people have been vaccinated in the UK so far? A single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now beenapproved for use in the UK. Twenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year. Because only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year. Another jab,Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators. It uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according tolate stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised. The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death. What do we know about China's coronavirus vaccines? What we know about India's coronavirus vaccines Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid. Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored inchallenge trialswhere people are deliberately infected with the virus. What drugs can help treat coronavirus? New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first ""real-world"" data on the new variants. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target. We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.

Some students not back until February next termUniversities in England will have a staggered start to the new term after Christmas.Family & Education,"Students have been taking Covid tests this week ahead of leaving for Christmas Students will have staggered starting dates for returning to universities in England after Christmas - with some not back until 7 February. The government's plan will mean students taking hands-on courses such as medicine or performing arts returning from 4 to 18 January. Other subjects would be taught online at the start of term, with students back between 25 January and 7 February. Students are being promised Covid tests when they return next term. It means some students heading home in the next few days will not be in university again for nine weeks. The National Union of Students said students would still have to pay rent on ""properties they are being told not to live in"". The plan, to avoid a surge of students and the risk of spreading coronavirus, will see a staggered return for students over five weeks in the new year - with most courses starting online before a return to in-person teaching. Mass testing for students gets underway in universities Two Covid tests for students and then leave in 24 hours Testing for Christmas holidays to start from 30 November The first students returning will be for practical courses which are difficult to teach solely online - which will include medicine, nursing and dentistry; sciences which need to use laboratories; or music, dance and drama. Courses are going to be online at the start of next term for many students Those starting later will include subjects such as English literature, history and maths. Students will be offered two lateral-flow Covid tests when they arrive back - similar to the process for their departure. ""This planâ¯willâ¯enable a safer returnâ¯forâ¯all students,"" Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said, who also announced a Â£20m student hardship fund. The UCU lecturers' union, which has called for teaching to be online to avoid the spread of infection, said the plan for a delayed start to in-person teaching was a ""step forward"". Vanessa Wilson, leader of the University Alliance group, welcomed the ""clarity"" about next term - and also the recognition that campus facilities would have to be kept open for students not going home at Christmas. Emma Hardy, Labour's shadow universities minister, said ""the delay in providing this guidance has caused huge, unnecessary stress for students and universities"". The arrangements have been announced on the eve of students being able to return home for Christmas - with the ""travel window"" for students opening on Thursday. Louis will be part of the logistical challenge to get students home this week Louis Chambers, a first year studying geology at the University of Hull, will be among the students heading home this week. HIs parents are coming to take him back to Norfolk - and the university is running a system of one-hour slots for students to be collected, which he says will mean ""not so many leaving at once"". ""It will be a relief to get back home,"" he says, as he has been able to see his family only once this term, because of Covid restrictions. But he thinks the Covid testing and ""travel window"" have been uncomplicated so far - and he has enjoyed his first term. And many students will already have left. Out of the six in Louis's flat, he says, three have already gone home. The ""window"" for students to travel home begins on Thursday University of Hull student services director Anji Gardiner has been organising the staggered departures through the Christmas ""travel window"". As well as slots for those being collected by car - which run from 07:00 to 20:00 - there are coaches being laid on and a booking system for the limited capacity on trains, with the numbers travelling spread out across the week. ""We want to keep it safe - we didn't want a logjam of people trying to get home,"" Dr Gardiner says. The mass Covid testing of students began in universities on Monday - with temporary testing centres set up in sports halls and in rooms on campus. Before leaving for Christmas, students have been encouraged to have two tests three days apart - and to travel within 24 hours of receiving a second negative test result. The ""travel window"", in which students are expected to move out of university, will run from 3 to 9 December. In England, about 1.2 million students will be travelling from a university to a home address in another part of the country, including: 235,000 leaving the South East 217,000 leaving London 126,000 leaving the East Midlands 122,000 leaving the West Midlands 119,000 leaving the North West 110,000 leaving the South West 88,000 leaving the East 64,000 leaving the North East Universities UK welcomed the plans for more testing for students when they returned after Christmas. ""The high demand for tests from students shows they understand the important role testing can play in keeping themselves and their communities safe,"" said a spokesman.

"Bomb attack stewards 'not trained properly'Stewards on duty on the night of the Manchester bombing were ""hardly briefed"", an inquiry hears.Manchester","Col Richard Latham said it was ""a managerial fault"" that two stewards failed to report concerns Stewards on duty on the night of the Manchester bombing did not think Salman Abedi was a threat because they had not been trained properly, a security expert has told the attack inquiry. Col Richard Latham said ""a managerial fault"" meant Showsec staff Kyle Lawler and Mohammed Agha failed to respond to suspicious behaviour. They were ""hardly briefed"", he said. The inquiry heard lives could have been saved if security had been quicker to shut the doors of the foyer. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more were injured as they left an Ariana Grande concert when Abedi detonated a bomb on 22 May 2017. Col Latham and his colleague Dr David BaMaung said if Mr Lawler and Mr Agha had ""properly communicated"" concerns over Abedi there would have been time to close the doors before the concert ended. Dr BaMaung said: ""Irrespective of how quickly we could close the arena doors, realistically if he was going to detonate, people would die that night. ""But the potential would be if the procedure had been quickly, the casualties and deaths would have been less."" The inquiry has previously heard how a member of the public reported suspicions about Abedi to Mr Aghar at 22:15 BST. He then alerted Mr Lawler to the report and the pair observed him. Abedi left his position at the back of the City Room, a CCTV ""blind spot"", to detonate his device at 22:31.

They should have been ""clearly told in meetings about what to do if a member of the public informed them about suspicious behaviour"", he said. He added: ""They are doing a job they've never done before and one they are hardly briefed upon and aren't given written notes. That is more than a supervisor's fault, that is a managerial fault."" He said the ""major factors"" were the two security stewards ""did not think that Salman Abedi was actually much of a threat"". He said he thought Mr Lawler was also concerned about ""being criticised for escalating something which was not a real problem"" and of being accused of racial profiling. The court heard the experts concluded there was no proper risk assessment of the terrorist threat by SMG, Showsec or British Transport Police and no effective system for identifying hostile reconnaissance. They said there was a failure to understand the need to check the area where Abedi hid, and insufficient monitoring of CCTV systems. Dr David BaMaung said fewer lives could have been lost if the doors had been closed quickly They also said there was an inadequate policing response by British Transport Police, particularly because there was no officer in the foyer when people were leaving the concert. Patrick Gibbs QC, representing British Transport Police, asked the security experts whether an email from Sgt Gareth Wilson - which instructed officers on duty at the arena that night about what they should do during their shift - was close to a ""model briefing"". Both experts disagreed. Dr BaMaung told the court he felt the email briefing had been sufficient up to the point at which it was realised the most senior officer on duty was not going to get to the arena as planned. He said he felt Sgt Wilson should have been ""more specific"" in the information he gave to officers. Dr BaMaung said: ""I would class that as a pretty large event and if I was a sergeant I would brief the individuals, I wouldn't just leave it up to a group to work out amongst themselves what they wanted to do."" Col Latham also told the inquiry there were ""missed opportunities"" to spot Abedi on the night of the bombing including him carrying a very heavy backpack affecting his gait and being overdressed for the weather.

Bomb attack stewards 'not trained properly',"Col Richard Latham said it was ""a managerial fault"" that two stewards failed to report concerns Stewards on duty on the night of the Manchester bombing did not think Salman Abedi was a threat because they had not been trained properly, a security expert has told the attack inquiry. Col Richard Latham said ""a managerial fault"" meant Showsec staff Kyle Lawler and Mohammed Agha failed to respond to suspicious behaviour. They were ""hardly briefed"", he said. The inquiry heard lives could have been saved if security had been quicker to shut the doors of the foyer. Twenty-two people were killed and hundreds more were injured as they left an Ariana Grande concert when Abedi detonated a bomb on 22 May 2017. Col Latham and his colleague Dr David BaMaung said if Mr Lawler and Mr Agha had ""properly communicated"" concerns over Abedi there would have been time to close the doors before the concert ended. Dr BaMaung said: ""Irrespective of how quickly we could close the arena doors, realistically if he was going to detonate, people would die that night. ""But the potential would be if the procedure had been quickly, the casualties and deaths would have been less."" The inquiry has previously heard how a member of the public reported suspicions about Abedi to Mr Aghar at 22:15 BST. He then alerted Mr Lawler to the report and the pair observed him.

Border checks to stop French skiing abroadSwiss ski resorts are open and Prime Minister Jean Castex says he wants to stop people going.Europe,"Swiss ski resorts are open but France's prime minister wants to stop compatriots going there Random border checks will be imposed to stop French holidaymakers going to ski in neighbouring Switzerland, Prime Minister Jean Castex has said. France, in common with Germany and Italy, is shutting its ski lifts over Christmas to stop the spread of Covid-19, but Swiss slopes are already open. The ski season at Christmas and the New Year is a vital part of the economy for many European countries Mr Castex said it was his duty to protect fellow citizens. ""The conclusion you need to make is that 'I'm not going to Switzerland',"" he told BFMTV on Wednesday, adding that anyone who did go would face quarantine on their return. Several EU leaders have tried to co-ordinate plans ahead of Christmas. However, Switzerland is not part of the European Union, and Austria and Spain are keen not to shut their slopes entirely. The mayor of ChÃ¢tel has draped Swiss flags from the town hall to protest against the French crackdown That has left one French town hall on the Swiss border draping Swiss flags from its windows in protest at the French decision not to allow the ski lifts to run. ChÃ¢tel is among a number of resorts on both sides of the border that make up the Portes du Soleil ski area. Mayor Nicolas Rubin accused French leaders of failing to listen and consult. ""We've got a problem with the French government which shuts the slopes a month before Christmas while our Swiss neighbours keep theirs open,"" he told French radio. In Switzerland itself the situation is still unfolding. Alpine resorts want to minimise restrictions but the government will decide on Friday whether to impose a limit on visitors. Austria on Wednesday announced that skiing would be allowed from 24 December. However, Austrian hotels will stay closed until 7 January and quarantine requirements for people from countries with more than 100 cases per 100,000 - which include Germany and Italy - are likely to severely restrict visits from abroad. Other EU countries are expected to set out their Covid plans for the coming weeks: Italy is aiming to limit travel between regions and also between municipalities over the Christmas and New Year break. Last week Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said: ""It's not possible to allow holidays on the snow, we can't afford it"" Germany has already joined France in calling for a holiday ban on ski tourism But Spain is trying to reach an agreement on measures for its autonomous regions to be able to open safely over the festive period. Germany seeks EU deal to close ski resorts How Europeans are preparing to celebrate Christmas Live updates: 'No corners cut in vaccine approval' ""I'm doing my utmost to appeal to every colleague,"" Jean Castex said. ""The Italian prime minister, the German chancellor and France are working together. The Spaniards and Swiss aren't going along with us, but diplomatic action is under way."" He said his intention was to protect French resorts as well as French citizens from coronavirus, so not only would checks be put in place on the border, but prefects in areas along the border could impose seven-day isolation while Covid testing took place. France is hoping to reopen its ski slopes from 20 January but the prime minister says the aim for the next few weeks is to prevent an influx of visitors over the festive season. Among the most notorious outbreaks during the last ski season was at the Austrian resort of Ischgl, where visitors from as many as 45 countries said they caught coronavirus. Authorities are facing possible compensation claims from thousands of people for failing to act fast enough. 'Momentous' errors in ski resort Covid outbreak Austrian government sued over Covid at ski resorts The World Health Organization says the problem lies not so much in the nature of skiing but in travelling to the ski slopes and in mixing with other skiers afterwards.

Man injured in Craigavon 'pipe bomb explosion',"A resident from the Enniskeen estate described hearing a ""very large bang"" on Tuesday evening A man injured after a pipe bomb partially exploded in Craigavon has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, police have said. The incident happened at about 21:30 GMT in the Enniskeen area on Tuesday. The man suffered non-life threatening injuries to his chest and hands and had to be taken to hospital for treatment. A number of homes were evacuated, but residents have since been allowed to return. Det Insp Simpson said the alert was triggered after police received a report of an explosion at the rear of a house in the estate. ""Upon arrival officers found a man in the vicinity of where the explosion was reported to have occurred being treated by paramedics for injuries received after the device exploded,"" he said. ""The injured man, who has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of an explosive device with intent to endanger life, currently remains in hospital receiving treatment for his injuries which are described as not life threatening."" Remnants of a pipe bomb-type device have been taken away for forensic examination, the officer added. The security alert is now over and police thanked local residents for their patience during the incident. An Enniskeen estate resident described hearing a ""very large bang"" shortly before 21:30 on Tuesday, which he believed was a pipe bomb explosion. He added that a while later, the police helicopter flew over the area. Police at the scene of the incident Upper Bann MP Carla Lockhart told BBC News NI the people of Enniskeen had been subjected to attacks for quite some time and did not want them to continue. Ms Lockhart described the explosion as ""a very worrying development"". The Democratic Unionist Party politician praised St Saviour's Church for providing shelter to people whose homes were evacuated and called on anyone with information about the attack to contact police. ""Obviously information is key to answering all the questions as to what happened in Enniskeen,"" she said. ""Those who cause hurt and disruption in our communities must be brought to justice."" Local representatives said the Enniskeen estate was a ""close-knit community"" SDLP councillor Thomas Larkham said: ""This is the last thing that anyone in Enniskeen wants or needs. ""This is a close-knit community full of people trying to get on with their lives during a difficult time for us all."" Alliance Party councillor EÃ³in Tennyson said: ""The patience of residents who have had to leave their homes as police work to make the area safe is greatly appreciated. ""Those behind this have nothing to offer only misery and destruction."" Mr Tennyson added: ""These kinds of devices have no place in our streets, there's no support in the community for this kind of activity. ""I would utterly condemn those responsible, they've been reckless in their behaviour and have shown total disregard for local residents.""

"BonmarchÃ© collapses into administrationMore than 1,500 jobs are at risk following the collapse of the women's fashion chain.BusinessComments","Women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ© has fallen into administration, putting more than 1,500 jobs at risk. BonmarchÃ©, which has 225 stores around the country, was owned by retail tycoon Philip Day. His other chains -Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Peacocks and Ponden Home stores- collapsed into administration last month. Administrators said the stores would continue to trade while options for the business were explored. Damian Webb and Gordon Thomson of RSM Restructuring Advisory have been appointed as joint administrators of the firm, known as BM Retail Limited. Debenhams set to close putting 12,000 jobs at risk Mr Webb said: ""BonmarchÃ© remains an attractive brand with a loyal customer base. It is our intention to continue to trade whilst working closely with management to explore the options for the business. ""We will shortly be marketing the business for sale and based on the interest to date, we anticipate there will be a number of interested parties."" Yorkshire-based BonmarchÃ© specialises in clothing for the over-50s. It has been in and out of administration before, most recently in October last year, butit was rescued a month later. This is the third time BonmarchÃ©'s been in administration. It had a 3,800-strong workforce back in 2012 before it collapsed and was then bought by a private equity firm. 160 stores closed and 1,400 job losses followed. The chain was floated on the stock exchange in 2013. But in recent years it's continued to struggle. Philip Day built up a stake last year and then went on to buy the rest of it in a Â£5.7m deal, only for it to fall into administration a few months later. He then went on to buy it back in what's known as a pre-pack deal. That allowed him to cut costs and reduce the number of stores. It also left suppliers out of pocket. Don't expect Philip to ride to the rescue again this time, said one source. Today's news means his retail empire has now completely collapsed. The collapse of the chain adds to a grim week for the High Street, afterDebenhams announced all its stores were set to close for goodandTopshop owner Arcadia fell into administration. Those two firms employ 25,000 people between them. In both cases, tough trading conditions and long-standing difficulties have been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, which forced stores to close for lengthy periods during 2020. And there is no end in sight for the uncertainty faced by retailers. Consumer confidence is expected to remain fragile into next year, amid fears that unemployment is set to rise as Covid continues to take its toll on the economy. Retail analyst Kate Hardcastle told the BBC it was a mistake to think that BonmarchÃ© and other troubled retailers were suffering purely because they had lagged behind on their online offer. She said BonmarchÃ© had shown ""disrespect"" towards its target market of older women by failing to engage with them and taking a traditional view of retail that no longer applied. ""It was led by a team that did not understand and reflect that their customers had changed and it did not move with them,"" she said. ""These are smart, sophisticated women. They're not your pearls-and-twinset customer. ""You can't just sell stuff to people any more. You have to embrace the way that 50-plus women live their life.""

Flaw allowed iPhone hacking remotely through wi-fi,"Ian Beer demonstrated the hack in a YouTube video Researchers have revealed a flaw that allowed Apple iPhones to be hacked from afar without the owner doing anything. Usually, smartphone hacks rely on user error - by clicking on a suspicious link, opening a message or downloading a malicious app - to gain control. But Google Project Zero researcher Ian Beer has revealed how attackers could steal emails, photos, messages - and even access the camera and microphone. Apple fixed the issue in May. And all up-to-date devices are secure. The hack was possible because Apple's devices use a technology called Apple Wireless Direct Link. This uses wi-fi to allow users to send files and photos over Apple's AirDrop technology and easily share screens with other iOS devices. Mr Beer exploited this network to show how hackers could gain access to a device from a distance. In a blog post,external, he explained how he was able to complete the hack, which he spent six months investigating. He found no evidence the vulnerability had been ""exploited in the wild"", although said some people tweeted when the bug was fixed in May. ""As we all pour more and more of our souls into these devices, an attacker can gain a treasure trove of information on an unsuspecting target,"" he said. Apple has not yet responded to a BBC News request for comment. Prof Daniel Dresner, cyber security expert at the University of Manchester, said the lack of known exploitation was reassuring, as was the quick reactions of those involved in detection and remediation. ""It's significant given how new services could be exploited, as devices become more connected,"" he said. ""As phones seem to be the pivot point of always-on online living, they are rich pickings for finding these vulnerabilities to exploit."" ""This showed you didn't have to be very close at all to the phone to hack it,"" Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey, said. ""It's a very simple hack. You don't even really have to understand what's going on inside the device to be able to remove a considerable amount of data from it."" Last year, Mr Beer revealed a ""sustained effort""to hack iPhones, using booby-trapped websites, said to have been visited thousands of times per week. Once on an iPhone, the implant could access an enormous amount of data, including (though not limited to) contacts, images and global-positioning-system (GPS) location data, and relay it to an external server every 60 seconds. In response,Apple accused Google of fear-mongering, as the investigation had been published six months after it had fixed the issues. However, it is common practice for responsible security researchers not to publish their findings until after a company has been given the chance to fix a flaw. This video can not be played Cyber-security researchers show off how they have ""fooled"" the iPhone X's Face ID system Another Apple flaw was alsorevealed in March by mobile security company ZecOps. Their research said a bug in the Mail app had made devices susceptible to sophisticated attacks. At the time, an Apple representative told Reuters news agency a fix would be included in upcoming software updates. Google's Android devices have also previously had vulnerabilities revealed. Watchdog Which? suggested more than a billion Android devices were at risk of being hackedbecause they were no longer protected by security updates. Anyone using an Android phone released in 2012 or earlier should be especially concerned, it said.

Humans waging 'suicidal war' on nature - UN chief,"This video can not be played United Nations chief Antonio Guterres issues a stark warning to world leaders about the state of the planet ""Our planet is broken,"" the Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, has warned. Humanity is waging what he describes as a ""suicidal"" war on the natural world. ""Nature always strikes back, and is doing so with gathering force and fury,"" he told a BBC special event on the environment. Mr Guterres wants to put tackling climate change at the heart of the UN's global mission. In a speech entitled State of the Planet, he announced that its ""central objective"" next year will be to build a global coalition around the need to reduce emissions to net zero. Net zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and balancing any further releases by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. Mr Guterres said that every country, city, financial institution and company ""should adopt plans for a transition to net zero emissions by 2050"". In his view, they will also need to take decisive action now to put themselves on the path towards achieving this vision. The objective, said the UN secretary general, will be to cut global emissions by 45% by 2030 compared with 2010 levels. Has the world started to take climate change fight seriously? 'Earthshot': William and Attenborough launch prize to save planet You've got cheap data, how about cheap power too? Here's what Mr Guterres demanded the nations of the world do: Put a price on carbon Phase out fossil fuel finance and end fossil fuel subsidies Shift the tax burden from income to carbon, and from tax payers to polluters Integrate the goal of carbon neutrality (a similar concept to net zero) into all economic and fiscal policies and decisions Help those around the world who are already facing the dire impacts of climate change Our war on the natural world will come back to haunt us, says Mr Guterres It is an ambitious agenda, as Mr Guterres acknowledged, but he said that radical action is needed now. ""The science is clear,"" Mr Guterres told the BBC, ""unless the world cuts fossil fuel production by 6% every year between now and 2030, things will get worse. Much worse."" This video can not be played Is it possible to reverse the climate crisis? The BBC's Justin Rowlatt explains Climate policies have yet to rise to the challenge, the UN chief said, adding that ""without concerted action, we may be headed for a catastrophic three to five-degree temperature rise this century"". The impact is already being felt around the world. ""Apocalyptic fires and floods, cyclones and hurricanes are the new normal,"" he warned. ""Biodiversity is collapsing. Deserts are spreading. Oceans are choking with plastic waste."" Mr Guterres said the nations of the world must bring ambitious commitments to cut emissions to the international climate conference the UK and Italy are hosting in Glasgow in November next year. As well as pressing for action on the climate crisis, he urged nations to tackle the extinction crisis that is destroying biodiversity and to step up efforts to reduce pollution. We face, he said, a ""moment of truth"". But he does discern some glimmers of hope.

He acknowledged that the European Union, the US, China, Japan, South Korea and more than 110 other countries have committed to become carbon neutral by the middle of this century. He said he wants to see this momentum turned into a movement. Technology will help us to reach these targets, Mr Guterres said he believes. Technology could help forge a more sustainable path, says Antonio Guterres ""The coal business is going up in smoke,"" because it costs more to run most of today's coal plants than it does to build new renewable plants from scratch, he told the BBC. ""We must forge a safer, more sustainable and equitable path"", the UN chief concluded. He said it is time for this war against the planet to end, adding: ""We must declare a permanent ceasefire and reconcile with nature.""

NHS Covid-19 and Zoom top iPhone's 2020 app charts,"The NHS Covid-19 app was launched on 24 September Apple has revealed the NHS Covid-19 app was the second most downloaded iPhone product on its App Store in the UK this year. Only the video chat app Zoom was installed more times. TikTok came third. The contact-tracing app's achievement is notable given it only launched about two months ago and is solely targeted at users based in England and Wales. The iPhone is the UK's best-selling smartphone brand. However, more people use Android. The BBC has asked Google where the government's app appears on its own Play Store's rankings. As of 18 November, the NHS Covid-19 app has been downloaded 20,056,685 times across both platforms,according to the government's latest figures,external. The BBC has asked how many users have subsequently deleted it. However, the Department of Health and Social Care has declined to provide the information at this time. Researchers at Oxford University initiallysaid that 80% of UK smartphone owners would need to use the appto halt the pandemic rather than just slow it. But in a follow-up paper they produced evidence that the number of hospital admissions and deathscould be ""meaningfully reduced"" at a much lower level of uptake,external. One issue that has deterred some people from using it has been that those on low incomes do not currently qualify for a support payment if the app tells them to self-isolate. This contrasts with the Â£500 grant they can apply for if they are told to stay at home by human contact-tracers. However, the BBC has learned that the app will soon generate a unique code that willmake it possible to apply for a corresponding payment via an external website.

Brain test: Tricky Puzzles Subway Surfers Roblox Woodturning 3D The pandemic also had an impact on the UK edition of TikTok's end-of-year review. It said the biggest trend was #blindinglights - a dance challenge that became popular at the start of the first lockdown, featuring NHS workers and families moving to The Weeknd's Blinding Lights track. Many key workers posted videos of themselves dancing to the #blindinglights challenge This was followed by #isolationgames, a challenge organised in partnership with Team GB for users to perform  sporting activities at home, to help make up for the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics. Download numbers for the NHS Covid-19 app look good, and compare well with those for similar contact-tracing apps in other countries. But we are still missing out on some key data which would tell us how well it is working. We need to know how many people have deleted the app and - the key number - how many users have received notifications to go into isolation because they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus. The nature of the Google-Apple system underlying the app means only limited data is available to the government. But there should be some information which would illustrate how effective the app has been over the last two months in its core mission of contact-tracing. What we won't know is how many people have obeyed instructions to self-isolate. NHS Covid-19 app to gain self-isolation payments Is the UK's NHS Covid-19 app too private?

Tesco to repay rates relief after payout backlashThe move comes after Tesco was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders.BusinessComments,"Tesco and Morrisons will together hand back more than Â£850m worth of business rates relief they received as support during the coronavirus crisis. Tesco said it would repay Â£585m after it was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders. Morrisons subsequently announced it had ""brought forward"" a decision on rates relief and would pay back Â£274m. Tesco said the help to retailers had been a ""game-changer"" and hugely important at the time. But it added that its business had proven ""resilient"" and it had now decided to return the money in full. ""We will work with the UK government and devolved administrations on the best means of doing that,"" it said. In October, Tesco defended paying a Â£315m dividend to shareholders after reporting a 29% increase in profits for the first half of the year. Finance chief Alan Stewart told reporters it was the right policy. Meanwhile, Morrisons said it would announce its dividend when it knows how much it has made this year. Commenting on the decision to pay back the rates relief, Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said the supermarket chain had ""done its best work"" to meet the ""enormous challenges"" the pandemic had brought. ""We are grateful for the government's swift action at the start of the pandemic which enabled the whole sector to face squarely into the challenges and disruption caused by Covid-19,"" he said. Business rates relief was extended to all retailers as part of a package of measures announced in March. Tesco profits surge as online orders double In March, Tesco was accused of ""whipping up a huge lobbying operation"" against a decision not to give its biggest stores in Wales financial help. The Welsh government changed its mind and decided to grant business rate relief to all retail, hospitality and leisure firms. Tesco is understood to have asked the Welsh government for an explanation of its thinking rather than a change in policy. ""The decision to repay business rates relief is one for individual companies to consider for themselves,"" said Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium. ""Many have used this money to cover increased costs as a result of Covid - hiring extra staff and making significant investment in the safety and protection of their premises. As such, there are many firms who simply cannot afford to repay this government relief."" While most of the public focus has - for obvious reasons - been on the furlough scheme, the business rates holiday for retailers and hospitality companies has been one of the main ways the government has tried to keep alive the companies most affected by pandemic closures. Like all coronavirus schemes, however, the rates relief was a blunt instrument - it went also to retailers who have stayed open throughout. When those retailers decided to pay dividends to shareholders, there was an understandable outcry. Tesco was the object of most opprobrium; it said it would pay Â£315m to investors after reporting that pandemic trading had been buoyant. Directors at the supermarket chain have obviously read the headlines. The company said it would repay the Â£585m it has had so far this year in business rates relief, while pointing out in passing that it estimated the pandemic had brought it Â£725m in additional costs. The question now is whether other essential retailers - especially the big grocery chains such as Sainsbury's and Asda - will follow Tesco's lead. It would be surprising if they did not. And while the repayments might appear like a public-spirited move, bear in mind the board may have had other motivations: in particular, a desire not to have the public support they have received hanging over them and preventing them from exercising their normal commercial judgement in paying dividends, approving bonuses and making deals. Tesco said the money meant that it had had the immediate confidence, in the face of significant uncertainty, to invest in colleagues and support its customers and suppliers. ""Every penny of the rates relief we have received has been spent on our response to the pandemic. Our latest estimate at our interim results in October was that Covid would cost Tesco [about] Â£725m this year - well in excess of the Â£585m rates relief received. ""Ten months into the pandemic, our business has proven resilient in the most challenging of circumstances. While all businesses have been impacted - many severely so - we have been able to continue trading throughout, serving many millions of customers every day and although uncertainties still exist, some of the potential risks faced earlier in the year are now behind us."" Chief executive Ken Murphy said: ""Giving this money back to the public is absolutely the right thing to do by our customers, colleagues and all of our stakeholders.""

Otters find 'fairytale' love in lockdownThe pair were brought together in Scarborough after both losing their partners.Cornwall,"Harris moved from Gweek in Cornwall to Sea Life Scarborough to be with Pumpkin Two otters have found love in lockdown after losing their former partners. Harris from the Cornish Seal Sanctuary, whose partner died four years ago, moved to Sea Life in Scarborough to be with Pumpkin. She was lonely after losing her elderly partner Eric and her animal care team hoped a new male otter would cheer her up. Tamara Cooper, curator at the Cornish Seal Sanctuary, said it was ""the perfect fairytale ending"". Both otters lost their partners prior to being put on an otter dating website To ensure the best chance of success for a new pairing of Asian short clawed otters, it is best to introduce a new male into a female's territory so that the male more easily submits to the female on first meeting. Sea Life Scarborough said things were going ""swimmingly"" and the otters had enjoyed a series of dates. The curator at the sanctuary in Scarborough, Todd German, said: ""We are delighted to report that not only is Pumpkin happy once again, but Harris has settled in extremely well."" When Pumpkin started to show signs of loneliness, the sanctuary in Scarborough reached out to fellow otter sanctuaries to see if there were any otters feeling the same. The curators at the Cornwall and Scarborough sanctuaries spoke and checked the otters' temperaments would be compatible, before deciding to move Harris. The otters have now moved into their new home together, where visitors to the sanctuary can see the happy couple.

Thanks for joining us, we'll be back in the morning to bring you more updates. Today's coverage has been brought to you by: Marie Jackson, Becky Morton, Joshua Cheetham, Katie Wright, Jennifer Scott, Sean Fanning, Claire Heald and Suzanne Leigh. Our live coverage will be coming to a close shortly, on a day which has been dominated by the news that a vaccine will begin being rolled out in the UK next week. Here is a round-up of the main developments: Prof
Peter Openshaw, a government adviser and medical expert at Imperial College
London, said people should beware fake news and rumours about the safety of the
vaccine. He
told the BBC: ""If people do not want to have it that is completely up to
them."" He
added: ""I really believe it is a safe way to get vaccinated and
protected."" The
UK's regulator, the MHRA, says all of the vital checks and measures have been
done and no corners have been cut, meaning the jab is safe to recommend. A
snap poll by YouGov of 5,321 British adults suggests the majority of the public
is confident about the vaccine. Reality Check There have been claims that Brexit allowed the UK to approve a vaccine more quickly than the EU, but is that correct? The EU - through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - has yet to approve a coronavirus vaccine. But the idea that Brexit enabled the UK to press ahead and authorise one is not right. Under European law a vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but individual countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine for temporary use in their domestic market. Britain is still subject to those EU rules during the post-Brexit transition period which runs until the end of the year. The UK's own medicines regulator, the MHRA, confirmed this ina statement last month,external. And its chief executive, Dr June Raine, said today that ""we have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January"". It is true that, in general, regulation of new medicines is done on an EU-wide basis. But that does not take account of the emergency provisions in EU law which Dr Raine refers to.

But as clubs in certain areas of England open their turnstiles for the first time in almost nine months, a BBC Sport poll suggestsfans are dividedover whether they should be allowed to return before a Covid-19 vaccine is rolled out. In a Savanta ComRes poll of 2,100 football fans, 52% said they should be allowed to return to watch matches in person before a vaccine is available, while 45% said they should not. The poll also shows:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Students will have staggered starting dates for returning to universities in England after Christmas- with some not back until 7 February. The government's plan would see students on hands-on, practical courses such as medicine going back from 4 to 18 January. Other subjects would be taught online until face-to-face teaching begins between 25 January and 7 February. Students are being promised Covid tests when they return to university next term. The plan, to avoid a surge of students and the risk of spreading coronavirus, will mean a staggered return for students over five weeks in the new year - with most courses starting online before a return to in-person teaching. Students will be offered two lateral flow Covid tests when they arrive back - similar to the process for their departure. The arrangements for next term have been announced on the eve of students being able to return home for Christmas. Labour's leader is calling for all parties to work together over the rollout of the vaccine. Speaking after the Downing Street press conference, Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""really important... whatever our political party, [we] work together to make sure that the rollout is
swift, safe and fair, and the people have confidence in it"". He says he has asked Boris Johnson to share No 10's plan for communicating the rollout. Sir Keir added: ""Then we will work
together so that the public can see cross-party consensus on this. ""This
rollout is one of the biggest logistical exercises since the Second World War. We need the best of Britain, we need parties pulling together, and I'm very
happy to put my party behind that effort."" The UK prime minister's press conference has just come to an end. So what did we learn from Boris Johnson, Simon Stevens and Jonathan Van-Tam? Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent ""It may be a
good thing, but on the other hand..."" The prime minister
doesn't seem very impressed with Jonathan Van-Tam's claim that coronavirus
safety measures may be with us long term. Boris Johnson
looked a bit baffled and says people want to reclaim their lives. ""I didn't mean
to challenge you,"" he says before the deputy chief medical officer then
clarifies his point that he hopes we'll get back to a much more
normal world as soon as possible. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the big unknowns about this vaccine â and the
others being developed â is whether it prevents transmission. It is possible that people who are vaccinated can still
pass on the virus to others. It will take time to establish to what extent this is
stopped. If it does stop transmission, once you have about 2/3 of
the population vaccinated it is possible you then reach herd immunity and the
virus stops spreading completely. But even if that doesnât happen, vaccinating all over 65s
- 12m people - will have a major impact on deaths. More than 90% of people who
have died have been over that age. That in itself would be enough to lead to significant
lifting of restrictions. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter The Pfizer vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective
at stopping people from becoming ill from the virus â the first priority for
getting life back to normal. But we donât yet know whether this vaccine stops people
spreading the virus. Both deputy chief medical officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam and NHS England head Simon Stevens stressed this point during todayâs
briefing. They are âvery hopefulâ it will also stop vaccinated people
from spreading the virus to others. And thereâs good precedent for this â the flu and MMR
(measles, mumps and rubella) jabs both stop vaccinated people from infecting
others. But for now, Van-Tam says, you canât watch others get it (the jab) and hope it will protect you. He encouraged everyone who is invited to be given the
vaccine to take up this opportunity, adding that low take-up of the vaccine will
âalmost certainly make restrictions last longerâ. In the final question, Van-Tam is asked if he can envisage a world where we can cast aside our masks and hand sanitiser for good. The deputy chief medical officer says he doesn't think we will eradicate coronavirus ""ever"", adding: ""It will be with humankind forever"". He also thinks it may become ""a seasonal problem"", like flu. ""Do I think there will be a big moment where we have a big party and throw off our masks? No I don't,"" says Van-Tam. Instead, he thinks the ""personal habit"" may carry on for some years, even if the government doesn't insist on the measures. And asked about the MPs that rebelled against the new tier system, the PM concludes the press conference saying: ""I totally understand people's frustrations with the tiering system. ""But we will make sure we are as local and as sensitive as we can possibly be [on restrictions]."" Asked whether the current coronavirus restrictions could be ended
early, the prime minister says the vaccine news âfor now makes absolutely no
differenceâ. However, he adds that there will come a moment to relax the ânon- pharmaceutical interventionsâ but âweâre not there yetâ. He stresses the moment when it is time to relax the rules is theoretical and there is âweeks,
months of work to goâ before we are in that position. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This is the day we have been waiting for. But it is clear listening to NHS England chief executive
Simon Stevens and deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van Tam that
there are some huge logistical challenges from here on in. First of all, supply. The UK is expecting 800,000 doses
in the next few days. But given there are 15 million people over the age of 65
and working in health and care sectors, and all need two doses, it is clear
getting more into the country is essential. Rollout is also difficult. Through a combination of the
need to keep the vaccine at ultra cold storage and the fact that the jab comes
in batches of 975 that cannot be split up at the moment, immunisation will only
be offered from a network of 50 hospitals to start with. It is why there is still so much hope pinned to the
Oxford University vaccine, that regulators are currently reviewing. That does
not need to be kept in ultra cold storage and so can be distributed much more
easily. Plus there are already millions of doses in the country. Then there is vaccine hesitancy. Officials have been at
pains to stress that despite the vaccine being developed in record time the
full testing and regulatory process has been followed. But the more people donât come forward, the longer
restrictions have to remain in place. There is a long way to go yet. Next up is a question on the vaccine roll-out again and about what stage it will be right to lift all the restrictions? Stevens says the ""goal"" of the vaccination programme is to ""protect vulnerable individuals"" - hence the graduated list of who will get it when - and to stop people spreading it. But we don't know yet if that vaccine will have the power to stop transmission. Van Tam points to the priority list, working down the ages and at risk groups, saying it is ""not an accident"" they take out 99% of groups linked to Covid related mortality deaths in the UK. Johnson says the reason the UK got the vaccine ahead of other countries is down to the vaccine task force's work. But they are ""global efforts of scientists around the world"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The prime minister
loves a colourful metaphor and so does Jonathan Van-Tam. Boris Johnson began
the briefing by saying science had performed a kind of biological jiu jitsu -
turning the virus on itself to make this vaccine. Soon after the
government's deputy chief medical officer likened it to a train arriving at a
station which people needed to get on and compared the vaccine to a yoghurt,
saying it couldn't be taken in and out of the fridge. Tabloid headline
writers will be able to take their pick. Beth Rigby from Sky News asks whether we should all still
prepare for restrictions to run until April. Boris Johnson says he accepts that the new tier system in
England is âtoughâ but he says the way forward is local restrictions and mass
testing to âkeep the virus under controlâ. He says he hopes places are able âto come down the tiersâ
before Easter, adding that it is necessary to have these measures alongside the
vaccine. Asked whether the PM expects to roll over the tier system at
the start of February, Johnson says the situation will be judged on the data but
âfor the time being youâve got to take it that tiering will be a very, very
important part of our campaign against coronavirus."" The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is the first one in the UK to be approved for use, with hopes people can start receiving the injection within a week. In the video below BBC health correspondent Laura Foster helps explain some of the logistics around how it will be rolled out. This video can not be played The next question is on care home residents, as despite scientists calling for them to get the vaccine first, the government says they may not. Johnson says: ""Of course we want to get it into care homes as fast as we possibly can"". But the issue is in distributing the cases of the vaccine. Each case has 975 vaccines in it, but you cannot currently divide it up, so the government wants to ""avoid wastage"". The PM says they are waiting to hear more, but they ""certainly"" want to get it to ""the most vulnerable"". Van-Tam says remarks about failure on care homes are ""extremely unfair when one considers a new virus emerged less than 12 months ago and we now have our first vaccine"". He adds: ""This is a complex product. It is not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in several times."" Now we turn to questions from journalists, and the BBCâs Fergus
Walsh asks, how important is this moment? Boris Johnson says itâs a âhuge momentâ and he agrees with
Jonathan Van-Tam that itâs also âa very moving thingâ. He says he is âlost in admirationâ for the way scientists can
solve problems. However, he adds that although itâs a fantastic moment, âthe
worst thing now would be to think that this the moment when we can relax our
guard and think that itâs game over"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Why is my area in a higher tier?,"England's new tiers system has started, but many are complaining areas with lower than average rates of infection have been unfairly put in high tiers. In the summer, action was supposed to be hyper-local, sometimes with different rules in the same local authority. But now, tiers have been applied in broad areas, generally matching counties or city regions. And in those larger areas, the case rates were all higher in tier three than in tier two in the week to 19 November. The modellers advising government say working on a broader scale ""may make measures more effective"" since it reduces the chances of people travelling across tier boundaries. The only exception to the ""bigger regions"" approach is Slough. The surrounding parts of Berkshire are all in tier two - but Slough, with a higher rate of infection, has been put into tier three. The price of this approach is low-Covid areas can be swept up into county-wide restrictions. For example, Tunbridge Wells and Ashford, in tier-three Kent, had about 120 cases per 100,000 in the week to 19 November. But most local authorities in England saw more than 180 cases per 100,000 people that week. Thedocument describing the government's rationale for each decision,externallists four factors on top of the main case rates, however: the rate in the over-60s whether rates are rising or falling whether the number of people testing positive is rising faster or slower than the number of people being tested the pressure on hospitals Tunbridge Wells and Ashford have seen rising rates in recent weeks, while the rates in the rest of England have been falling. And with hospitals in Kentalready under pressure, the worry is the high rates of infection in Swale and Medway spread out into the rest of Kent. But many MPs are still unsatisfied with the government's explanations. Conservative MP Damian Green, who represents Ashford, asked the government to apply rules at ""a local level, districts rather than counties or regions"" as ""restrictions which people feel are unfair to their particular community will simply not be respected or obeyed"".

Otters find 'fairytale' love in lockdown,"Harris moved from Gweek in Cornwall to Sea Life Scarborough to be with Pumpkin Two otters have found love in lockdown after losing their former partners. Harris from the Cornish Seal Sanctuary, whose partner died four years ago, moved to Sea Life in Scarborough to be with Pumpkin. She was lonely after losing her elderly partner Eric and her animal care team hoped a new male otter would cheer her up. Tamara Cooper, curator at the Cornish Seal Sanctuary, said it was ""the perfect fairytale ending"". Both otters lost their partners prior to being put on an otter dating website To ensure the best chance of success for a new pairing of Asian short clawed otters, it is best to introduce a new male into a female's territory so that the male more easily submits to the female on first meeting. Sea Life Scarborough said things were going ""swimmingly"" and the otters had enjoyed a series of dates. The curator at the sanctuary in Scarborough, Todd German, said: ""We are delighted to report that not only is Pumpkin happy once again, but Harris has settled in extremely well."" When Pumpkin started to show signs of loneliness, the sanctuary in Scarborough reached out to fellow otter sanctuaries to see if there were any otters feeling the same. The curators at the Cornwall and Scarborough sanctuaries spoke and checked the otters' temperaments would be compatible, before deciding to move Harris. The otters have now moved into their new home together, where visitors to the sanctuary can see the happy couple.

Tesco to repay rates relief after payout backlashThe move comes after Tesco was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders.,"Tesco and Morrisons will together hand back more than Â£850m worth of business rates relief they received as support during the coronavirus crisis. Tesco said it would repay Â£585m after it was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders. Morrisons subsequently announced it had ""brought forward"" a decision on rates relief and would pay back Â£274m. Tesco said the help to retailers had been a ""game-changer"" and hugely important at the time. But it added that its business had proven ""resilient"" and it had now decided to return the money in full. ""We will work with the UK government and devolved administrations on the best means of doing that,"" it said. In October, Tesco defended paying a Â£315m dividend to shareholders after reporting a 29% increase in profits for the first half of the year. Finance chief Alan Stewart told reporters it was the right policy. Meanwhile, Morrisons said it would announce its dividend when it knows how much it has made this year. Commenting on the decision to pay back the rates relief, Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said the supermarket chain had ""done its best work"" to meet the ""enormous challenges"" the pandemic had brought. ""We are grateful for the government's swift action at the start of the pandemic which enabled the whole sector to face squarely into the challenges and disruption caused by Covid-19,"" he said. Business rates relief was extended to all retailers as part of a package of measures announced in March. Tesco profits surge as online orders double In March, Tesco was accused of ""whipping up a huge lobbying operation"" against a decision not to give its biggest stores in Wales financial help. The Welsh government changed its mind and decided to grant business rate relief to all retail, hospitality and leisure firms. Tesco is understood to have asked the Welsh government for an explanation of its thinking rather than a change in policy. ""The decision to repay business rates relief is one for individual companies to consider for themselves,"" said Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium. ""Many have used this money to cover increased costs as a result of Covid - hiring extra staff and making significant investment in the safety and protection of their premises. As such, there are many firms who simply cannot afford to repay this government relief."" While most of the public focus has - for obvious reasons - been on the furlough scheme, the business rates holiday for retailers and hospitality companies has been one of the main ways the government has tried to keep alive the companies most affected by pandemic closures. Like all coronavirus schemes, however, the rates relief was a blunt instrument - it went also to retailers who have stayed open throughout. When those retailers decided to pay dividends to shareholders, there was an understandable outcry. Tesco was the object of most opprobrium; it said it would pay Â£315m to investors after reporting that pandemic trading had been buoyant. Directors at the supermarket chain have obviously read the headlines. The company said it would repay the Â£585m it has had so far this year in business rates relief, while pointing out in passing that it estimated the pandemic had brought it Â£725m in additional costs. The question now is whether other essential retailers - especially the big grocery chains such as Sainsbury's and Asda - will follow Tesco's lead. It would be surprising if they did not. And while the repayments might appear like a public-spirited move, bear in mind the board may have had other motivations: in particular, a desire not to have the public support they have received hanging over them and preventing them from exercising their normal commercial judgement in paying dividends, approving bonuses and making deals. Tesco said the money meant that it had had the immediate confidence, in the face of significant uncertainty, to invest in colleagues and support its customers and suppliers. ""Every penny of the rates relief we have received has been spent on our response to the pandemic. Our latest estimate at our interim results in October was that Covid would cost Tesco [about] Â£725m this year - well in excess of the Â£585m rates relief received. ""Ten months into the pandemic, our business has proven resilient in the most challenging of circumstances. While all businesses have been impacted - many severely so - we have been able to continue trading throughout, serving many millions of customers every day and although uncertainties still exist, some of the potential risks faced earlier in the year are now behind us."" Chief executive Ken Murphy said: ""Giving this money back to the public is absolutely the right thing to do by our customers, colleagues and all of our stakeholders.""

Nike's diversity advert causing a backlash in Japan,"Nike is facing a backlash in Japan over an advert which highlights racial discrimination in the country. The video shows the ""real life experience"" of three young soccer players from mixed heritage. It has about 25 million views on social media and almost 80,000 shares. But it has sparked fierce debate as Japan is unaccustomed to openly discussing sensitive issues such as race, with some questioning whether a foreign brand should have waded in. Nike Japan said the ad highlights how people ""overcome their daily struggles and conflicts to move their future through sports"". Allow YouTube content?

But some comments on social media said Nike was exaggerating the scale of discrimination, arguing that it was unfair to single out Japan. Other users threatened to boycott Nike products. One comment said: ""It's as if they are trying to say this kind of discrimination is everywhere in Japan."" However, there were also positive comments about the ad, entitled The Future Isn't Waiting, for highlighting the issue of racism. ""Many Japanese do not like to be told by outside voices to change their ways,"" said Morley Robertson, a Japanese-American journalist. ""But if a foreigner demonstrates a deep understanding of Japanese culture or Japanese rules, then those same Japanese who would otherwise take offence will gush forth with praise."" Steve McGinnes, the author of Surfing the Asian wave: How to survive and thrive in the new world order, believes the advert is an ""own goal"". ""Endemic racism is going to be a sensitive topic in any culture. But Nike should not think, as a foreign brand, that it is appropriate for them to point it out to their hosts. ""They are crudely putting a spotlight onto a subject that many feel should be off-limits to guests. It's a huge own goal for Nike."" Nike is not the only Western brand to come under fire for not understanding Asian cultures and consumer behaviour. Last year, luxuryFrench brand Dior was criticised for using a map of China that excluded Taiwan. Taiwan has been self-ruled since the 1950s, but Beijing's official policy is that the island is a Chinese province. ""Arrogance and complacency can be the worst enemies for Western brands in Asia, as management teams may underestimate the pride of Asia and local cultures by Asian consumers,"" said Martin Roll, a brand adviser and author on Asian business. ""In 2020, should America or an American brand be taking the high ground on racism and telling the rest of the world what they are doing wrong?"" adds Mr McGinnes. ""Clearly, a lot of Japanese people think they shouldn't."" This video can not be played The guy designing sneakers for NBA stars... and Cristiano Ronaldo However, Mr Morley says Nike did understand the sensitivity of the issue. ""They are telling it from the unique individual's side. Most advertising in Japan skirts around delicate issues like discrimination because someone might feel bad."" But controversy doesn't always lead to a fall in sales, and can actually have the opposite effect. Nike's campaigns in the US featuring Colin Kaepernick, the former NFL quarterback who knelt during the national anthem to protest against racial injustice, saw sales increase. ""Nike's sales will probably go up. Haters will buy their merchandise any way,"" added Mr Robertson.

US 'bribes-for-pardon' inquiry unveiled,"With only a few weeks before Donald Trump leaves the White House, the issue of presidential pardons comes to the fore The US justice department is looking into claims that lobbyists have tried to use bribes to secure a presidential pardon, unsealed court papers show. They say that in August investigators began investigating a ""secret lobbying scheme"" possibly involving attempts to contact White House officials. The redacted filings do not give any names, but the justice department says no government official is being probed. In a tweet, President Trump referred to the investigation as ""fake news"".

It is common for outgoing presidents to use their right to issue pardons, which wipe out convictions. President Trump - who is due to leave office in January, although he is still contesting his election defeat in the courts - has used the procedure a number of times. Last weekhe pardoned his former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI. Meanwhile, US media say Mr Trump has been discussing the possibility of pardoning family members. Are we going to see a blitz of Trump pardons? The White House revolving door: Who's gone? The document released by a federal court in Washington DC on Tuesday relates to a request by the Department of Justice (DOJ) to use emails and other communications seized in a bribery-for-pardon inquiry. The data, prosecutors say in the paper, points to potential ""criminal activity"". This video can not be played Are presidential pardons Trump's secret weapon? They say individuals - whose identities are redacted - appear to have ""acted as lobbyists to senior White House officials without complying with the registration requirements"" for such activity. Their aim, according to the papers, may have been to secure ""a pardon or reprieve of sentence"" for another unidentified individual. According to the documents, prosecutors in August sought a court order ""so that the investigative team [could] access"" the communications and confront the suspects. It is unknown who the people targeted were. On Tuesday the DOJ said: ""No government official was or is currently a subject or target of the investigation disclosed in this filing."" Mr Trump has so far been less enthusiastic in using his right to grant clemency than any of his recent predecessors,according to the Pew Research Center,external. Barack Obama, whom Mr Trump replaced in 2017, granted 212 pardons and 1,715 commutations - the most since President Harry Truman in the 1940s and 1950s. President Trump, by contrast, had granted just 28 pardons and 16 commutations as of late November. Michael Flynn was fired serving as national security adviser for 23 days in 2017 Apart from Michael Flynn - who was convicted in 2017 of lying about his contacts with the Russian ambassador the year before - people pardoned by Mr Trump include political strategistRoger Stone, ex-Arizona sheriffJoe Arpaio, and former vice-presidential aideScooter Libby. A number of Trump allies are reportedly hoping for clemency, including ex-advisers Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos, who were both convicted in the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Profile: Michael Flynn, Trump's ex-adviser US media also say the president is considering issuing pardons for family members - even though none has been accused of any crime. One source told NBC News thatthe suggestion has arisen because the president feels embattled,external- not because he believes that he or any of his relatives are guilty of wrongdoing. The New York Times says Mr Trump appears concerned that under future President Joe Biden,the Democratic administration might target his children,externalDonald Jr, Eric and Ivanka Trump, as well as Ivanka's husband Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser. There are precedents for granting clemency to people who have not been indicted.

'94% effective in over-65s',"The coronavirus vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old. More data released from their continuing phase three trial suggests it works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities. The companies say they will now apply for authorisation for emergency use of the jab in the US. The trial involved 41,000 people worldwide. Half were given the vaccine, and half a placebo. Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech published preliminary data suggestingthe vaccine offered 90% protection against Covid-19and said there were no safety concerns. This was followed by data on a vaccine made byUS company Modernasuggesting nearly 95% protection andsimilarly promising results from trials of another developed in Russia, called Sputnik. Wednesday's data from Pfizer and BioNTech, which builds on last week's data, suggests the vaccine is 95% effective based on 170 cases of Covid-19 developing in volunteers. Just eight were in the group given the vaccine, suggesting it offers good protection. The rest of the cases were in the placebo group given a dummy jab. In older adults, who are most at risk from the virus and have weaker immune systems, the vaccine worked as well as it did in younger people. Scientists said the data was further encouraging news, with Prof Trudie Lang from the University of Oxford describing it as ""a remarkable and very reassuring situation"". ""To go from identifying a new virus to having several vaccines at the point of applying for regulatory approval is an incredible milestone for science,"" she said. Will there be more than one coronavirus vaccine? Is the vaccine safe to take? And other questions Although the full trial data has yet to be published, the companies say there have been no serious safety concerns. But they did notice fatigue in 3.8%  of volunteers given the vaccine and headaches in 2%, both after the second dose, although older people seemed to experience minimal side effects. This video can not be played Coronavirus vaccine: How close are you to getting one? There is also evidence that the vaccine protects against severe Covid - but this is based on only 10 cases. It's still unclear how long protection from the vaccine lasts and if it stops people transmitting the virus. In the trial, 42% of all participants are from diverse ethnic backgrounds and 41% are aged between 56 and 85 years old. More vaccine good news is what we've all been waiting for. This time it's really encouraging to know the Pfizer vaccine seems to work on older people as effectively as in younger ones. But this vaccine is still a long way off widespread use. First, regulators need to be absolutely sure in their own minds that it's safe - not least because Moderna and Pfizer both use an experimental technology that's never been approved before. That process could still take a few weeks. Then there's the massive issue of availability. Pfizer is promising 50 million doses by the end of the year. But remember: it's a two-shot vaccine. Perhaps one of the biggest problems is that wealthy countries have already swooped in to buy up the first batches that will be ready. That's good news for a country such as the UK, but not such good news for developing countries which haven't got the money to place bids. That's why so much hinges on other vaccines such as the Oxford AstraZeneca one, as they may be more scalable, and there are more advanced plans to get it to low- and middle-income countries through a UN-backed project called Covax. The trial, which is testing people at 150 sites in the US, Germany, Turkey, South Africa, Brazil and Argentina, will collect data on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine for another two years. The companies behind it expect to produce up to 50 million doses of the vaccine this year and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. The UK has pre-ordered 40 million doses and should get 10 million by the end of the year. It has also ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, which is planning to release data from its phase three trial soon. There are hundreds of vaccines in development around the world, and about a dozen in the final stages of testing, known as phase three. The first two to show any results - made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna - both use an experimental approach, called mRNA, which involves injecting part of the virus's genetic code into the body to train the immune system. Antibodies and T-cells are then made by the body to fight the coronavirus. The Sputnik vaccine, developed in Russia, has also released early data from phase three based on a smaller number of volunteers and Covid cases. There are some logistical challenges with mRNA vaccines, namely the need to store them at cold temperatures. The Pfizer vaccine must be stored at about minus 80C, although it can be kept in a fridge for five days. Moderna's vaccine needs to be stored at minus 20C for up to six months and kept in a standard fridge for up to a month. Prof Stephen Evans, professor of pharmacoepidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said the full data would have to be submitted to bodies like the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for approval. ""We can expect both agencies to conduct a very careful evaluation and we can rely on their conclusions,"" he said. This process could take several weeks.

Dua Lipa and other Spotify artists' pages hacked,"Dua Lipa and Lana Del Ray were among those whose pages were changed Some of the world's most popular singers have had their Spotify pages defaced by a hacker who posted messages about Donald Trump and Taylor Swift. On Wednesday, artists including Lana Del Rey and Dua Lipa had their biographies replaced by the attacker. The hacker called himself Daniel, and replaced the celebrities' photos with one of himself. The action will be an embarrassment to the platform's security efforts. It is the most popular app of its kind. The attacker also asked people to add him on Snapchat, and added the words ""Trump 2020"". ""Best of all shout out to my queen Taylor Swift,"" he added. On Twitter, users posted images of the changed pages, which also affected artists like Future and Pop Smoke. Spotify biographies had new photos added featuring Snapchat invites Spotify quickly reversed the changes, and the artists' pages appear to have returned to normal. It is not clear how the edits to some of the world's biggest musicians took place. Spotify has a special product available for music publishers and independent artists, called Spotify for Artists, which is what manages band pages and biographies. The tool lets Spotify users ""claim"" a band page or join the artist's team to manage it. But an already-claimed page cannot be claimed again. It can be joined by team members - such as staff on a recording label who have the right login - or through a verification process. Spotify has not publicly said anything about the attack or how it happened, but has been contacted for comment. The problem comes at a busy time for Spotify,which has just announced the year's most-streamed tracksand when users are exploring their annual ""Wrapped"" playlists of their most-played tracks. Dua Lipa - one of the artists who had their profile defaced - clocked in at the fifth-most streamed song of the year worldwide, with Don't Start Now.

What jobs are available at the moment?,"Job vacancies are at a record high, rising to 1.17 million in the three months to October. Latest figures also show the number of workers on payrolls jumped by 160,000 in October, despite the end of the furlough scheme. Workers call the shots as job vacancies boom According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), there were 388,000 more vacancies in this period (August to October 2021) than the three months immediately before the pandemic (January-March 2020), with record highs in 15 of its 18 sector categories. Health The health sector had the most vacancies between July and September with 183,000. The King's Fund think tank says the NHS is facing a""workforce crisis"",external. According tothe latest annual State of the Adult Social Care Sector and Workforce in England report, the sector is struggling to recruit and retain staff, with more unfilled posts now than at the start of the pandemic. The government says extra funding and a regular recruitment drive will help boost the workforce. Care home staff shortage adding pressure on NHS Hospitality The hospitality sector had 151,000 unfilled roles. Industry body UK Hospitality said chefs, security and front of house staff were particularly in demand. The shortage is put down to a number a factors including job security fears in light of Covid, and Brexit. It's leading some businesses to scale back their operations, with restaurants reducing opening hours and hotels closing off parts of their buildings. Is there a solution to the hospitality staff crisis? 'Help - I still can't find a job' Retail and transport There were 91,000 vacancies in retail -GreggsandNextare among the high street names which have recently warned of staff shortages in the run-up to Christmas. The British Retail Consortium said there were vacancies across the sector - for example in warehouses and logistics - and its supply chains, like flower-pickers, butchers and distribution centre operators. There is also aUK-wide shortage of lorry drivers, with 53,000 vacancies in the transport sector Staff shortages could last two years, say firms Starter salaries rise at fastest rate in 24 years Furlough, the government's main coronavirus job support scheme, finished at the end of September. There were fears this could lead to a spike in unemployment, with employers unable to keep staff on their books without the support it offered. The ONS says it could take a few months for the full impact of furlough to be shown - but the latest figures show the number of workers on payrolls jumped by 160,000 in October, and strong demand for workers seems to have prevented the feared wave of job cuts. What are my rights if I am made redundant?

You can also sign up with a general or specialist recruitment agency. If you want to work for a particular company, check if it hires directly, or through a recruiter. And if you want a specific job, be proactive and contact someone doing that role to discover how they got there. Professional networks can also be useful. These could be LinkedIn or Facebook groups, or industry organisations, where jobs and events are posted and advice is available. Some industries and employers have set upvirtual networking events and job fairs.,external Corinne Mills suggests drawing on your personal network. Friends, family and acquaintances will collectively know hundreds of people, many of whom will be hiring. Employers often respond to personal recommendations, and you may hear about roles before they are advertised. Tech recruiter Amy Golding also recommends: Tailoring your CV and cover letter for each application Emphasising your skills and listing specific achievements such as finishing a project on time and within budget Showing enthusiasm and giving reasons why you want to do this job for this employer Proofreading your materials, including asking someone else to check them for spelling or grammatical errors which could mean your application goes straight in the bin At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

US scuba boat captain charged over 34 fire deaths,"This video can not be played Family and friends mourn those lost in California dive-boat fire. The captain of a scuba-diving boat that was destroyed by fire last year off California has been charged with 34 counts of seaman's manslaughter. Jerry Nehl Boylan caused the deaths of those aboard the Conception ""by his misconduct, negligence and inattention to his duties"", says the indictment. Prosecutors allege the 67 year old failed to have a night watchman or conduct fire drills as required by law. All 33 passengers and a crew member sleeping below deck died. Family of five among dead in California boat fire Mr Boylan was among five crew members who managed to escape the blaze on the 75-ft (23m) vessel off Santa Barbara on 2 September 2019. He is expected to surrender to the authorities at a later date. Each charge of seaman's manslaughter carries up to 10 years in federal prison. Firefighters were unable to board the vessel to put the fire out as flames has already taken hold Kristi Johnson, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said on Tuesday: ""This tragedy forever altered the lives of so many families and loved ones, and it deeply affected members of the public who watched in horror. We continue to grieve with them. ""Our hope is that this indictment leads to the prevention of boating accidents and the senseless destruction of lives through proper precautions and training."" Mr Boylan has not publicly commented on the charges. The fire broke out in the early hours of the morning while the Conception was moored in Platt's Harbour near Santa Cruz Island, south of Santa Barbara. At the time, it had been hosting a diving expedition over the Labour Day holiday weekend. A US National Transportation Safety Board investigation determined the fire began in a middle deck area where lithium-ion batteries were being charged, though it was unclear exactly what ignited the blaze. Those who survived had been above deck when the blaze broke out. They escaped by jumping overboard and swimming to another vessel nearby, called the Great Escape. The crew members told investigators that the flames were too intense to save anyone trapped in the passenger quarters. A grand jury cited three federal safety violations: failure to assign a night watch or roving patrol, to conduct sufficient crew training or to conduct adequate fire drills.

Debenhams website overwhelmed as shoppers swoop,"The Debenhams website has been overwhelmed by shoppers searching for bargainsafter the department store chain collapsed. The firm launched a stock clearance sale on Wednesday at 07:00 as non-essential retailers in England reopen after a four-week lockdown. But high demand led to long, virtual queues of thousands and by mid morning the site had crashed altogether. ""We have been seeing unprecedented levels of visits,"" a spokesperson said. In a bid to keep up with the additional demand, the retailer was forced to implement a queuing system for its website, which promised customers: ""We will get you onto the site as soon as possible."" What Debenhams means to us: Norwich and Stevenage People of Bedford mourn loss of Debenhams On Tuesday, the company spelled out how many shoppers were on its site, at one point queues stretched into many hundreds of thousands, but on Wednesday Debenhams was no longer displaying that information.

The company had already been running a 14-day ""Black Friday"" sales event, with discounts of up to 70% from Wednesday onwards in-store and online across clothes and homeware. For other customers, the website crashed completely on Tuesday evening, either before reaching the virtual queue or having reached the checkout stage for their purchases. One social media user wrote that they had been given only 30 minutes to complete their shopping online. ""Only problem is once you get in there the homepage keeps crashing. No wonder they've gone bust,"" they wrote. Twitter user Danielle Harmer said,external: ""Finally get onto the website, start adding to my basket and then an error message pops up saying my queue number has been rejected and I have to join the back of the queue again! Actually livid."" On Tuesday shoppers were told how many people were in the queue but on Wednesday Debenhams were no longer giving that information All of Debenhams' 124 UK stores are set to close after the failure of last-ditch efforts to rescue the ailing store chain. It means all 12,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs when the shops cease trading, unless the administrators do a deal for all of parts of the business. Some social media users expressed sympathies for those staff members now facing uncertainty.Heather Angus wrote,external: ""If you're planning to go raid Debenhams with the announcement of them selling off stock, please be kind to their staff. This is awful."" Debenhams had been in administration since April. It is now set to enter liquidation, also known as winding-up, which means it will cease to exist as a company. The 242-year-old retailer had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May as it struggled to stay afloat. This video can not be played 'I'll miss it', shoppers say of the 242-year-old retailer Hopes of a rescue were crushed after the last remaining bidder for the company, JD Sports, withdrew. There have been suggestions that JD Sports pulled out of bidding for Debenhams because of the collapse of Arcadia, which is the biggest concession operator in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales. Tough trading during the coronavirus pandemic proved to be the final blow for both Debenhams and Arcadia, which employ more than 25,000 people between them. Restructuring firm Hilco will start going into Debenhams stores on Wednesday to begin clearing stock. Shoppers will still be able to buy items in-store and on the Debenhams website, until all of it is sold. Anyone who has ordered something on the website, including during the Black Friday sales, should receive it. They should also be able to return these items, under the normal rules, within 14 days, if they do not want them. The business is also accepting payment cards, such as gift cards. If the business is sold, these cards might continue to be valid. However, if cards are unspent or items not delivered if Debenhams closes entirely, then shoppers may need to contact their bank, via the chargeback scheme, or their credit card provider (if they spent more than Â£100 on a single order) to get a refund.

UN says aid deal on Tigray agreed with Ethiopia,"The UN and Ethiopia have agreed to allow aid into the country's conflict-torn Tigray region, UN officials say. UN spokesman Saviano Abreu said an assessment mission would begin later on Wednesday. There has been no word so far from the Ethiopian government. Food and medicines are said to be running out for millions of people. Hundreds of people have reportedly been killed in the month-long fighting between the federal army and the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The Ethiopian government said the regional capital Mekelle was seized over the weekend, but TPLF soldiers said they were still fighting near the city. The conflict has displaced tens of thousands of people, and sent a wave of refugees fleeing into Sudan. This video can not be played The BBCâs Anne Soy reports from a refugee camp on the Sudan-Ethiopian border In a separate development, the Ethiopian authorities said one of the most senior TPLF figures had surrendered. Keriya Ibrahim is the former speaker of the regional parliament. The TPLF has not publicly commented on the issue. Africa Live: More on this and other stories Ethiopian soldiers accused of blocking border with Sudan Can Ethiopia ignore Africa's diplomats? Why Ethiopia may be marching into guerrilla war The UN will have ""unimpeded, sustained and secure"" access to deliver aid to the government-held areas of Tigray under the agreement, the UN's humanitarian agency Ocha said. Spokesman Saviano Abreu said that the first mission to carry out a needs assessment would start on Wednesday. ""We are of course working to make sure assistance will be provided in the whole region and for every single person who needs it,"" Mr Abreu was quoted by the Associated Press as saying. Separately, a UN source told Reuters the organisation had established a logistics group with the government to ensure access. However, the government in Addis Ababa is yet to confirm the deal. Among those in need of urgent aid in Tigray are thousands of refugees from neighbouring Eritrea. They fled political persecution and compulsory military service. Eritrean refugees in Ethiopia 'run out of food' Meanwhile, communications have been fully restored in Alamata - a town on the south-eastern tip of Tigray. But towns in the western parts of the region saw only partial restoration of the services. Communications blackouts since the start of the fighting have made it difficult to verify claims and counterclaims by the rival sides. Moges, a resident of Alamata in his 20s, told the BBC that people in the town were terrified when they could hear the battle between government and TPLF forces. ""Since we didn't have any information, we were just imagining things. That was all we were thinking about,"" he said. ""It was only in the last two or three days that we have started thinking about our future."" With communications now restored, life in Alamata - which Moges said did not suffer damage in the fighting - is getting back to normal. But he said the family was worried about an uncle living in Humera, on the other side of Tigray, near the border with Sudan. ""We don't know what happened to him as the network is not restored there yet.'' The TPLF dominated Ethiopia's military and political life for decades before PM Abiy Ahmed took office in 2018 and pushed through major reforms. Last year, Mr Ahmed dissolved the ruling coalition, made up of several ethnically based regional parties, and merged them into a single, national party, which the TPLF refused to join. This video can not be played Four things that explain the crisis in the Tigray region of Ethiopia The feud escalated in September, when Tigray held a regional election, defying a nationwide ban on all polls imposed because of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Abiy responded by calling the vote illegal. The TPLF sees Mr Abiy's reforms as an attempt to hand his central government more power and weaken regional states. It also resents what it calls the prime minister's ""unprincipled"" friendship with Eritrean President Isaias Afwerki. Fighting broke out after the federal government accused Tigrayan forces of seizing an army base Mr Abiy won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for his efforts to bring peace with Eritrea.

Dua Lipa and other Spotify artist's pages hacked,"Dua Lipa and Lana Del Ray were among those whose pages were changed Some of the world's most popular singers have had their Spotify pages defaced by a hacker who posted messages about Donald Trump and Taylor Swift. On Wednesday, artists including Lana Del Rey and Dua Lipa had their biographies replaced by the attacker. The hacker called himself Daniel, and replaced the celebrities' photos with one of himself. The action will be an embarrassment to the platform's security efforts. It is the most popular app of its kind. The attacker also asked people to add him on Snapchat, and added the words ""Trump 2020"". ""Best of all shout out to my queen Taylor Swift,"" he added. On Twitter, users posted images of the changed pages, which also affected artists like Future and Pop Smoke. Spotify biographies had new photos added featuring Snapchat invites Spotify quickly reversed the changes, and the artists' pages appear to have returned to normal. It is not clear how the edits to some of the world's biggest musicians took place. Spotify has a special product available for music publishers and independent artists, called Spotify for Artists, which is what manages band pages and biographies. The tool lets Spotify users ""claim"" a band page or join the artist's team to manage it. But an already-claimed page cannot be claimed again. It can be joined by team members - such as staff on a recording label who have the right login - or through a verification process.

And with that, Speaker Lindsay Hoyle brings this week's session to a close.  The final question is from the SNP's Drew Hendry. He presses the PM on whether the Â£20 weeklyincrease in Universal Creditwill be extended beyond next April, a decision that the government has yet to commit to. If it isn't, he suggests the government will be ""throwing millions to the wolves"". The PM remarks on the extra support available through Universal Credit and repeats the government's commitment to protect lives and livelihoods during tough economic terms. As a measure of the UK's success, he says the UK's unemployment rate is lower than France, Spain, Italy, the United States and Canada. Conservative MP for North Cornwall Scott Mann says the media often thinks the government's levelling up agenda only refers to ""red wall"" seats in the North, despite Cornwall having ""pockets of deprivation"". He seeks confirmation that businesses in Cornwall will be able to access funding schemes aimed at addressing regional inequalities - and also that these schemes will be ""less onerous to access"" than EU schemes. Boris Johnson agrees and says his government is committed to addressing the needs of the people of Cornwall. Helen CattPolitical correspondent The Prime Minister's response to Karl McCartney about setting the coronavirus tiers at a more local level hints at one of the potential flash points to come. The PM talked about 'reflecting' local situations but having to take into account the national picture. Some MPs appear to believe they have been given assurances that smaller areas might be considered when tiers are reviewed in two week's time, but Boris Johnson has so far avoided committing himself to that. Conservative Karl McCartney asks the prime minister whether he will allow ""decision makers"" to ""take decisions locally"" on which areas are put into each tier in the new regional system. Under the current plan, decisions on tier allocations are ultimately made by central government. Boris Johnson replies that ministers have decided to design tiers to reflect local infection rates ""as closely as we can"". But he adds the government ""must look as the entire national picture"" as well. Labour's Emma Lewell-Buck notes that is it almost a year since Boris Johnson won the general election - she says during his time in office, the UK has seen the highest Covid death rate in Europe, the worst-performing economy in the G7, failing Brexit negotiations and Â£1.5bn given to Conservative donors in contracts. She asks ""which of these achievement is he most proud of"". The PM begins to reply ""I would take her point more seriously if she could be bothered to vote..."" but he is interrupted as the Labour MP points out she did vote, rather than abstain, on the new tier system. ""Ah, she defied the instruction to dither,"" Mr Johnson says and goes on to attack the Labour leader for abstaining. Former cabinet minister Liam Fox says small business is the lifeblood of his constituency and will be key to the country's recovery from the pandemic. He urges the PM to introduce a ""small business test"" to ensure that all new regulation and legislation passed in the next year or so will facilitate enterprise and entrepreneurship. The PM says all new laws currently take business into account and lists the support on offer to business during the pandemic.  Labour's Alex Davies-Jones says the aviation industry has been ""uniquely impacted"" by Covid and some of her constituents in Wales have been ""financially ruined"" by damage to the sector. She asks him to support a ""sector-specific"" deal to support the sector ""before it's too late"" . In reply, Boris Johnson says the threats to the industry are ""global"". He adds he has ""every hope"" it will ""bounce back strongly"" when the economy is ""moving again"". Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts says there has been a reduction in the amount Wales receives through transport spend in England from 80.9% 36.6%. She asks how much investment he is ""funnelling"" away from Wales to pay for the ""white elephant"" HS2 project - ""despite not a single inch of the railway being in Wales"". ""I fail to recognise the characterisation,"" replies Boris Johnson. He says next year the Welsh government will receive an additional Â£1.3m. And he adds that the Welsh Labour government spent Â£144m for plans for an M4 bypass ""which they then junked"". Now it's the turn of SNP Westminster leader Iain Blackford. He also welcomes the vaccine approval which he says is ""the news we have all been waiting for"". But he says it has come too late for what he says are the three million people who have ""not had a penny of support"" during the pandemic from the UK government. He says following a recent meeting with campaign group Excluded UK he learnt the ""shocking"" news that eight people had taken their own lives in the past 10 days. In response, the PM says he is sorry to hear this and goes on to talk about the extra funding on offer for mental health support and the increase in Universal Credit. Mr Blackford says this is not good enough and the lack of support for self-employed people in the arts and construction has been an ""abject failure"" and people have been ""abandoned"". The PM rejects this, saying ""no-one has been abandoned"" and the tiered restrictions approved yesterday would pave the way for the economy to re-open, particularly the retail sector. Helen CattPolitical correspondent As expected, Boris Johnson attacks Labour over its decision to abstain on the tier votes. Sir Keir Starmer clearly saw this coming; his response takes a swipe at the prime minister himself for missing a vote onHeathrow Airport in 2018 The Labour leader says there are ""serious questions that need to be answered"" about government support for affected sectors. He says retailers need ""much greater support,"" and asks the PM to commit to working with unions to deliver this. Referencing Sir Keir's decision to tell his MPs to abstain yesterday, the PM says he would ""take him more seriously"" if he'd ""bothered to vote"". ""Captain Hindsight is rising rapidly up the ranks and becoming General Indecision,"" he quips. Turning to the collapse of the Arcadia Group andDebenhams, Sir Keir Starmer says the arrival of the vaccine will come too late for those who have lost their job already. ""What is he going to do now to protect the jobs and the pensions of all those affected by the closures,"" he asks. Boris Johnson says the business secretary has asked the Insolvency Service to look at conduct ofArcadia company. ""We will do everything we can to restore the high street,"" he adds. He then attacks the Labour leader for abstaining on a vote to approve England's new Covid tier system. ""I think it is a bit much that he should attack the economic consequence of coronavirus when neither he or his  troops could be bothered to vote for measures that would open up the economy,"" he says. Helen CattPolitical correspondent There's a cautious tone to today's opening exchanges. Keir Starmer focussing on the detail of the delivery of the vaccine; Boris Johnson keen to stress that it is not an immediate silver bullet and that the tier restrictions will need to be observed in the meantime. Keir Starmer turns to the issue of public confidence in the vaccine, which he says gives ""cause for concern"". He asks the PM whether he will backLabour calls for new legislationto enable the government to fine social media companies if they don't promptly remove anti-vaccine disinformation. Boris Johnson says ministers are already working to combat disinformation online. He says more detail will be revealed shortly when the government publishes a paper on ""online harms"". Sir Keir Starmer raises concerns that delivery of vaccines into care homes will be difficult due to temperatures at which the vaccine must be stored. He asks what plans the PM has put in place to address these issues. Boris Johnson says the Labour leader is right to raise the issue as the vaccine needs to be stored at -70 degrees. He says his government is working on the problem and adds that it is also important to get the Oxford vaccine ready as it can be more easily stored. Our technology reporter Zoe Kleinman looks here at the questions surrounding the cold storage of the vaccine. Â© 2025 BBC.

Dame Jenni explains why she's stripping off on TV,"Dame Jenni Murray presented Radio 4's Woman's Hour for 33 years Former Woman's Hour host Dame Jenni Murray has opened up about her decision to take her clothes off on television for The Real Full Monty On Ice. Dame Jenni will strip to her underwear on the ITV show to raise awareness of the importance of checking for cancer. The 70-year-old  has had breast cancer herself, resulting in a mastectomy in 2007. After talking about it for years on the Radio 4 programme, she said it was time to ""put my money where my mouth is"". Dame Jenni told the Radio Times that when her agent first suggested the idea to her, she said: ""'Don't be ridiculous!... I'm not baring my one remaining breast to the entire nation.' ""And then I thought about it. The Full Monty is probably my favourite film ever. I thought, 'Come on, Jenni. You've been talking about breast cancer for donkey's years.'"" The presenter explained the subject has come up frequently on Woman's Hour, with listeners regularly being encouraged to check their breasts. Almost one million women in the UK have missed vital breast screening due to coronavirus, a leading charity recently estimated. One million UK women may have missed breast scans Dame Jenni added: ""You have to be gung ho about these things. I've had two children. I've had my hips replaced. I've had a mastectomy. I've had stomach surgery. I've had an operation on my left humerus, which I managed to break six years ago, slipping on a very icy step. ""My body has been exposed and dealt with on numerous occasions, and I can't see the point of being shy about it. It's a couple of seconds of taking your bra off. What's the problem?"" This video can not be played Dame Jenni closes her last programme with Helen Reddy Dame Jenni has been cancer-free for 14 years now, and told the publication she dislikes being termed a ""survivor"", preferring ""recovered"" instead. Last month, she made her final broadcast as host of the Radio 4 show, after 33 years in the hot seat. She signed off her tenure by playing Helen Reddy's feminist anthem, I Am Woman. Dame Jenni Murray signs off with feminist anthem Emma Barnett to present Radio 4's Woman's Hour Jane Garvey to leave Woman's Hour The broadcaster thinks her next eyebrow-raising venture will be a challenge - particularly the ice part - but nothing compared to what she has put her body through previously. Episode one of Emmy-winning show, led by Ashley Banjo and Coleen Nolan, is on ITV on 14 December. Alongside Dame Jenni, will be actresses Linda Lusardi and Hayley Tamaddon; and Love Island's Shaunghna Phillips, as well as This Morning's Dr Zoe.

Two women stabbed in Marks & Spencer store,"Police were called to a report of a stabbing inside Marks and Spencer A staff member and a shopper have been injured in a stabbing at a Marks & Spencer store. The two women were hurt in the attack in the St James Street store in Burnley at 09:30 GMT, Lancashire Police said. A force spokesman said both were taken to hospital but their injuries were not believed to be life-threatening. Supt Stasia Osiowy praised the ""brave actions"" of passers-by, who detained a 57-year-old man, who was then arrested on suspicion of attempted murder. She said the attack was ""not being treated as a terrorism incident, but due to some comments made at the scene, counter-terrorism detectives will be leading on the investigation"". Detectives were ""keeping an open mind as to motivation"", she said, but were ""considering the mental health background"" of the arrested man. Supt Osiowy thanked ""members of the public who acted very quickly, and without regard to their own safety, in order to detain the attacker"". ""Without their brave actions, this incident, while serious, could have been so much worse,"" she said. The force spokesman said the two women, a staff member in her 40s and a customer in her 60s, had ""thankfully"" not been seriously injured. A knife was recovered at the scene. A police cordon is in place outside the store as inquiries continue Carl Stredder, who was shopping with his wife at the time, had stopped at the cash machine opposite Marks & Spencer when he heard shouting coming from the store. He told the BBC he saw a man ""holding down"" another man before the emergency services arrived at the scene. ""Within a couple of minutes, the police had arrived. There were six or seven police cars, sirens all over the place,"" he said. ""Then within another five or so minutes, an ambulance came. It was apparent by then that some sort of major incident had occurred."" He added: ""It was a bit of a frightener when we came home and realised in the cold light of day what could have happened."" A Marks & Spencer spokesman said the company was ""incredibly grateful"" to the emergency services and pleased both victims were ""now in good care"". ""Our focus is on ensuring that our colleagues in Burnley receive all the support they need,"" he added. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

Baby among five killed by car in pedestrian zone,"This video can not be played The scene in Trier after a car ploughed through a pedestrian area of the western German city of Trier A car has ploughed through a pedestrian area in the western German city of Trier, killing five people including a nine-week-old baby girl, police say. The driver, a 51-year-old local man, has been arrested. The prosecutor said the suspect had drunk a significant amount of alcohol. Authorities said they were not working on the assumption that the incident was politically or religiously motivated. The city's mayor described the scene as ""horrible"". Witnesses said people screamed in panic and some were thrown in the air by an SUV travelling at high speed in Trier's Brotstrasse and Simeonstrasse streets towards the city's famous Roman gate, the Porta Nigra. The incident happened at around 13:45 local time (12:45 GMT), and the suspect drove for 1km (0.62 miles) ""hitting people at random on his way"" before being stopped by a police car, Trier police spokesman Karl-Peter Jochem said earlier. The victims were three women, aged 25, 52 and 73.Police said the 45-year-old father of the baby was also killed.,externalHis wife and one-year-old son were injured and admitted to hospital. By Nick Beake, BBC News, Trier Central Trier is almost silent tonight. The flashing blue lights of dozens of police vehicles compete with the Christmas illuminations in front of the Porta Nigra, the famous Roman gate. Tonight it is an entrance to a large crime scene. The city, often claimed as Germany's oldest, is the now the latest to experience a horrific and fatal incident involving a vehicle and pedestrians so close to Christmas. Armed police stand guard at the edge of the cordon, which marks the point at which the suspect drove away from the scene. Two friends, Stacy and Karolina, told me they had come to light candles and remember those who had been killed. ""This is just a small place"", said Stacy. ""You never imagine this could happen."" Footage posted on social media appeared to show the presumed driver being held by several officers next to the damaged car. Police have been questioning the suspect, who was alone, and has been identified by German media as Bernd W. Initial indications ""suggest that psychiatric problems possibly played a role"", prosecutor Peter Fritzen told reporters. The man did not have a criminal record, had no fixed address and was living in the car, which had been lent to him by someone else. The incident happened in the centre of Trier Earlier, Mayor Wolfram Leibe said up to 15 people had been injured, some of them seriously. ""We [had] a driver who ran amok in the city... I just walked through the city centre and it was just horrible. There is a trainer lying on the ground, and the girl it belongs to is dead,"" he told a news conference. Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement: ""The news from Trier is very sad. My sympathy goes to the relatives of people who were torn from their lives so suddenly and forcibly. I also think of those who have suffered severe injuries and I wish them much strength."" The prosecutor said the suspect had drunk a significant amount of alcohol The incident has shocked Trier, a medieval city of around 110,000 people and 720km west of Berlin, near the border with Luxembourg. A Christmas market that is usually held in the area was cancelled this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but shops were open. Bollards that would usually be in place to protect the pedestrianised area because of the Christmas market were therefore not put up. The case brought back memories of the 2016 attack in Berlin whenan Islamist militant drove a hijacked truck into a Christmas market, killing 12 people and injuring dozens of others. He was shot dead by Italian police four days later. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

What are the safety checks for vaccines?,"More than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. There are different approved types and brands available and all have undergone rigorous testing and safety checks. Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. The principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. When will I get a coronavirus vaccine? If the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech,the first to be approved in the UK. Half are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. The Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. Approval is only given if regulators are happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. Checks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. In the UK, independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it after approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Scientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge. The UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can befast-tracked for approvalif needed. No corners will be cut, with safety paramount. But lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed. Instead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used. Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. They do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus. Vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective. Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against. Some people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine. Common reactions,externalthat may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles. It is rare to find that health problems occurring following a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Events may be coincidental and unrelated to vaccination. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has beenlinked to very rare cases of blood clots,external. This is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. The chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK have been offered alternative Covid vaccines. Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients arelisted.,external There have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. As a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. Be aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). People will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid in the past. That's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection. Guidance,externalsays there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with ""long"" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. Some vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. The Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products. TheBritish Islamic Medical Association,externalsays there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example. How will the vulnerable be protected from Covid?

"Trump inciting violence, Georgia Republican warns","This video can not be played ""This has to stop... someone's gonna get killed"": Mr Sterling calls on President Trump to condemn the threats An election official in the US state of Georgia has said President Trump will bear responsibility for any violence that results from unsubstantiated election fraud claims he has stoked. ""It's all gone too far,"" Gabriel Sterling warned. ""It has to stop!"" He cited intimidation and death threats to workers in remarks on Tuesday. Georgia is carrying out a second recount of votes at the Trump camp's request. Joe Biden was declared a narrow winner in the key state. The second re-tally is showing no major changes, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said on Wednesday. He said no evidence of widespread fraud had been found to support Mr Trump's claims. Earlier Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said his team was trying to make sure ""that all legal votes are counted and all illegal votes are not"". ""No-one should engage in threats or violence, and if that has happened, we condemn that fully,"" he said. The plea in Georgia came afterUS Attorney General William Barr said his justice department had so far found no proofto back the president's claims of fraud in the election - the latest setback to the Trump camp's legal challenges in several states. What legal challenges remain for Trump? 'In his mind, he will not have lost' Georgia will also hold in January two run-off elections, which will determine who controls the Senate. Mr Trump's Republican party currently has a slim majority in the upper chamber, and a victory in the run-offs would allow it to counter the Democratic administration of President-elect Biden. However, if the Democrats win the two remaining seats, they would control half the seats in the Senate - and the vice-president would be able to act as a tie-breaker. The Democrats already control the lower chamber - the House of Representatives. At a news conference in Atlanta on Tuesday, Mr Sterling, the state's voting systems implementation manager, rebuked his fellow Republicans, including the president. He said a 20-year-old contractor in Gwinnett County for Dominion Voting Systems, which has become the subject of baseless right-wing conspiracy theories, had received death threats. The worker's family was also getting harassed, Mr Sterling added. The unnamed man had been threatened with a noose and accused of treason, Mr Sterling said, after transferring a report on ballot batches to a county computer so he could read it. Mr Sterling said he himself had a police guard outside his home, while the wife of Georgia's Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, was ""getting sexualised threats through her cell phone"". ""Mr president, you have not condemned these actions or this language,"" added Mr Sterling. ""Senators, you have not condemned these actions or this language. ""We need you to step up and if you're going to take a position of leadership, show some!"" He added: ""Death threats, physical threats, intimidation, it's too much, it's not right, they've lost the moral high ground to claim that it is."" This video can not be played ""Mr President-elect, how does your foot feel?"": Joe Biden is seen in his protective boot Mr Sterling also cited threats of violence against Chris Krebs, who was fired last month as head of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency after he disputed Mr Trump's fraud claims. Mr Sterling condemned Trump lawyer Joe DiGenova, who said on Monday that Mr Krebs should be ""taken out at dawn and shot"". Addressing Mr Trump directly, Mr Sterling continued: ""You have the right to go to the courts. What you don't have the ability to do, and you need to step up and say this, is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. ""Someone's going to get hurt, someone's going to get shot, someone's going to get killed, and it's not right."" He added: ""Be the bigger man here, and stop, step in, tell your supporters, don't be violent, don't intimidate. All that's wrong, it's un-American."" President Trump responded by retweeting a video of Mr Sterling's speech, but without referencing the concerns over threats of violence. Instead he doubled down on his allegations of election fraud, saying: ""Rigged election. Show signatures and envelopes. Expose the massive voter fraud in Georgia."" Allow Twitter content?

Before and since, he has fired off many more tweets on the same subject, all without credible evidence. He shared a conspiracy theory about voting machines in Georgia, claimed Mr Biden's win in Arizona was ""impossible"", the results in Nevada were ""fake"" and also claimed without proof: ""We won Michigan by a lot!"" On Wednesday morning, Mr Raffensperger criticised how the president had responded to the passionate plea from his colleague. ""Even after this office requested that President Trump try and quell the violent rhetoric being born out of his continuing claims of winning states where he obviously lost, he tweeted out 'expose the massive voter fraud in Georgia,'"" he said. ""This is exactly the kind of language that is at the base of a growing threat environment for election workers who are simply doing their jobs."" On Tuesday, the president's campaign filed a lawsuit with Wisconsin's supreme court challenging the state's presidential vote results. The petition came a day after Mr Biden was certified as the winner in the Midwestern state by about 20,000 votes. The Trump legal action challenges more than 220,000 ballots in Wisconsin based largely on technicalities. It alleges clerks filled out missing information on postal ballots and objects to an event where election officials collected and checked votes in a park in the city of Madison, rather than polling stations. Mr Trump and his allies have failed to make any significant headway in their efforts to challenge the results in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada. All these key swing states have certified results confirming a Biden victory. Attorney General Barr said on Tuesday that the justice departmentso far had ""not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election"". The comments were seen as a big blow to Mr Trump, as Mr Barr is a close ally. A DOJ spokesperson later stressed the department had not concluded its investigation.

What is in the Pfizer vaccine?,"The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is one of two being rolled out across the UK. The government aims to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by mid-February and has got off to a strong start, with more than four million jabs administered. The vaccine trains the immune system to fight coronavirus. It is a new type of jab called an RNA vaccine and uses a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack. The genetic material is encased in a tiny protective bubble of fat to get it into cells. The exact ingredients of the vaccine have not been made public, but other vaccines can contain other ingredients, like aluminium, to make them stable or more effective. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? This is the first RNA vaccine to be approved for use in humans. The concept has been researched before and people have been given them in clinical trials for other diseases. The vaccine will be considered by regulatory agencies around the world, who will decide whether the jab can be approved for use. NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, and the over 80s are first in line to receive the two vaccines being rolled out in the UK - Pfizer and Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab. About half of over-80s in the UK have now been vaccinated. People in England in their 70s, and those listed as clinically extremely vulnerable, are now beginning to receiving their offers of a jab. Out of the nine priority groups, those aged 50-54 are at the bottom of the current list. There will be a second phase, which will offer the vaccine to the other groups in the population. The vaccine was initially delivered in hospitals. It is now also being administered through GPs and care homes, as well as local vaccination centres in venues such as sports halls andmass vaccination hubsin places like cathedrals and sports halls. However, there are logistical challenges for the Pfizer vaccine: It must be keptat -70C during transportation The jab must be thawed before it is given to a patient It can be stored in a normal fridge for a few days before being used How do the Covid vaccines compare? It is impossible to know and we will find out only by waiting. If immunity does not last then it may be necessary to have annual vaccines, as we do for flu. The vaccine appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old and data from its phase three trial suggestsit works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities. Early evidencesuggests the Pfizer vaccine is likely to protect against a coronavirus variant that is spreading around the UK. Some people - such as those with a weak immune system - will not be able to have the vaccine. Nothing in medicine is 100% safe - even something we take without thinking, like paracetamol, poses risks. The data so far is reassuring - trials on 43,500 people discovered no safety concerns, although mild side effects, such as headaches and muscle aches, have been reported. If there were highly dangerous and common consequences of this vaccination, they should have become apparent. However, rarer side effects may emerge as millions of people are immunised. Hopefully yes, but not for some time. If enough people are immune then the virus would stop spreading and we would not need other measures. However, the manufacture and distribution of a vaccine will take some time. So testing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing are going to be a feature of our lives for a while yet. The vaccine has been designed and developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, and they own the intellectual property. They already have the manufacturing capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of this year, but could partner with others to increase capacity even further. We do not know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or just stops you from getting ill. We also don't know how protective the vaccine is in different age groups. These will be crucial for understanding how it will be used. About a dozen vaccines are in the final development stages. The Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab is also being used in the UK, and supplies of the approved Moderna vaccine should arrive in the spring.

How do we know vaccine's safe? And other questions,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

And with that, Speaker Lindsay Hoyle brings this week's session to a close.  The final question is from the SNP's Drew Hendry. He presses the PM on whether the Â£20 weeklyincrease in Universal Creditwill be extended beyond next April, a decision that the government has yet to commit to. If it isn't, he suggests the government will be ""throwing millions to the wolves"". The PM remarks on the extra support available through Universal Credit and repeats the government's commitment to protect lives and livelihoods during tough economic terms. As a measure of the UK's success, he says the UK's unemployment rate is lower than France, Spain, Italy, the United States and Canada. Conservative MP for North Cornwall Scott Mann says the media often thinks the government's levelling up agenda only refers to ""red wall"" seats in the North, despite Cornwall having ""pockets of deprivation"". He seeks confirmation that businesses in Cornwall will be able to access funding schemes aimed at addressing regional inequalities - and also that these schemes will be ""less onerous to access"" than EU schemes. Boris Johnson agrees and says his government is committed to addressing the needs of the people of Cornwall. Helen CattPolitical correspondent The Prime Minister's response to Karl McCartney about setting the coronavirus tiers at a more local level hints at one of the potential flash points to come. The PM talked about 'reflecting' local situations but having to take into account the national picture. Some MPs appear to believe they have been given assurances that smaller areas might be considered when tiers are reviewed in two week's time, but Boris Johnson has so far avoided committing himself to that. Conservative Karl McCartney asks the prime minister whether he will allow ""decision makers"" to ""take decisions locally"" on which areas are put into each tier in the new regional system. Under the current plan, decisions on tier allocations are ultimately made by central government. Boris Johnson replies that ministers have decided to design tiers to reflect local infection rates ""as closely as we can"". But he adds the government ""must look as the entire national picture"" as well. Labour's Emma Lewell-Buck notes that is it almost a year since Boris Johnson won the general election - she says during his time in office, the UK has seen the highest Covid death rate in Europe, the worst-performing economy in the G7, failing Brexit negotiations and Â£1.5bn given to Conservative donors in contracts. She asks ""which of these achievement is he most proud of"". The PM begins to reply ""I would take her point more seriously if she could be bothered to vote..."" but he is interrupted as the Labour MP points out she did vote, rather than abstain, on the new tier system. ""Ah, she defied the instruction to dither,"" Mr Johnson says and goes on to attack the Labour leader for abstaining. Former cabinet minister Liam Fox says small business is the lifeblood of his constituency and will be key to the country's recovery from the pandemic. He urges the PM to introduce a ""small business test"" to ensure that all new regulation and legislation passed in the next year or so will facilitate enterprise and entrepreneurship. The PM says all new laws currently take business into account and lists the support on offer to business during the pandemic.  Labour's Alex Davies-Jones says the aviation industry has been ""uniquely impacted"" by Covid and some of her constituents in Wales have been ""financially ruined"" by damage to the sector. She asks him to support a ""sector-specific"" deal to support the sector ""before it's too late"" . In reply, Boris Johnson says the threats to the industry are ""global"". He adds he has ""every hope"" it will ""bounce back strongly"" when the economy is ""moving again"". Plaid Cymru MP Liz Saville Roberts says there has been a reduction in the amount Wales receives through transport spend in England from 80.9% 36.6%. She asks how much investment he is ""funnelling"" away from Wales to pay for the ""white elephant"" HS2 project - ""despite not a single inch of the railway being in Wales"". ""I fail to recognise the characterisation,"" replies Boris Johnson. He says next year the Welsh government will receive an additional Â£1.3m. And he adds that the Welsh Labour government spent Â£144m for plans for an M4 bypass ""which they then junked"". Now it's the turn of SNP Westminster leader Iain Blackford. He also welcomes the vaccine approval which he says is ""the news we have all been waiting for"". But he says it has come too late for what he says are the three million people who have ""not had a penny of support"" during the pandemic from the UK government. He says following a recent meeting with campaign group Excluded UK he learnt the ""shocking"" news that eight people had taken their own lives in the past 10 days. In response, the PM says he is sorry to hear this and goes on to talk about the extra funding on offer for mental health support and the increase in Universal Credit. Mr Blackford says this is not good enough and the lack of support for self-employed people in the arts and construction has been an ""abject failure"" and people have been ""abandoned"". The PM rejects this, saying ""no-one has been abandoned"" and the tiered restrictions approved yesterday would pave the way for the economy to re-open, particularly the retail sector. Helen CattPolitical correspondent As expected, Boris Johnson attacks Labour over its decision to abstain on the tier votes. Sir Keir Starmer clearly saw this coming; his response takes a swipe at the prime minister himself for missing a vote onHeathrow Airport in 2018 The Labour leader says there are ""serious questions that need to be answered"" about government support for affected sectors. He says retailers need ""much greater support,"" and asks the PM to commit to working with unions to deliver this. Referencing Sir Keir's decision to tell his MPs to abstain yesterday, the PM says he would ""take him more seriously"" if he'd ""bothered to vote"". ""Captain Hindsight is rising rapidly up the ranks and becoming General Indecision,"" he quips. Turning to the collapse of the Arcadia Group andDebenhams, Sir Keir Starmer says the arrival of the vaccine will come too late for those who have lost their job already. ""What is he going to do now to protect the jobs and the pensions of all those affected by the closures,"" he asks. Boris Johnson says the business secretary has asked the Insolvency Service to look at conduct ofArcadia company. ""We will do everything we can to restore the high street,"" he adds. He then attacks the Labour leader for abstaining on a vote to approve England's new Covid tier system. ""I think it is a bit much that he should attack the economic consequence of coronavirus when neither he or his  troops could be bothered to vote for measures that would open up the economy,"" he says. Helen CattPolitical correspondent There's a cautious tone to today's opening exchanges. Keir Starmer focussing on the detail of the delivery of the vaccine; Boris Johnson keen to stress that it is not an immediate silver bullet and that the tier restrictions will need to be observed in the meantime. Keir Starmer turns to the issue of public confidence in the vaccine, which he says gives ""cause for concern"". He asks the PM whether he will backLabour calls for new legislationto enable the government to fine social media companies if they don't promptly remove anti-vaccine disinformation. Boris Johnson says ministers are already working to combat disinformation online. He says more detail will be revealed shortly when the government publishes a paper on ""online harms"". Sir Keir Starmer raises concerns that delivery of vaccines into care homes will be difficult due to temperatures at which the vaccine must be stored. He asks what plans the PM has put in place to address these issues. Boris Johnson says the Labour leader is right to raise the issue as the vaccine needs to be stored at -70 degrees. He says his government is working on the problem and adds that it is also important to get the Oxford vaccine ready as it can be more easily stored.

Slack sold to business software giant for $27.7bnThe workplace messaging app's sale comes as the pandemic has increased the focus on remote work.,"Salesforce has agreed to buy workplace messaging app Slack for $27.7bn (Â£20bn) in what would be one of the biggest tech mergers in recent years. Marc Benioff, boss of the business software giant,called the deal,externala ""match made in heaven"". He has been pushing to expand the company's software offerings and fend off rivals such as Microsoft. The acquisition comes as the pandemic has increased the focus on remote work and tools, like Slack, which enable it. Tech analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities called it a ""now or never"" purchase for Mr Benioff. ""If Salesforce wants to expand beyond its core gold mine of sales and marketing departments â¦ this was the moment and thus represents a major shot across the bow against Microsoft,"" he wrote in a note to investors after the deal was announced. Slack, founded in 2009, has won a following with its group chats, which offer an alternative to email. When it listed its shares publicly in 2019, it was valued at roughly $20bn. Slack: Why is this money-loser worth $20bn? Slack makes EU antitrust claim against Microsoft However, its shares sank after the launch and have missed out on the stratospheric rise enjoyed by other tech firms this year. The company, which had about 12.5 million users as of late March, has had difficulty making inroads against Microsoft Teams, a similar product that the tech giant unveiled in 2016 and now has more than 100 million users. Four years ago, Microsoft looked into buying Slack. The deal never happened and Microsoft instead focussed on developing its own platform. Microsoft Teams was created - a clear rival to Slack. When a trillion dollar company like Microsoft looks to move into your business - you should be worried. Initially, Slack was confident of the challenge, even taking out a full page advert in the New York Times welcoming the competition in 2016. Looking back on it, it's hard to see that advert as any more than hubris. Big Tech can kill smaller companies. Their sheer size and dominance in the market makes them very hard to compete with. Microsoft started flexing its muscle. It started bundling in Microsoft Teams with its Office Software. Microsoft Teams is now used by nearly 10 times as many people as Slack. If Slack thought it was fun to have Microsoft as a competitor in 2016, it definitely didn't in 2020. Its legal challenges claim that Microsoft uses its heft to unfairly bully the competition. So, this acquisition should be seen in that context. Slack was being slowly squeezed. It has now been bought by a much bigger fish - it will be better placed to compete with Microsoft. But, there will be many who will use this case to lament the plight of smaller tech companies, who simply can't compete with a handful of tech giants. The two companies hope that the tie-up will put them in a better position to take on a number of enterprise software competitors, and in particular Microsoft. Microsoft's business applications have seen a massive surge as large numbers of people shifted to work-from-home arrangements due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Microsoft's business suite includes features that are similar to Slack's messaging service. The tech giant' CEO Satya Nadella remarked earlier this year that ""We've seen two years worth of digital transformation in two months"" Both Salesforce and Slack have had previous run-ins with Microsoft. In 2016, Salesforce lost out to its bigger rival when it attempted to buy the business-focused social media service LinkedIn. This summer, Slack brought a competition complaint against Microsoft in the European Union, saying the firm was abusing its market dominance by bundling Teams into its other products. Under the terms of the Salesforce deal, Slack shareholders are to receive $26.79 in cash per share - roughly what they were worth at the beginning of November, before rumours of the acquisition pushed the price per share to more than $43 as of Tuesday. They will also receive some shares in Salesforce. The deal, which will be reviewed by Slack shareholders, is expected to close next year. Slack: Why is this money-loser worth $20bn?

"US scuba boat captain charged over 34 fire deathsProsecutors say the captain's alleged failure to follow safety rules sparked ""a hellish nightmare"".","This video can not be played Family and friends mourn those lost in California dive-boat fire. The captain of a scuba-diving boat that was destroyed by fire last year off California has been charged with 34 counts of seaman's manslaughter. Jerry Nehl Boylan caused the deaths of those aboard the Conception ""by his misconduct, negligence and inattention to his duties"", says the indictment. Prosecutors allege the 67 year old failed to have a night watchman or conduct fire drills as required by law. All 33 passengers and a crew member sleeping below deck died. Family of five among dead in California boat fire Mr Boylan was among five crew members who managed to escape the blaze on the 75-ft (23m) vessel off Santa Barbara on 2 September 2019. He is expected to surrender to the authorities at a later date. Each charge of seaman's manslaughter carries up to 10 years in federal prison. Firefighters were unable to board the vessel to put the fire out as flames has already taken hold Kristi Johnson, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said on Tuesday: ""This tragedy forever altered the lives of so many families and loved ones, and it deeply affected members of the public who watched in horror. We continue to grieve with them. ""Our hope is that this indictment leads to the prevention of boating accidents and the senseless destruction of lives through proper precautions and training."" Mr Boylan has not publicly commented on the charges. The fire broke out in the early hours of the morning while the Conception was moored in Platt's Harbour near Santa Cruz Island, south of Santa Barbara. At the time, it had been hosting a diving expedition over the Labour Day holiday weekend. A US National Transportation Safety Board investigation determined the fire began in a middle deck area where lithium-ion batteries were being charged, though it was unclear exactly what ignited the blaze. Those who survived had been above deck when the blaze broke out. They escaped by jumping overboard and swimming to another vessel nearby, called the Great Escape. The crew members told investigators that the flames were too intense to save anyone trapped in the passenger quarters. A grand jury cited three federal safety violations: failure to assign a night watch or roving patrol, to conduct sufficient crew training or to conduct adequate fire drills.

Debenhams website overwhelmed as shoppers swoopThe 242-year-old department has started a clearance sale after it said it would permanently close.Business,"The Debenhams website has been overwhelmed by shoppers searching for bargainsafter the department store chain collapsed. The firm launched a stock clearance sale on Wednesday at 07:00 as non-essential retailers in England reopen after a four-week lockdown. But high demand led to long, virtual queues of thousands and by mid morning the site had crashed altogether. ""We have been seeing unprecedented levels of visits,"" a spokesperson said. In a bid to keep up with the additional demand, the retailer was forced to implement a queuing system for its website, which promised customers: ""We will get you onto the site as soon as possible."" What Debenhams means to us: Norwich and Stevenage People of Bedford mourn loss of Debenhams On Tuesday, the company spelled out how many shoppers were on its site, at one point queues stretched into many hundreds of thousands, but on Wednesday Debenhams was no longer displaying that information. Some social media users reported as many as 900,000 other customers in the queue for the website. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The company had already been running a 14-day ""Black Friday"" sales event, with discounts of up to 70% from Wednesday onwards in-store and online across clothes and homeware. For other customers, the website crashed completely on Tuesday evening, either before reaching the virtual queue or having reached the checkout stage for their purchases. One social media user wrote that they had been given only 30 minutes to complete their shopping online. ""Only problem is once you get in there the homepage keeps crashing. No wonder they've gone bust,"" they wrote. Twitter user Danielle Harmer said,external: ""Finally get onto the website, start adding to my basket and then an error message pops up saying my queue number has been rejected and I have to join the back of the queue again! Actually livid."" On Tuesday shoppers were told how many people were in the queue but on Wednesday Debenhams were no longer giving that information All of Debenhams' 124 UK stores are set to close after the failure of last-ditch efforts to rescue the ailing store chain. It means all 12,000 employees are likely to lose their jobs when the shops cease trading, unless the administrators do a deal for all of parts of the business. Some social media users expressed sympathies for those staff members now facing uncertainty.Heather Angus wrote,external: ""If you're planning to go raid Debenhams with the announcement of them selling off stock, please be kind to their staff. This is awful."" Debenhams had been in administration since April. It is now set to enter liquidation, also known as winding-up, which means it will cease to exist as a company. The 242-year-old retailer had already trimmed its store portfolio and cut about 6,500 jobs since May as it struggled to stay afloat. This video can not be played 'I'll miss it', shoppers say of the 242-year-old retailer Hopes of a rescue were crushed after the last remaining bidder for the company, JD Sports, withdrew. There have been suggestions that JD Sports pulled out of bidding for Debenhams because of the collapse of Arcadia, which is the biggest concession operator in Debenhams, accounting for about Â£75m of sales. Tough trading during the coronavirus pandemic proved to be the final blow for both Debenhams and Arcadia, which employ more than 25,000 people between them. Restructuring firm Hilco will start going into Debenhams stores on Wednesday to begin clearing stock. Shoppers will still be able to buy items in-store and on the Debenhams website, until all of it is sold. Anyone who has ordered something on the website, including during the Black Friday sales, should receive it. They should also be able to return these items, under the normal rules, within 14 days, if they do not want them. The business is also accepting payment cards, such as gift cards. If the business is sold, these cards might continue to be valid. However, if cards are unspent or items not delivered if Debenhams closes entirely, then shoppers may need to contact their bank, via the chargeback scheme, or their credit card provider (if they spent more than Â£100 on a single order) to get a refund.

Tesco to repay Â£585m in business rates relief,"Tesco and Morrisons will together hand back more than Â£850m worth of business rates relief they received as support during the coronavirus crisis. Tesco said it would repay Â£585m after it was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders. Morrisons subsequently announced it had ""brought forward"" a decision on rates relief and would pay back Â£274m. Tesco said the help to retailers had been a ""game-changer"" and hugely important at the time. But it added that its business had proven ""resilient"" and it had now decided to return the money in full. ""We will work with the UK government and devolved administrations on the best means of doing that,"" it said. In October, Tesco defended paying a Â£315m dividend to shareholders after reporting a 29% increase in profits for the first half of the year. Finance chief Alan Stewart told reporters it was the right policy. Meanwhile, Morrisons said it would announce its dividend when it knows how much it has made this year. Commenting on the decision to pay back the rates relief, Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said the supermarket chain had ""done its best work"" to meet the ""enormous challenges"" the pandemic had brought. ""We are grateful for the government's swift action at the start of the pandemic which enabled the whole sector to face squarely into the challenges and disruption caused by Covid-19,"" he said. Business rates relief was extended to all retailers as part of a package of measures announced in March. Tesco profits surge as online orders double In March, Tesco was accused of ""whipping up a huge lobbying operation"" against a decision not to give its biggest stores in Wales financial help. The Welsh government changed its mind and decided to grant business rate relief to all retail, hospitality and leisure firms. Tesco is understood to have asked the Welsh government for an explanation of its thinking rather than a change in policy. ""The decision to repay business rates relief is one for individual companies to consider for themselves,"" said Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium. ""Many have used this money to cover increased costs as a result of Covid - hiring extra staff and making significant investment in the safety and protection of their premises. As such, there are many firms who simply cannot afford to repay this government relief."" While most of the public focus has - for obvious reasons - been on the furlough scheme, the business rates holiday for retailers and hospitality companies has been one of the main ways the government has tried to keep alive the companies most affected by pandemic closures. Like all coronavirus schemes, however, the rates relief was a blunt instrument - it went also to retailers who have stayed open throughout. When those retailers decided to pay dividends to shareholders, there was an understandable outcry. Tesco was the object of most opprobrium; it said it would pay Â£315m to investors after reporting that pandemic trading had been buoyant. Directors at the supermarket chain have obviously read the headlines. The company said it would repay the Â£585m it has had so far this year in business rates relief, while pointing out in passing that it estimated the pandemic had brought it Â£725m in additional costs. The question now is whether other essential retailers - especially the big grocery chains such as Sainsbury's and Asda - will follow Tesco's lead. It would be surprising if they did not. And while the repayments might appear like a public-spirited move, bear in mind the board may have had other motivations: in particular, a desire not to have the public support they have received hanging over them and preventing them from exercising their normal commercial judgement in paying dividends, approving bonuses and making deals. Tesco said the money meant that it had had the immediate confidence, in the face of significant uncertainty, to invest in colleagues and support its customers and suppliers. ""Every penny of the rates relief we have received has been spent on our response to the pandemic. Our latest estimate at our interim results in October was that Covid would cost Tesco [about] Â£725m this year - well in excess of the Â£585m rates relief received. ""Ten months into the pandemic, our business has proven resilient in the most challenging of circumstances. While all businesses have been impacted - many severely so - we have been able to continue trading throughout, serving many millions of customers every day and although uncertainties still exist, some of the potential risks faced earlier in the year are now behind us."" Chief executive Ken Murphy said: ""Giving this money back to the public is absolutely the right thing to do by our customers, colleagues and all of our stakeholders.""

Does the NHS really need protecting?,"England has exited lockdown but for nearly all the country, Wednesday marks just a small step back towards normality. With the exception of Cornwall, the Isle of Wight and Isles of Scilly, strict restrictions mean people's lives are being curtailed. A crucial factor - ministers have argued - is that the NHS risks being overwhelmed without the tough curbs on freedoms. But is this really true? A quick glance at the latest data on hospital beds shows there were nearly 13,000 beds free at the end of November. That's 50% more than last winter. There are also several thousand beds available in private hospitals that the NHS has paid for until the end of the year that could be used for non-Covid patients. It means, in theory, there are enough beds available to cope with a doubling of Covid patients - there are currently about 14,000 in hospital. In practice, the NHS is meant to keep at least a tenth of its beds free to create flexibility to admit patients and cope with surges in demand. It also allows time for cleaning and infection control - something that is, of course, particularly important during a pandemic. In fact, the need for social distancing and infection control has meant hospitals have had to be reconfigured significantly, leading to 13,000 beds being lost from the system. What is more, the pressures are not felt evenly around the country. The past few months have been marked by individual hospitals getting dangerously close to full, with some reporting more than a quarter of beds occupied by Covid patients. But the flip side of that is that some are not. Explaining why he was voting against the new tiers, Tim Loughton, the Tory MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, said his hospital had just four Covid patients. These differences matter. Hospital capacity is one of the five key tests for working out which tier local areas are in. While doing this, the NHS is playing a juggling act. In the spring, a lot of planned work, including some cancer care, was cancelled. The decision was taken because of the fear that hospitals could be completely overwhelmed. But it meant significant numbers of beds were left unused as the data for June in the chart below shows. But this chart also demonstrates how the NHS has tried to get services back to normal over the summer and autumn with the number of non-Covid patients in hospital (shown in green) climbing. This is deemed essential because of the growing backlog in numbers waiting for treatment. Macmillan estimates there are more than 40,000 missing cancer patients. Meanwhile, the numbers waiting over a year for routine treatment, such as knee and hip operations, is at its highest level since 2008. It is easy to think these sort of treatments can wait. But as Royal College of Surgeons of England president Prof Neil Mortensen says, these are patients whose lives are on hold left waiting ""potentially in pain"". The desire to keep the non-Covid work going is strong - and when you put this all together, it leaves very little wriggle room. It means any significant increase in Covid patients above the level seen now has a direct impact on non-Covid care. All this is being done while staff are exhausted with significant numbers - 30,000 at last count - off work for Covid-related issues. England has a network of seven field hospitals known as Nightingales. These were built during the spring, again on the assumption that hospitals could become overwhelmed. One of the challenges the NHS has faced is that it has fewer doctors, nurses and beds per head of population than many other western European countries. Tory MP John Redwood has been vocal in calling for the Nightingales to be used, accusing those making dire warnings of trying to ""scare"" the public. Between them they could provide care to several thousand patients. But the problem is they need staff. Chris Hopson, of NHS Providers, which represents hospital managers, says they were only ever built as an ""insurance policy"" to be used as a last resort if hospitals were overwhelmed. To open them would mean spreading staff more thinly across hospitals and the Nightingales. That, of course, has consequences for the quality of care. It is the reason why only two have been pressed into action during the second wave. Stretching the NHS beyond the point it is at currently is certainly possible, but it will have consequences.

'Serious disruption' risk at Channel post-Brexit,"A group of MPs have warned of the ""risk of serious disruption and delay"" at Channel crossings when the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said the government was ""taking limited responsibility"" for national readiness ahead of the looming deadline. And it said the necessary systems would not be in place in time, regardless of whether an EU trade deal is agreed. A government spokeswoman said they were ""making significant preparations"". They added it was ""vital that businesses and citizens make their final preparations too"", and they were ""intensifying our engagement... so they know exactly what they need to do to get ready."" But the committee's chair, Labour's Meg Hillier, said the prime minister's promise of an ""oven ready"" Brexit deal at the last election had become more of a ""cold turkey"". Brexit: Will the borders be ready? How close to a Brexit trade deal are we? Brexit: Seven things that will change on 1 January The UK left the EU on 31 January, but has been following the bloc's rules as part of a transition period while the two sides negotiate a trade deal. Talks began in March and are continuing in London this week, but sticking points on fishing and competition rules remain, despite the impending deadline of the end of 2020. If a deal is not agreed and ratified by parliaments by the end of the year, the UK will trade with the EU on World Trade Organisation rules - which critics fear will damage the economy. But Boris Johnson believes the UK will ""prosper"" with or without an EU trade deal. The committee has published 12 reports warning about the need for Brexit readiness since the referendum in 2016. It said it had been assured the necessary systems were ""on track or that delays were being managed"", but added: ""And yet, with a few weeks to go, border systems remain in development and plans for managing disruption or prioritisation of key goods are unclear."" In its latest publication, the cross-party group of MPs said it remained ""extremely concerned"" - especially for Channel crossings, which were the delivery point for the majority of the UK's fresh food supplies. The committee added: ""There are still significant risks to the country being ready for the end of the transition period on 31 December 2020, but government still only seems to be taking limited responsibility for that readiness. ""Industry bodies have said that government has not provided key information needed by businesses to prepare, such as detailed guidance on how to apply for simplified customs procedures."" Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? But in response to the report, the government insisted IT systems were ""on track and will be ready"" and its ""wider plans for managing disruption and the prioritisation of key goods are well established"". A spokeswoman added: ""Industry has been engaged in the plans from the outset."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The report from the committee also said: The impact of the ""Get ready for Brexit"" campaign in 2019, which cost Â£46m before being scrapped, was ""unclear"" and the government was ""still not doing enough to ensure businesses and citizens are ready"" A survey used in the report found 36% of small and medium sized firms expected the transition period to be extended The Cabinet Office admitted it had no knowledge of how many of the remaining 64% will be ready for the change A total of Â£4.4bn had been spent on preparing for Brexit, involving 22,000 civil servants and ""many more"" paid consultants, with ""too much"" being spent on the latter Ministers specifically limited the amount of contingency planning the civil service could carry out for a Brexit scenario ahead of the referendum Brexit preparations and the Covid-19 response exposed ""critical gaps in the civil service's approach to planning, particularly for unexpected events or undesired outcomes"" Ms Hiller, added: ""Pretending that things you don't want to happen are not going to happen is not a recipe for government, it's a recipe for disaster. ""We're paying for that approach in the UK's response to the Covid-19 pandemic and can only hope that we're not now facing another catastrophe at the border in four weeks' time. ""A year after the oven-ready deal, we have more of a cold turkey and businesses and consumers do not know what to be prepared for."" The report called for the Cabinet Office to conduct a formal review of the whole period of preparations. It added: ""Government must maximise all remaining opportunities for getting businesses and individuals to act in the time remaining to January 2021."" A government spokesman said: ""We've been clear from the outset that we all have a responsibility to get ready. ""And with just one month to go it's vital we all dig deep and do what needs to be done before the end of the year.""

Pfizer vaccine safe for UK rollout next week,"The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination. Britain's medicines regulator, the MHRA, says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe to be rolled out. The first doses are already on their way to the UK, with 800,000 due in the coming days, Pfizer said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS will contact people about jabs. Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff. But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine is wasted. A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the public not to get ""carried away with over optimism or falling into the naive belief that our struggle is over"". He tolda Downing Street news conference that, while the ""searchlights of science"" had created a working vaccine, significant logistical challenges remained. What are the safety checks for vaccines How will I get a vaccine? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years. The UK has already ordered 40 million doses of the jab - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. The doses will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Mr Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland will be immunised on Tuesday. Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the rollout of the Pfizer jab to care homes would be particularly difficult because of how it needs to be stored. Mr Gething said that it was not possible to transport the Pfizer vaccine to more than 1,000 care homes across Wales. The bulk of the rollout across the UK will be next year, Mr Hancock said, adding: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better."" There is a clear priority list for who gets the vaccine first - and care home residents and staff are top of it. But operational complexities mean the reality will be somewhat different. When the vaccines arrives, it will be sent straight to major hospitals who have the ultra-cold facilities to store it. From there it can be moved just once - and when it is, it must be kept in batches of 1,000. That means sending it out to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents in some places, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted. Because of that, the NHS, which is in charge of distributing the vaccine, will run clinics from hospitals at first. This will allow NHS and care home staff to get immunised first as well as, perhaps, some of the older age groups who come into hospital. It looks like it will not be until much more of the Pfizer vaccine is available or the Oxford University one, which is easier to distribute, is approved that care home residents will be able to get it. While Mr Hancock said that the government does not yet know how many people need to be vaccinated before restrictions can start being lifted, he added: ""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy."" Mr Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again."" Downing Street press secretary Allegra Stratton said Mr Johnson would not rule out receiving the vaccine jab live on television, though she said he would not want to take a jab meant for someone more vulnerable. The free vaccine will not be compulsory and there will be three ways of vaccinating people across the UK: Hospitals Vaccination centres ""a bit like the Nightingales project and including some of the Nightingales"", said Mr Hancock In the community, with GPs and pharmacists Around 50 hospitals are on stand-by and vaccination centres - in venues such as conference centres or sports stadiums - are being set up now. It is thought the vaccination network could start delivering more than one million doses a week once enough doses are available. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""This is a day to remember and, frankly, a year to forget"" NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the health service was preparing for ""the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country's history"". But experts said people still need to remain vigilant and follow rules to stop the virus spreading - including with social distancing, face masks and self-isolation. ""We can't lower our guard yet,"" said the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty. The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations and decided by the government. Mass immunisation of everyone over 50, as well as younger people with pre-existing health conditions, can happen as more stocks become available in 2021. Pfizer confirmed that the first stocks of the vaccine will be for the NHS, which will give them out for free based on clinical need. People in the UK will not be able to bypass this and buy the vaccine privately to jump the queue. The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. Most of the side effects are very mild, similar to the side effects after any other vaccine and usually last for a day or so, said Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chairman of the Commission on Human Medicine expert working group. The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people, he said. The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said that - despite the speed of approval - no corners have been cut. Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said. This video can not be played Dr June Raine from the MHRA: ""The safety of the public will always come first"" Giving the analogy of climbing a mountain, she said: ""If you're climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became available on 10 November we were at base camp. ""And then when we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us to today."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters The Pfizer/BioNTech was the first vaccine to publish positive early results from final stages of testing. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials. Covid vaccine: How will we keep it cold enough? Because the vaccine must be stored at around -70C, it will be transported in special boxes of up to 5,000 doses, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. And once out of the fridge it needs to be used within six hours. Other coronavirus vaccines are also being developed: One from Moderna uses the same mRNA approach as the Pfizer vaccine and offers similar protection - the UK has pre-ordered seven million doses that could be ready by the spring The UK has ordered 100 million doses of a different type of Covid vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca Russia has been using another vaccine, called Sputnik, and the Chinese military has approved another one made by CanSino Biologics. The World Health Organization's Dr David Nabarro said the Pfizer vaccine would not replace the other measures ""for a number of months, even a year, so we'll have to keep doing physical distancing, mask wearing, hygiene and isolating ourselves when we're sick"". He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme ""the vaccine will only start to dent the size of the pandemic somewhat later in the year"". The pace has been breathtaking. From an unknown virus at the start of the year to a vaccine approved by the regulator and ready to use in early December is an unprecedented timescale. At the Downing Street briefing, the MHRA's chief executive said it was like climbing Everest, with preparations starting in June and a team working ""night and day"" assessing early data and reaching ""base camp"" by early November when Pfizer/BioNtech published the trial results. At the same time, the MHRA was adamant that the process had been robust with safety considerations paramount. A rapid emergency approval process was used by the UK regulator. The European Medicines Agency is taking longer to reach a view and there has been some sniping from European politicians arguing their processes are more reliable and authoritative. But the MHRA is an internationally respected independent watchdog and for now those about to receive the first jabs will rely on its ruling.

BonmarchÃ© falls into administration,"Women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ© has fallen into administration, putting more than 1,500 jobs at risk. BonmarchÃ©, which has 225 stores around the country, was owned by retail tycoon Philip Day. His other chains -Edinburgh Woollen Mill, Peacocks and Ponden Home stores- collapsed into administration last month. Administrators said the stores would continue to trade while options for the business were explored. Damian Webb and Gordon Thomson of RSM Restructuring Advisory have been appointed as joint administrators of the firm, known as BM Retail Limited. Debenhams set to close putting 12,000 jobs at risk Mr Webb said: ""BonmarchÃ© remains an attractive brand with a loyal customer base. It is our intention to continue to trade whilst working closely with management to explore the options for the business. ""We will shortly be marketing the business for sale and based on the interest to date, we anticipate there will be a number of interested parties."" Yorkshire-based BonmarchÃ© specialises in clothing for the over-50s. It has been in and out of administration before, most recently in October last year, butit was rescued a month later. This is the third time BonmarchÃ©'s been in administration. It had a 3,800-strong workforce back in 2012 before it collapsed and was then bought by a private equity firm. 160 stores closed and 1,400 job losses followed. The chain was floated on the stock exchange in 2013. But in recent years it's continued to struggle. Philip Day built up a stake last year and then went on to buy the rest of it in a Â£5.7m deal, only for it to fall into administration a few months later. He then went on to buy it back in what's known as a pre-pack deal. That allowed him to cut costs and reduce the number of stores. It also left suppliers out of pocket. Don't expect Philip to ride to the rescue again this time, said one source. Today's news means his retail empire has now completely collapsed. The collapse of the chain adds to a grim week for the High Street, afterDebenhams announced all its stores were set to close for goodandTopshop owner Arcadia fell into administration. Those two firms employ 25,000 people between them. In both cases, tough trading conditions and long-standing difficulties have been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, which forced stores to close for lengthy periods during 2020. And there is no end in sight for the uncertainty faced by retailers. Consumer confidence is expected to remain fragile into next year, amid fears that unemployment is set to rise as Covid continues to take its toll on the economy. Retail analyst Kate Hardcastle told the BBC it was a mistake to think that BonmarchÃ© and other troubled retailers were suffering purely because they had lagged behind on their online offer. She said BonmarchÃ© had shown ""disrespect"" towards its target market of older women by failing to engage with them and taking a traditional view of retail that no longer applied. ""It was led by a team that did not understand and reflect that their customers had changed and it did not move with them,"" she said. ""These are smart, sophisticated women. They're not your pearls-and-twinset customer. ""You can't just sell stuff to people any more. You have to embrace the way that 50-plus women live their life.""

Keeping pools closed 'a catastrophe for health',"Swim England says 221 council-run pools will remain closed More than 200 swimming pools in England will remain closed despite being able to reopen as lockdown restrictions are eased, a Swim England report has said. The swimming body said the decision presented a ""catastrophe for the health and wellbeing of the nation"". The 221 pools were council-run, with the North West being particularly hard hit, affecting about half a million swimmers, Swim England said. Councils pointed to financial difficulties in their decision making. A number of council-run gyms are also still shut With lockdown in England having come to an end, gyms and swimming pools across the country are allowed to reopen from Wednesday, regardless of what tier their area is in. ""While it's extremely positive that millions of swimmers up and down the country can return to the activity they love, it's unacceptable to even think that so many people or clubs will not have a much-loved swimming pool to visit,"" Swim England's chief executive Jane Nickerson said. She said more investment was needed to keep swimming pools and leisure centres open, adding despite a government grant for the industry ""financial pressures have not gone away"". Four times world champion triathlete Barbara Holmes, from Lancashire, said: ""People need their pools, especially the children."" Ms Holmes, who is the over-60s world champion, has been backing campaigners trying to reopen Fleetwood swimming pool. ""The community needs to be heard,"" she said. Some leisure centre staff have been redeployed to support work tackling coronavirus Trafford Leisure said all of its centres would remain closed until the new year, saying they would be ""largely empty and costly to run"". To save money, its chief operating officer said it had had to furlough staff as well as leaving its pool and building unheated. In Stoke-on-Trent, the council said it recognised the ""essential"" physical and mental health benefits of leisure facilities but had made the decision to stagger their reopening and only two of the city's gyms would not remain closed. Council leader Abi Brown said 75% of its leisure centre staff had been ""redeployed to critical services including welfare calls and contact tracing"" in an effort to bring down coronavirus cases and some centres had been adapted for community testing. Outdoor pools struggling to reopen after spring lockdown What might swimming pools be like after lockdown? Sea swims help with lockdown mental health ""If the current situation improves, we expect to restart more of our sport and leisure services from the new year,"" she said. While some pools have been ""mothballed"", Ms Nickerson said some would ""sadly never reopen"".

Thanks for joining us, we'll be back in the morning to bring you more updates. Today's coverage has been brought to you by: Marie Jackson, Becky Morton, Joshua Cheetham, Katie Wright, Jennifer Scott, Sean Fanning, Claire Heald and Suzanne Leigh. Our live coverage will be coming to a close shortly, on a day which has been dominated by the news that a vaccine will begin being rolled out in the UK next week. Here is a round-up of the main developments: Prof
Peter Openshaw, a government adviser and medical expert at Imperial College
London, said people should beware fake news and rumours about the safety of the
vaccine. He
told the BBC: ""If people do not want to have it that is completely up to
them."" He
added: ""I really believe it is a safe way to get vaccinated and
protected."" The
UK's regulator, the MHRA, says all of the vital checks and measures have been
done and no corners have been cut, meaning the jab is safe to recommend. A
snap poll by YouGov of 5,321 British adults suggests the majority of the public
is confident about the vaccine. Reality Check There have been claims that Brexit allowed the UK to approve a vaccine more quickly than the EU, but is that correct? The EU - through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - has yet to approve a coronavirus vaccine. But the idea that Brexit enabled the UK to press ahead and authorise one is not right. Under European law a vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but individual countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine for temporary use in their domestic market. Britain is still subject to those EU rules during the post-Brexit transition period which runs until the end of the year. The UK's own medicines regulator, the MHRA, confirmed this ina statement last month,external. And its chief executive, Dr June Raine, said today that ""we have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January"". It is true that, in general, regulation of new medicines is done on an EU-wide basis. But that does not take account of the emergency provisions in EU law which Dr Raine refers to.

But as clubs in certain areas of England open their turnstiles for the first time in almost nine months, a BBC Sport poll suggestsfans are dividedover whether they should be allowed to return before a Covid-19 vaccine is rolled out. In a Savanta ComRes poll of 2,100 football fans, 52% said they should be allowed to return to watch matches in person before a vaccine is available, while 45% said they should not. The poll also shows:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Students will have staggered starting dates for returning to universities in England after Christmas- with some not back until 7 February. The government's plan would see students on hands-on, practical courses such as medicine going back from 4 to 18 January. Other subjects would be taught online until face-to-face teaching begins between 25 January and 7 February. Students are being promised Covid tests when they return to university next term. The plan, to avoid a surge of students and the risk of spreading coronavirus, will mean a staggered return for students over five weeks in the new year - with most courses starting online before a return to in-person teaching. Students will be offered two lateral flow Covid tests when they arrive back - similar to the process for their departure. The arrangements for next term have been announced on the eve of students being able to return home for Christmas. Labour's leader is calling for all parties to work together over the rollout of the vaccine. Speaking after the Downing Street press conference, Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""really important... whatever our political party, [we] work together to make sure that the rollout is
swift, safe and fair, and the people have confidence in it"". He says he has asked Boris Johnson to share No 10's plan for communicating the rollout. Sir Keir added: ""Then we will work
together so that the public can see cross-party consensus on this. ""This
rollout is one of the biggest logistical exercises since the Second World War. We need the best of Britain, we need parties pulling together, and I'm very
happy to put my party behind that effort."" The UK prime minister's press conference has just come to an end. So what did we learn from Boris Johnson, Simon Stevens and Jonathan Van-Tam? Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent ""It may be a
good thing, but on the other hand..."" The prime minister
doesn't seem very impressed with Jonathan Van-Tam's claim that coronavirus
safety measures may be with us long term. Boris Johnson
looked a bit baffled and says people want to reclaim their lives. ""I didn't mean
to challenge you,"" he says before the deputy chief medical officer then
clarifies his point that he hopes we'll get back to a much more
normal world as soon as possible. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the big unknowns about this vaccine â and the
others being developed â is whether it prevents transmission. It is possible that people who are vaccinated can still
pass on the virus to others. It will take time to establish to what extent this is
stopped. If it does stop transmission, once you have about 2/3 of
the population vaccinated it is possible you then reach herd immunity and the
virus stops spreading completely. But even if that doesnât happen, vaccinating all over 65s
- 12m people - will have a major impact on deaths. More than 90% of people who
have died have been over that age. That in itself would be enough to lead to significant
lifting of restrictions. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter The Pfizer vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective
at stopping people from becoming ill from the virus â the first priority for
getting life back to normal. But we donât yet know whether this vaccine stops people
spreading the virus. Both deputy chief medical officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam and NHS England head Simon Stevens stressed this point during todayâs
briefing. They are âvery hopefulâ it will also stop vaccinated people
from spreading the virus to others. And thereâs good precedent for this â the flu and MMR
(measles, mumps and rubella) jabs both stop vaccinated people from infecting
others. But for now, Van-Tam says, you canât watch others get it (the jab) and hope it will protect you. He encouraged everyone who is invited to be given the
vaccine to take up this opportunity, adding that low take-up of the vaccine will
âalmost certainly make restrictions last longerâ. In the final question, Van-Tam is asked if he can envisage a world where we can cast aside our masks and hand sanitiser for good. The deputy chief medical officer says he doesn't think we will eradicate coronavirus ""ever"", adding: ""It will be with humankind forever"". He also thinks it may become ""a seasonal problem"", like flu. ""Do I think there will be a big moment where we have a big party and throw off our masks? No I don't,"" says Van-Tam. Instead, he thinks the ""personal habit"" may carry on for some years, even if the government doesn't insist on the measures. And asked about the MPs that rebelled against the new tier system, the PM concludes the press conference saying: ""I totally understand people's frustrations with the tiering system. ""But we will make sure we are as local and as sensitive as we can possibly be [on restrictions]."" Asked whether the current coronavirus restrictions could be ended
early, the prime minister says the vaccine news âfor now makes absolutely no
differenceâ. However, he adds that there will come a moment to relax the ânon- pharmaceutical interventionsâ but âweâre not there yetâ. He stresses the moment when it is time to relax the rules is theoretical and there is âweeks,
months of work to goâ before we are in that position. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This is the day we have been waiting for. But it is clear listening to NHS England chief executive
Simon Stevens and deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van Tam that
there are some huge logistical challenges from here on in. First of all, supply. The UK is expecting 800,000 doses
in the next few days. But given there are 15 million people over the age of 65
and working in health and care sectors, and all need two doses, it is clear
getting more into the country is essential. Rollout is also difficult. Through a combination of the
need to keep the vaccine at ultra cold storage and the fact that the jab comes
in batches of 975 that cannot be split up at the moment, immunisation will only
be offered from a network of 50 hospitals to start with. It is why there is still so much hope pinned to the
Oxford University vaccine, that regulators are currently reviewing. That does
not need to be kept in ultra cold storage and so can be distributed much more
easily. Plus there are already millions of doses in the country. Then there is vaccine hesitancy. Officials have been at
pains to stress that despite the vaccine being developed in record time the
full testing and regulatory process has been followed. But the more people donât come forward, the longer
restrictions have to remain in place. There is a long way to go yet. Next up is a question on the vaccine roll-out again and about what stage it will be right to lift all the restrictions? Stevens says the ""goal"" of the vaccination programme is to ""protect vulnerable individuals"" - hence the graduated list of who will get it when - and to stop people spreading it. But we don't know yet if that vaccine will have the power to stop transmission. Van Tam points to the priority list, working down the ages and at risk groups, saying it is ""not an accident"" they take out 99% of groups linked to Covid related mortality deaths in the UK. Johnson says the reason the UK got the vaccine ahead of other countries is down to the vaccine task force's work. But they are ""global efforts of scientists around the world"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The prime minister
loves a colourful metaphor and so does Jonathan Van-Tam. Boris Johnson began
the briefing by saying science had performed a kind of biological jiu jitsu -
turning the virus on itself to make this vaccine. Soon after the
government's deputy chief medical officer likened it to a train arriving at a
station which people needed to get on and compared the vaccine to a yoghurt,
saying it couldn't be taken in and out of the fridge. Tabloid headline
writers will be able to take their pick. Beth Rigby from Sky News asks whether we should all still
prepare for restrictions to run until April. Boris Johnson says he accepts that the new tier system in
England is âtoughâ but he says the way forward is local restrictions and mass
testing to âkeep the virus under controlâ. He says he hopes places are able âto come down the tiersâ
before Easter, adding that it is necessary to have these measures alongside the
vaccine. Asked whether the PM expects to roll over the tier system at
the start of February, Johnson says the situation will be judged on the data but
âfor the time being youâve got to take it that tiering will be a very, very
important part of our campaign against coronavirus."" The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is the first one in the UK to be approved for use, with hopes people can start receiving the injection within a week. In the video below BBC health correspondent Laura Foster helps explain some of the logistics around how it will be rolled out. This video can not be played The next question is on care home residents, as despite scientists calling for them to get the vaccine first, the government says they may not. Johnson says: ""Of course we want to get it into care homes as fast as we possibly can"". But the issue is in distributing the cases of the vaccine. Each case has 975 vaccines in it, but you cannot currently divide it up, so the government wants to ""avoid wastage"". The PM says they are waiting to hear more, but they ""certainly"" want to get it to ""the most vulnerable"". Van-Tam says remarks about failure on care homes are ""extremely unfair when one considers a new virus emerged less than 12 months ago and we now have our first vaccine"". He adds: ""This is a complex product. It is not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in several times."" Now we turn to questions from journalists, and the BBCâs Fergus
Walsh asks, how important is this moment? Boris Johnson says itâs a âhuge momentâ and he agrees with
Jonathan Van-Tam that itâs also âa very moving thingâ. He says he is âlost in admirationâ for the way scientists can
solve problems. However, he adds that although itâs a fantastic moment, âthe
worst thing now would be to think that this the moment when we can relax our
guard and think that itâs game over"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
New Covid tier system comes into force in England,"This video can not be played Shoppers queue as stores reopen in Birmingham Shoppers have returned to the High Street in England, after non-essential retailers opened their doors at the end of a four-week national lockdown. Athree-tiered system of Covid-19 rules has now come into forcein the nation, with gyms and businesses such as hairdressers also able to open. More than 55 million people are in the strictest two tiers and cannot mix indoors with those in other households. The government said it would ""safeguard the gains made during the past month"". At a Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he accepted that the tiered system was ""tough"", but insisted that regional restrictions and mass testing were the way to ""keep the virus under control"". He said he hoped that places would be able ""to come down the tiers"" before Easter, while stressing that the tier restrictions would continue to be a ""very important"" part of battling coronavirus. Government publishes data behind stricter tiers Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? Keeping pools closed 'a catastrophe for health' 'We've lost a day of trade' over lockdown end date There were queues outside stores across England early on Wednesday as shoppers returned to High Street giants such as Primark. And people arrived promptly to take advantage ofa stock clearance sale at Debenhams department storefrom 07:00 GMT. Some retailers are extending their trading hours to try to recoup the loss in sales over the lockdown. It comes after a period which has seenthe collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia group,women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ©and the failure ofDebenhams to secure a buyer- putting a total of more than 25,000 jobs at risk. Footfall at UK shops was up by 64.5% compared to last week, butdown by 24.1%on the same day last year, according to analyst Springboard. Queues were seen outside Primark in Birmingham early on Wednesday Shoppers also headed to London's Oxford Street A swimmer takes to the water at London's Serpentine Swimming Club as outdoor swimming pools are also allowed to reopen Jordan Roberts, 19, was among a dozen people queuing outside Selfridges in London's Oxford Street before the department store opened its doors - and shoppers were welcomed by store workers dressed as elves on roller skates. She said she was there to do her Christmas shopping, adding: ""It feels more enjoyable being in a store and things run out of stock online."" Another London shopper, Tamara Rass, 44, said she hit the stores early as she expected they would be busy. ""For me, it's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and getting back to normality,"" she said. ""There are things in store that I can't get online and I like to treat my daughter once a month."" Elsewhere, there were also reports of ""steady"" footfall in England's town centres.

Transport for London said 760,000 journeys were made on the London Underground network on Wednesday from the start of service until 10:00 GMT - up 14% on last week, but only 31% of normal demand. There were 970,000 bus journeys made. This was up 8% on last week and 57% of pre-pandemic levels. British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said businesses were looking forward to welcoming back customers,with billions lost in sales during the lockdown, adding ""every purchase we make is a retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported"". The government has also announced that people living in care homes in England willbe able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas, if the visitors test negative for coronavirus. And later on Wednesdayabout 10,000 fans will be allowed into six games in the English Football Leaguefor the first time, other than a few pilot games, since March. England's new tiered system wasbacked by MPs in a Commons votejust hours before it came into effect, despite 55 Tories voting against PM Boris Johnson's plan. The latest restrictions are tougher than the previous tier system that was in place before the lockdown was introduced on 5 November. Under the system every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers. In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors. And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues. Scotlandoperates a five-tier systemwhile Wales and Northern Ireland havetheir own coronavirus restrictions- with the latter currently ina two-week circuit breaker lockdown. On Wednesday, a further 16,170 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK, while a further 648 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test.

Tesco to repay Â£585m in business rates reliefThe supermarket giant received the money as support to help it get through the coronavirus pandemic.Business,"Tesco and Morrisons will together hand back more than Â£850m worth of business rates relief they received as support during the coronavirus crisis. Tesco said it would repay Â£585m after it was criticised for paying dividends to shareholders. Morrisons subsequently announced it had ""brought forward"" a decision on rates relief and would pay back Â£274m. Tesco said the help to retailers had been a ""game-changer"" and hugely important at the time. But it added that its business had proven ""resilient"" and it had now decided to return the money in full. ""We will work with the UK government and devolved administrations on the best means of doing that,"" it said. In October, Tesco defended paying a Â£315m dividend to shareholders after reporting a 29% increase in profits for the first half of the year. Finance chief Alan Stewart told reporters it was the right policy. Meanwhile, Morrisons said it would announce its dividend when it knows how much it has made this year. Commenting on the decision to pay back the rates relief, Morrisons' chief executive, David Potts, said the supermarket chain had ""done its best work"" to meet the ""enormous challenges"" the pandemic had brought. ""We are grateful for the government's swift action at the start of the pandemic which enabled the whole sector to face squarely into the challenges and disruption caused by Covid-19,"" he said. Business rates relief was extended to all retailers as part of a package of measures announced in March. Tesco profits surge as online orders double In March, Tesco was accused of ""whipping up a huge lobbying operation"" against a decision not to give its biggest stores in Wales financial help. The Welsh government changed its mind and decided to grant business rate relief to all retail, hospitality and leisure firms. Tesco is understood to have asked the Welsh government for an explanation of its thinking rather than a change in policy. ""The decision to repay business rates relief is one for individual companies to consider for themselves,"" said Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium. ""Many have used this money to cover increased costs as a result of Covid - hiring extra staff and making significant investment in the safety and protection of their premises. As such, there are many firms who simply cannot afford to repay this government relief."" While most of the public focus has - for obvious reasons - been on the furlough scheme, the business rates holiday for retailers and hospitality companies has been one of the main ways the government has tried to keep alive the companies most affected by pandemic closures. Like all coronavirus schemes, however, the rates relief was a blunt instrument - it went also to retailers who have stayed open throughout. When those retailers decided to pay dividends to shareholders, there was an understandable outcry. Tesco was the object of most opprobrium; it said it would pay Â£315m to investors after reporting that pandemic trading had been buoyant. Directors at the supermarket chain have obviously read the headlines. The company said it would repay the Â£585m it has had so far this year in business rates relief, while pointing out in passing that it estimated the pandemic had brought it Â£725m in additional costs. The question now is whether other essential retailers - especially the big grocery chains such as Sainsbury's and Asda - will follow Tesco's lead. It would be surprising if they did not. And while the repayments might appear like a public-spirited move, bear in mind the board may have had other motivations: in particular, a desire not to have the public support they have received hanging over them and preventing them from exercising their normal commercial judgement in paying dividends, approving bonuses and making deals. Tesco said the money meant that it had had the immediate confidence, in the face of significant uncertainty, to invest in colleagues and support its customers and suppliers. ""Every penny of the rates relief we have received has been spent on our response to the pandemic. Our latest estimate at our interim results in October was that Covid would cost Tesco [about] Â£725m this year - well in excess of the Â£585m rates relief received. ""Ten months into the pandemic, our business has proven resilient in the most challenging of circumstances. While all businesses have been impacted - many severely so - we have been able to continue trading throughout, serving many millions of customers every day and although uncertainties still exist, some of the potential risks faced earlier in the year are now behind us."" Chief executive Ken Murphy said: ""Giving this money back to the public is absolutely the right thing to do by our customers, colleagues and all of our stakeholders.""

Will next year's Higher exams go ahead?,"Teachers, pupils and parents are waiting to find out if next year's Higher and Advanced Higher exams are going to be held next May. The Scottish government hasalready cancelled National 5s,the more junior exams, and originally said it planned to hold Highers in as normal a way as possible. However, the government has now said it is looking at the issue of disruption to education around self-isolation periods for Covid-19 and some key meetings are taking place this week that could help ministers make their decision. The Highers and Advanced Higher exams diet is currently due to start on 10 May 2021 John Swinney announced the cancellation of the National 5s in October. The education secretary made a statement to parliament in which he said holding a full exam diet in 2021 was ""too big a risk"" due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic. National 5s will now be decided by ""teacher judgement supported by assessment"". Schools are still waiting for the full guidance on how to carry this out. The Scottish Qualifications Authority said plans were currently continuing in preparation for Higher and Advanced Higher exams starting on 10 May 2021. A spokesman added: ""A clear contingency plan is being developed as part of the work being undertaken by the National Qualifications Group 2021, including key checkpoints up to the February break to assess public health advice and its impact on the plans for exams."" Cancelling Higher exams cannot be ruled out Scottish National 5 exams to be cancelled in 2021 The education secretary said he would make a final decision on what was happening with Highers and Advanced Highers by the February break and a ""contingency plan"" was in place should they need to be called off, which would see the grades awarded on teacher judgement. As the BBC has been reporting, Covid-19 has meant tens of thousands ofpupils have had to isolate at home since schools returnedfull time in August and particularly since they came back after the October break.The year groups most affected by these absences tend to be S3-S5.,external The worst hit areas are in the central belt, where we have heard from several students who have had multiple periods of isolation through being identified as a contact of someone with Covid-19. Protests were held in the summer over some pupils having their marks downgraded by the SQA Scotland's exams were cancelled in 2020 - for the first time in history - due to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown. Results were initially decided using teacher estimated grades which the Scottish Qualifications Authority then moderated based on different schools' past performances. There wasan outcry and protests were heldwhen it emerged that 125,000 of those teacher estimates were downgraded, with claims the system was unfair to children at schools with worse records in exams. The Scottish government then agreed to accept just the teacher estimates. It also commissioned a review into the issue. Prof Mark Priestly's report subsequentlyrecommended cancelling the final exams for National 5s next year.,external All next year's GCSEs and A-level exams have been cancelled in Wales Wales hascancelled all GCSE and A-level exams in 2021. Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams said it was impossible to guarantee a level playing field for pupils due to the Covid pandemic. Grades will be decided using classroom assessments. In England,A-levels and GCSEs are due to go ahead next summer, starting three weeks later than usual. Plans for how to manage them in a pandemic are expected to be published later this week. Northern Ireland isplanning to hold all exams in 2021, with its education minister, Peter Weir, saying they represented the ""fairest way of judging students"". John Swinney says he wants every young person to have equal access to learning and teaching this year This week, John Swinney told MSPs at Holyrood that he appreciated ""the necessity for early decision making"". He said the evidence suggested that about 75% of S4-S6 pupils ""have experienced no disruption to their learning in sense of having to self-isolate"". He added: ""I am very acutely focused on the issue of equityâ¦it's material to my decision making around the Highers and Advanced Highers. ""I have to be satisfied that every young person, no matter their experience of Covid, is able to have the full opportunities for learning and teaching and therefore position themselves to be in the best place to be able to perform in any exam diet in the spring."" The Scottish government's education recovery group, made up of education bodies, teaching unions, college and university representatives, will meet on Wednesday and is expected to discuss exams. On Friday, there is a planned meeting of the qualifications contingency group, which the government's website states is ""invoked in circumstances where there is a system-wide risk to the delivery of the exam diet and the awarding of qualifications."" It last met on 5 October. Neither of these groups are decision-making bodies. They are used to gather information and opinions across education. Ultimately the decision on Highers will be made by Mr Swinney and it is likely that he will inform parliament first if a decision is reached. There are concerns that some pupils are missing out on classroom learning due to having to self-isolate It would be very difficult politically for the government to cancel exams five months in advance - the amount of disruption nationally to schooling is broadly in line with the amount that could have been anticipated. However, there is the very real question of fairness to candidates whose courses have been disrupted. Would changing the format of exams to allow a greater choice of questions be sufficient? An appeals system could be used to support candidates who had to self-isolate or any candidates who lost out because their teachers had to stay off work. Scotland's biggest teaching union, the EIS, is calling for a decision to be made sooner rather than later. General secretary Larry Flanagan said: ""Given the growing inequities in teaching time and the ongoing threat to an exam diet, the EIS believes it is prudent to make an early decision to switch to an alternative assessment model, although there are clear workload implications which would require to be addressed.""

Visitors with negative test can visit care homes,"People living in care homes in England will be able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas if the visitors test negative for Covid-19, the government has said. More than a million coronavirus tests will be sent to care homes over the next month to allow safe indoor visits. Visits will be allowed across all tiers of coronavirus restrictions. The health secretary said the move was possible due to ""unprecedented strides"" in testing technology and capacity. Matt Hancock said: ""The separation has been painful, but has protected residents and staff from this deadly virus. ""I'm so pleased we are now able to help reunite families and more safely allow people to have meaningful contact with their loved ones by Christmas."" Daily Covid tests to cut 14-day isolation trialled Visitor tests in all care homes 'by Christmas' Care home coronavirus tests a 'game-changer' Strict restrictions have been placed on visits to care homes during the last eight months because of the pandemic. Innew guidance,external, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says the ""default position"" is now that visits should be enabled to go ahead in all tiers - unless there is an outbreak in the care home. It adds that hand holding and hugging may be possible if other infection control measures are followed. It stresses the importance of visitors minimising contact as much as possible and wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) to help protect their loved ones. Care homes will manage the number of visits that take place, which must be arranged in advance, with visitors urged to be mindful of the additional workload for the care home. Each care home is responsible for setting the visiting policy in that home, it says. This will be welcome news for families in England who have waited a long time to be given the chance to visit loved ones and friends inside care homes, rather than trying to communicate through windows or on video calls. But therein lies the problem. The danger is that expectations will be raised of visits before Christmas which cannot all be fulfilled. The biggest care home operators have been sent rapid testing kits but the smaller providers have not yet heard details about how they can obtain them. One told me that, while welcoming the initiative, he was concerned at the level of administration which would be required to book in visits and organise the testing and this might mean taking on more staff. Some doubts have been raised about the effectiveness of the rapid testing technology with a relatively high number of false negatives if administered by less-trained staff. The scheme will not be fully rolled out by Christmas but officials hope it will be more accessible to the wider public early in the new year. More than a million quick-turnaround or ""lateral flow"" tests, which provide results in about 20 minutes without the need for a lab, are being sent out to England's 385 biggest care homes as part of the first phase of the rollout. The guidance says the number of test kits will allow up to two visitors per resident, based on them visiting twice a week, by Christmas. As well as the tests, an extra 46 million items of PPE will be sent to Care Quality Commission (CQC)-registered care home providers. The Alzheimer's Society urged the government to ensure care homes do not struggle with extra administrative costs so that visits can continue. The National Care Forum, a member association for not-for-profit social care providers, applauded the announcement, calling it a ""game-changing moment for visits"". But executive director Vic Rayner said recognition of what the sector needs to put the policy into practice ""remains an inherent weakness"". She added: ""It is essential that the government addresses this immediately, or else risks setting in train huge expectations around visiting, with no meaningful ability for care homes to deliver at the scale and pace required to make visiting a reality for all by Christmas."" And Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said it was good news that the government has ""significantly shifted"" its position on care home visiting. But she cautioned: ""The government has promised that everyone will be able to visit their loved one by Christmas and, while this is a laudable aim, it is also very ambitious, so we remain worried that practical difficulties of various kinds could get in the way for some.""

Thanks for joining us, we'll be back in the morning to bring you more updates. Today's coverage has been brought to you by: Marie Jackson, Becky Morton, Joshua Cheetham, Katie Wright, Jennifer Scott, Sean Fanning, Claire Heald and Suzanne Leigh. Our live coverage will be coming to a close shortly, on a day which has been dominated by the news that a vaccine will begin being rolled out in the UK next week. Here is a round-up of the main developments: Prof
Peter Openshaw, a government adviser and medical expert at Imperial College
London, said people should beware fake news and rumours about the safety of the
vaccine. He
told the BBC: ""If people do not want to have it that is completely up to
them."" He
added: ""I really believe it is a safe way to get vaccinated and
protected."" The
UK's regulator, the MHRA, says all of the vital checks and measures have been
done and no corners have been cut, meaning the jab is safe to recommend. A
snap poll by YouGov of 5,321 British adults suggests the majority of the public
is confident about the vaccine. Reality Check There have been claims that Brexit allowed the UK to approve a vaccine more quickly than the EU, but is that correct? The EU - through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - has yet to approve a coronavirus vaccine. But the idea that Brexit enabled the UK to press ahead and authorise one is not right. Under European law a vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but individual countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine for temporary use in their domestic market. Britain is still subject to those EU rules during the post-Brexit transition period which runs until the end of the year. The UK's own medicines regulator, the MHRA, confirmed this ina statement last month,external. And its chief executive, Dr June Raine, said today that ""we have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January"". It is true that, in general, regulation of new medicines is done on an EU-wide basis. But that does not take account of the emergency provisions in EU law which Dr Raine refers to. Read the full analysishere. After 266 long days, the return of fans to English league football is finally here. But as clubs in certain areas of England open their turnstiles for the first time in almost nine months, a BBC Sport poll suggestsfans are dividedover whether they should be allowed to return before a Covid-19 vaccine is rolled out. In a Savanta ComRes poll of 2,100 football fans, 52% said they should be allowed to return to watch matches in person before a vaccine is available, while 45% said they should not. The poll also shows:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Students will have staggered starting dates for returning to universities in England after Christmas- with some not back until 7 February. The government's plan would see students on hands-on, practical courses such as medicine going back from 4 to 18 January. Other subjects would be taught online until face-to-face teaching begins between 25 January and 7 February. Students are being promised Covid tests when they return to university next term. The plan, to avoid a surge of students and the risk of spreading coronavirus, will mean a staggered return for students over five weeks in the new year - with most courses starting online before a return to in-person teaching. Students will be offered two lateral flow Covid tests when they arrive back - similar to the process for their departure. The arrangements for next term have been announced on the eve of students being able to return home for Christmas. Labour's leader is calling for all parties to work together over the rollout of the vaccine. Speaking after the Downing Street press conference, Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""really important... whatever our political party, [we] work together to make sure that the rollout is
swift, safe and fair, and the people have confidence in it"". He says he has asked Boris Johnson to share No 10's plan for communicating the rollout. Sir Keir added: ""Then we will work
together so that the public can see cross-party consensus on this. ""This
rollout is one of the biggest logistical exercises since the Second World War. We need the best of Britain, we need parties pulling together, and I'm very
happy to put my party behind that effort."" The UK prime minister's press conference has just come to an end. So what did we learn from Boris Johnson, Simon Stevens and Jonathan Van-Tam? Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent ""It may be a
good thing, but on the other hand..."" The prime minister
doesn't seem very impressed with Jonathan Van-Tam's claim that coronavirus
safety measures may be with us long term. Boris Johnson
looked a bit baffled and says people want to reclaim their lives. ""I didn't mean
to challenge you,"" he says before the deputy chief medical officer then
clarifies his point that he hopes we'll get back to a much more
normal world as soon as possible. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the big unknowns about this vaccine â and the
others being developed â is whether it prevents transmission. It is possible that people who are vaccinated can still
pass on the virus to others. It will take time to establish to what extent this is
stopped. If it does stop transmission, once you have about 2/3 of
the population vaccinated it is possible you then reach herd immunity and the
virus stops spreading completely. But even if that doesnât happen, vaccinating all over 65s
- 12m people - will have a major impact on deaths. More than 90% of people who
have died have been over that age. That in itself would be enough to lead to significant
lifting of restrictions. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter The Pfizer vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective
at stopping people from becoming ill from the virus â the first priority for
getting life back to normal. But we donât yet know whether this vaccine stops people
spreading the virus. Both deputy chief medical officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam and NHS England head Simon Stevens stressed this point during todayâs
briefing. They are âvery hopefulâ it will also stop vaccinated people
from spreading the virus to others. And thereâs good precedent for this â the flu and MMR
(measles, mumps and rubella) jabs both stop vaccinated people from infecting
others. But for now, Van-Tam says, you canât watch others get it (the jab) and hope it will protect you. He encouraged everyone who is invited to be given the
vaccine to take up this opportunity, adding that low take-up of the vaccine will
âalmost certainly make restrictions last longerâ. In the final question, Van-Tam is asked if he can envisage a world where we can cast aside our masks and hand sanitiser for good. The deputy chief medical officer says he doesn't think we will eradicate coronavirus ""ever"", adding: ""It will be with humankind forever"". He also thinks it may become ""a seasonal problem"", like flu. ""Do I think there will be a big moment where we have a big party and throw off our masks? No I don't,"" says Van-Tam. Instead, he thinks the ""personal habit"" may carry on for some years, even if the government doesn't insist on the measures. And asked about the MPs that rebelled against the new tier system, the PM concludes the press conference saying: ""I totally understand people's frustrations with the tiering system. ""But we will make sure we are as local and as sensitive as we can possibly be [on restrictions]."" Asked whether the current coronavirus restrictions could be ended
early, the prime minister says the vaccine news âfor now makes absolutely no
differenceâ. However, he adds that there will come a moment to relax the ânon- pharmaceutical interventionsâ but âweâre not there yetâ. He stresses the moment when it is time to relax the rules is theoretical and there is âweeks,
months of work to goâ before we are in that position. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This is the day we have been waiting for. But it is clear listening to NHS England chief executive
Simon Stevens and deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van Tam that
there are some huge logistical challenges from here on in. First of all, supply. The UK is expecting 800,000 doses
in the next few days. But given there are 15 million people over the age of 65
and working in health and care sectors, and all need two doses, it is clear
getting more into the country is essential. Rollout is also difficult. Through a combination of the
need to keep the vaccine at ultra cold storage and the fact that the jab comes
in batches of 975 that cannot be split up at the moment, immunisation will only
be offered from a network of 50 hospitals to start with. It is why there is still so much hope pinned to the
Oxford University vaccine, that regulators are currently reviewing. That does
not need to be kept in ultra cold storage and so can be distributed much more
easily. Plus there are already millions of doses in the country. Then there is vaccine hesitancy. Officials have been at
pains to stress that despite the vaccine being developed in record time the
full testing and regulatory process has been followed. But the more people donât come forward, the longer
restrictions have to remain in place. There is a long way to go yet. Next up is a question on the vaccine roll-out again and about what stage it will be right to lift all the restrictions? Stevens says the ""goal"" of the vaccination programme is to ""protect vulnerable individuals"" - hence the graduated list of who will get it when - and to stop people spreading it. But we don't know yet if that vaccine will have the power to stop transmission. Van Tam points to the priority list, working down the ages and at risk groups, saying it is ""not an accident"" they take out 99% of groups linked to Covid related mortality deaths in the UK. Johnson says the reason the UK got the vaccine ahead of other countries is down to the vaccine task force's work. But they are ""global efforts of scientists around the world"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The prime minister
loves a colourful metaphor and so does Jonathan Van-Tam. Boris Johnson began
the briefing by saying science had performed a kind of biological jiu jitsu -
turning the virus on itself to make this vaccine. Soon after the
government's deputy chief medical officer likened it to a train arriving at a
station which people needed to get on and compared the vaccine to a yoghurt,
saying it couldn't be taken in and out of the fridge. Tabloid headline
writers will be able to take their pick. Beth Rigby from Sky News asks whether we should all still
prepare for restrictions to run until April. Boris Johnson says he accepts that the new tier system in
England is âtoughâ but he says the way forward is local restrictions and mass
testing to âkeep the virus under controlâ. He says he hopes places are able âto come down the tiersâ
before Easter, adding that it is necessary to have these measures alongside the
vaccine. Asked whether the PM expects to roll over the tier system at
the start of February, Johnson says the situation will be judged on the data but
âfor the time being youâve got to take it that tiering will be a very, very
important part of our campaign against coronavirus."" The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is the first one in the UK to be approved for use, with hopes people can start receiving the injection within a week. In the video below BBC health correspondent Laura Foster helps explain some of the logistics around how it will be rolled out. This video can not be played The next question is on care home residents, as despite scientists calling for them to get the vaccine first, the government says they may not. Johnson says: ""Of course we want to get it into care homes as fast as we possibly can"". But the issue is in distributing the cases of the vaccine. Each case has 975 vaccines in it, but you cannot currently divide it up, so the government wants to ""avoid wastage"". The PM says they are waiting to hear more, but they ""certainly"" want to get it to ""the most vulnerable"". Van-Tam says remarks about failure on care homes are ""extremely unfair when one considers a new virus emerged less than 12 months ago and we now have our first vaccine"". He adds: ""This is a complex product. It is not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in several times."" Now we turn to questions from journalists, and the BBCâs Fergus
Walsh asks, how important is this moment? Boris Johnson says itâs a âhuge momentâ and he agrees with
Jonathan Van-Tam that itâs also âa very moving thingâ. He says he is âlost in admirationâ for the way scientists can
solve problems. However, he adds that although itâs a fantastic moment, âthe
worst thing now would be to think that this the moment when we can relax our
guard and think that itâs game over"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
UK approves Pfizer Covid vaccine for rollout next week,"The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination. Britain's medicines regulator, the MHRA, says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe to be rolled out. The first doses are already on their way to the UK, with 800,000 due in the coming days, Pfizer said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS will contact people about jabs. Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff. But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine is wasted. A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the public not to get ""carried away with over optimism or falling into the naive belief that our struggle is over"". He tolda Downing Street news conference that, while the ""searchlights of science"" had created a working vaccine, significant logistical challenges remained. What are the safety checks for vaccines How will I get a vaccine? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years. The UK has already ordered 40 million doses of the jab - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. The doses will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Mr Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland will be immunised on Tuesday. Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the rollout of the Pfizer jab to care homes would be particularly difficult because of how it needs to be stored. Mr Gething said that it was not possible to transport the Pfizer vaccine to more than 1,000 care homes across Wales. The bulk of the rollout across the UK will be next year, Mr Hancock said, adding: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better."" There is a clear priority list for who gets the vaccine first - and care home residents and staff are top of it. But operational complexities mean the reality will be somewhat different. When the vaccines arrives, it will be sent straight to major hospitals who have the ultra-cold facilities to store it. From there it can be moved just once - and when it is, it must be kept in batches of 1,000. That means sending it out to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents in some places, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted. Because of that, the NHS, which is in charge of distributing the vaccine, will run clinics from hospitals at first. This will allow NHS and care home staff to get immunised first as well as, perhaps, some of the older age groups who come into hospital. It looks like it will not be until much more of the Pfizer vaccine is available or the Oxford University one, which is easier to distribute, is approved that care home residents will be able to get it. While Mr Hancock said that the government does not yet know how many people need to be vaccinated before restrictions can start being lifted, he added: ""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy."" Mr Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again."" Downing Street press secretary Allegra Stratton said Mr Johnson would not rule out receiving the vaccine jab live on television, though she said he would not want to take a jab meant for someone more vulnerable. The free vaccine will not be compulsory and there will be three ways of vaccinating people across the UK: Hospitals Vaccination centres ""a bit like the Nightingales project and including some of the Nightingales"", said Mr Hancock In the community, with GPs and pharmacists Around 50 hospitals are on stand-by and vaccination centres - in venues such as conference centres or sports stadiums - are being set up now. It is thought the vaccination network could start delivering more than one million doses a week once enough doses are available. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""This is a day to remember and, frankly, a year to forget"" NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the health service was preparing for ""the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country's history"". But experts said people still need to remain vigilant and follow rules to stop the virus spreading - including with social distancing, face masks and self-isolation. ""We can't lower our guard yet,"" said the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty. The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations and decided by the government. Mass immunisation of everyone over 50, as well as younger people with pre-existing health conditions, can happen as more stocks become available in 2021. Pfizer confirmed that the first stocks of the vaccine will be for the NHS, which will give them out for free based on clinical need. People in the UK will not be able to bypass this and buy the vaccine privately to jump the queue. The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. Most of the side effects are very mild, similar to the side effects after any other vaccine and usually last for a day or so, said Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chairman of the Commission on Human Medicine expert working group. The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people, he said. The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said that - despite the speed of approval - no corners have been cut. Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said. This video can not be played Dr June Raine from the MHRA: ""The safety of the public will always come first"" Giving the analogy of climbing a mountain, she said: ""If you're climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became available on 10 November we were at base camp. ""And then when we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us to today."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters The Pfizer/BioNTech was the first vaccine to publish positive early results from final stages of testing. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials. Covid vaccine: How will we keep it cold enough? Because the vaccine must be stored at around -70C, it will be transported in special boxes of up to 5,000 doses, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. And once out of the fridge it needs to be used within six hours. Other coronavirus vaccines are also being developed: One from Moderna uses the same mRNA approach as the Pfizer vaccine and offers similar protection - the UK has pre-ordered seven million doses that could be ready by the spring The UK has ordered 100 million doses of a different type of Covid vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca Russia has been using another vaccine, called Sputnik, and the Chinese military has approved another one made by CanSino Biologics. The World Health Organization's Dr David Nabarro said the Pfizer vaccine would not replace the other measures ""for a number of months, even a year, so we'll have to keep doing physical distancing, mask wearing, hygiene and isolating ourselves when we're sick"". He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme ""the vaccine will only start to dent the size of the pandemic somewhat later in the year"". The pace has been breathtaking. From an unknown virus at the start of the year to a vaccine approved by the regulator and ready to use in early December is an unprecedented timescale. At the Downing Street briefing, the MHRA's chief executive said it was like climbing Everest, with preparations starting in June and a team working ""night and day"" assessing early data and reaching ""base camp"" by early November when Pfizer/BioNtech published the trial results. At the same time, the MHRA was adamant that the process had been robust with safety considerations paramount. A rapid emergency approval process was used by the UK regulator. The European Medicines Agency is taking longer to reach a view and there has been some sniping from European politicians arguing their processes are more reliable and authoritative. But the MHRA is an internationally respected independent watchdog and for now those about to receive the first jabs will rely on its ruling.

Covid vaccine: How will we keep it cold enough?,"The government has begun distributing the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. However, it needs to be kept at a temperature of about -70C. Most other vaccines do not need this, so how will this be made to work? In the short-term, Pfizer has a plan. The vaccine will be distributed from its own centres in the US, Germany and Belgium. It will need to travel both on land and by air and possibly be stored in distribution centres, before being delivered to anywhere the vaccine will be given. Pfizer hasdeveloped a special transport box,externalthe size of a suitcase, packed with dry ice and installed with GPS trackers. Each reusable box can keep up to 5,000 doses of the vaccine at the right temperature for 10 days, if it remains unopened. Wiltshire-based firm Polar Thermals makes similar boxes for other vaccines and counts Pfizer among its clients, but not yet for this particular purpose. Polar Thermal's ""thermal shipper"" can be reused thousands of times The box is not likely to be cheap. Head of sales Paul Harrison says a standard chilled transport box, which will retain a temperature of up to -8C for five days and is big enough to hold 1,200 vaccines, costs about Â£5,000 per unit - although they can be reused thousands of times. His firm uses aerogel as insulation, rather than dry ice - which could be handy if a global carbon dioxide shortage from earlier this year continues to affect the availability of related products, such as dry ice. The US Compressed Gas Association, however, has saidit is committed to meeting demand.,external The vaccine can survive for a further five days once thawed, Pfizer has said, but this does not buy a great deal of extra time. In the longer-term, Public Health England says that in the UK ""national preparations"" are under way regarding both central storage and distribution of the vaccine across the country, but has not given details. As it stands, extreme cold storage is certainly not commonplace, and your local GP is unlikely to have it. Some institutions, such as universities and research labs, do have the right storage capacity. In the UK, universities shared resources at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, including PPE-making equipment and ventilators. How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine?

Q&A: How will the vaccine roll-out work in Wales?,"""It is tremendously exciting that only nine months on from the declaration of the pandemic, we have vaccines available to offer"" With up to 1.4 million people in line to get a Covid-19 vaccine in Wales in the months ahead, officials say it will be one of the biggest health programmes ever mounted. The UK has become the first country in the world toapprove the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccinefor widespread use. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe for use. But how will it be rolled out? Preparations in Wales started in June and the Welsh Government hopes the first vaccines will be given within seven to 14 days. To start with, everyone over 50 will be offered the vaccine in the coming months. Here we ask those behind the rollout what we should expect. There are a number of different vaccines in development with different ways of storage and administration There could well be seven different vaccines, eventually. The first available is the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTec. The UK government has bought 40 million doses. Each person getting this vaccine will need two doses, three weeks apart. Wales will get a share of around 4.8% based on its population. The next will be the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine and there will be many more doses of this available, with the UK government having ordered 100 million doses. Freezers holding doses of the mRNA vaccine, which will be the first to be rolled out The mRNA vaccine has to be stored at -75 C and also transported at that sub-zero temperature to the central locations where it will be used. There may be some transportation possible at normal refrigerated temperature, which would enable it to be taken to care homes, but otherwise it will require those on the priority list to get to special vaccination centres. The vaccines - in nearly 1,000 doses per package - have to be used within five days once opened. And the thawing and preparation process can take up to five days from when they arrive. How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Oxford's Covid vaccine 'dose error' explained Covid vaccines: Who decides if they are safe? ""It is tremendously exciting that only nine months on from the declaration of the pandemic, we have vaccines available to offer and a system in place to offer them,"" said Richard Roberts, head of the vaccine preventable disease programme at Public Health Wales. ""Some will be able to travel but some we would want to stay where they are  - a care home for example. If we can solve that problem of transporting the vaccine but when the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine comes online, that's a vaccine which we store in the fridge, we can move it around and it lasts six months."" About 60% of the Welsh population will be offered the vaccine at first Older, more vulnerable people and care home staff will be among the first to receive it. The Welsh Government will split the population into age groups to determine priority, based on advice form the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The order of priority is set to be: Older residents in care homes and care home workers All those 80 years and over and health and social care workers All those 75 years and over Those 70 and over, andclinically extremely vulnerable people,external- including those with cancer and kidney disease All aged 65 and over All individuals aged 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality All those 60 years and over All those 55 years and over All those 50 years and over The 40% remainder of the population, with order of priority to be determined The priority 10 groups represent 60% of the population but also 99% of all deaths linked to Covid-19. More information about the vaccine from Public Health Wales,external Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection. For context, around 900,000 flu vaccines were given over a period of 10 to 12 weeks last year - there are 1.4 million in the priority groups for the Covid vaccines. ""Although more complex because community locations are being used and the logistics with the vaccine, if we can match volume of delivery that we achieve with flu, then it will mean we will be able to roll out as quickly as possible,"" said Dr Roberts. You will be told. In the Cardiff and Vale health board, for example, Fiona Kinghorn, executive director for public health, said: ""We are already planning how we might vaccinate those in sequence, and different groups at the same time, and we'll call them, so when we are ready to vaccinate, they will receive a letter, and then in Cardiff and Vale, they will be able to ring our booking centre and book an appointment that is convenient for them."" Each health board will get its share and vaccines will go across Wales at the same time. Mass vaccination centres will be set up - particularly for the mRNA vaccine, which needs to be kept a very low temperatures. Cardiff and Vale health board has already said its mass vaccination centres will be at Splott and at leisure centres in Pentwyn and Barry. Officials say each site will have tight security and the vaccines will be guarded ""like a VIP"", as well as cyber and IT security measures being taken. Gill Richardson, chief adviser to the chief medical officer, said: ""It's been an incredible logistical exercise - we tested our pharmaceutical logistics colleagues but they've worked tirelessly to ensure there's an effective and safe vaccine across Wales. ""The vaccine can't be transported once it's diluted, it has to be used on the site. This is a vaccine that needs to be made up. It's not like the flu vaccine, where it comes ready-made and in single doses. It will be in vials which can serve five doses and it will be delivered so it can be used at those mass centres."" Health officials would like to see ""thousands rather than hundreds"" vaccinated in the first few weeks. It's likely those vulnerable and shielded people and those with chronic conditions, who would normally get the flu vaccine, will also be slotted in too as it is rolled down the age groups. Boris Johnson saw one of the labs which will make the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in Wrexham ""It's on the scale of the smallpox vaccination campaign [in the 1960s],"" said Dr Richardson. There is hope that the take-up will be at least 75%. It will be ""well into next year"" before the entire Welsh population has been vaccinated though, according to the Chief Medical Officer for Wales Dr Frank Atherton. ""It's fantastic news that we're going to be able to be starting this as soon as next week but everything else depends on when we get stocks and how quickly we can start to roll it out."" There is a balancing act in staffing the programme from within the NHS, to ensure not too many people are taken away from where they are needed. In the early stages, those who are already registered to vaccinate - with oversight by senior pharmacists and specialists - will be used to administer the vaccine. More people, including those that have not administered vaccines before, will be trained up in the coming months. Health boards are already recruiting retired nurses, midwives, pharmacists and therapists to train up. Those being given the Pfizer/BioNTec vaccine will receive two doses, three weeks apart. But the effectiveness of the vaccines will be studied to determine what form of immunity the vaccine gives and how long it might last. That in future could determine whether people need to be vaccinated again in future. The different vaccines might well have different characteristics on this. But Dr Richardson said they offered a ""fantastic message of hope"" Public health experts say you will still need to keep to guidelines around social distancing, hand-washing and using masks. Not everyone will be able to have vaccine and certainly not in the first phase. It will take some time to get back to normal. ""While vaccines are part of the answer, they are not the whole part"", said Swansea Bay health board's public health director Keith Reid. He is worried that people might think ""we are all saved and this will all soon be over"". You will not be able to mix and match between the vaccines - once you have received the first dose you must stick to it. It is also not recommended you get the jab within 28 days of testing positive or from when you first have onset of Covid symptoms. Beyond that, it is worth noting that previous exposure to Covid will not affect your eligibility for the vaccine or position within the priority list.

Demands for Senedd vote before pub alcohol ban,"Mark Drakeford says the rules will save 'hundreds and hundreds"" of lives Ministers have been accused of showing ""disrespect"" to the Welsh Parliament because its members will not get a chance to vote on the latest coronavirus restrictions before pubs have to stop serving alcohol. An opposition request for a debate was denied by the Senedd's presiding officer Elin Jones said a vote would be held in the chamber next Tuesday. Laws banning alcohol in pubs and restaurants are due to start on Friday. Hospitality venues will also have to close at 18:00 every night when the law changes on Friday. What do people in the pub think of alcohol ban? How many Covid deaths have there been in Wales? What are you allowed to do? The Welsh Government is facing calls to produce more evidence to support the restrictions,including from its own backbenches. Ms Jones said MSs would be able to table amendments to a Welsh Government debate at the next full meeting of the Senedd on Tuesday. That meant ""the Senedd has the opportunity therefore to debate and vote on the matter during the next plenary session"", she said. Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said he understood the presiding officer's ""balancing act"", but that it was ""a missed opportunity"". He said: ""We are a parliament. We are parliamentarians. If we are to be taken seriously we should have the opportunity to debate the issue and represent the people who put us here. ""I am grateful for your consideration presiding officer and I think it is the government that has missed the opportunity here and has in this particular instance, in my opinion, shown disrespect to the Welsh Parliament."" This video can not be played Mark Drakeford defends the new rules to tackle the spread of coronavirus Plaid Cymru MS Sian Gwenllian asked whether more pressure could be put on the government to hold a vote on the principle behind the regulations before they come into force on Friday. ""The changes happening on Friday are significant and we also need to see the evidence that has led to their introduction,"" she said. Defending the alcohol decision on Tuesday, Mr Drakeford said without the rules ""hundreds and hundreds of people in Wales who otherwise would have been alive will not be alive in 2021"". Earlier, Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said his chain would close its pubs in Wales from Friday, as staying open but only selling food had been ""ruinously expensive"" when tried in Scotland. He told BBC Radio Wales the rules had been made by ""people who have never run a business"". ""This new puritanism in Wales and elsewhere is madness, is economic madness,"" he said. ""I don't want to wind the Welsh up by criticising their first minister, but he's talking cobblers. ""There's very good evidence that lockdowns - and this is a type of lockdown, it's a quasi-lockdown - simply don't work... ""This scare tactic saying so many people are going to die is nonsense in my opinion."" Enzo Nigro says he was not expecting a ban on serving alcohol Enzo Nigro, the owner of Potters pub in Newport, said he was concerned by the new rules. ""We had 70 to 80 emails come through 10 minutes after the announcement, and everyone was wondering what was going on,"" he said. ""People don't really understand the rules because they thought we would be able to serve alcohol until 6 o'clock and not no alcohol at all. ""It's frustrating."" Conservatives say the rules are ""completely disproportionate"" in parts of Wales where the rate of infection is comparatively low. Plaid Cymru, which has backed most of the Welsh Government's restriction during the pandemic, has said ministers should find a ""sensible compromise"" that allows alcohol to be served until 19:00, with closing time an hour later. Mandy Jones, of the Independent Alliance for Reform in the Senedd, said a petition started by former MEP Nathan Gill ""shows that the public also agree with us in demanding that the Welsh Government publish the science they've used to justify this claim"". The petition showed more than 18,500 signatures on Wednesday evening. Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales will not be able to serve alcohol on the premises and they will have to close at 18:00. Only takeaway alcohol will be allowed when the new rules kick in on Friday. On Tuesday, Mr Drakeford pointed out that up to four people from different households will still be able to meet in bars and cafes, but without alcohol. ""Now I am sorry that is a significant deprivation for many people,"" he said. ""But the evidence is that when people drink then their behaviour changes and their behaviour changes in ways that make them and other people more vulnerable to the virus."" Without further action, he said modelling suggested between 1,000 and 1,700 more deaths would occur this winter. This video can not be played Last orders for 100 Brains pubs in Wales - as they close for Covid on Friday Mr Drakeford also said his government was publishing more information than any other administration in the UK. Incident management teams had ""repeatedly"" highlighted problems with alcohol and hospitality venues in outbreaks, he added. The boss of Brains, the biggest Welsh-owned brewery, hascalled the new alcohol rules ""closure by stealth""and announced more than 100 managed pubs will be closed from Friday. Brains data shared with BBC Wales shows between July and the end of November it served more than 850,000 customers at the 100 pubs it manages and had five inquiries from the Test, Trace, Protect scheme. Chief executive Alistair Darby said it was hard ""to believe that the latest restrictions which will force the closure of all of our managed pubs will do much to reduce transmission of the virus"". The company said three of its pubs were temporarily closed and deep cleaned after staff tested positive for coronavirus. A new tougher tier system of coronavirus restrictions for England began on Wednesday, as the country emerged from its lockdown,after the plan was approved by MPs, despite a major rebellion on the Tory benches. Under the highest, tier three, all hospitality venues must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway services. What do the new rules mean for pubs in Wales?

How does the Oxford vaccine compare?How will I get the coronavirus vaccine?Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it?What are the safety checks for vaccines?,"Covid vaccination campaigns are under way in the UK and across the world. A range of vaccines are being used to reduce people's chances of getting sick, needing hospital treatment or dying. It is more than a year since the virus first emerged, yet many people are still vulnerable. The restrictions on our lives help keep the virus in check as they reduce opportunities for the virus to spread. Vaccines teach our bodies to fight the infection and are ""the"" exit strategy from the pandemic. The three vaccine frontrunners are those developed byPfizer-BioNTech,ModernaandOxford-AstraZeneca. Pfizer and Moderna both developed RNA vaccines - a new approach that is incredibly quick to design. They inject a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code into the body, which starts producing part of the coronavirus and pushes the body to mount a defence. These have been approved for use in the UK, Europe and the US. The Oxford vaccine is subtly different as it uses a harmless virus to carry the same genetic material into the body. This has been approved in the UK and Europe. It is the easiest of the three to use as it can be stored in a fridge, rather than needing very cold temperatures. All three are supposed to be given as two doses. When will I get my Covid jab? How many people have been vaccinated in the UK so far? A single-dose Covid vaccine made by Janssen has now beenapproved for use in the UK. Twenty million doses of the jab, which was 85% effective in stopping severe illness from Covid-19 in trials, will arrive later this year. Because only one dose is needed - and the vaccine can be stored in a fridge - it could have a significant impact around the world. A billion doses are planned this year. Another jab,Novavax, is also being reviewed by drugs regulators. It uses a different, old-school, approach to vaccines - proteins from the virus and a chemical to prime the immune system are injected into the body. UK orders extra 40m doses of Valneva vaccine There are other noteworthy vaccines, even if they are not being used in Europe and the US. The Sinovac, CanSino and Sinopharm vaccines have been developed by scientists in China and deals have signed with other countries in Asia and South America. Around one million people in China are reported to have been given the Sinopharm injection. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed by Russia's Gamaleya Research Centre, is also effective according tolate stage trial results published in The Lancet. Some people have been immunised. The vaccine, which works in a similar way to the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines has also been deemed to be safe - and offer complete protection against hospitalisation and death. What do we know about China's coronavirus vaccines? What we know about India's coronavirus vaccines Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? It is hard to compare one company's results with another as their trials will have been conducted in slightly different ways and at different points in the pandemic. However, all the main vaccines seem to have a large impact on your chances of needing hospital treatment or dying from Covid. Nonetheless, one of the most important questions - do they stop you spreading the virus - remains unknown. Understanding which method produces the best results will be explored inchallenge trialswhere people are deliberately infected with the virus. What drugs can help treat coronavirus? New versions of the coronavirus are emerging in countries around the world. However, there is a warning sign from Janssen and Novavax, which have the first ""real-world"" data on the new variants. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all, but they emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target. We may need to change the vaccines we use in the future.

Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it?What are the safety checks for vaccines?,"The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is one of two being rolled out across the UK. The government aims to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by mid-February and has got off to a strong start, with more than four million jabs administered. The vaccine trains the immune system to fight coronavirus. It is a new type of jab called an RNA vaccine and uses a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack. The genetic material is encased in a tiny protective bubble of fat to get it into cells. The exact ingredients of the vaccine have not been made public, but other vaccines can contain other ingredients, like aluminium, to make them stable or more effective. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? This is the first RNA vaccine to be approved for use in humans. The concept has been researched before and people have been given them in clinical trials for other diseases. The vaccine will be considered by regulatory agencies around the world, who will decide whether the jab can be approved for use. NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, and the over 80s are first in line to receive the two vaccines being rolled out in the UK - Pfizer and Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab. About half of over-80s in the UK have now been vaccinated. People in England in their 70s, and those listed as clinically extremely vulnerable, are now beginning to receiving their offers of a jab. Out of the nine priority groups, those aged 50-54 are at the bottom of the current list. There will be a second phase, which will offer the vaccine to the other groups in the population. The vaccine was initially delivered in hospitals. It is now also being administered through GPs and care homes, as well as local vaccination centres in venues such as sports halls andmass vaccination hubsin places like cathedrals and sports halls. However, there are logistical challenges for the Pfizer vaccine: It must be keptat -70C during transportation The jab must be thawed before it is given to a patient It can be stored in a normal fridge for a few days before being used How do the Covid vaccines compare? It is impossible to know and we will find out only by waiting. If immunity does not last then it may be necessary to have annual vaccines, as we do for flu. The vaccine appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old and data from its phase three trial suggestsit works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities. Early evidencesuggests the Pfizer vaccine is likely to protect against a coronavirus variant that is spreading around the UK. Some people - such as those with a weak immune system - will not be able to have the vaccine. Nothing in medicine is 100% safe - even something we take without thinking, like paracetamol, poses risks. The data so far is reassuring - trials on 43,500 people discovered no safety concerns, although mild side effects, such as headaches and muscle aches, have been reported. If there were highly dangerous and common consequences of this vaccination, they should have become apparent. However, rarer side effects may emerge as millions of people are immunised. Hopefully yes, but not for some time. If enough people are immune then the virus would stop spreading and we would not need other measures. However, the manufacture and distribution of a vaccine will take some time. So testing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing are going to be a feature of our lives for a while yet. The vaccine has been designed and developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, and they own the intellectual property. They already have the manufacturing capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of this year, but could partner with others to increase capacity even further. We do not know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or just stops you from getting ill. We also don't know how protective the vaccine is in different age groups. These will be crucial for understanding how it will be used. About a dozen vaccines are in the final development stages. The Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab is also being used in the UK, and supplies of the approved Moderna vaccine should arrive in the spring.

Thanks for joining us, we'll be back in the morning to bring you more updates. Today's coverage has been brought to you by: Marie Jackson, Becky Morton, Joshua Cheetham, Katie Wright, Jennifer Scott, Sean Fanning, Claire Heald and Suzanne Leigh. Our live coverage will be coming to a close shortly, on a day which has been dominated by the news that a vaccine will begin being rolled out in the UK next week. Here is a round-up of the main developments: Prof
Peter Openshaw, a government adviser and medical expert at Imperial College
London, said people should beware fake news and rumours about the safety of the
vaccine. He
told the BBC: ""If people do not want to have it that is completely up to
them."" He
added: ""I really believe it is a safe way to get vaccinated and
protected."" The
UK's regulator, the MHRA, says all of the vital checks and measures have been
done and no corners have been cut, meaning the jab is safe to recommend. A
snap poll by YouGov of 5,321 British adults suggests the majority of the public
is confident about the vaccine. Reality Check There have been claims that Brexit allowed the UK to approve a vaccine more quickly than the EU, but is that correct? The EU - through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - has yet to approve a coronavirus vaccine. But the idea that Brexit enabled the UK to press ahead and authorise one is not right. Under European law a vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but individual countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine for temporary use in their domestic market. Britain is still subject to those EU rules during the post-Brexit transition period which runs until the end of the year. The UK's own medicines regulator, the MHRA, confirmed this ina statement last month,external. And its chief executive, Dr June Raine, said today that ""we have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January"". It is true that, in general, regulation of new medicines is done on an EU-wide basis. But that does not take account of the emergency provisions in EU law which Dr Raine refers to.

But as clubs in certain areas of England open their turnstiles for the first time in almost nine months, a BBC Sport poll suggestsfans are dividedover whether they should be allowed to return before a Covid-19 vaccine is rolled out. In a Savanta ComRes poll of 2,100 football fans, 52% said they should be allowed to return to watch matches in person before a vaccine is available, while 45% said they should not. The poll also shows:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Students will have staggered starting dates for returning to universities in England after Christmas- with some not back until 7 February. The government's plan would see students on hands-on, practical courses such as medicine going back from 4 to 18 January. Other subjects would be taught online until face-to-face teaching begins between 25 January and 7 February. Students are being promised Covid tests when they return to university next term. The plan, to avoid a surge of students and the risk of spreading coronavirus, will mean a staggered return for students over five weeks in the new year - with most courses starting online before a return to in-person teaching. Students will be offered two lateral flow Covid tests when they arrive back - similar to the process for their departure. The arrangements for next term have been announced on the eve of students being able to return home for Christmas. Labour's leader is calling for all parties to work together over the rollout of the vaccine. Speaking after the Downing Street press conference, Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""really important... whatever our political party, [we] work together to make sure that the rollout is
swift, safe and fair, and the people have confidence in it"". He says he has asked Boris Johnson to share No 10's plan for communicating the rollout. Sir Keir added: ""Then we will work
together so that the public can see cross-party consensus on this. ""This
rollout is one of the biggest logistical exercises since the Second World War. We need the best of Britain, we need parties pulling together, and I'm very
happy to put my party behind that effort."" The UK prime minister's press conference has just come to an end. So what did we learn from Boris Johnson, Simon Stevens and Jonathan Van-Tam? Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent ""It may be a
good thing, but on the other hand..."" The prime minister
doesn't seem very impressed with Jonathan Van-Tam's claim that coronavirus
safety measures may be with us long term. Boris Johnson
looked a bit baffled and says people want to reclaim their lives. ""I didn't mean
to challenge you,"" he says before the deputy chief medical officer then
clarifies his point that he hopes we'll get back to a much more
normal world as soon as possible. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the big unknowns about this vaccine â and the
others being developed â is whether it prevents transmission. It is possible that people who are vaccinated can still
pass on the virus to others. It will take time to establish to what extent this is
stopped. If it does stop transmission, once you have about 2/3 of
the population vaccinated it is possible you then reach herd immunity and the
virus stops spreading completely. But even if that doesnât happen, vaccinating all over 65s
- 12m people - will have a major impact on deaths. More than 90% of people who
have died have been over that age. That in itself would be enough to lead to significant
lifting of restrictions. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter The Pfizer vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective
at stopping people from becoming ill from the virus â the first priority for
getting life back to normal. But we donât yet know whether this vaccine stops people
spreading the virus. Both deputy chief medical officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam and NHS England head Simon Stevens stressed this point during todayâs
briefing. They are âvery hopefulâ it will also stop vaccinated people
from spreading the virus to others. And thereâs good precedent for this â the flu and MMR
(measles, mumps and rubella) jabs both stop vaccinated people from infecting
others. But for now, Van-Tam says, you canât watch others get it (the jab) and hope it will protect you. He encouraged everyone who is invited to be given the
vaccine to take up this opportunity, adding that low take-up of the vaccine will
âalmost certainly make restrictions last longerâ. In the final question, Van-Tam is asked if he can envisage a world where we can cast aside our masks and hand sanitiser for good. The deputy chief medical officer says he doesn't think we will eradicate coronavirus ""ever"", adding: ""It will be with humankind forever"". He also thinks it may become ""a seasonal problem"", like flu. ""Do I think there will be a big moment where we have a big party and throw off our masks? No I don't,"" says Van-Tam. Instead, he thinks the ""personal habit"" may carry on for some years, even if the government doesn't insist on the measures. And asked about the MPs that rebelled against the new tier system, the PM concludes the press conference saying: ""I totally understand people's frustrations with the tiering system. ""But we will make sure we are as local and as sensitive as we can possibly be [on restrictions]."" Asked whether the current coronavirus restrictions could be ended
early, the prime minister says the vaccine news âfor now makes absolutely no
differenceâ. However, he adds that there will come a moment to relax the ânon- pharmaceutical interventionsâ but âweâre not there yetâ. He stresses the moment when it is time to relax the rules is theoretical and there is âweeks,
months of work to goâ before we are in that position. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This is the day we have been waiting for. But it is clear listening to NHS England chief executive
Simon Stevens and deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van Tam that
there are some huge logistical challenges from here on in. First of all, supply. The UK is expecting 800,000 doses
in the next few days. But given there are 15 million people over the age of 65
and working in health and care sectors, and all need two doses, it is clear
getting more into the country is essential. Rollout is also difficult. Through a combination of the
need to keep the vaccine at ultra cold storage and the fact that the jab comes
in batches of 975 that cannot be split up at the moment, immunisation will only
be offered from a network of 50 hospitals to start with. It is why there is still so much hope pinned to the
Oxford University vaccine, that regulators are currently reviewing. That does
not need to be kept in ultra cold storage and so can be distributed much more
easily. Plus there are already millions of doses in the country. Then there is vaccine hesitancy. Officials have been at
pains to stress that despite the vaccine being developed in record time the
full testing and regulatory process has been followed. But the more people donât come forward, the longer
restrictions have to remain in place. There is a long way to go yet. Next up is a question on the vaccine roll-out again and about what stage it will be right to lift all the restrictions? Stevens says the ""goal"" of the vaccination programme is to ""protect vulnerable individuals"" - hence the graduated list of who will get it when - and to stop people spreading it. But we don't know yet if that vaccine will have the power to stop transmission. Van Tam points to the priority list, working down the ages and at risk groups, saying it is ""not an accident"" they take out 99% of groups linked to Covid related mortality deaths in the UK. Johnson says the reason the UK got the vaccine ahead of other countries is down to the vaccine task force's work. But they are ""global efforts of scientists around the world"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The prime minister
loves a colourful metaphor and so does Jonathan Van-Tam. Boris Johnson began
the briefing by saying science had performed a kind of biological jiu jitsu -
turning the virus on itself to make this vaccine. Soon after the
government's deputy chief medical officer likened it to a train arriving at a
station which people needed to get on and compared the vaccine to a yoghurt,
saying it couldn't be taken in and out of the fridge. Tabloid headline
writers will be able to take their pick. Beth Rigby from Sky News asks whether we should all still
prepare for restrictions to run until April. Boris Johnson says he accepts that the new tier system in
England is âtoughâ but he says the way forward is local restrictions and mass
testing to âkeep the virus under controlâ. He says he hopes places are able âto come down the tiersâ
before Easter, adding that it is necessary to have these measures alongside the
vaccine. Asked whether the PM expects to roll over the tier system at
the start of February, Johnson says the situation will be judged on the data but
âfor the time being youâve got to take it that tiering will be a very, very
important part of our campaign against coronavirus."" The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is the first one in the UK to be approved for use, with hopes people can start receiving the injection within a week. In the video below BBC health correspondent Laura Foster helps explain some of the logistics around how it will be rolled out. This video can not be played The next question is on care home residents, as despite scientists calling for them to get the vaccine first, the government says they may not. Johnson says: ""Of course we want to get it into care homes as fast as we possibly can"". But the issue is in distributing the cases of the vaccine. Each case has 975 vaccines in it, but you cannot currently divide it up, so the government wants to ""avoid wastage"". The PM says they are waiting to hear more, but they ""certainly"" want to get it to ""the most vulnerable"". Van-Tam says remarks about failure on care homes are ""extremely unfair when one considers a new virus emerged less than 12 months ago and we now have our first vaccine"". He adds: ""This is a complex product. It is not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in several times."" Now we turn to questions from journalists, and the BBCâs Fergus
Walsh asks, how important is this moment? Boris Johnson says itâs a âhuge momentâ and he agrees with
Jonathan Van-Tam that itâs also âa very moving thingâ. He says he is âlost in admirationâ for the way scientists can
solve problems. However, he adds that although itâs a fantastic moment, âthe
worst thing now would be to think that this the moment when we can relax our
guard and think that itâs game over"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Baby among five killed by car in pedestrian zoneOfficials say there is no sign the incident in Trier, Germany, was politically motivated.Europe","This video can not be played The scene in Trier after a car ploughed through a pedestrian area of the western German city of Trier A car has ploughed through a pedestrian area in the western German city of Trier, killing five people including a nine-week-old baby girl, police say. The driver, a 51-year-old local man, has been arrested. The prosecutor said the suspect had drunk a significant amount of alcohol. Authorities said they were not working on the assumption that the incident was politically or religiously motivated. The city's mayor described the scene as ""horrible"". Witnesses said people screamed in panic and some were thrown in the air by an SUV travelling at high speed in Trier's Brotstrasse and Simeonstrasse streets towards the city's famous Roman gate, the Porta Nigra. The incident happened at around 13:45 local time (12:45 GMT), and the suspect drove for 1km (0.62 miles) ""hitting people at random on his way"" before being stopped by a police car, Trier police spokesman Karl-Peter Jochem said earlier. The victims were three women, aged 25, 52 and 73.Police said the 45-year-old father of the baby was also killed.,externalHis wife and one-year-old son were injured and admitted to hospital. By Nick Beake, BBC News, Trier Central Trier is almost silent tonight. The flashing blue lights of dozens of police vehicles compete with the Christmas illuminations in front of the Porta Nigra, the famous Roman gate. Tonight it is an entrance to a large crime scene. The city, often claimed as Germany's oldest, is the now the latest to experience a horrific and fatal incident involving a vehicle and pedestrians so close to Christmas. Armed police stand guard at the edge of the cordon, which marks the point at which the suspect drove away from the scene. Two friends, Stacy and Karolina, told me they had come to light candles and remember those who had been killed. ""This is just a small place"", said Stacy. ""You never imagine this could happen."" Footage posted on social media appeared to show the presumed driver being held by several officers next to the damaged car. Police have been questioning the suspect, who was alone, and has been identified by German media as Bernd W. Initial indications ""suggest that psychiatric problems possibly played a role"", prosecutor Peter Fritzen told reporters. The man did not have a criminal record, had no fixed address and was living in the car, which had been lent to him by someone else. The incident happened in the centre of Trier Earlier, Mayor Wolfram Leibe said up to 15 people had been injured, some of them seriously. ""We [had] a driver who ran amok in the city... I just walked through the city centre and it was just horrible. There is a trainer lying on the ground, and the girl it belongs to is dead,"" he told a news conference. Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a statement: ""The news from Trier is very sad. My sympathy goes to the relatives of people who were torn from their lives so suddenly and forcibly. I also think of those who have suffered severe injuries and I wish them much strength."" The prosecutor said the suspect had drunk a significant amount of alcohol The incident has shocked Trier, a medieval city of around 110,000 people and 720km west of Berlin, near the border with Luxembourg. A Christmas market that is usually held in the area was cancelled this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but shops were open. Bollards that would usually be in place to protect the pedestrianised area because of the Christmas market were therefore not put up. The case brought back memories of the 2016 attack in Berlin whenan Islamist militant drove a hijacked truck into a Christmas market, killing 12 people and injuring dozens of others. He was shot dead by Italian police four days later. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Visitors with negative test can visit care homesMore than a million tests will be sent to care homes in England to allow safe indoor visits.UK,"People living in care homes in England will be able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas if the visitors test negative for Covid-19, the government has said. More than a million coronavirus tests will be sent to care homes over the next month to allow safe indoor visits. Visits will be allowed across all tiers of coronavirus restrictions. The health secretary said the move was possible due to ""unprecedented strides"" in testing technology and capacity. Matt Hancock said: ""The separation has been painful, but has protected residents and staff from this deadly virus. ""I'm so pleased we are now able to help reunite families and more safely allow people to have meaningful contact with their loved ones by Christmas."" Daily Covid tests to cut 14-day isolation trialled Visitor tests in all care homes 'by Christmas' Care home coronavirus tests a 'game-changer' Strict restrictions have been placed on visits to care homes during the last eight months because of the pandemic. Innew guidance,external, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says the ""default position"" is now that visits should be enabled to go ahead in all tiers - unless there is an outbreak in the care home. It adds that hand holding and hugging may be possible if other infection control measures are followed. It stresses the importance of visitors minimising contact as much as possible and wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) to help protect their loved ones. Care homes will manage the number of visits that take place, which must be arranged in advance, with visitors urged to be mindful of the additional workload for the care home. Each care home is responsible for setting the visiting policy in that home, it says. This will be welcome news for families in England who have waited a long time to be given the chance to visit loved ones and friends inside care homes, rather than trying to communicate through windows or on video calls. But therein lies the problem. The danger is that expectations will be raised of visits before Christmas which cannot all be fulfilled. The biggest care home operators have been sent rapid testing kits but the smaller providers have not yet heard details about how they can obtain them. One told me that, while welcoming the initiative, he was concerned at the level of administration which would be required to book in visits and organise the testing and this might mean taking on more staff. Some doubts have been raised about the effectiveness of the rapid testing technology with a relatively high number of false negatives if administered by less-trained staff. The scheme will not be fully rolled out by Christmas but officials hope it will be more accessible to the wider public early in the new year. More than a million quick-turnaround or ""lateral flow"" tests, which provide results in about 20 minutes without the need for a lab, are being sent out to England's 385 biggest care homes as part of the first phase of the rollout. The guidance says the number of test kits will allow up to two visitors per resident, based on them visiting twice a week, by Christmas. As well as the tests, an extra 46 million items of PPE will be sent to Care Quality Commission (CQC)-registered care home providers. The Alzheimer's Society urged the government to ensure care homes do not struggle with extra administrative costs so that visits can continue. The National Care Forum, a member association for not-for-profit social care providers, applauded the announcement, calling it a ""game-changing moment for visits"". But executive director Vic Rayner said recognition of what the sector needs to put the policy into practice ""remains an inherent weakness"". She added: ""It is essential that the government addresses this immediately, or else risks setting in train huge expectations around visiting, with no meaningful ability for care homes to deliver at the scale and pace required to make visiting a reality for all by Christmas."" And Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said it was good news that the government has ""significantly shifted"" its position on care home visiting. But she cautioned: ""The government has promised that everyone will be able to visit their loved one by Christmas and, while this is a laudable aim, it is also very ambitious, so we remain worried that practical difficulties of various kinds could get in the way for some."" Prof Martin Green, chief executive of Care England - the largest representative body for independent care providers - said: ""In order for these promising plans to land successfully, the sector must now be adequately supported by the government. ""We appreciate the continued risks associated with visits, but this represents a positive step forwards."" Separately, the government has published new guidance that may allow for some residents under the age of 65to spend time with their families at Christmas outside of care homes,external- if their provider agrees and carries out risk assessments.

"Trump inciting violence, Georgia Republican warns""It's all gone too far!"" says the voting systems manager as he rebukes fellow Republicans.US Election 2020","This video can not be played ""This has to stop... someone's gonna get killed"": Mr Sterling calls on President Trump to condemn the threats An election official in the US state of Georgia has said President Trump will bear responsibility for any violence that results from unsubstantiated election fraud claims he has stoked. ""It's all gone too far,"" Gabriel Sterling warned. ""It has to stop!"" He cited intimidation and death threats to workers in remarks on Tuesday. Georgia is carrying out a second recount of votes at the Trump camp's request. Joe Biden was declared a narrow winner in the key state. The second re-tally is showing no major changes, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said on Wednesday. He said no evidence of widespread fraud had been found to support Mr Trump's claims. Earlier Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said his team was trying to make sure ""that all legal votes are counted and all illegal votes are not"". ""No-one should engage in threats or violence, and if that has happened, we condemn that fully,"" he said. The plea in Georgia came afterUS Attorney General William Barr said his justice department had so far found no proofto back the president's claims of fraud in the election - the latest setback to the Trump camp's legal challenges in several states. What legal challenges remain for Trump? 'In his mind, he will not have lost' Georgia will also hold in January two run-off elections, which will determine who controls the Senate. Mr Trump's Republican party currently has a slim majority in the upper chamber, and a victory in the run-offs would allow it to counter the Democratic administration of President-elect Biden. However, if the Democrats win the two remaining seats, they would control half the seats in the Senate - and the vice-president would be able to act as a tie-breaker. The Democrats already control the lower chamber - the House of Representatives. At a news conference in Atlanta on Tuesday, Mr Sterling, the state's voting systems implementation manager, rebuked his fellow Republicans, including the president. He said a 20-year-old contractor in Gwinnett County for Dominion Voting Systems, which has become the subject of baseless right-wing conspiracy theories, had received death threats. The worker's family was also getting harassed, Mr Sterling added. The unnamed man had been threatened with a noose and accused of treason, Mr Sterling said, after transferring a report on ballot batches to a county computer so he could read it. Mr Sterling said he himself had a police guard outside his home, while the wife of Georgia's Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, was ""getting sexualised threats through her cell phone"". ""Mr president, you have not condemned these actions or this language,"" added Mr Sterling. ""Senators, you have not condemned these actions or this language. ""We need you to step up and if you're going to take a position of leadership, show some!"" He added: ""Death threats, physical threats, intimidation, it's too much, it's not right, they've lost the moral high ground to claim that it is."" This video can not be played ""Mr President-elect, how does your foot feel?"": Joe Biden is seen in his protective boot Mr Sterling also cited threats of violence against Chris Krebs, who was fired last month as head of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency after he disputed Mr Trump's fraud claims. Mr Sterling condemned Trump lawyer Joe DiGenova, who said on Monday that Mr Krebs should be ""taken out at dawn and shot"". Addressing Mr Trump directly, Mr Sterling continued: ""You have the right to go to the courts. What you don't have the ability to do, and you need to step up and say this, is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. ""Someone's going to get hurt, someone's going to get shot, someone's going to get killed, and it's not right."" He added: ""Be the bigger man here, and stop, step in, tell your supporters, don't be violent, don't intimidate. All that's wrong, it's un-American."" President Trump responded by retweeting a video of Mr Sterling's speech, but without referencing the concerns over threats of violence. Instead he doubled down on his allegations of election fraud, saying: ""Rigged election. Show signatures and envelopes. Expose the massive voter fraud in Georgia."" Allow Twitter content?

Before and since, he has fired off many more tweets on the same subject, all without credible evidence. He shared a conspiracy theory about voting machines in Georgia, claimed Mr Biden's win in Arizona was ""impossible"", the results in Nevada were ""fake"" and also claimed without proof: ""We won Michigan by a lot!"" On Wednesday morning, Mr Raffensperger criticised how the president had responded to the passionate plea from his colleague. ""Even after this office requested that President Trump try and quell the violent rhetoric being born out of his continuing claims of winning states where he obviously lost, he tweeted out 'expose the massive voter fraud in Georgia,'"" he said. ""This is exactly the kind of language that is at the base of a growing threat environment for election workers who are simply doing their jobs."" On Tuesday, the president's campaign filed a lawsuit with Wisconsin's supreme court challenging the state's presidential vote results. The petition came a day after Mr Biden was certified as the winner in the Midwestern state by about 20,000 votes. The Trump legal action challenges more than 220,000 ballots in Wisconsin based largely on technicalities. It alleges clerks filled out missing information on postal ballots and objects to an event where election officials collected and checked votes in a park in the city of Madison, rather than polling stations. Mr Trump and his allies have failed to make any significant headway in their efforts to challenge the results in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada. All these key swing states have certified results confirming a Biden victory. Attorney General Barr said on Tuesday that the justice departmentso far had ""not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election"". The comments were seen as a big blow to Mr Trump, as Mr Barr is a close ally. A DOJ spokesperson later stressed the department had not concluded its investigation.

Thanks for joining us, we'll be back in the morning to bring you more updates. Today's coverage has been brought to you by: Marie Jackson, Becky Morton, Joshua Cheetham, Katie Wright, Jennifer Scott, Sean Fanning, Claire Heald and Suzanne Leigh. Our live coverage will be coming to a close shortly, on a day which has been dominated by the news that a vaccine will begin being rolled out in the UK next week. Here is a round-up of the main developments: Prof
Peter Openshaw, a government adviser and medical expert at Imperial College
London, said people should beware fake news and rumours about the safety of the
vaccine. He
told the BBC: ""If people do not want to have it that is completely up to
them."" He
added: ""I really believe it is a safe way to get vaccinated and
protected."" The
UK's regulator, the MHRA, says all of the vital checks and measures have been
done and no corners have been cut, meaning the jab is safe to recommend. A
snap poll by YouGov of 5,321 British adults suggests the majority of the public
is confident about the vaccine. Reality Check There have been claims that Brexit allowed the UK to approve a vaccine more quickly than the EU, but is that correct? The EU - through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - has yet to approve a coronavirus vaccine. But the idea that Brexit enabled the UK to press ahead and authorise one is not right. Under European law a vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but individual countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine for temporary use in their domestic market. Britain is still subject to those EU rules during the post-Brexit transition period which runs until the end of the year. The UK's own medicines regulator, the MHRA, confirmed this ina statement last month,external. And its chief executive, Dr June Raine, said today that ""we have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January"". It is true that, in general, regulation of new medicines is done on an EU-wide basis. But that does not take account of the emergency provisions in EU law which Dr Raine refers to. Read the full analysishere. After 266 long days, the return of fans to English league football is finally here. But as clubs in certain areas of England open their turnstiles for the first time in almost nine months, a BBC Sport poll suggestsfans are dividedover whether they should be allowed to return before a Covid-19 vaccine is rolled out. In a Savanta ComRes poll of 2,100 football fans, 52% said they should be allowed to return to watch matches in person before a vaccine is available, while 45% said they should not. The poll also shows:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Students will have staggered starting dates for returning to universities in England after Christmas- with some not back until 7 February. The government's plan would see students on hands-on, practical courses such as medicine going back from 4 to 18 January. Other subjects would be taught online until face-to-face teaching begins between 25 January and 7 February. Students are being promised Covid tests when they return to university next term. The plan, to avoid a surge of students and the risk of spreading coronavirus, will mean a staggered return for students over five weeks in the new year - with most courses starting online before a return to in-person teaching. Students will be offered two lateral flow Covid tests when they arrive back - similar to the process for their departure. The arrangements for next term have been announced on the eve of students being able to return home for Christmas. Labour's leader is calling for all parties to work together over the rollout of the vaccine. Speaking after the Downing Street press conference, Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""really important... whatever our political party, [we] work together to make sure that the rollout is
swift, safe and fair, and the people have confidence in it"". He says he has asked Boris Johnson to share No 10's plan for communicating the rollout. Sir Keir added: ""Then we will work
together so that the public can see cross-party consensus on this. ""This
rollout is one of the biggest logistical exercises since the Second World War. We need the best of Britain, we need parties pulling together, and I'm very
happy to put my party behind that effort."" The UK prime minister's press conference has just come to an end. So what did we learn from Boris Johnson, Simon Stevens and Jonathan Van-Tam? Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent ""It may be a
good thing, but on the other hand..."" The prime minister
doesn't seem very impressed with Jonathan Van-Tam's claim that coronavirus
safety measures may be with us long term. Boris Johnson
looked a bit baffled and says people want to reclaim their lives. ""I didn't mean
to challenge you,"" he says before the deputy chief medical officer then
clarifies his point that he hopes we'll get back to a much more
normal world as soon as possible. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the big unknowns about this vaccine â and the
others being developed â is whether it prevents transmission. It is possible that people who are vaccinated can still
pass on the virus to others. It will take time to establish to what extent this is
stopped. If it does stop transmission, once you have about 2/3 of
the population vaccinated it is possible you then reach herd immunity and the
virus stops spreading completely. But even if that doesnât happen, vaccinating all over 65s
- 12m people - will have a major impact on deaths. More than 90% of people who
have died have been over that age. That in itself would be enough to lead to significant
lifting of restrictions. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter The Pfizer vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective
at stopping people from becoming ill from the virus â the first priority for
getting life back to normal. But we donât yet know whether this vaccine stops people
spreading the virus. Both deputy chief medical officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam and NHS England head Simon Stevens stressed this point during todayâs
briefing. They are âvery hopefulâ it will also stop vaccinated people
from spreading the virus to others. And thereâs good precedent for this â the flu and MMR
(measles, mumps and rubella) jabs both stop vaccinated people from infecting
others. But for now, Van-Tam says, you canât watch others get it (the jab) and hope it will protect you. He encouraged everyone who is invited to be given the
vaccine to take up this opportunity, adding that low take-up of the vaccine will
âalmost certainly make restrictions last longerâ. In the final question, Van-Tam is asked if he can envisage a world where we can cast aside our masks and hand sanitiser for good. The deputy chief medical officer says he doesn't think we will eradicate coronavirus ""ever"", adding: ""It will be with humankind forever"". He also thinks it may become ""a seasonal problem"", like flu. ""Do I think there will be a big moment where we have a big party and throw off our masks? No I don't,"" says Van-Tam. Instead, he thinks the ""personal habit"" may carry on for some years, even if the government doesn't insist on the measures. And asked about the MPs that rebelled against the new tier system, the PM concludes the press conference saying: ""I totally understand people's frustrations with the tiering system. ""But we will make sure we are as local and as sensitive as we can possibly be [on restrictions]."" Asked whether the current coronavirus restrictions could be ended
early, the prime minister says the vaccine news âfor now makes absolutely no
differenceâ. However, he adds that there will come a moment to relax the ânon- pharmaceutical interventionsâ but âweâre not there yetâ. He stresses the moment when it is time to relax the rules is theoretical and there is âweeks,
months of work to goâ before we are in that position. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This is the day we have been waiting for. But it is clear listening to NHS England chief executive
Simon Stevens and deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van Tam that
there are some huge logistical challenges from here on in. First of all, supply. The UK is expecting 800,000 doses
in the next few days. But given there are 15 million people over the age of 65
and working in health and care sectors, and all need two doses, it is clear
getting more into the country is essential. Rollout is also difficult. Through a combination of the
need to keep the vaccine at ultra cold storage and the fact that the jab comes
in batches of 975 that cannot be split up at the moment, immunisation will only
be offered from a network of 50 hospitals to start with. It is why there is still so much hope pinned to the
Oxford University vaccine, that regulators are currently reviewing. That does
not need to be kept in ultra cold storage and so can be distributed much more
easily. Plus there are already millions of doses in the country. Then there is vaccine hesitancy. Officials have been at
pains to stress that despite the vaccine being developed in record time the
full testing and regulatory process has been followed. But the more people donât come forward, the longer
restrictions have to remain in place. There is a long way to go yet. Next up is a question on the vaccine roll-out again and about what stage it will be right to lift all the restrictions? Stevens says the ""goal"" of the vaccination programme is to ""protect vulnerable individuals"" - hence the graduated list of who will get it when - and to stop people spreading it. But we don't know yet if that vaccine will have the power to stop transmission. Van Tam points to the priority list, working down the ages and at risk groups, saying it is ""not an accident"" they take out 99% of groups linked to Covid related mortality deaths in the UK. Johnson says the reason the UK got the vaccine ahead of other countries is down to the vaccine task force's work. But they are ""global efforts of scientists around the world"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The prime minister
loves a colourful metaphor and so does Jonathan Van-Tam. Boris Johnson began
the briefing by saying science had performed a kind of biological jiu jitsu -
turning the virus on itself to make this vaccine. Soon after the
government's deputy chief medical officer likened it to a train arriving at a
station which people needed to get on and compared the vaccine to a yoghurt,
saying it couldn't be taken in and out of the fridge. Tabloid headline
writers will be able to take their pick. Beth Rigby from Sky News asks whether we should all still
prepare for restrictions to run until April. Boris Johnson says he accepts that the new tier system in
England is âtoughâ but he says the way forward is local restrictions and mass
testing to âkeep the virus under controlâ. He says he hopes places are able âto come down the tiersâ
before Easter, adding that it is necessary to have these measures alongside the
vaccine. Asked whether the PM expects to roll over the tier system at
the start of February, Johnson says the situation will be judged on the data but
âfor the time being youâve got to take it that tiering will be a very, very
important part of our campaign against coronavirus."" The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is the first one in the UK to be approved for use, with hopes people can start receiving the injection within a week. In the video below BBC health correspondent Laura Foster helps explain some of the logistics around how it will be rolled out. This video can not be played The next question is on care home residents, as despite scientists calling for them to get the vaccine first, the government says they may not. Johnson says: ""Of course we want to get it into care homes as fast as we possibly can"". But the issue is in distributing the cases of the vaccine. Each case has 975 vaccines in it, but you cannot currently divide it up, so the government wants to ""avoid wastage"". The PM says they are waiting to hear more, but they ""certainly"" want to get it to ""the most vulnerable"". Van-Tam says remarks about failure on care homes are ""extremely unfair when one considers a new virus emerged less than 12 months ago and we now have our first vaccine"". He adds: ""This is a complex product. It is not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in several times."" Now we turn to questions from journalists, and the BBCâs Fergus
Walsh asks, how important is this moment? Boris Johnson says itâs a âhuge momentâ and he agrees with
Jonathan Van-Tam that itâs also âa very moving thingâ. He says he is âlost in admirationâ for the way scientists can
solve problems. However, he adds that although itâs a fantastic moment, âthe
worst thing now would be to think that this the moment when we can relax our
guard and think that itâs game over"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
New Covid tier system comes into force in EnglandMore than 55 million people must abide by the two strictest levels after MPs approved the measures.,"This video can not be played Shoppers queue as stores reopen in Birmingham Shoppers have returned to the High Street in England, after non-essential retailers opened their doors at the end of a four-week national lockdown. Athree-tiered system of Covid-19 rules has now come into forcein the nation, with gyms and businesses such as hairdressers also able to open. More than 55 million people are in the strictest two tiers and cannot mix indoors with those in other households. The government said it would ""safeguard the gains made during the past month"". At a Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he accepted that the tiered system was ""tough"", but insisted that regional restrictions and mass testing were the way to ""keep the virus under control"". He said he hoped that places would be able ""to come down the tiers"" before Easter, while stressing that the tier restrictions would continue to be a ""very important"" part of battling coronavirus. Government publishes data behind stricter tiers Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? Keeping pools closed 'a catastrophe for health' 'We've lost a day of trade' over lockdown end date There were queues outside stores across England early on Wednesday as shoppers returned to High Street giants such as Primark. And people arrived promptly to take advantage ofa stock clearance sale at Debenhams department storefrom 07:00 GMT. Some retailers are extending their trading hours to try to recoup the loss in sales over the lockdown. It comes after a period which has seenthe collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia group,women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ©and the failure ofDebenhams to secure a buyer- putting a total of more than 25,000 jobs at risk. Footfall at UK shops was up by 64.5% compared to last week, butdown by 24.1%on the same day last year, according to analyst Springboard. Queues were seen outside Primark in Birmingham early on Wednesday Shoppers also headed to London's Oxford Street A swimmer takes to the water at London's Serpentine Swimming Club as outdoor swimming pools are also allowed to reopen Jordan Roberts, 19, was among a dozen people queuing outside Selfridges in London's Oxford Street before the department store opened its doors - and shoppers were welcomed by store workers dressed as elves on roller skates. She said she was there to do her Christmas shopping, adding: ""It feels more enjoyable being in a store and things run out of stock online."" Another London shopper, Tamara Rass, 44, said she hit the stores early as she expected they would be busy. ""For me, it's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and getting back to normality,"" she said. ""There are things in store that I can't get online and I like to treat my daughter once a month."" Elsewhere, there were also reports of ""steady"" footfall in England's town centres.

Transport for London said 760,000 journeys were made on the London Underground network on Wednesday from the start of service until 10:00 GMT - up 14% on last week, but only 31% of normal demand. There were 970,000 bus journeys made. This was up 8% on last week and 57% of pre-pandemic levels. British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said businesses were looking forward to welcoming back customers,with billions lost in sales during the lockdown, adding ""every purchase we make is a retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported"". The government has also announced that people living in care homes in England willbe able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas, if the visitors test negative for coronavirus. And later on Wednesdayabout 10,000 fans will be allowed into six games in the English Football Leaguefor the first time, other than a few pilot games, since March. England's new tiered system wasbacked by MPs in a Commons votejust hours before it came into effect, despite 55 Tories voting against PM Boris Johnson's plan. The latest restrictions are tougher than the previous tier system that was in place before the lockdown was introduced on 5 November. Under the system every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers. In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors. And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues. Scotlandoperates a five-tier systemwhile Wales and Northern Ireland havetheir own coronavirus restrictions- with the latter currently ina two-week circuit breaker lockdown. On Wednesday, a further 16,170 people tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK, while a further 648 deaths were reported within 28 days of a positive test.

He also thinks it may become ""a seasonal problem"", like flu. ""Do I think there will be a big moment where we have a big party and throw off our masks? No I don't,"" says Van-Tam. Instead, he thinks the ""personal habit"" may carry on for some years, even if the government doesn't insist on the measures. And asked about the MPs that rebelled against the new tier system, the PM concludes the press conference saying: ""I totally understand people's frustrations with the tiering system. ""But we will make sure we are as local and as sensitive as we can possibly be [on restrictions]."" Asked whether the current coronavirus restrictions could be ended
early, the prime minister says the vaccine news âfor now makes absolutely no
differenceâ. However, he adds that there will come a moment to relax the ânon- pharmaceutical interventionsâ but âweâre not there yetâ. He stresses the moment when it is time to relax the rules is theoretical and there is âweeks,
months of work to goâ before we are in that position. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This is the day we have been waiting for. But it is clear listening to NHS England chief executive
Simon Stevens and deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van Tam that
there are some huge logistical challenges from here on in. First of all, supply. The UK is expecting 800,000 doses
in the next few days. But given there are 15 million people over the age of 65
and working in health and care sectors, and all need two doses, it is clear
getting more into the country is essential. Rollout is also difficult. Through a combination of the
need to keep the vaccine at ultra cold storage and the fact that the jab comes
in batches of 975 that cannot be split up at the moment, immunisation will only
be offered from a network of 50 hospitals to start with. It is why there is still so much hope pinned to the
Oxford University vaccine, that regulators are currently reviewing. That does
not need to be kept in ultra cold storage and so can be distributed much more
easily. Plus there are already millions of doses in the country. Then there is vaccine hesitancy. Officials have been at
pains to stress that despite the vaccine being developed in record time the
full testing and regulatory process has been followed. But the more people donât come forward, the longer
restrictions have to remain in place. There is a long way to go yet. Next up is a question on the vaccine roll-out again and about what stage it will be right to lift all the restrictions? Stevens says the ""goal"" of the vaccination programme is to ""protect vulnerable individuals"" - hence the graduated list of who will get it when - and to stop people spreading it. But we don't know yet if that vaccine will have the power to stop transmission. Van Tam points to the priority list, working down the ages and at risk groups, saying it is ""not an accident"" they take out 99% of groups linked to Covid related mortality deaths in the UK. Johnson says the reason the UK got the vaccine ahead of other countries is down to the vaccine task force's work. But they are ""global efforts of scientists around the world"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The prime minister
loves a colourful metaphor and so does Jonathan Van-Tam. Boris Johnson began
the briefing by saying science had performed a kind of biological jiu jitsu -
turning the virus on itself to make this vaccine. Soon after the
government's deputy chief medical officer likened it to a train arriving at a
station which people needed to get on and compared the vaccine to a yoghurt,
saying it couldn't be taken in and out of the fridge. Tabloid headline
writers will be able to take their pick. Beth Rigby from Sky News asks whether we should all still
prepare for restrictions to run until April. Boris Johnson says he accepts that the new tier system in
England is âtoughâ but he says the way forward is local restrictions and mass
testing to âkeep the virus under controlâ. He says he hopes places are able âto come down the tiersâ
before Easter, adding that it is necessary to have these measures alongside the
vaccine. Asked whether the PM expects to roll over the tier system at
the start of February, Johnson says the situation will be judged on the data but
âfor the time being youâve got to take it that tiering will be a very, very
important part of our campaign against coronavirus."" The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is the first one in the UK to be approved for use, with hopes people can start receiving the injection within a week. In the video below BBC health correspondent Laura Foster helps explain some of the logistics around how it will be rolled out. This video can not be played The next question is on care home residents, as despite scientists calling for them to get the vaccine first, the government says they may not. Johnson says: ""Of course we want to get it into care homes as fast as we possibly can"". But the issue is in distributing the cases of the vaccine. Each case has 975 vaccines in it, but you cannot currently divide it up, so the government wants to ""avoid wastage"". The PM says they are waiting to hear more, but they ""certainly"" want to get it to ""the most vulnerable"". Van-Tam says remarks about failure on care homes are ""extremely unfair when one considers a new virus emerged less than 12 months ago and we now have our first vaccine"". He adds: ""This is a complex product. It is not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in several times."" Now we turn to questions from journalists, and the BBCâs Fergus
Walsh asks, how important is this moment? Boris Johnson says itâs a âhuge momentâ and he agrees with
Jonathan Van-Tam that itâs also âa very moving thingâ. He says he is âlost in admirationâ for the way scientists can
solve problems. However, he adds that although itâs a fantastic moment, âthe
worst thing now would be to think that this the moment when we can relax our
guard and think that itâs game over"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
US scuba boat captain charged with 34 fire deaths,"This video can not be played Family and friends mourn those lost in California dive-boat fire. The captain of a scuba-diving boat that was destroyed by fire last year off California has been charged with 34 counts of seaman's manslaughter. Jerry Nehl Boylan caused the deaths of those aboard the Conception ""by his misconduct, negligence and inattention to his duties"", says the indictment. Prosecutors allege the 67 year old failed to have a night watchman or conduct fire drills as required by law. All 33 passengers and a crew member sleeping below deck died. Family of five among dead in California boat fire Mr Boylan was among five crew members who managed to escape the blaze on the 75-ft (23m) vessel off Santa Barbara on 2 September 2019. He is expected to surrender to the authorities at a later date. Each charge of seaman's manslaughter carries up to 10 years in federal prison. Firefighters were unable to board the vessel to put the fire out as flames has already taken hold Kristi Johnson, assistant director of the FBI's Los Angeles field office, said on Tuesday: ""This tragedy forever altered the lives of so many families and loved ones, and it deeply affected members of the public who watched in horror. We continue to grieve with them. ""Our hope is that this indictment leads to the prevention of boating accidents and the senseless destruction of lives through proper precautions and training."" Mr Boylan has not publicly commented on the charges. The fire broke out in the early hours of the morning while the Conception was moored in Platt's Harbour near Santa Cruz Island, south of Santa Barbara. At the time, it had been hosting a diving expedition over the Labour Day holiday weekend. A US National Transportation Safety Board investigation determined the fire began in a middle deck area where lithium-ion batteries were being charged, though it was unclear exactly what ignited the blaze. Those who survived had been above deck when the blaze broke out. They escaped by jumping overboard and swimming to another vessel nearby, called the Great Escape. The crew members told investigators that the flames were too intense to save anyone trapped in the passenger quarters. A grand jury cited three federal safety violations: failure to assign a night watch or roving patrol, to conduct sufficient crew training or to conduct adequate fire drills.

Man injured in Craigavon 'explosion',"A resident from the Enniskeen estate described hearing a ""very large bang"" on Tuesday evening A man injured after a pipe bomb partially exploded in Craigavon has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, police have said. The incident happened at about 21:30 GMT in the Enniskeen area on Tuesday. The man suffered non-life threatening injuries to his chest and hands and had to be taken to hospital for treatment. A number of homes were evacuated, but residents have since been allowed to return. Det Insp Simpson said the alert was triggered after police received a report of an explosion at the rear of a house in the estate. ""Upon arrival officers found a man in the vicinity of where the explosion was reported to have occurred being treated by paramedics for injuries received after the device exploded,"" he said. ""The injured man, who has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and possession of an explosive device with intent to endanger life, currently remains in hospital receiving treatment for his injuries which are described as not life threatening."" Remnants of a pipe bomb-type device have been taken away for forensic examination, the officer added. The security alert is now over and police thanked local residents for their patience during the incident. An Enniskeen estate resident described hearing a ""very large bang"" shortly before 21:30 on Tuesday, which he believed was a pipe bomb explosion. He added that a while later, the police helicopter flew over the area. Police at the scene of the incident Upper Bann MP Carla Lockhart told BBC News NI the people of Enniskeen had been subjected to attacks for quite some time and did not want them to continue. Ms Lockhart described the explosion as ""a very worrying development"". The Democratic Unionist Party politician praised St Saviour's Church for providing shelter to people whose homes were evacuated and called on anyone with information about the attack to contact police. ""Obviously information is key to answering all the questions as to what happened in Enniskeen,"" she said. ""Those who cause hurt and disruption in our communities must be brought to justice."" Local representatives said the Enniskeen estate was a ""close-knit community"" SDLP councillor Thomas Larkham said: ""This is the last thing that anyone in Enniskeen wants or needs. ""This is a close-knit community full of people trying to get on with their lives during a difficult time for us all."" Alliance Party councillor EÃ³in Tennyson said: ""The patience of residents who have had to leave their homes as police work to make the area safe is greatly appreciated. ""Those behind this have nothing to offer only misery and destruction."" Mr Tennyson added: ""These kinds of devices have no place in our streets, there's no support in the community for this kind of activity. ""I would utterly condemn those responsible, they've been reckless in their behaviour and have shown total disregard for local residents.""

Shops offer festive discounts in battle for survival,"Shop prices are falling in the run-up to Christmas as retailers race to clear stock amid a ""deepening"" High Street crisis, a report has said. Discounts are most common at retailers selling fashion and DIY goods, according to the British Retail Consortium's (BRC) Shop Price Index. Overall, it found prices of goods excluding food fell 3.7% in November. Market researchers Mintel and Springboard say they see similar trends and expect further falls in December. The BRC said the discounting reflected ""an extremely challenging year"" for retailers after trade was put on hold because of lockdowns. ""As we approach Christmas, consumers will be glad to see another month of falling prices,"" said boss Helen Dickinson. ""Where demand was weak for some products, discounting has followed, with many retailers trying to encourage more consumer spending, particularly those selling fashion and DIY goods."" Next, M&S and Wilko shun Black Friday sales Why bots will beat you to in-demand gifts The BRC's Shop Price Index tracked the price of 500 of the most commonly bought High Street products from 2 to 6 November - a period that crossed into the start of England's second national lockdown. Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard, said pre-Christmas discounts were not new, but that there would be more deals than usual this year as non-essential shops tried to make up for lost sales. ""Many retailers will have committed to orders, not had enough time to cancel and then ended up lumbered with stock,"" she told the BBC. ""They won't be able to sell things like seasonal gift sets and certain fashion lines in the new year, so we expect lots of discounts on those."" Retailers are also trying to get people to do their Christmas shopping earlier, fearing a spike in online orders that will be hard to fulfil, said Nick Carroll, associate director of retail at Mintel. This partly explains why this year's Black Friday sale had lasted longer than usual, with deals available as early as 1 November, he said. ""We've seen huge pressure on logistics operations and people not able to get their goods on time, so the more demand is spread out out, the easier it will be."" The pandemic continues to batter retailers, putting thousands of jobs at risks. This weekTopshop owner Arcadia fell into administration, whileDebenhams announced it would shut its 124 UK storesafter last-ditch rescue talks failed. The BRC's Ms Dickinson said businesses shuttered during lockdown had ""lost billions in sales and many are now in a precarious financial position"".

"Demands for Senedd vote before pub alcohol banCalls are made for a vote before Friday, when new Covid rules stop pubs across Wales serving alcohol.Wales politics","Mark Drakeford says the rules will save 'hundreds and hundreds"" of lives Ministers have been accused of showing ""disrespect"" to the Welsh Parliament because its members will not get a chance to vote on the latest coronavirus restrictions before pubs have to stop serving alcohol. An opposition request for a debate was denied by the Senedd's presiding officer Elin Jones said a vote would be held in the chamber next Tuesday. Laws banning alcohol in pubs and restaurants are due to start on Friday. Hospitality venues will also have to close at 18:00 every night when the law changes on Friday. What do people in the pub think of alcohol ban? How many Covid deaths have there been in Wales? What are you allowed to do? The Welsh Government is facing calls to produce more evidence to support the restrictions,including from its own backbenches. Ms Jones said MSs would be able to table amendments to a Welsh Government debate at the next full meeting of the Senedd on Tuesday. That meant ""the Senedd has the opportunity therefore to debate and vote on the matter during the next plenary session"", she said. Conservative health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said he understood the presiding officer's ""balancing act"", but that it was ""a missed opportunity"". He said: ""We are a parliament. We are parliamentarians. If we are to be taken seriously we should have the opportunity to debate the issue and represent the people who put us here. ""I am grateful for your consideration presiding officer and I think it is the government that has missed the opportunity here and has in this particular instance, in my opinion, shown disrespect to the Welsh Parliament."" This video can not be played Mark Drakeford defends the new rules to tackle the spread of coronavirus Plaid Cymru MS Sian Gwenllian asked whether more pressure could be put on the government to hold a vote on the principle behind the regulations before they come into force on Friday. ""The changes happening on Friday are significant and we also need to see the evidence that has led to their introduction,"" she said. Defending the alcohol decision on Tuesday, Mr Drakeford said without the rules ""hundreds and hundreds of people in Wales who otherwise would have been alive will not be alive in 2021"". Earlier, Wetherspoon chairman Tim Martin said his chain would close its pubs in Wales from Friday, as staying open but only selling food had been ""ruinously expensive"" when tried in Scotland. He told BBC Radio Wales the rules had been made by ""people who have never run a business"". ""This new puritanism in Wales and elsewhere is madness, is economic madness,"" he said. ""I don't want to wind the Welsh up by criticising their first minister, but he's talking cobblers. ""There's very good evidence that lockdowns - and this is a type of lockdown, it's a quasi-lockdown - simply don't work... ""This scare tactic saying so many people are going to die is nonsense in my opinion."" Enzo Nigro says he was not expecting a ban on serving alcohol Enzo Nigro, the owner of Potters pub in Newport, said he was concerned by the new rules. ""We had 70 to 80 emails come through 10 minutes after the announcement, and everyone was wondering what was going on,"" he said. ""People don't really understand the rules because they thought we would be able to serve alcohol until 6 o'clock and not no alcohol at all. ""It's frustrating."" Conservatives say the rules are ""completely disproportionate"" in parts of Wales where the rate of infection is comparatively low. Plaid Cymru, which has backed most of the Welsh Government's restriction during the pandemic, has said ministers should find a ""sensible compromise"" that allows alcohol to be served until 19:00, with closing time an hour later. Mandy Jones, of the Independent Alliance for Reform in the Senedd, said a petition started by former MEP Nathan Gill ""shows that the public also agree with us in demanding that the Welsh Government publish the science they've used to justify this claim"". The petition showed more than 18,500 signatures on Wednesday evening. Pubs, bars and restaurants in Wales will not be able to serve alcohol on the premises and they will have to close at 18:00. Only takeaway alcohol will be allowed when the new rules kick in on Friday. On Tuesday, Mr Drakeford pointed out that up to four people from different households will still be able to meet in bars and cafes, but without alcohol. ""Now I am sorry that is a significant deprivation for many people,"" he said. ""But the evidence is that when people drink then their behaviour changes and their behaviour changes in ways that make them and other people more vulnerable to the virus."" Without further action, he said modelling suggested between 1,000 and 1,700 more deaths would occur this winter. This video can not be played Last orders for 100 Brains pubs in Wales - as they close for Covid on Friday Mr Drakeford also said his government was publishing more information than any other administration in the UK. Incident management teams had ""repeatedly"" highlighted problems with alcohol and hospitality venues in outbreaks, he added. The boss of Brains, the biggest Welsh-owned brewery, hascalled the new alcohol rules ""closure by stealth""and announced more than 100 managed pubs will be closed from Friday. Brains data shared with BBC Wales shows between July and the end of November it served more than 850,000 customers at the 100 pubs it manages and had five inquiries from the Test, Trace, Protect scheme. Chief executive Alistair Darby said it was hard ""to believe that the latest restrictions which will force the closure of all of our managed pubs will do much to reduce transmission of the virus"". The company said three of its pubs were temporarily closed and deep cleaned after staff tested positive for coronavirus. A new tougher tier system of coronavirus restrictions for England began on Wednesday, as the country emerged from its lockdown,after the plan was approved by MPs, despite a major rebellion on the Tory benches. Under the highest, tier three, all hospitality venues must stay closed, except for delivery and takeaway services. What do the new rules mean for pubs in Wales?

Q&A: How will the vaccine roll-out work in Wales?Vaccines are set to be rolled out in Wales - but how will it work and who will get it first?Wales,"""It is tremendously exciting that only nine months on from the declaration of the pandemic, we have vaccines available to offer"" With up to 1.4 million people in line to get a Covid-19 vaccine in Wales in the months ahead, officials say it will be one of the biggest health programmes ever mounted. The UK has become the first country in the world toapprove the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccinefor widespread use. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe for use. But how will it be rolled out? Preparations in Wales started in June and the Welsh Government hopes the first vaccines will be given within seven to 14 days. To start with, everyone over 50 will be offered the vaccine in the coming months. Here we ask those behind the rollout what we should expect. There are a number of different vaccines in development with different ways of storage and administration There could well be seven different vaccines, eventually. The first available is the mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTec. The UK government has bought 40 million doses. Each person getting this vaccine will need two doses, three weeks apart. Wales will get a share of around 4.8% based on its population. The next will be the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine and there will be many more doses of this available, with the UK government having ordered 100 million doses. Freezers holding doses of the mRNA vaccine, which will be the first to be rolled out The mRNA vaccine has to be stored at -75 C and also transported at that sub-zero temperature to the central locations where it will be used. There may be some transportation possible at normal refrigerated temperature, which would enable it to be taken to care homes, but otherwise it will require those on the priority list to get to special vaccination centres. The vaccines - in nearly 1,000 doses per package - have to be used within five days once opened. And the thawing and preparation process can take up to five days from when they arrive. How will I get a coronavirus vaccine? Oxford's Covid vaccine 'dose error' explained Covid vaccines: Who decides if they are safe? ""It is tremendously exciting that only nine months on from the declaration of the pandemic, we have vaccines available to offer and a system in place to offer them,"" said Richard Roberts, head of the vaccine preventable disease programme at Public Health Wales. ""Some will be able to travel but some we would want to stay where they are  - a care home for example. If we can solve that problem of transporting the vaccine but when the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine comes online, that's a vaccine which we store in the fridge, we can move it around and it lasts six months."" About 60% of the Welsh population will be offered the vaccine at first Older, more vulnerable people and care home staff will be among the first to receive it. The Welsh Government will split the population into age groups to determine priority, based on advice form the UK Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The order of priority is set to be: Older residents in care homes and care home workers All those 80 years and over and health and social care workers All those 75 years and over Those 70 and over, andclinically extremely vulnerable people,external- including those with cancer and kidney disease All aged 65 and over All individuals aged 16 to 64 with underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of serious disease and mortality All those 60 years and over All those 55 years and over All those 50 years and over The 40% remainder of the population, with order of priority to be determined The priority 10 groups represent 60% of the population but also 99% of all deaths linked to Covid-19. More information about the vaccine from Public Health Wales,external Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection. For context, around 900,000 flu vaccines were given over a period of 10 to 12 weeks last year - there are 1.4 million in the priority groups for the Covid vaccines. ""Although more complex because community locations are being used and the logistics with the vaccine, if we can match volume of delivery that we achieve with flu, then it will mean we will be able to roll out as quickly as possible,"" said Dr Roberts. You will be told. In the Cardiff and Vale health board, for example, Fiona Kinghorn, executive director for public health, said: ""We are already planning how we might vaccinate those in sequence, and different groups at the same time, and we'll call them, so when we are ready to vaccinate, they will receive a letter, and then in Cardiff and Vale, they will be able to ring our booking centre and book an appointment that is convenient for them."" Each health board will get its share and vaccines will go across Wales at the same time. Mass vaccination centres will be set up - particularly for the mRNA vaccine, which needs to be kept a very low temperatures. Cardiff and Vale health board has already said its mass vaccination centres will be at Splott and at leisure centres in Pentwyn and Barry. Officials say each site will have tight security and the vaccines will be guarded ""like a VIP"", as well as cyber and IT security measures being taken. Gill Richardson, chief adviser to the chief medical officer, said: ""It's been an incredible logistical exercise - we tested our pharmaceutical logistics colleagues but they've worked tirelessly to ensure there's an effective and safe vaccine across Wales. ""The vaccine can't be transported once it's diluted, it has to be used on the site. This is a vaccine that needs to be made up. It's not like the flu vaccine, where it comes ready-made and in single doses. It will be in vials which can serve five doses and it will be delivered so it can be used at those mass centres."" Health officials would like to see ""thousands rather than hundreds"" vaccinated in the first few weeks. It's likely those vulnerable and shielded people and those with chronic conditions, who would normally get the flu vaccine, will also be slotted in too as it is rolled down the age groups. Boris Johnson saw one of the labs which will make the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine in Wrexham ""It's on the scale of the smallpox vaccination campaign [in the 1960s],"" said Dr Richardson. There is hope that the take-up will be at least 75%. It will be ""well into next year"" before the entire Welsh population has been vaccinated though, according to the Chief Medical Officer for Wales Dr Frank Atherton. ""It's fantastic news that we're going to be able to be starting this as soon as next week but everything else depends on when we get stocks and how quickly we can start to roll it out."" There is a balancing act in staffing the programme from within the NHS, to ensure not too many people are taken away from where they are needed. In the early stages, those who are already registered to vaccinate - with oversight by senior pharmacists and specialists - will be used to administer the vaccine. More people, including those that have not administered vaccines before, will be trained up in the coming months. Health boards are already recruiting retired nurses, midwives, pharmacists and therapists to train up. Those being given the Pfizer/BioNTec vaccine will receive two doses, three weeks apart. But the effectiveness of the vaccines will be studied to determine what form of immunity the vaccine gives and how long it might last. That in future could determine whether people need to be vaccinated again in future. The different vaccines might well have different characteristics on this. But Dr Richardson said they offered a ""fantastic message of hope"" Public health experts say you will still need to keep to guidelines around social distancing, hand-washing and using masks. Not everyone will be able to have vaccine and certainly not in the first phase. It will take some time to get back to normal. ""While vaccines are part of the answer, they are not the whole part"", said Swansea Bay health board's public health director Keith Reid. He is worried that people might think ""we are all saved and this will all soon be over"". You will not be able to mix and match between the vaccines - once you have received the first dose you must stick to it. It is also not recommended you get the jab within 28 days of testing positive or from when you first have onset of Covid symptoms. Beyond that, it is worth noting that previous exposure to Covid will not affect your eligibility for the vaccine or position within the priority list.

Lack of abuse support 'will lead to deaths',"This video can not be played ""He would push, shove and kick me out of bed"" ""It was a massive step - it was scary. I thought the little one could be taken away from me."" When Beth sought help to flee her abusive partner before the first lockdown in March, she and her daughter were placed in a women's refuge. But she fears women in that situation today might not get that as domestic abuse services warn a lack of capacity will lead to more people dying. The Welsh Government said Â£1.3m had been spent to help accommodate victims. Domestic violence services say they have struggled to cope with a surge in referrals since schools reopened in September, with many cases previously going unreported. Charities NSPCC Cymru and Welsh Women's Aid say support services for children in Wales were already ""sparse"" and ""underfunded"", with people relying on a ""postcode lottery"". Beth says her 11-year-old daughter started ""hearing and seeing"" the abuse she was being subjected to ""He was accusing me of sleeping with other people while I was working,"" said Beth, which is not her real name and is being used to protect her identity. ""He would say I wasn't a fit enough mother to look after his daughter. It was then becoming physical. ""He began to push me, shove me, kick me out of the bed. One day I had a bottle of Coke poured over my head because I was accused of not calling him when his food was ready. ""It was having an impact on the little one, she was hearing and seeing things."" Beth, from south Wales, managed to flee and spent the next eight months living in a women's refuge with her 11-year-old daughter, who has complex needs. Beth said she finally decided to call for help after her mother threatened to ring social services - but she had to wait for her partner to leave for work and her daughter to go to school. She said making that initial phone call was the most difficult step. This video can not be played Coronavirus and domestic abuse: ""Youâre with each other 24/7"" ""It's the not knowing where you're going to go after that phone call, who's at the end of the phone and who's going to help you,"" she explained. Beth said social services managed to find her a refuge before she went to pick her daughter up from school that day. ""[My daughter] was all questions about why I hadn't brought my own car to pick her up,"" she recalled. ""I explained that we weren't going home and I remember her saying to me: 'We'll be ok now and we'll be safe, because daddy can't shout and do anything now can he?'"" Kate Annison says her service has had to introduce waiting lists for the first time in her career A domestic abuse service in Powys says it has had to put a waiting list in place after a ""huge surge"" in cases, and feared the worst for those they could not support. ""We're really struggling with referrals and for the first time in my career, we've had to introduce a waiting list,"" said Kate Annison, who runs the children's service at Montgomeryshire Family Crisis Centre in Newtown. She said referrals had more than doubled between August and October compared to last year, adding that children's support services often reveal more about the scale of the abuse taking place. ""Making people wait even a short amount of time could mean that they get hurt really badly,"" says Ms Annison ""The children are disclosing a lot of things that were happening over the previous lockdown or are still happening. There's been a huge surge in cases,"" Ms Annison said. ""We've had to put six people on the waiting list for support so far - that's four families. ""Making people wait even a short amount of time could mean that they get hurt really badly. These decisions we're making could ultimately result in a death."" Children's support services often reveal more about the scale of the abuse taking place, Ms Annison says She said her team were already aware of a case where a family member died after being told there was not enough space in any refuges. ""We know they tried a few different services in a few different areas but failed to find any space,"" she said. ""Unfortunately, they then pulled out of trying to find somewhere and there was a fatality in that family. ""That victim was asking for support at the time they were able to, potentially when the perpetrator was not around. ""If we'd have had the capacity as a nation to put them into refuge then they would be safe now. Unfortunately, due to the lack of capacity, there is somebody who's died and young people are in care."" The pressure on services ""will result in people losing their lives,"" says Angelina Rodriques Both NSPCC Cymru and Welsh Women's Aid said many services were underfunded and relied on charitable donations and grants to get by. ""What the pandemic has done has just exacerbated something that was struggling already,"" said Angelina Rodriques, of the Atal Y Fro refuge and support service in the Vale of Glamorgan. ""If a service hasn't got the finances or the resources, then all you're doing is holding women and children on waiting lists. ""Referrals are coming in every day and you can't keep up. We're doing the best that we can in this situation, but we're missing loads of people around the Vale of Glamorgan. ""It will result in people losing their lives, because they can't get the support at that time."" Domestic abuse offences increased during pandemic Domestic violence 'increases globally during lockdown' How smart devices are exploited for domestic abuse Despite now feeling safe, Beth said she feared the long-term impact of the pandemic on victims of domestic abuse. ""I think it will be 100 times more difficult to reach out to those services now,"" she explained. ""If I was in the same position in March or April then I don't think I would have got out, I think I would still be there. ""You need to get out of there before that predator even knows anything about what's going on - you need to get out that door."" A Welsh Government spokeswoman said: ""We recognise the extreme pressures facing women fleeing domestic abuse with children. ""This year we have invested over Â£1.3m for disbursed community accommodation for those for whom refuge might not be the right answer."" She added it had provided local authorities with Â£50m for housing support, including for those fleeing domestic abuse, as well as other grants, guidance and training.

Thanks for joining us, we'll be back in the morning to bring you more updates. Today's coverage has been brought to you by: Marie Jackson, Becky Morton, Joshua Cheetham, Katie Wright, Jennifer Scott, Sean Fanning, Claire Heald and Suzanne Leigh. Our live coverage will be coming to a close shortly, on a day which has been dominated by the news that a vaccine will begin being rolled out in the UK next week. Here is a round-up of the main developments: Prof
Peter Openshaw, a government adviser and medical expert at Imperial College
London, said people should beware fake news and rumours about the safety of the
vaccine. He
told the BBC: ""If people do not want to have it that is completely up to
them."" He
added: ""I really believe it is a safe way to get vaccinated and
protected."" The
UK's regulator, the MHRA, says all of the vital checks and measures have been
done and no corners have been cut, meaning the jab is safe to recommend. A
snap poll by YouGov of 5,321 British adults suggests the majority of the public
is confident about the vaccine. Reality Check There have been claims that Brexit allowed the UK to approve a vaccine more quickly than the EU, but is that correct? The EU - through the European Medicines Agency (EMA) - has yet to approve a coronavirus vaccine. But the idea that Brexit enabled the UK to press ahead and authorise one is not right. Under European law a vaccine must be authorised by the EMA, but individual countries can use an emergency procedure that allows them to distribute a vaccine for temporary use in their domestic market. Britain is still subject to those EU rules during the post-Brexit transition period which runs until the end of the year. The UK's own medicines regulator, the MHRA, confirmed this ina statement last month,external. And its chief executive, Dr June Raine, said today that ""we have been able to authorise the supply of this vaccine using provisions under European law, which exist until 1 January"". It is true that, in general, regulation of new medicines is done on an EU-wide basis. But that does not take account of the emergency provisions in EU law which Dr Raine refers to. Read the full analysishere. After 266 long days, the return of fans to English league football is finally here. But as clubs in certain areas of England open their turnstiles for the first time in almost nine months, a BBC Sport poll suggestsfans are dividedover whether they should be allowed to return before a Covid-19 vaccine is rolled out. In a Savanta ComRes poll of 2,100 football fans, 52% said they should be allowed to return to watch matches in person before a vaccine is available, while 45% said they should not. The poll also shows:  Sean CoughlanBBC News, education correspondent Students will have staggered starting dates for returning to universities in England after Christmas- with some not back until 7 February. The government's plan would see students on hands-on, practical courses such as medicine going back from 4 to 18 January. Other subjects would be taught online until face-to-face teaching begins between 25 January and 7 February. Students are being promised Covid tests when they return to university next term. The plan, to avoid a surge of students and the risk of spreading coronavirus, will mean a staggered return for students over five weeks in the new year - with most courses starting online before a return to in-person teaching. Students will be offered two lateral flow Covid tests when they arrive back - similar to the process for their departure. The arrangements for next term have been announced on the eve of students being able to return home for Christmas. Labour's leader is calling for all parties to work together over the rollout of the vaccine. Speaking after the Downing Street press conference, Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""really important... whatever our political party, [we] work together to make sure that the rollout is
swift, safe and fair, and the people have confidence in it"". He says he has asked Boris Johnson to share No 10's plan for communicating the rollout. Sir Keir added: ""Then we will work
together so that the public can see cross-party consensus on this. ""This
rollout is one of the biggest logistical exercises since the Second World War. We need the best of Britain, we need parties pulling together, and I'm very
happy to put my party behind that effort."" The UK prime minister's press conference has just come to an end. So what did we learn from Boris Johnson, Simon Stevens and Jonathan Van-Tam? Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent ""It may be a
good thing, but on the other hand..."" The prime minister
doesn't seem very impressed with Jonathan Van-Tam's claim that coronavirus
safety measures may be with us long term. Boris Johnson
looked a bit baffled and says people want to reclaim their lives. ""I didn't mean
to challenge you,"" he says before the deputy chief medical officer then
clarifies his point that he hopes we'll get back to a much more
normal world as soon as possible. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent One of the big unknowns about this vaccine â and the
others being developed â is whether it prevents transmission. It is possible that people who are vaccinated can still
pass on the virus to others. It will take time to establish to what extent this is
stopped. If it does stop transmission, once you have about 2/3 of
the population vaccinated it is possible you then reach herd immunity and the
virus stops spreading completely. But even if that doesnât happen, vaccinating all over 65s
- 12m people - will have a major impact on deaths. More than 90% of people who
have died have been over that age. That in itself would be enough to lead to significant
lifting of restrictions. Rachel SchraerBBC Health Reporter The Pfizer vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective
at stopping people from becoming ill from the virus â the first priority for
getting life back to normal. But we donât yet know whether this vaccine stops people
spreading the virus. Both deputy chief medical officer for England Jonathan Van-Tam and NHS England head Simon Stevens stressed this point during todayâs
briefing. They are âvery hopefulâ it will also stop vaccinated people
from spreading the virus to others. And thereâs good precedent for this â the flu and MMR
(measles, mumps and rubella) jabs both stop vaccinated people from infecting
others. But for now, Van-Tam says, you canât watch others get it (the jab) and hope it will protect you. He encouraged everyone who is invited to be given the
vaccine to take up this opportunity, adding that low take-up of the vaccine will
âalmost certainly make restrictions last longerâ. In the final question, Van-Tam is asked if he can envisage a world where we can cast aside our masks and hand sanitiser for good. The deputy chief medical officer says he doesn't think we will eradicate coronavirus ""ever"", adding: ""It will be with humankind forever"". He also thinks it may become ""a seasonal problem"", like flu. ""Do I think there will be a big moment where we have a big party and throw off our masks? No I don't,"" says Van-Tam. Instead, he thinks the ""personal habit"" may carry on for some years, even if the government doesn't insist on the measures. And asked about the MPs that rebelled against the new tier system, the PM concludes the press conference saying: ""I totally understand people's frustrations with the tiering system. ""But we will make sure we are as local and as sensitive as we can possibly be [on restrictions]."" Asked whether the current coronavirus restrictions could be ended
early, the prime minister says the vaccine news âfor now makes absolutely no
differenceâ. However, he adds that there will come a moment to relax the ânon- pharmaceutical interventionsâ but âweâre not there yetâ. He stresses the moment when it is time to relax the rules is theoretical and there is âweeks,
months of work to goâ before we are in that position. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent This is the day we have been waiting for. But it is clear listening to NHS England chief executive
Simon Stevens and deputy chief medical officer Professor Jonathan Van Tam that
there are some huge logistical challenges from here on in. First of all, supply. The UK is expecting 800,000 doses
in the next few days. But given there are 15 million people over the age of 65
and working in health and care sectors, and all need two doses, it is clear
getting more into the country is essential. Rollout is also difficult. Through a combination of the
need to keep the vaccine at ultra cold storage and the fact that the jab comes
in batches of 975 that cannot be split up at the moment, immunisation will only
be offered from a network of 50 hospitals to start with. It is why there is still so much hope pinned to the
Oxford University vaccine, that regulators are currently reviewing. That does
not need to be kept in ultra cold storage and so can be distributed much more
easily. Plus there are already millions of doses in the country. Then there is vaccine hesitancy. Officials have been at
pains to stress that despite the vaccine being developed in record time the
full testing and regulatory process has been followed. But the more people donât come forward, the longer
restrictions have to remain in place. There is a long way to go yet. Next up is a question on the vaccine roll-out again and about what stage it will be right to lift all the restrictions? Stevens says the ""goal"" of the vaccination programme is to ""protect vulnerable individuals"" - hence the graduated list of who will get it when - and to stop people spreading it. But we don't know yet if that vaccine will have the power to stop transmission. Van Tam points to the priority list, working down the ages and at risk groups, saying it is ""not an accident"" they take out 99% of groups linked to Covid related mortality deaths in the UK. Johnson says the reason the UK got the vaccine ahead of other countries is down to the vaccine task force's work. But they are ""global efforts of scientists around the world"". Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The prime minister
loves a colourful metaphor and so does Jonathan Van-Tam. Boris Johnson began
the briefing by saying science had performed a kind of biological jiu jitsu -
turning the virus on itself to make this vaccine. Soon after the
government's deputy chief medical officer likened it to a train arriving at a
station which people needed to get on and compared the vaccine to a yoghurt,
saying it couldn't be taken in and out of the fridge. Tabloid headline
writers will be able to take their pick. Beth Rigby from Sky News asks whether we should all still
prepare for restrictions to run until April. Boris Johnson says he accepts that the new tier system in
England is âtoughâ but he says the way forward is local restrictions and mass
testing to âkeep the virus under controlâ. He says he hopes places are able âto come down the tiersâ
before Easter, adding that it is necessary to have these measures alongside the
vaccine. Asked whether the PM expects to roll over the tier system at
the start of February, Johnson says the situation will be judged on the data but
âfor the time being youâve got to take it that tiering will be a very, very
important part of our campaign against coronavirus."" The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is the first one in the UK to be approved for use, with hopes people can start receiving the injection within a week. In the video below BBC health correspondent Laura Foster helps explain some of the logistics around how it will be rolled out. This video can not be played The next question is on care home residents, as despite scientists calling for them to get the vaccine first, the government says they may not. Johnson says: ""Of course we want to get it into care homes as fast as we possibly can"". But the issue is in distributing the cases of the vaccine. Each case has 975 vaccines in it, but you cannot currently divide it up, so the government wants to ""avoid wastage"". The PM says they are waiting to hear more, but they ""certainly"" want to get it to ""the most vulnerable"". Van-Tam says remarks about failure on care homes are ""extremely unfair when one considers a new virus emerged less than 12 months ago and we now have our first vaccine"". He adds: ""This is a complex product. It is not a yoghurt that can be taken out of the fridge and put back in several times."" Now we turn to questions from journalists, and the BBCâs Fergus
Walsh asks, how important is this moment? Boris Johnson says itâs a âhuge momentâ and he agrees with
Jonathan Van-Tam that itâs also âa very moving thingâ. He says he is âlost in admirationâ for the way scientists can
solve problems. However, he adds that although itâs a fantastic moment, âthe
worst thing now would be to think that this the moment when we can relax our
guard and think that itâs game over"". Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Dame Jenni explains why she's stripping off on TVThe former Women's Hour presenter will appear on ITV's The Real Full Monty On Ice.Entertainment & Arts,"Dame Jenni Murray presented Radio 4's Woman's Hour for 33 years Former Woman's Hour host Dame Jenni Murray has opened up about her decision to take her clothes off on television for The Real Full Monty On Ice. Dame Jenni will strip to her underwear on the ITV show to raise awareness of the importance of checking for cancer. The 70-year-old  has had breast cancer herself, resulting in a mastectomy in 2007. After talking about it for years on the Radio 4 programme, she said it was time to ""put my money where my mouth is"". Dame Jenni told the Radio Times that when her agent first suggested the idea to her, she said: ""'Don't be ridiculous!... I'm not baring my one remaining breast to the entire nation.' ""And then I thought about it. The Full Monty is probably my favourite film ever. I thought, 'Come on, Jenni. You've been talking about breast cancer for donkey's years.'"" The presenter explained the subject has come up frequently on Woman's Hour, with listeners regularly being encouraged to check their breasts. Almost one million women in the UK have missed vital breast screening due to coronavirus, a leading charity recently estimated. One million UK women may have missed breast scans Dame Jenni added: ""You have to be gung ho about these things. I've had two children. I've had my hips replaced. I've had a mastectomy. I've had stomach surgery. I've had an operation on my left humerus, which I managed to break six years ago, slipping on a very icy step. ""My body has been exposed and dealt with on numerous occasions, and I can't see the point of being shy about it. It's a couple of seconds of taking your bra off. What's the problem?"" This video can not be played Dame Jenni closes her last programme with Helen Reddy Dame Jenni has been cancer-free for 14 years now, and told the publication she dislikes being termed a ""survivor"", preferring ""recovered"" instead. Last month, she made her final broadcast as host of the Radio 4 show, after 33 years in the hot seat. She signed off her tenure by playing Helen Reddy's feminist anthem, I Am Woman. Dame Jenni Murray signs off with feminist anthem Emma Barnett to present Radio 4's Woman's Hour Jane Garvey to leave Woman's Hour The broadcaster thinks her next eyebrow-raising venture will be a challenge - particularly the ice part - but nothing compared to what she has put her body through previously. Episode one of Emmy-winning show, led by Ashley Banjo and Coleen Nolan, is on ITV on 14 December. Alongside Dame Jenni, will be actresses Linda Lusardi and Hayley Tamaddon; and Love Island's Shaunghna Phillips, as well as This Morning's Dr Zoe. Baring all for the blokes will be rugby star Gareth Thomas, Love Island's Chris Hughes, and actor Jamie Lomas; along with singer Jake Quickenden, Diversity's Perri Kiehly and jockey Bob Champion.

"Humans waging 'suicidal war' on nature - UN chiefSecretary General Antonio Guterres says our ""war"" on the natural world will come back to haunt us.Science & Environment","This video can not be played United Nations chief Antonio Guterres issues a stark warning to world leaders about the state of the planet ""Our planet is broken,"" the Secretary General of the United Nations, Antonio Guterres, has warned. Humanity is waging what he describes as a ""suicidal"" war on the natural world. ""Nature always strikes back, and is doing so with gathering force and fury,"" he told a BBC special event on the environment. Mr Guterres wants to put tackling climate change at the heart of the UN's global mission. In a speech entitled State of the Planet, he announced that its ""central objective"" next year will be to build a global coalition around the need to reduce emissions to net zero. Net zero refers to cutting greenhouse gas emissions as far as possible and balancing any further releases by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere. Mr Guterres said that every country, city, financial institution and company ""should adopt plans for a transition to net zero emissions by 2050"". In his view, they will also need to take decisive action now to put themselves on the path towards achieving this vision. The objective, said the UN secretary general, will be to cut global emissions by 45% by 2030 compared with 2010 levels. Has the world started to take climate change fight seriously? 'Earthshot': William and Attenborough launch prize to save planet You've got cheap data, how about cheap power too? Here's what Mr Guterres demanded the nations of the world do: Put a price on carbon Phase out fossil fuel finance and end fossil fuel subsidies Shift the tax burden from income to carbon, and from tax payers to polluters Integrate the goal of carbon neutrality (a similar concept to net zero) into all economic and fiscal policies and decisions Help those around the world who are already facing the dire impacts of climate change Our war on the natural world will come back to haunt us, says Mr Guterres It is an ambitious agenda, as Mr Guterres acknowledged, but he said that radical action is needed now. ""The science is clear,"" Mr Guterres told the BBC, ""unless the world cuts fossil fuel production by 6% every year between now and 2030, things will get worse. Much worse."" This video can not be played Is it possible to reverse the climate crisis? The BBC's Justin Rowlatt explains Climate policies have yet to rise to the challenge, the UN chief said, adding that ""without concerted action, we may be headed for a catastrophic three to five-degree temperature rise this century"". The impact is already being felt around the world. ""Apocalyptic fires and floods, cyclones and hurricanes are the new normal,"" he warned. ""Biodiversity is collapsing. Deserts are spreading. Oceans are choking with plastic waste."" Mr Guterres said the nations of the world must bring ambitious commitments to cut emissions to the international climate conference the UK and Italy are hosting in Glasgow in November next year. As well as pressing for action on the climate crisis, he urged nations to tackle the extinction crisis that is destroying biodiversity and to step up efforts to reduce pollution. We face, he said, a ""moment of truth"". But he does discern some glimmers of hope.

He acknowledged that the European Union, the US, China, Japan, South Korea and more than 110 other countries have committed to become carbon neutral by the middle of this century. He said he wants to see this momentum turned into a movement. Technology will help us to reach these targets, Mr Guterres said he believes. Technology could help forge a more sustainable path, says Antonio Guterres ""The coal business is going up in smoke,"" because it costs more to run most of today's coal plants than it does to build new renewable plants from scratch, he told the BBC. ""We must forge a safer, more sustainable and equitable path"", the UN chief concluded. He said it is time for this war against the planet to end, adding: ""We must declare a permanent ceasefire and reconcile with nature.""

UK approves Pfizer Covid vaccine for mass roll out,"The UK has become the first country in the world to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine, paving the way for mass vaccination. Britain's medicines regulator, the MHRA, says the jab, which offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, is safe to be rolled out. The first doses are already on their way to the UK, with 800,000 due in the coming days, Pfizer said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the NHS will contact people about jabs. Elderly people in care homes and care home staff have been placed top of the priority list, followed by over-80s and health and care staff. But because hospitals already have the facilities to store the vaccine at -70C, as required, the very first vaccinations are likely to take place there - for care home staff, NHS staff and patients - so none of the vaccine is wasted. A further 648 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test were recorded in the UK on Wednesday, with another 16,170 cases reported. Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged the public not to get ""carried away with over optimism or falling into the naive belief that our struggle is over"". He tolda Downing Street news conference that, while the ""searchlights of science"" had created a working vaccine, significant logistical challenges remained. What are the safety checks for vaccines How will I get a vaccine? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' The Pfizer/BioNTech jab is the fastest vaccine to go from concept to reality, taking only 10 months to follow the same steps that normally span 10 years. The UK has already ordered 40 million doses of the jab - enough to vaccinate 20 million people. The doses will be rolled out as quickly as they can be made by Pfizer in Belgium, Mr Hancock said, with the first load next week and then ""several millions"" throughout December. Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first people in Scotland will be immunised on Tuesday. Welsh Health and Social Care Minister Vaughan Gething said the rollout of the Pfizer jab to care homes would be particularly difficult because of how it needs to be stored. Mr Gething said that it was not possible to transport the Pfizer vaccine to more than 1,000 care homes across Wales. The bulk of the rollout across the UK will be next year, Mr Hancock said, adding: ""2020 has been just awful and 2021 is going to be better."" There is a clear priority list for who gets the vaccine first - and care home residents and staff are top of it. But operational complexities mean the reality will be somewhat different. When the vaccines arrives, it will be sent straight to major hospitals who have the ultra-cold facilities to store it. From there it can be moved just once - and when it is, it must be kept in batches of 1,000. That means sending it out to care homes, where there may be only a few dozen residents in some places, would lead to a huge amount of vaccine being wasted. Because of that, the NHS, which is in charge of distributing the vaccine, will run clinics from hospitals at first. This will allow NHS and care home staff to get immunised first as well as, perhaps, some of the older age groups who come into hospital. It looks like it will not be until much more of the Pfizer vaccine is available or the Oxford University one, which is easier to distribute, is approved that care home residents will be able to get it. While Mr Hancock said that the government does not yet know how many people need to be vaccinated before restrictions can start being lifted, he added: ""I'm confident now, with the news today, that from spring, from Easter onwards, things are going to be better. And we're going to have a summer next year that everybody can enjoy."" Mr Johnson added: ""It's the protection of vaccines that will ultimately allow us to reclaim our lives and get the economy moving again."" Downing Street press secretary Allegra Stratton said Mr Johnson would not rule out receiving the vaccine jab live on television, though she said he would not want to take a jab meant for someone more vulnerable. The free vaccine will not be compulsory and there will be three ways of vaccinating people across the UK: Hospitals Vaccination centres ""a bit like the Nightingales project and including some of the Nightingales"", said Mr Hancock In the community, with GPs and pharmacists Around 50 hospitals are on stand-by and vaccination centres - in venues such as conference centres or sports stadiums - are being set up now. It is thought the vaccination network could start delivering more than one million doses a week once enough doses are available. This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""This is a day to remember and, frankly, a year to forget"" NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the health service was preparing for ""the largest-scale vaccination campaign in our country's history"". But experts said people still need to remain vigilant and follow rules to stop the virus spreading - including with social distancing, face masks and self-isolation. ""We can't lower our guard yet,"" said the government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty. The order in which people will get the jab is recommended by the Joint Committee on Vaccinations and Immunisations and decided by the government. Mass immunisation of everyone over 50, as well as younger people with pre-existing health conditions, can happen as more stocks become available in 2021. Pfizer confirmed that the first stocks of the vaccine will be for the NHS, which will give them out for free based on clinical need. People in the UK will not be able to bypass this and buy the vaccine privately to jump the queue. The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. Most of the side effects are very mild, similar to the side effects after any other vaccine and usually last for a day or so, said Prof Sir Munir Pirmohamed, the chairman of the Commission on Human Medicine expert working group. The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people, he said. The head of the MHRA, Dr June Raine, said that - despite the speed of approval - no corners have been cut. Batches of the vaccine will be tested in labs ""so that every single vaccine that goes out meets the same high standards of safety"", she said. This video can not be played Dr June Raine from the MHRA: ""The safety of the public will always come first"" Giving the analogy of climbing a mountain, she said: ""If you're climbing a mountain, you prepare and prepare. We started that in June. By the time the interim results became available on 10 November we were at base camp. ""And then when we got the final analysis we were ready for that last sprint that takes us to today."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? HOLIDAYS:Where can I go away in the UK? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters The Pfizer/BioNTech was the first vaccine to publish positive early results from final stages of testing. It is a new type called an mRNA vaccine that uses a tiny fragment of genetic code from the pandemic virus to teach the body how to fight Covid-19 and build immunity. An mRNA vaccine has never been approved for use in humans before, although people have received them in clinical trials. Covid vaccine: How will we keep it cold enough? Because the vaccine must be stored at around -70C, it will be transported in special boxes of up to 5,000 doses, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. And once out of the fridge it needs to be used within six hours. Other coronavirus vaccines are also being developed: One from Moderna uses the same mRNA approach as the Pfizer vaccine and offers similar protection - the UK has pre-ordered seven million doses that could be ready by the spring The UK has ordered 100 million doses of a different type of Covid vaccine from Oxford University and AstraZeneca Russia has been using another vaccine, called Sputnik, and the Chinese military has approved another one made by CanSino Biologics. The World Health Organization's Dr David Nabarro said the Pfizer vaccine would not replace the other measures ""for a number of months, even a year, so we'll have to keep doing physical distancing, mask wearing, hygiene and isolating ourselves when we're sick"". He told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme ""the vaccine will only start to dent the size of the pandemic somewhat later in the year"". The pace has been breathtaking. From an unknown virus at the start of the year to a vaccine approved by the regulator and ready to use in early December is an unprecedented timescale. At the Downing Street briefing, the MHRA's chief executive said it was like climbing Everest, with preparations starting in June and a team working ""night and day"" assessing early data and reaching ""base camp"" by early November when Pfizer/BioNtech published the trial results. At the same time, the MHRA was adamant that the process had been robust with safety considerations paramount. A rapid emergency approval process was used by the UK regulator. The European Medicines Agency is taking longer to reach a view and there has been some sniping from European politicians arguing their processes are more reliable and authoritative. But the MHRA is an internationally respected independent watchdog and for now those about to receive the first jabs will rely on its ruling.

How do we know if a Covid vaccine is safe?,"More than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. There are different approved types and brands available and all have undergone rigorous testing and safety checks. Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. The principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. When will I get a coronavirus vaccine? If the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech,the first to be approved in the UK. Half are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. The Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. Approval is only given if regulators are happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. Checks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. In the UK, independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it after approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Scientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge. The UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can befast-tracked for approvalif needed. No corners will be cut, with safety paramount. But lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed. Instead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used. Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. They do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus. Vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective. Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against. Some people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine. Common reactions,externalthat may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles. It is rare to find that health problems occurring following a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Events may be coincidental and unrelated to vaccination. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has beenlinked to very rare cases of blood clots,external. This is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. The chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK have been offered alternative Covid vaccines. Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients arelisted.,external There have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. As a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. Be aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). People will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid in the past. That's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection. Guidance,externalsays there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with ""long"" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. Some vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. The Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.

New Covid tier system comes into force in EnglandMore than 55 million people must abide by the two strictest levels after MPs approved the measures.UK,"This video can not be played Shoppers queue as stores reopen in Birmingham Shoppers have returned to the High Street in England, after non-essential retailers opened their doors at the end of a four-week national lockdown. Athree-tiered system of Covid-19 rules has now come into forcein the nation, with gyms and businesses such as hairdressers also able to open. More than 55 million people are in the strictest two tiers and cannot mix indoors with those in other households. The government said it would ""safeguard the gains made during the past month"". At a Downing Street briefing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he accepted that the tiered system was ""tough"", but insisted that regional restrictions and mass testing were the way to ""keep the virus under control"". He said he hoped that places would be able ""to come down the tiers"" before Easter, while stressing that the tier restrictions would continue to be a ""very important"" part of battling coronavirus. Government publishes data behind stricter tiers Why is so much of the North and Midlands in the top tier? Keeping pools closed 'a catastrophe for health' 'We've lost a day of trade' over lockdown end date There were queues outside stores across England early on Wednesday as shoppers returned to High Street giants such as Primark. And people arrived promptly to take advantage ofa stock clearance sale at Debenhams department storefrom 07:00 GMT. Some retailers are extending their trading hours to try to recoup the loss in sales over the lockdown. It comes after a period which has seenthe collapse of Topshop owner Arcadia group,women's fashion chain BonmarchÃ©and the failure ofDebenhams to secure a buyer- putting a total of more than 25,000 jobs at risk. Footfall at UK shops was up by 64.5% compared to last week, butdown by 24.1%on the same day last year, according to analyst Springboard. Queues were seen outside Primark in Birmingham early on Wednesday Shoppers also headed to London's Oxford Street A swimmer takes to the water at London's Serpentine Swimming Club as outdoor swimming pools are also allowed to reopen Jordan Roberts, 19, was among a dozen people queuing outside Selfridges in London's Oxford Street before the department store opened its doors - and shoppers were welcomed by store workers dressed as elves on roller skates. She said she was there to do her Christmas shopping, adding: ""It feels more enjoyable being in a store and things run out of stock online."" Another London shopper, Tamara Rass, 44, said she hit the stores early as she expected they would be busy. ""For me, it's a little bit of light at the end of the tunnel and getting back to normality,"" she said. ""There are things in store that I can't get online and I like to treat my daughter once a month."" Elsewhere, there were also reports of ""steady"" footfall in England's town centres.

Transport for London said 760,000 journeys were made on the London Underground network on Wednesday from the start of service until 10:00 GMT - up 14% on last week, but only 31% of normal demand. There were 970,000 bus journeys made. This was up 8% on last week and 57% of pre-pandemic levels. British Retail Consortium chief executive Helen Dickinson said businesses were looking forward to welcoming back customers,with billions lost in sales during the lockdown, adding ""every purchase we make is a retailer helped, a job protected and a local community supported"". The government has also announced that people living in care homes in England willbe able to have visits from family and friends by Christmas, if the visitors test negative for coronavirus. And later on Wednesdayabout 10,000 fans will be allowed into six games in the English Football Leaguefor the first time, other than a few pilot games, since March. England's new tiered system wasbacked by MPs in a Commons votejust hours before it came into effect, despite 55 Tories voting against PM Boris Johnson's plan. The latest restrictions are tougher than the previous tier system that was in place before the lockdown was introduced on 5 November. Under the system every area of the country is in one of three tiers - medium (one), high (two) and very high (three) - with the vast majority of the population in the higher two tiers. In tier two, people are not allowed to mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, although they can socialise in groups of up to six outdoors. And in tier three, people must also not mix with anyone outside their household or support bubble indoors, or at most outdoor venues.

"Small waters 'can help address biodiversity crisis'Experts call for urgent action to protect England's smallest freshwater sites, from ponds to streams.Science & Environment","Ponds harbour a multitude of plants, insects, fish and amphibians Experts are calling for urgent action to protect England's ponds, ditches and streams. Small freshwater habitats contain an abundance of life, including rare amphibians, insects and plants, they say. Yet, unlike large lakes and rivers, there is no obligation to monitor and protect them. A group of 20 scientists outline their concerns in a letter to the government's natural capital committee. They are calling for measures to monitor, manage and protect England's smallest freshwater habitats. Extra Â£40m pledged for green spaces in England Surprise discovery of rare plant at 'ghost pond' The letter points out that small water bodies make up 80% of England's freshwaters and support over 70% of freshwater species, but lack any formal monitoring in the UK. Freshwater habitats vary in size Dr Jeremy Biggs of the charity, the Freshwater Habitats Trust, who organised the letter, said better protection of ponds and streams could help address the biodiversity crisis. ""Small water bodies are at least as important as big water bodies because there are a lot more of them and they are very rich biologically,"" he said. Freshwater lakes of 50 hectares and above, and about a third of large rivers and streams, are monitored under EU regulations. Begwns Pond near Hay-on-Wye is a site of special scientific interest But there is no obligation to monitor the richness of life in ditches, ponds and small streams.

Extra Â£40m pledged for green spaces in England Surprise discovery of rare plant at 'ghost pond' The letter points out that small water bodies make up 80% of England's freshwaters and support over 70% of freshwater species, but lack any formal monitoring in the UK. Freshwater habitats vary in size Dr Jeremy Biggs of the charity, the Freshwater Habitats Trust, who organised the letter, said better protection of ponds and streams could help address the biodiversity crisis. ""Small water bodies are at least as important as big water bodies because there are a lot more of them and they are very rich biologically,"" he said. Freshwater lakes of 50 hectares and above, and about a third of large rivers and streams, are monitored under EU regulations. Begwns Pond near Hay-on-Wye is a site of special scientific interest But there is no obligation to monitor the richness of life in ditches, ponds and small streams. These habitats support a large number of freshwater species, including crested newts, toads, fish, water beetles, dragon flies and wetland plants such as the water-violet.

What do the new rules mean for pubs in Wales?,"The rules for licensed venues have been turned on their head by the first minister following his announcement on Monday ofsweeping restrictionsto the hospitality trade. Let's take a closer look. Pubs can't do this on the premises any more from Friday, but you can still get takeaways From Friday at 18:00, licensed pubs, cafes and restaurants in Wales will have to stop serving alcohol on their premises. Those with an off-licence can sell alcoholic drinks to be taken away. They will have to close at 18:00 every day until further notice. They can operate a takeaway service for food and drink after 18:00. The regulations will be reviewed on 17 December. Shops and off-licences can still continue to sell alcohol until 22:00 In a word, yes. Some people have questioned whether this is fair on pubs, but as stated above, pubs which have the correct licence can provide ""off-sales"", ie alcohol to take away. According to the British Beer and Pub Association, the majority of pubs tend to have an off-licence as part of their trading conditions anyway. But under the Business and Planning Act 2020, all premises have now been given temporary extensions to their licences allowing off-sales until September 2021. It's important to be clear that alcohol sales are not banned in pubs - you just can't drink it there. This is not Prohibition Mark II. First Minister Mark Drakeford said they had considered bringing in a 18:00 cut-off time for alcohol sales in shops but had decided people would just stock up before that time, so it would have been ""an action without a consequence"". We're a land of wine (and beer), (bar-)women and song apparently, with 2,190 pubs in Wales, according to House of Commons figures from May. This means Wales has the second-highest number of pubs per population in the UK, at 70 per 100,000. Only the south west of England has more. What do people in the pub think of alcohol rules? Wales' biggest brewer closes 100 pubs under new rules Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales The accommodation and food sector in Wales employs 106,400 people according to the latest statistics. It accounts for 3.2% of all industries and is worth Â£2.1bn to the Welsh economy. Of those jobs 27,400 are in Wales' 1,200 cafes and 1,500 restaurants, according to UK Hospitality. Beyond that, the food and drink supply chain employs 229,500 people in Wales, including in catering, retail and wholesale, agriculture and fisheries, and manufacturing and packaging. The news is already having a big impact. Wales' largest brewer, Brains,is closing 100 of its managed pubs on Fridayand putting 1,500 staff on furlough. Not much Christmas cheer or singing there. It's bad news for a sector which was already in trouble prior to Covid striking. Despite that high per capita figure for pubs, Wales had the biggest proportionate decline in pubs in the UK, with 1% closing even as pub numbers were increasing across the UK as a whole. Pubs argue it is safer for people to drink in a regulated environment but evidence says alcohol ""impacts on behaviour"" Good question. It's not entirely certain who has the answer to that. In the briefing, Mr Drakeford said the evidence ""was there"" that the virus was spreading in hospitality venues, and that with cases rising, without changes there could be between 1,000 and 1,700 preventable deaths over the winter. However, when asked for this evidence, the Welsh Government initially pointed back to a Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) report from September which said there was ""moderate impact"" from taking action on pubs. This is what the advice said: ""Potential reduction in Rt [reproduction number] of 0.1-0.2, though precise estimation very difficult. Environmental risk in bars, pubs etc is likely to be higher than many other indoor settings due to close proximity of people, long duration of exposure, no wearing of face coverings by customers, loud talking that can generate more aerosols. ""Some venues are poorly ventilated, especially in winter. Consumption of alcohol impacts on behaviour."" But - and it is quite a big but - this was talking about the impact if you close pubs entirely. Not the impact of stopping serving alcohol, although that is referenced, and crucially, not closing them early. In fact the advice goes on to say: ""Curfews likely to have a marginal impact. Low confidence [in the outcome]."" So is it ho, ho, hogwash? When asked for more specifics, the Welsh Government then referred toanother Sage report,externalwhich it said had concluded that measures being taken inScotland's level three,externalandEngland's tier three,externalcoronavirus restrictions were effective. England's measures once again involve closing hospitality venues entirely, which is like comparing apples with pears. However, Scotland's - finally - do apply the same measures as Wales will be taking, namely venues closing at 18:00, and no alcohol being served. However, these restrictions were only brought in on 2 November, and it is worth bearing in mind that many of the areas now in Level 3 or 4 had previously been under restrictions which had seen pubs closed entirely. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We know that as the consumption of alcohol increases, social distancing and the perception of risk decreases. ""Wherever people mix, there's a risk of coronavirus being passed on."" What do people in the pub think of alcohol ban?

"Trump inciting violence, says Georgia official","This video can not be played ""This has to stop... someone's gonna get killed"": Mr Sterling calls on President Trump to condemn the threats An election official in the US state of Georgia has said President Trump will bear responsibility for any violence that results from unsubstantiated election fraud claims he has stoked. ""It's all gone too far,"" Gabriel Sterling warned. ""It has to stop!"" He cited intimidation and death threats to workers in remarks on Tuesday. Georgia is carrying out a second recount of votes at the Trump camp's request. Joe Biden was declared a narrow winner in the key state. The second re-tally is showing no major changes, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said on Wednesday. He said no evidence of widespread fraud had been found to support Mr Trump's claims. Earlier Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said his team was trying to make sure ""that all legal votes are counted and all illegal votes are not"". ""No-one should engage in threats or violence, and if that has happened, we condemn that fully,"" he said. The plea in Georgia came afterUS Attorney General William Barr said his justice department had so far found no proofto back the president's claims of fraud in the election - the latest setback to the Trump camp's legal challenges in several states. What legal challenges remain for Trump? 'In his mind, he will not have lost' Georgia will also hold in January two run-off elections, which will determine who controls the Senate. Mr Trump's Republican party currently has a slim majority in the upper chamber, and a victory in the run-offs would allow it to counter the Democratic administration of President-elect Biden. However, if the Democrats win the two remaining seats, they would control half the seats in the Senate - and the vice-president would be able to act as a tie-breaker. The Democrats already control the lower chamber - the House of Representatives. At a news conference in Atlanta on Tuesday, Mr Sterling, the state's voting systems implementation manager, rebuked his fellow Republicans, including the president. He said a 20-year-old contractor in Gwinnett County for Dominion Voting Systems, which has become the subject of baseless right-wing conspiracy theories, had received death threats. The worker's family was also getting harassed, Mr Sterling added. The unnamed man had been threatened with a noose and accused of treason, Mr Sterling said, after transferring a report on ballot batches to a county computer so he could read it. Mr Sterling said he himself had a police guard outside his home, while the wife of Georgia's Secretary of State, Brad Raffensperger, was ""getting sexualised threats through her cell phone"". ""Mr president, you have not condemned these actions or this language,"" added Mr Sterling. ""Senators, you have not condemned these actions or this language. ""We need you to step up and if you're going to take a position of leadership, show some!"" He added: ""Death threats, physical threats, intimidation, it's too much, it's not right, they've lost the moral high ground to claim that it is."" This video can not be played ""Mr President-elect, how does your foot feel?"": Joe Biden is seen in his protective boot Mr Sterling also cited threats of violence against Chris Krebs, who was fired last month as head of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency after he disputed Mr Trump's fraud claims. Mr Sterling condemned Trump lawyer Joe DiGenova, who said on Monday that Mr Krebs should be ""taken out at dawn and shot"". Addressing Mr Trump directly, Mr Sterling continued: ""You have the right to go to the courts. What you don't have the ability to do, and you need to step up and say this, is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. ""Someone's going to get hurt, someone's going to get shot, someone's going to get killed, and it's not right."" He added: ""Be the bigger man here, and stop, step in, tell your supporters, don't be violent, don't intimidate. All that's wrong, it's un-American."" President Trump responded by retweeting a video of Mr Sterling's speech, but without referencing the concerns over threats of violence. Instead he doubled down on his allegations of election fraud, saying: ""Rigged election. Show signatures and envelopes. Expose the massive voter fraud in Georgia."" Allow Twitter content?

He shared a conspiracy theory about voting machines in Georgia, claimed Mr Biden's win in Arizona was ""impossible"", the results in Nevada were ""fake"" and also claimed without proof: ""We won Michigan by a lot!"" On Wednesday morning, Mr Raffensperger criticised how the president had responded to the passionate plea from his colleague. ""Even after this office requested that President Trump try and quell the violent rhetoric being born out of his continuing claims of winning states where he obviously lost, he tweeted out 'expose the massive voter fraud in Georgia,'"" he said.

On Tuesday, the president's campaign filed a lawsuit with Wisconsin's supreme court challenging the state's presidential vote results.

Dame Jenni explains why she's stripping off on TVThe former Women's Hour presenter will appear on ITV's The Real Full Monty On Ice.,"Dame Jenni Murray presented Radio 4's Woman's Hour for 33 years Former Woman's Hour host Dame Jenni Murray has opened up about her decision to take her clothes off on television for The Real Full Monty On Ice. Dame Jenni will strip to her underwear on the ITV show to raise awareness of the importance of checking for cancer. The 70-year-old  has had breast cancer herself, resulting in a mastectomy in 2007. After talking about it for years on the Radio 4 programme, she said it was time to ""put my money where my mouth is"". Dame Jenni told the Radio Times that when her agent first suggested the idea to her, she said: ""'Don't be ridiculous!... I'm not baring my one remaining breast to the entire nation.' ""And then I thought about it. The Full Monty is probably my favourite film ever. I thought, 'Come on, Jenni. You've been talking about breast cancer for donkey's years.'"" The presenter explained the subject has come up frequently on Woman's Hour, with listeners regularly being encouraged to check their breasts. Almost one million women in the UK have missed vital breast screening due to coronavirus, a leading charity recently estimated.
