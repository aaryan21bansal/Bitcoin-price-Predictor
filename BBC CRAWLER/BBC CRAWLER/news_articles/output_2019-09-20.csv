"It's the Bauhaus, but not as you know it âââââ","Happy birthday Nottingham Contemporary! The Caruso St John-designed art gallery situated near the city's old lace-making district is celebrating its 10th anniversary: a first decade in which it has mounted in excess of 50 exhibitions and welcomed more than two million visitors. Impressive stuff. Especially when you consider its approach to putting on shows. This is an institution which doesn't sugar the art pill. Its exhibitions tend to be as dry as dust, stripped to their bare essentials without any of the populist added extras beloved by wealthier museums and galleries. It wears its academic heart on its hipster sleeve, trusting visitors to share in its spirit of intellectual enquiry (exhibitions are free), with the promise of delicious post-show cake in the cafe (Â£5.95 for a coffee with a slice of brownie). It's a winning formula. Bauhausian, you might say. At least you might if you had seen the gallery's latest show, Still Undead: Popular Culture in Britain Beyond the Bauhaus. Bauhaus School in Dessau, designed by architect Walter Gropius in 1926 The exhibition marks the centenary of the now defunct German art school, which started life in 1919 in Weimar before relocating to Dessau in 1925. In the 14 years of its existence (Hitler shut it down in 1933) the now legendary institution played a central role in shaping the prevailing modernist aesthetics of the 20th Century. The teaching staff boasted some incredible artists, including Wassily Kandinsky, Anni Albers, Josef Albers, and Paul Klee. The architect and designer Marcel Breuer studied and taught there, during which time he pioneered the use of tubular steel in furniture design, resulting in the iconic Model B3 chair now found in office lobbies the world over. Wassily Chair, B3, was designed by Marcel Breuer at the Bauhaus School in 1925-26, but is ubiquitous today The range of designs, art and ideas emanating from the Bauhaus was incredible. Many were beautiful, such as Joost Schmidt's poster for the 1923 Bauhaus Exhibition, and Marianne Brandt's Coffee and Tea Set (1924). Almost all were worthy of your time and attention. To see them laid out in an exhibition would be terrific. Poster of the Bauhaus exhibition in Weimar in 1923 by Joost Schmidt But you won't be finding any of them in the Nottingham Contemporary exhibition. It's not how they roll in this neck of the woods. It'd be too obvious. Instead, the curators have served up a very different but utterly compelling show, which feels a little esoteric at first but reveals itself to be a timely and important provocation. It focuses on the experimental nature of the Bauhaus and how new philosophies about teaching and technology developed on its campuses in the 1920s and '30s affected post-War culture in Britain. The exhibition starts with a large hanging screen showing a film of Kurt Schwerdtfeger's 1922 Reflektorische Farblichtspiele (Reflecting Colour-Light Games): a play of sorts, with a Heath Robinson-like invention acting as the set. The contraption was made by Schwerdtfeger when a student at the Bauhaus for its Lantern Festival. It consisted of a large handmade, cube-shaped, apparatus containing lamps, in front of which performers would move cut-out shapes to create interconnecting geometric shadows on the surface of a screen accompanied by music. Reflektorische Farblichtspiele, 1966, 16mm film transfer to digital, sound, 17 minutes 24 seconds, by Kurt Schwerdtfeger The images look a bit like a pop video for Kraftwerk directed by a Russian constructivist on acid (it was first performed at a party hosted by Kandinsky). It's good. And significant, as a reference point for both the development of avant-garde filmmaking and performance art. Behind it hangs another screen also presenting a film of a revered experimental work. It is called Light-Play: Black, White, Grey (1933) by the Hungarian artist and Bauhaus master LÃ¡szlÃ³ Moholy-Nagy. Light-Play: Black, White, Grey (1933) by the Hungarian artist LÃ¡szlÃ³ Moholy-Nagy It shows the interplay of shapes created by shining light through a rotating (kinetic) metal sculpture he called Light-Prop Lightspace Modulator. These aren't ""easy"" works of art. In fact, they weren't really conceived as works of art at all. They were artistic investigations into a central idea of the Bauhaus, which founder Walter Gropius referred to as ""an alliance of the arts"": a desire to unite art, design, technology, and life. Walter Gropius, regarded as one of the fathers of modern architecture, is standing in front of a house designed by him in 1927 Moholy-Nagy believed such a synthesis was possible, enlightening even, and was searching for a way of articulating the vision. If such a concept appeared vital at the time, it seems even or pressing now. But which art school or institution is currently investigating such bold and ambitious ideas? Several were for a while. In Germany and America and Britain. After the Bauhaus closed, Moholy-Nagy, Gropius and many other students and masters came to the UK to look for work and share their knowledge. There's a slow but captivating film by Moholy-Nagy studying the modernist architecture of Whipsnade and London zoos. At this point in the exhibition the emphasis shifts from Bauhaus emigres to the influence they had on Britain. Mary Quant (""the Bauhaus ideal is about making modern design accessible""), Terence Conran, and Vidal Sassoon all feature. As does the artist Richard Hamilton who is represented by a handful of works including his excellent painting, Trainsition IIII (1954). Vidal Sassoon: Bauhaus (Spirals), 1986, by Robyn Beeche (make-up by Phyllis Cohen) Trainsition IIII (1954) by Richard Hamilton Hamilton was one of several advocates of a foundation course called Basic Design, based on the Vorkurs preliminary course at the Bauhaus, which encouraged intuition and experimentation. The results of Basic Design course are presented in the final room of the exhibition, which is dedicated to work connected to Leeds Polytechnic in the 1970s and 80s: a place the artist Patrick Heron proclaimed to be ""the most influential art school in Europe since the Bauhaus."" Frankly, I'm not sure time has borne this out, but it still makes for a rousing finale: a black-walled, double-height gallery displaying - among many objects and films - a wonderfully eccentric Charles Atlas video called Mrs. Peanut Visits New York (1992), and an unforgettable series of photographs featuring performance artist Leigh Bowery by Robyn Beeche called 7th Alternative Miss Worldâ¦(1986-7). 7th Alternative Miss World contestant, 1986. Leigh Bowery and assistant the late Jill; Swimwear, by Robyn Beeche This is to barely scratch the surface of an encyclopaedic show that has resisted presenting the typical Bauhaus collection and focused more on its spirit: its openness to ideas, its willingness to challenge convention; to seek to unite art, technology, life, and science: to re-think the purpose of education, the contents of the curriculum, and the student experience. This was an institution that urgently wanted to make a difference; to positively impact on the lives of those on and beyond its campus. It leaves you thinking that is what we need now: a revolutionary approach to art and education. There's no reason it shouldn't start here in the UK. After all, that's where the seeds of the original Bauhaus were sown.

Huge rise in catalytic converter thefts,"There has been a huge rise in catalytic converters being stolen from cars in 2019, police in London say. For the first six months of 2019, the number of thefts of catalytic converters jumped to 2,894, compared to 1,674 thefts for all of 2018. In a car's exhaust system, catalytic converters clean up harmful gases before they exit the exhaust pipe. In a video seen by the BBC, a criminal gang stole a catalytic converter in under three minutes in broad daylight. The prices of certain precious metals have skyrocketed in the last 18 months - palladium is now worth Â£1,300/oz, while rhodium goes for Â£4,000/oz, according to FJ Church and Sons, a specialist metals merchant that is also the UK's largest specialist in recycling catalytic converters. The police urged vehicle owners ""to be vigilant"" and consider taking safety measures to protect their cars. A catalytic converter is located in a box on the exhaust pipe under a car. In order to steal it, thieves slide under the car and use high-powered cutting tools to detach the box from the pipes around it. Although there are 10,000 different types of converters, the cars that are most often targeted are hybrid vehicles. Since hybrid cars have two power sources - electric and petrol or diesel - the catalytic converter is used less frequently to process pollutants. The metals are less likely to corrode, meaning they are worth more and thus attractive to thieves. Precious metals must be used because the converters have to work efficiently enough to meet emissions standards. The police has advised that vehicle owners consider taking the following safety measures: Mark catalytic converters with a serial number to make it distinctive Place a protective covering over the catalytic converter Install CCTV and alarms Park vehicles so as to prevent access underneath Carmaker Toyota is very concerned about the thefts, and says it is ""doing all [it] can"" to support its customers who have been victims of crime. Besides consulting with the police andoffering customers safety tips,external, Toyota has developed ""Catloc"", a device which makes it harder for thieves to detach the catalytic converter from the bottom of the car. ""Although 'cat theft' is not new, or limited to Toyota products, it has always been comparatively rare; however, the recent rise in the value of such parts for recycling has meant that police forces have seen a very significant rise in these offences in the last few months,"" said a Toyota spokesman. Toyota does not make money when replacing stolen catalytic converters in cars, and it is also bearing the cost to discount the Catloc device for its customers, while it researches more anti-theft technologies, the BBC understands. Honda has a different take on the matter - it says that Honda Accord and Jazz models from 2008 onwards come with a tray under the car to make it harder for thieves to get at the catalytic converter. And in car models from 2015 onwards, the catalytic converter has been placed within the engine bay, so a thief would need to disassemble the car to get at it. Dafydd Dylan, commercial manager of the catalytic converters division at FJ Church and Sons, told the BBC that his firm is constantly receiving calls from members of the public asking how much they could get if they were to sell catalytic converters from car models such as Totoya Prius, Honda Accord and Honda Jazz. ""We do what we can to discourage it - we don't purchase any units from these models unless they come from a reputable dealer,"" he said. He added that there were also ways to tell if suppliers were trying to sell stolen goods: ""When we get a packet, usually there will be a range of low-end and high-end catalytic converters in it. ""We have refused to work with some suppliers for certain packets containing a disproportionate amount of high-grade scrap converters."" Toyota says it is trying to support its customers while consulting with the police to improve anti-theft measures However, although it has been illegal to pay cash for scrap metal since 2013, he says there are some dealers who will pay cash for catalytic converters, which tempts the thieves. ""The police needs to start to put people in jail for paying cash for scrap metal - as soon as they do that, the trade would slow down and stop,"" he said. The British Metals Recycling Association agrees: ""It is unlikely that any stolen catalytic converters will enter a BMRA member yard due to 'know your customer' checks. ""However, there will be yards that operate illegally, willingly take stolen material and pay cash for it. There will also be no record of the transaction. This is due to the lack of enforcement of the Scrap Metals Dealers Act 2013 and its complementary legislation in Scotland, The Air Weapons Licensing Act 2015.""

Thousands join UK climate change protests,"This video can not be played Global climate strike: Protests take place across England Thousands of people around the UK have joined a global climate change protest, with pupils walking out of schools and workers downing tools to demand action. Millions around the world are taking part in the""climate strike"" day, with rallies in British cities including Glasgow, Manchester and London. Anna Taylor, a co-founder of UK Student Climate Network, said it was ""very easy"" to persuade people to show up. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said ""every child"" should be in school. He added: ""They should be learning, they shouldn't be bunking off and it's very irresponsible for people to encourage children to do so."" Huge crowds join day of climate action - live updates Climate protest: A very different kind of school trip In pictures: Global climate strike Hundreds miss school for climate strike protest Student Jessica Ahmed, 16, emailed her school to warn that she would be joining the protests instead of being in class. Speaking at a protest in Westminster, she said: ""School is important but so is my future. ""If politicians were taking the appropriate action we need - and had been taking this action a long time ago when it was recognised the world was changing in a negative way -  then I would not have to be skipping school."" Pupils left the classroom for the coast in Cullercoats, North Tyneside Organisers estimated that around 100,000 people attended a rally in central London, while more than 20,000 were thought to have marched in Edinburgh and 10,000 in Brighton. In Belfast, organisers put the turnout at between 3,000 and 4,000, with young people taking over the Cornmarket area of the city centre and staging a ""mass die-in"". And in Birmingham, around 3,000 protesters, including hundreds of children, gathered in the city's Victoria Square before marching through nearby streets. UK Student Climate Network said more than 200 events had been organised across the country. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told young people at the Westminster rally: ""You and a whole generation have brought [climate change] centre stage and I am absolutely delighted about that. ""If we're going to sustain this planet we need to get to net zero emissions a lot, lot quicker than 2050 [the government's target],"" he said. He wants every country to sign up to theParis Agreement, which commits signatory nations to keeping global temperatures ""well below"" 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times. Referring to President Donald Trump, Mr Corbyn said it was ""disgraceful when you get a president of a major country like the US"" whosays they will walk away. The global protests come ahead of a summit at the UN next week that will urge countries to do more to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Children hold a similar ""die in"" in Cambridge Dozens of pupils from John Stainer Community Primary school in Brockley, south-east London, were among those taking part in protests in London. Head teacher Sue Harte said ""children need to know that they have a right to democratic protest"". Sebastian, a pupil at the school, said he joined the protests to help fight global warming. Sebastian says he knows how important it is to look after the planet ""They, the government, don't understand that we're going to go through it and they are not,"" he said. Eight-year-old Sohan and Nayan, five, also from south-east London, joined protesters with their mother, Celine. Sohan said: ""We want to save our planet and we hope that marching will help."" Sohan and Nayan with their mother, Celine At the Belfast protest, Extinction Rebellion activist Lorraine Montague, from County Tyrone, was dressed as a swan to highlight the threat of climate change to wildlife. ""Our climate is at crisis point and the government is not doing anything about it,"" she said. ""We are grieving for our future. I don't feel happy about having children, the way our climate is going."" Children join climate change protests in NI Thousands to join school strikes on climate change What is climate change doing to Wales? In Edinburgh, demonstrators - the majority of them young people - chanted and sang as they marched from the Meadows to Holyrood Park near the Scottish Parliament. They carried placards reading ""Scotland, you're not too wee to change the world"" and ""If you were smarter, I would be in school"". Young climate activists in Glasgow think children could ""save the planet"" Children from Terra Nova Secondary in Cheshire are attending the UK Student Climate Network's strike in Manchester Extinction Rebellion, which organised its own climate and environment protests in the UK earlier this year, said it stood ""in solidarity"" with those taking part. It added that its members were joining the strikes and holding their own events, including a choir and ""kids' space"" in Victoria Tower Gardens, Westminster, and outside King's College London. Protesters in Manchester, where at least one clothing store closed to support the strike This video can not be played Climate protest: 'This is more important than a maths lesson' Some trade unions, including the TUC, the University and College Union and Unite, are supporting members who take part in the ""strikes"". Co-operative Bank said it supported workers who want to join the action, while US clothing brand Patagonia closed all of its stores and took out adverts to back the protesters. But in Norwich, protester Tiffany Wallace said her employer declined to give her time off work to join demonstrators ""because they didn't think it was important"". ""The worst thing they can do is fire me,"" said the 33-year-old. ""I don't feel I should compromise my own values and integrity and what's important, so I can make money for a business."" Tiffany Wallace said her company declined to give her permission to join the protests Energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng said he could not ""endorse children leaving school"" to take part in the protests. But he said he did support ""their energy, their creativity, and the fact that they have completely mastered these issues and take them very seriously"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson all supported the walkout for the Youth Strike 4 Climate campaign. The Metropolitan Police said seven people were arrested for public order offences, but overall the day ran ""smoothly"". Commander Dave Musker said a ""tiny minority of protesters"" tried to block Lambeth Bridge, a key route for emergency services to St Thomas' Hospital. One other man was arrested on the bridge on suspicion of discharging a flare in a public place. Teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg - who inspired the protests - sailed to the US ahead of the UN Climate Action Summit in New York next week The global action follows a long-running series of school strikes initially inspired by activist Greta Thunberg. The teenager, from Sweden, is also playing a role in the day's events and is set to join a rally planned in New York, where world leaders will meet at the UN next week.

UK PM to discuss climate and Brexit at UN meeting,"It is Boris Johnson's first visit to the United Nations as prime minister Climate change, instability in the Middle East and Brexit will be on the agenda when Boris Johnson meets other world leaders in New York next week. The prime minister will hold talks with Donald Trump, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel among others at the UN's annual General Assembly. He will also meet India's Narendra Modi and Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar. The Irish government has said ""quite a wide gap"" remains between it and the UK over a mutually acceptable Brexit deal. Speaking on Friday, its foreign minister Simon Coveney said the ""mood music"" had improved but claims the two sides were inching towards an agreement were ""spin"". The UK is due to leave the EU on 31 October unless the bloc agrees to further extend the process. Mr Johnson has said he will not ask for another delay. Brexit secretary: EU and UK share common purpose Thousands join climate change protests across UK Saudi oil attack drones launched in Iran - US officials Although Brexit is not officially on the agenda of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly, a senior government official said they were ""sure it will come up"". Mr Johnson, who will arrive in New York on Sunday, will meet the German and French leaders as well as European Council president Donald Tusk. It is thought theywill discuss a series of ideas put forward bythe UK on Thursday aimed at breaking the current deadlock. ""What this gives the PM an opportunity to do is to talk to them at leader level about what some of our proposals are,"" the government official added. ""At the same time we are under no illusions that there's an awful lot of work to do."" The US and French leaders have very different views about Brexit The General Assembly is the largest gathering of world leaders in a single place - providing a forum to discuss issues of global concern. Nuclear disarmament, sustainable development and global healthcare are among the main issues are on the agenda, while a separate climate summit will start on Monday. Last week's attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia - which Houthi rebels in Yemen have claimed responsibility for, but which the US blames on Iran - will also be discussed. As well as meeting Mr Trump for the second time since he became PM in July, Mr Johnson is also due to hold one-to-one meetings with the leaders of Turkey, Egypt, Ukraine and Jordan. The PM, who is expected to be accompanied on the trip by his partner Carrie Symonds, said he had three priorities for the upcoming meeting. ""First, how Britain can work with our European and American allies on peace and stability in the Middle East,"" he said. ""Second, how science and new technologies can help the world deal with climate change and the threats to biodiversity. ""And third, how post-Brexit Britain will be a better place to invest in and live in.""

New Oor Wullie statue of war veteran to be made,"Tom Gilzean's family wanted his Oor Wullie statue to remain in Edinburgh city centre A new Oor Wullie statue is to be made of a 99-year-old war veteran after his family was out-bid when the original sculpture went up for auction. The statue of well-known Edinburgh fund-raiser Tom Gilzean was sold to a mystery bidder on Thursday night. But now a local taxi company has stepped in to commission another sculpture. Mr Gilzean's son Douglas said the family was ""absolutely thrilled"" at the news. The sculpture was part of the Scotland-wide Oor Wullie's Bucket Trail which took place in several Scottish towns and cities over the summer. All the statues are now being sold off to raise money for charity. An auction of 60 statues in Edinburgh raised Â£318,000 for Edinburgh Children's Hospital Charity on Thursday night. Mr Gilzean's family wanted to buy his statue and keep it in the city centre. They had raised Â£7,000 through crowdfunding, but the sculpturewas bought for Â£13,000 by a mystery bidder. Now Central Taxis has commissioned another sculpture from artist Chris Rutterford. It will feature Mr Gilzean - who has raised more than Â£1m for charity - in a different pose so that the buyer still has an original version. The prolific fundraiser is well known in Edinburgh, where Mr Gilzean is regularly seen with his collecting tin and trademark tartan trousers on Princes Street and the Royal Mile. Douglas Gilzean said: ""We are absolutely thrilled that another Oor Wullie sculpture of my dad will be created."" A location for the statue has not yet been confirmed. Tom Gilzean was awarded the Edinburgh Medal in 2014 But Douglas said: ""We're thrilled a sculpture of Tom will be staying on the streets of Edinburgh as a tribute to him."" He paid tribute to Central Taxis for their ""incredible support and generosity"". The mystery buyer has been notified, and welcomed the decision to create a new sculpture. Callum Hogg, general manager of Central Taxis, said Tom was ""an inspiration to all"" and that his fund-raising work was ""nothing short of incredible"". ""We are delighted that another sculpture will be created to stay in the city, as benefits an Edinburgh icon, and look forward to seeing the new Tom take his permanent place of residence somewhere in Edinburgh soon,"" he added. Roslyn Neely, CEO of Edinburgh Children's Hospital Charity, said: ""Tom is an incredible man and is such a fantastic supporter of ours.

'Why weren't we told our daughter was in trouble?',"Ceara Thacker's parents believe she ""fell through the cracks"" between various mental health services while at university. Speaking after a coroner ruled their daughter killed herself, they say they hope lessons can be learned from her death. The end of Ceara Thacker's first year at the University of Liverpool was just weeks away. She seemed upbeat and happy when she returned home for the Easter break, her father Iain recalled. The 19-year-old was excited about a big family party and to see her boyfriend Sam - and his dog - who still lived in Yorkshire. 'Patchy' help for students' mental health New system to spot troubled uni students Parents 'should be told of student mental health' Things appeared to have been going well for Ceara. The philosophy student had always been a voracious reader and a deep thinker and the course seemed like a good fit for her. She had loved the atmosphere of Liverpool when she visited on an open day, and had made good friends. Yet just a few weeks after she returned to Liverpool after that Easter break at home, Ceara was found dead in her halls room.A coroner ruled she died by suicide. It is the stunned silence Iain Thacker remembers most about the moment he and Ceara's mother Lorraine were told, just hours after their daughter had died, that she had previously attempted suicide. ""Straight away we looked aghast at each other and thought, 'How can we not know this?' 'How can we not be told this?'"" he said. Ceara had struggled with her mental health since she was 13 and first showed her mother a self-inflicted cut on her hand. Throughout her early teenage years, Ceara was helped by Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services, commonly known as CAMHS, and had always been fairly open about her mental health with her parents. She also seemed able to seek professional help when she felt she needed it, Iain said. Ceara had struggled with her mental health since the age of 13 Ceara declared her mental health problems on both her university application, and it was followed up by the University of Liverpool. ""I remember she couldn't wait for us to leave,"" Iain said of the day he dropped her off at the halls of residence. Yet over the next eight months, unknown to her parents, Ceara would seek help for mental health problems several times before she died, the inquest heard. Just a few weeks after her arrival in Liverpool, Ceara attended A&E and told a mental health nurse she was struggling. She later attended a GP appointment and was prescribed anti-depressants. Into the new year, Ceara continued to struggle. On 21 February 2018, the coroner heard she had texted a friend to say she had taken a number of tablets. The friend took Ceara to the reception in the halls of residence and told the staff member there. A member of staff in Ceara's halls of residence called a taxi for her to attend A&E after an overdose They ordered her a taxi to get to A&E but nobody escalated the incident to other parts of the university, including its mental health team. After being treated for the overdose at the Royal Liverpool Hospital, Ceara was assessed by two mental health nurses. The inquest was told how records of that assessment were incomplete and not sent to Ceara's GP. One of the nurses, Lindsay Cleary, told the inquest she was sorry for the error, which came after a busy shift. The day after, Ceara sent an email of her own accord to the university's mental health team requesting an appointment. Ceara's family remember her as ""perceptive, intelligent, loyal, funny and extremely kind"" She did not receive a response for almost two months due to what the university said were ""exceptional circumstances"" - including a strike by staff at its mental health advice service. Ceara was eventually offered an appointment, her first with the campus mental health team, but none of the plan put together to help her at the meeting was acted upon. She died two weeks later on 11 May 2018. The University of Liverpool said it had since ""conducted a thorough review of the support Ceara was offered"" and had also recruited more staff at its mental health advice service. After her death, a letter from Ceara's GP practice was found in her room, asking her to get in touch. A handwritten note on the page urged ""do it!!"" underlined and in capital letters. ""We don't know why Ceara didn't feel able to tell us what was going on. However, we feel very strongly that someone in a position of responsibility needed to ask her if she wanted us to be told,"" Iain said. ""If we had been told what was happening with Ceara we would have made a difference."" Rosie Tressler, the chief executive of mental health charityStudent Minds,external, told the BBC she was optimistic about the progress being made by the higher education sector with innovative schemes being tried and tested by institutions. At Bristol University, where about a dozen students died through suspected suicide in a short period, all studentsare asked to ""opt-in""to a policy which automatically informs a parent or guardian if there are concerns for their wellbeing in the future. ""We can't rest on our laurels. With so many challenges, we can't stop working on student mental health. It will require partnership between universities, NHS services and the student voice,"" Ms Tressler added. Liverpool area coroner Anita Bhardwaj concluded that Ceara died by suicide. She said Ceara experienced an ""unacceptable delay"" in accessing the university's mental health service and there were several missed opportunities to refer her for mental health support. Mrs Bhardwaj said there was no record of discussions between medical professionals and Ceara about contacting her family. She added: ""It is difficult and unclear whether Ceara would have had a different outcome had she had additional mental health appointments, been given an urgent appointment, and had family involvement."" Gavin Brown, of the University of Liverpool, said it had ""instigated a number of improvements to mental health support services"" with a Â£500,000 investment and new guidance on asking students about sharing information. He said some students might not want to inform family and that in those cases staff would work with students to ""identify alternative support networks"". The university has chosen not to adopt a campus-wide ""opt-in"" policy to automatically inform parents of concerns for a student's wellbeing.

Thomas Cook asks government for bailout,"Tour operator Thomas Cook has approached the government in an attempt to plug a gap in its funding. The travel company could fall into administration this weekend unless it finds Â£200m in extra funds needed to secure its future. ButBBC business editor Simon Jack saysif holidaymakers are hoping the government will save the day, they may be disappointed. A collapse would leave 150,000 UK holidaymakers stranded. The BBC's business editor said that while a private sector deal may still be possible, the noises coming out of the government at the moment suggested the UK taxpayer was unlikely to become Thomas Cook's saviour. The troubled operator hoped to seal a rescue led by China's Fosun this week. But the creditor banks issued a last-minute demand that the travel company find an extra Â£200m. The Civil Aviation Authority is on standby with a repatriation contingency plan called Operation Matterhorn. The potential cost of bringing home passengers is put at about Â£600m. In his blog,Simon Jack says the government does not recognise the choice being presented as between spending Â£200m on a cash injection to save the company versus a Â£600m bill to repatriate UK holidaymakers. He writes that the government's understanding is that most Thomas Cook customers will be covered by travel insurance or Atol protection - a fund paid for through industry levies. He also says the government's previous refusal to offer assistance to companieslike Carillionwould make helping Thomas Cook very difficult in principle and in practice. Furthermore, the matter is being handled by the Department for Transport - which organised the repatriation of customers of the failed airline Monarch - rather than the Department for Business, he adds. There has been a shift in tone from Thomas Cook on Twitter, with worried customers being told to ignore media speculation on Friday. Now they are being reminded they do have Atol protection ""in the event that Thomas Cook goes into administration"". Thomas Cook: Your questions answered What's gone wrong at Thomas Cook? Customers fear ruined weddings and trips Thomas Cook: MP calls for 'leadership' Travel expert Simon Calder said all Thomas Cook flights in and out of the UK were running normally on Saturday morning, and travel agencies would be opening at the usual times. He said that while Thomas Cook remains a going concern - albeit in terrible trouble - there was very little anyone who was on a Thomas Cook holiday or has one booked in the coming days or weeks could do. Anyone trying to cancel holidays could expect to be given short shrift and end up losing some or all of their money, he added. Currently there are 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British Thomas Cook, one of the world's largest travel companies, was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and now has annual sales of Â£9bn. It employs 22,000 staff, 9,000 of those in the UK and serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries. The TSSA union's general secretary Manuel Cortes told the BBC that his members' ""main concern was if they had a job on Monday morning"". Jacqui Cunningham and her partner Angus McNair are unsure whether they should pay the outstanding balance on their holiday Teacher Jacqui Cunningham and her partner, train driver Angus McNair, from Brentwood, Essex, have booked a holiday to the Maldives with Thomas Cook for December. The luxury trip is to celebrate Ms Cunningham's recovery from cancer. They have paid a deposit of Â£500 and the balance of Â£8,000 is due by midnight on Friday. Thomas Cook is, of course, still operating. But their predicament underlines the anxiety many customers are feeling. Ms Cunningham and Mr McNair called the customer service helpline and asked if they could delay paying the Â£8,000 until they know that the tour operator is not going to fall into administration. But they were told the deadline remains, or they would lose their Â£500 deposit. ""We were going to pay on debit card, but now I think we'll put it on the credit card if we go forward,"" she said. Thomas Cook's financial difficulties have mounted over the past year, culminating with the agreement in August of a rescue deal led by its biggest shareholder Fosun. Thomas Cook 'racing to finalise rescue deal' Weak pound boosting UK tourism industry In July, Thomas Cook produced a business plan saying that it needed Â£900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of Â£150m. The Â£900m would come from Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors. The group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional Â£200m on top of the Â£900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to Â£1.1bn. Thomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional Â£200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out and the group of creditors will not come back to the table unless that additional funding is found. A final vote on that deal was due to take place this week, but it has been delayed until next Friday in the face of the latest demand for extra standby funding. Earlier this week, Thomas Cook said it was ""focused on completing"" the deal. It is believed to be negotiating with its banks, bondholders and Fosun in an attempt to keep the rescue on track. In May, the operator reported a Â£1.5bn loss for the first half of the year. It has also recently issued three profit warnings and is struggling to reduce its debts. It has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit. If you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment. Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating. If you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme. If you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund. When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.

Brexit secretary: EU and UK share common purpose,"This video can not be played Barclay: No one wants to see a no-deal Brexit Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has said the UK and EU share a ""common purpose"" in reaching a new withdrawal deal, after a meeting in Brussels with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier. He said they had had ""serious detailed discussions"" and things were ""moving forward with momentum"". Mr Barnier said it had been a ""cordial"" meeting, but ""lots of work has to be done in the next few days"". The deadline for the UK to exit the EU is 31 October. On Thursday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said a new Brexit deal could still be reached by then. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said some ""progress"" was being made, although it was important not to ""exaggerate"" this. But Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told the BBC on Friday that there was a ""wide gap"" between the UK and the EU, with Brussels ""still waiting for serious proposals"" from London. And a leaked memo from the European Commission said the UK had confirmed its proposals for replacing the Irish backstop ""do not amount to legally operational solutions and would have to be developed during the transitional period"". The memo also said the UK's proposals did not avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, or preserve the integrity of the single market. However, a UK government source insisted their proposals were ""serious and workable"" and would avoid a hard border. ""As for the Commission, two months ago they said we couldn't reopen the withdrawal agreement and there was absolutely no alternative to the backstop - now we are having detailed discussions. ""Leaks from Brussels on Twitter are par for the course,  you can set your watch by them. ""What we're focused on is actually getting a deal in the room - we trust they'll do the same."" 'Dose of reality needed' over Brexit deal hopes UK shares Brexit documents with EU Kuenssberg: What happens next if the PM gets a Brexit deal? UK 'has 12 days to set out Brexit plans' The backstop - the policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit - has proved the biggest point of contention in EU-UK talks so far. It was a major sticking point in former Prime Minister Theresa May's attempts to get Parliament to back her withdrawal agreement, which was rejected three times by MPs. Amid the white noise of Brexit, there has only ever been one question that really matters: is there any sign that things might be about to change? Meetings get excitedly talked up in advance (I plead guilty). Anodyne statements follow shortly afterwards. In short, the EU says the UK has not yet provided enough detail on a plan to replace the so-called backstop, to keep the border on the island of Ireland open under all circumstances. The UK says it is dreaming up all sorts of ideas. So what happens next? New York. A shindig at the United Nations next week - and with it the chance for the prime minister to have one-on-one chats with the likes of President Macron of France and Chancellor Merkel of Germany. Could they provide the oomph needed to knock together a deal? It still looks less likely than likely, but who knows? Mr Johnson, who has said he wants to leave the EU - preferably with a deal - by 31 October, has urged the EU to scrap the backstop. But the EU has asked for detailed alternative proposals. Following the latest meeting, which overran, Mr Barclay said: ""There's a common purpose in Dublin, in London and here in Brussels to see a deal over the line."" He added that the two sides had been ""getting into the detail"" and that more ""technical"" discussions would happen next week. Mr Johnson and European Council President Donald Tusk are also expected to hold talks when the United Nations General Assembly takes place in New York next week. Mr Barclay said this ""underscores the purpose there is on both sides to get a deal and that is what we are working very hard to secure"". This video can not be played Barnier: UK Brexit proposals must protect peace in Ireland He added that ""a clear message has been given both by President Juncker and the prime minister"" and both sides were ""working hard"". Also speaking after the meeting, Mr Barnier said he was not optimistic or pessimistic but ""still determined"". ""Brexit is a school of patience but we are still ready to reach an agreement,"" he said. He said that any proposal from the UK to replace the backstop ""must reach all the objectives of the backstop"". These were to ""protect the peace in Ireland, to protect the all=Ireland economy, and also to protect the consumers and the businesses of the EU and the single market"", Mr Barnier said. The prime minister has said the UK needs to leave in a way that allows it to ""do things differently"" and ""not remain under the control of the EU in terms of laws and trade policy"". But he also reiterated the need to ensure no hard border returned to Northern Ireland, and the Good Friday Agreement -which helped bring an end to the Troubles- was protected.

This happened after Finland's prime minister said Mr Johnson had 12 days to set out his Brexit plans to the EU - although a government source said the development was not in response to those remarks. Thursday saw the final day of the legal battle over Mr Johnson's decision to prorogue - suspend - Parliament at the UK's Supreme Court. Its president, Lady Hale, promised a decision early next week.

Efforts to cut sugar out of food way off target,"Efforts to cut a fifth of the sugar out of our food by next year are way off target, figures from Public Health England show. Between 2015 and 2018 the average sugar content of shop-bought food fell by just 2.9% and the amount of sugar we actually eat has gone up. This is despite a tax on sugary drinks leading to a 29% fall in their sugar content. The food industry said the voluntary target was too ambitious. But experts said parts of the industry were ""asleep at the wheel"" and not tackling obesity. Obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease and is puttingmillions of peopleat risk of cancer. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has openly questioned whether ""sin taxes"" actually cut obesity. Boris Johnson promises review of 'unhealthy food taxes' Tax unhealthy food, says top doctor The sugar tax - officially the soft drinks industry levy - was introduced in April 2018. It charges manufacturers 24p per litre on very sweet drinks and 18p per litre on medium-sugar ones. Brands such as Fanta, Ribena and Irn Bru changed their recipes in response. On average, 100mls of sugary drinks now contain 28.8% less sugar than in 2015. Sales of soft drinks increased between 2015 and 2018, but shifted towards low- or zero-sugar versions. It works out as more than 30,000 tonnes less sugar - 5 billion fewer calories - being sold in such drinks each year. The progress on the sugar content of pop is in stark contrast to that in other foods. Public Health England has a voluntary sugar reduction programme with food manufacturers and retailers. Children's favourites - including cakes, chocolate, breakfast cereals, yoghurts and biscuits - are all being targeted. The aim is a 20% reduction in their average sugar content by 2020, compared with 2015 levels. In 2017 the amount cut had reached 2%, and by 2018 (the latest data we have) the figure had crept up to 2.9%. There was supposed to have been a 5% reduction in the first year of the plan. Sue Kellie, from the British Dietetic Association, said it was a ""worrying lack of progress"" and it was ""very unlikely"" the target would be met. Seemingly not, at least when we are at home. Despite the success of the sugar tax and the 2.9% cut in sugar due to reformulating foods - we are still eating more of the stuff. The report says the amount of sugar in foods bought at the supermarket has increased from 723,000 tonnes in 2015 to 743,000 tonnes in 2018. PHE officials said that was the equivalent of everybody increasing their sugar consumption by 0.5%. This could be because we are buying more or portion sizes are getting bigger. There was also a large increase in sales of ice cream and sorbets in 2018, possibly due to the hot weather. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said there was ""some encouraging progress"" from the food industry which he described as ""realistic at this early stage"". Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the tax on sugar was a ""success story"".

He added: ""If industry fails to act for child health, then we look forward to the introduction of mandatory sugar reduction targets in 2020.""

"Brexit secretary: EU and UK share common purposeBoth sides promise to look for an agreement ahead of 31 October, following a meeting in Brussels.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Barclay: No one wants to see a no-deal Brexit Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has said the UK and EU share a ""common purpose"" in reaching a new withdrawal deal, after a meeting in Brussels with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier. He said they had had ""serious detailed discussions"" and things were ""moving forward with momentum"". Mr Barnier said it had been a ""cordial"" meeting, but ""lots of work has to be done in the next few days"". The deadline for the UK to exit the EU is 31 October. On Thursday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said a new Brexit deal could still be reached by then. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said some ""progress"" was being made, although it was important not to ""exaggerate"" this. But Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told the BBC on Friday that there was a ""wide gap"" between the UK and the EU, with Brussels ""still waiting for serious proposals"" from London. And a leaked memo from the European Commission said the UK had confirmed its proposals for replacing the Irish backstop ""do not amount to legally operational solutions and would have to be developed during the transitional period"". The memo also said the UK's proposals did not avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, or preserve the integrity of the single market. However, a UK government source insisted their proposals were ""serious and workable"" and would avoid a hard border. ""As for the Commission, two months ago they said we couldn't reopen the withdrawal agreement and there was absolutely no alternative to the backstop - now we are having detailed discussions. ""Leaks from Brussels on Twitter are par for the course,  you can set your watch by them. ""What we're focused on is actually getting a deal in the room - we trust they'll do the same."" 'Dose of reality needed' over Brexit deal hopes UK shares Brexit documents with EU Kuenssberg: What happens next if the PM gets a Brexit deal? UK 'has 12 days to set out Brexit plans' The backstop - the policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit - has proved the biggest point of contention in EU-UK talks so far. It was a major sticking point in former Prime Minister Theresa May's attempts to get Parliament to back her withdrawal agreement, which was rejected three times by MPs. Amid the white noise of Brexit, there has only ever been one question that really matters: is there any sign that things might be about to change? Meetings get excitedly talked up in advance (I plead guilty). Anodyne statements follow shortly afterwards. In short, the EU says the UK has not yet provided enough detail on a plan to replace the so-called backstop, to keep the border on the island of Ireland open under all circumstances. The UK says it is dreaming up all sorts of ideas. So what happens next? New York. A shindig at the United Nations next week - and with it the chance for the prime minister to have one-on-one chats with the likes of President Macron of France and Chancellor Merkel of Germany. Could they provide the oomph needed to knock together a deal? It still looks less likely than likely, but who knows? Mr Johnson, who has said he wants to leave the EU - preferably with a deal - by 31 October, has urged the EU to scrap the backstop. But the EU has asked for detailed alternative proposals. Following the latest meeting, which overran, Mr Barclay said: ""There's a common purpose in Dublin, in London and here in Brussels to see a deal over the line."" He added that the two sides had been ""getting into the detail"" and that more ""technical"" discussions would happen next week. Mr Johnson and European Council President Donald Tusk are also expected to hold talks when the United Nations General Assembly takes place in New York next week. Mr Barclay said this ""underscores the purpose there is on both sides to get a deal and that is what we are working very hard to secure"". This video can not be played Barnier: UK Brexit proposals must protect peace in Ireland He added that ""a clear message has been given both by President Juncker and the prime minister"" and both sides were ""working hard"". Also speaking after the meeting, Mr Barnier said he was not optimistic or pessimistic but ""still determined"". ""Brexit is a school of patience but we are still ready to reach an agreement,"" he said. He said that any proposal from the UK to replace the backstop ""must reach all the objectives of the backstop"". These were to ""protect the peace in Ireland, to protect the all=Ireland economy, and also to protect the consumers and the businesses of the EU and the single market"", Mr Barnier said. The prime minister has said the UK needs to leave in a way that allows it to ""do things differently"" and ""not remain under the control of the EU in terms of laws and trade policy"". But he also reiterated the need to ensure no hard border returned to Northern Ireland, and the Good Friday Agreement -which helped bring an end to the Troubles- was protected. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button On Thursday, the UK government saidconfidential documents that ""reflect the ideas the UK has put forward"" on Brexit had been shared with the EU. This happened after Finland's prime minister said Mr Johnson had 12 days to set out his Brexit plans to the EU - although a government source said the development was not in response to those remarks. Thursday saw the final day of the legal battle over Mr Johnson's decision to prorogue - suspend - Parliament at the UK's Supreme Court. Its president, Lady Hale, promised a decision early next week.

Rugby fans advised to cover tattoos in JapanSupporters are warned tattoos can be associated with gangsters in the World Cup host country.,"Wales fan Gavin Baos admits he is ""concerned"" at causing offence in Japan Welsh rugby fans travelling to Japan for the World Cup have been urged to cover up tattoos to avoid offending some of their hosts. Hundreds of supporters are heading to the country ahead ofWales' opening gameof the tournament on Monday. Tattoos have long been associated by some in Japan with yakuza crime syndicates, and tattooed tourists could be barred from communal hot springs. Fans are also being asked to wear shirts when using gyms or pools. Gavin Baos, 42, from Cardiff, is spending 11 days following Wales in Japan with a group of friends. Mr Baos has Maori and Celtic-themed body art Mr Baos, a financial adviser, has extensive tattoos from elbow to wrist on both arms and covering much of his lower legs. ""They are pretty big tattoos so it has been a real concern,"" he said. ""A friend in Tokyo said there's no way you can go into some gyms or baths with tattoos as it would really cause offence. ""It's really important to know these customs because the last thing I want to do is cause offence. Buy a house or go to Japan? England football fans gets 'winners' tattoo Wales fan driving to Japan ""Normally I live in shorts, T-shirts and flip-flops but I've found myself buying long-sleeve shirts and jogging bottoms to have as a back-up, just in case. ""The only frustrating thing is that if it's 25 degrees and 100% humidity, it could get a bit uncomfortable."" Ross Moriarty is one of the Wales internationals with extensive body art Keith Dunn, the honorary Japanese consul to Wales, said: ""We like tattoos in Wales. ""I think making sure you understand the customs are different and making sure you cover up tattoos - if you're going to go swimming or to the gym, just cover up."" World Rugby, the sport's governing body,has posted advice,externalto the estimated 400,000 travelling fans. A 2015 survey found that 56% of hotels and inns did not allow tattooed guests to use communal bathing facilities. Japan's tourism agency has called on spas in the country to relax their rules. The organisation suggested that hot springs - onsens - and bath houses could offer visitors stickers to cover up tattoos, or set aside specific times of day when tattooed bathers can use the facilities. This video can not be played The end of Japanese tattoo art? Strachan Sports Travel, of Cowbridge in the Vale of Glamorgan, is taking six tour groups of Wales fans to the tournament, whichruns between 20 September and 2 November. General manager Angharad Griffiths said: ""It may be a little more relaxed during the World Cup, so not to upset certain cultures. ""However we have advised anyone with tattoos that there may be occasions when they need to cover them."" The advice is not limited to fans, with tattoos common among players, especially Pacific Islanders and Maoris. Wales player James Davies had his nickname ""Cubby Boi"" tattooed during a trip to Las Vegas While not required during matches, visiting players and officials have been warned by World Rugby to cover up in public. A Welsh Rugby Union spokesman said: ""Having toured Japan in 2013 and visited the country on many occasions as part of our Rugby World Cup preparations, the management and the squad are looking forward to embracing the local culture and will of course comply with all protocols.""

Thomas Cook races to secure more rescue funds,"Tour operator Thomas Cook has approached the government in an attempt to plug a gap in its funding. The travel company could fall into administration this weekend unless it finds Â£200m in extra funds needed to secure its future. ButBBC business editor Simon Jack saysif holidaymakers are hoping the government will save the day, they may be disappointed. A collapse would leave 150,000 UK holidaymakers stranded. The BBC's business editor said that while a private sector deal may still be possible, the noises coming out of the government at the moment suggested the UK taxpayer was unlikely to become Thomas Cook's saviour. The troubled operator hoped to seal a rescue led by China's Fosun this week. But the creditor banks issued a last-minute demand that the travel company find an extra Â£200m. The Civil Aviation Authority is on standby with a repatriation contingency plan called Operation Matterhorn. The potential cost of bringing home passengers is put at about Â£600m. In his blog,Simon Jack says the government does not recognise the choice being presented as between spending Â£200m on a cash injection to save the company versus a Â£600m bill to repatriate UK holidaymakers. He writes that the government's understanding is that most Thomas Cook customers will be covered by travel insurance or Atol protection - a fund paid for through industry levies. He also says the government's previous refusal to offer assistance to companieslike Carillionwould make helping Thomas Cook very difficult in principle and in practice. Furthermore, the matter is being handled by the Department for Transport - which organised the repatriation of customers of the failed airline Monarch - rather than the Department for Business, he adds. There has been a shift in tone from Thomas Cook on Twitter, with worried customers being told to ignore media speculation on Friday. Now they are being reminded they do have Atol protection ""in the event that Thomas Cook goes into administration"". Thomas Cook: Your questions answered What's gone wrong at Thomas Cook? Customers fear ruined weddings and trips Thomas Cook: MP calls for 'leadership' Travel expert Simon Calder said all Thomas Cook flights in and out of the UK were running normally on Saturday morning, and travel agencies would be opening at the usual times. He said that while Thomas Cook remains a going concern - albeit in terrible trouble - there was very little anyone who was on a Thomas Cook holiday or has one booked in the coming days or weeks could do. Anyone trying to cancel holidays could expect to be given short shrift and end up losing some or all of their money, he added. Currently there are 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British Thomas Cook, one of the world's largest travel companies, was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and now has annual sales of Â£9bn. It employs 22,000 staff, 9,000 of those in the UK and serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries. The TSSA union's general secretary Manuel Cortes told the BBC that his members' ""main concern was if they had a job on Monday morning"". Jacqui Cunningham and her partner Angus McNair are unsure whether they should pay the outstanding balance on their holiday Teacher Jacqui Cunningham and her partner, train driver Angus McNair, from Brentwood, Essex, have booked a holiday to the Maldives with Thomas Cook for December. The luxury trip is to celebrate Ms Cunningham's recovery from cancer. They have paid a deposit of Â£500 and the balance of Â£8,000 is due by midnight on Friday. Thomas Cook is, of course, still operating. But their predicament underlines the anxiety many customers are feeling. Ms Cunningham and Mr McNair called the customer service helpline and asked if they could delay paying the Â£8,000 until they know that the tour operator is not going to fall into administration. But they were told the deadline remains, or they would lose their Â£500 deposit. ""We were going to pay on debit card, but now I think we'll put it on the credit card if we go forward,"" she said. Thomas Cook's financial difficulties have mounted over the past year, culminating with the agreement in August of a rescue deal led by its biggest shareholder Fosun. Thomas Cook 'racing to finalise rescue deal' Weak pound boosting UK tourism industry In July, Thomas Cook produced a business plan saying that it needed Â£900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of Â£150m. The Â£900m would come from Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors. The group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional Â£200m on top of the Â£900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to Â£1.1bn. Thomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional Â£200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out and the group of creditors will not come back to the table unless that additional funding is found. A final vote on that deal was due to take place this week, but it has been delayed until next Friday in the face of the latest demand for extra standby funding. Earlier this week, Thomas Cook said it was ""focused on completing"" the deal. It is believed to be negotiating with its banks, bondholders and Fosun in an attempt to keep the rescue on track. In May, the operator reported a Â£1.5bn loss for the first half of the year. It has also recently issued three profit warnings and is struggling to reduce its debts. It has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit. If you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment. Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating. If you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme. If you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund. When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.

Why are young activists attracting so much hate?,"Youth climate activists pose with Greta Thunberg (C) during a demonstration From the first protest by a single student, the school climate strike movement has been a lightning rod for criticism. Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teenager who inspired the now-global movement, has become a primary target. On Wednesday, the 16-year-old arrived in New York after completing her voyage across the Atlantic aboard an environmentally friendly yacht. She faced a barrage of attacks on the way. ""Freak yachting accidents do happen in August,""Arron Banks, a businessman and prominent Brexit campaigner, tweeted,external. While Mr Banks said the tweet was a joke, many were outraged. Ms Thunberg is not the only eco-activist under fire, though. Four young climate campaigners told the BBC of the abuse they have been subjected to. One was compared to Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels while another said she had been racially abused. These environmentalists have asked difficult questions of politicians, and been ruthlessly derided for doing so. With hostility heightening, why are young climate activists facing so much hate? Since Ms Thunberg's first solo vigil outside Sweden's parliament in August 2018 media attention and criticism have gone hand-in-hand. At first, they were told to stay in school. These students were not on strike,one British Conservative MP tweeted,external, they were truants. Then there were claims that young climate activists were merely the puppets of adults. In February a far-right Dutch lawmaker said students were being influenced by teachers with a political agenda. Who is Greta Thunberg? What is a climate emergency? French MPs boycott teen 'apocalypse guru' UKIP AM accused of 'personal attack' Greta Thunberg When Ms Thunberg travelled to the UK in April, several right-wing media outlets wrote polemics against the teen. One of them, an editorial by the website Spiked, mocked the ""apocalyptic dread in her eyes"". There were sustained attacks by Germany's far-right Alternative fÃ¼r Deutschland (AfD) party ahead of the EU elections in May. Posts about Ms Thunberg and climate change spiked on the party's Facebook page,an investigation, led by Greenpeace Unearthed, found,external. Weeks later, before her address to the French parliament in July, somefar-right and conservative MPs hurled insults at the teen, calling her the ""Justin Bieber of ecology"" and a ""prophetess in shorts"". Some French MPs hurled insults at the young activist ahead of her speech in the French parliament in July Those who have resorted to personal attacks on the activist appear to be ""retreating into various forms of denial"", Nigel Thomas, professor of childhood and youth at the University of Lancashire, says. Given the seriousness of scientists' climate warnings, some ""may feel threatened by a teenager who has clearly understood and faced up to the trouble we are all in"". So far, she has shown restraint, staying mostly above the fray. Her tweeted response to Australian political blogger Andrew Bolt, who described her as ""deeply disturbed"", was an exception.

Instead, Ms Thunberg tends to focus her ire on political leaders. Her brand of environmentalism, however, does not appeal to everyone. In particular, those who ""don't like being told what to do"" and feel children ""don't have the right to say these things"", Richard Black, the director of the environmental think tank the Energy & Climate Intelligence Unit, said. One theory is that, by using shaming tactics, some activists are provoking visceral reactions. But Mr Black said it is governments, not ordinary people, which she and others are targeting. By couching her climate warnings in ominous terms, Greta's message has gained traction. Yet some have accused her of alarmism. Greta Thunberg holds her ""school strike for climate"" sign onboard the racing boat Malizia II in the Atlantic Ocean Prof Thomas disagrees with this assessment. He said her language ""befits the very serious message she feels impelled to convey"". ""I don't see how one can put climate change aside in assessing the appropriateness of her language; that's precisely the issue,"" he says. Ms Thunberg has argued that climate activists are ""just saying what scientists have repeatedly said for decades"". ""I am just a messenger, and yet I get all this hate,"" she wrote on Facebook. The reality is that the children who campaign, including school strikes, have become the bearers of bad news. Global warming, according to theUN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),external, is being caused by human activity. This conclusion is shared by 97% of actively publishing climate scientists,a 2016 study of peer-reviewed journals found,external. If carbon emissions are not curbed, and global temperatures continue to rise, researchers expect the risks of climate change to increase. As purveyors of this scientific consensus, young climate activists are in the crosshairs of those who oppose radical action on it. Dr Stephane Wolton, a London School of Economics professor whose research focuses on accountability, believes young activists should not be held to the same standards as adults. Young people take part in a Fridays for Future demonstration for climate action at DÃ¼sseldorf International Airport He says Ms Thunberg has to accept some scrutiny now she has put herself in the public eye ""but we should not expect a 16-year-old, or even millions of them, to have solutions to such a complicated problem"". Although it is ""fair game"" to accuse her of ""playing on emotions"", personal attacks are not appropriate, he adds. Graphics: Where we are now on climate change Extinction Rebellion: What do they want and is it realistic? Michael Wyness, professor of education studies at the University of Warwick, says children are quite capable of accounting for their claims. Many 16-year-olds would ""probably not recognise themselves as children"", Prof Wyness argues. Ms Thunberg's school strike has become a global movement and set her up as a contender for the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize Regardless of age, Prof Thomas says all activists should be held to account for their political interventions. But he says this should be done ""in a manner appropriate to their age and any other relevant characteristics"". Ms Thunberg has sought to position herself as an impartial messenger, saying ""our school strike has nothing to do with party politics"". The problem is, her campaign ""may be captured by other activists with a broader agenda"", Dr Wolton says. This video can not be played Environmental activist Greta Thunberg says climate change is 'an existential crisis' Sweeping changes to combat climate change will require increased state spending and intervention, an economic approach largely favoured by the left. ""I do think there are certain groups of campaigners, I would say a minority, whose main concern is changing the economic system,"" Mr Black, a former BBC environment correspondent, says. This creates a dilemma for young activists professing their neutrality. For the time being, three of the four young activists the BBC spoke to said they were not interested in politics. None of them intends to change the way they campaign and see politics, and the criticism that flows from it, as a distraction. Aside from climate change, these youngsters have other interests, of course. For example, one said she's happiest when watching Netflix or playing with her dog. Without the placards and slogans, it is easy to forget that many activists are, after all, children. But children doing what they believe to be right in what can be a cruel world.

"Tax cuts sugar in drinks, but we still eat more","Efforts to cut a fifth of the sugar out of our food by next year are way off target, figures from Public Health England show. Between 2015 and 2018 the average sugar content of shop-bought food fell by just 2.9% and the amount of sugar we actually eat has gone up. This is despite a tax on sugary drinks leading to a 29% fall in their sugar content. The food industry said the voluntary target was too ambitious. But experts said parts of the industry were ""asleep at the wheel"" and not tackling obesity. Obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease and is puttingmillions of peopleat risk of cancer. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has openly questioned whether ""sin taxes"" actually cut obesity. Boris Johnson promises review of 'unhealthy food taxes' Tax unhealthy food, says top doctor The sugar tax - officially the soft drinks industry levy - was introduced in April 2018. It charges manufacturers 24p per litre on very sweet drinks and 18p per litre on medium-sugar ones. Brands such as Fanta, Ribena and Irn Bru changed their recipes in response. On average, 100mls of sugary drinks now contain 28.8% less sugar than in 2015. Sales of soft drinks increased between 2015 and 2018, but shifted towards low- or zero-sugar versions. It works out as more than 30,000 tonnes less sugar - 5 billion fewer calories - being sold in such drinks each year. The progress on the sugar content of pop is in stark contrast to that in other foods. Public Health England has a voluntary sugar reduction programme with food manufacturers and retailers. Children's favourites - including cakes, chocolate, breakfast cereals, yoghurts and biscuits - are all being targeted. The aim is a 20% reduction in their average sugar content by 2020, compared with 2015 levels. In 2017 the amount cut had reached 2%, and by 2018 (the latest data we have) the figure had crept up to 2.9%. There was supposed to have been a 5% reduction in the first year of the plan. Sue Kellie, from the British Dietetic Association, said it was a ""worrying lack of progress"" and it was ""very unlikely"" the target would be met. Seemingly not, at least when we are at home. Despite the success of the sugar tax and the 2.9% cut in sugar due to reformulating foods - we are still eating more of the stuff. The report says the amount of sugar in foods bought at the supermarket has increased from 723,000 tonnes in 2015 to 743,000 tonnes in 2018. PHE officials said that was the equivalent of everybody increasing their sugar consumption by 0.5%. This could be because we are buying more or portion sizes are getting bigger. There was also a large increase in sales of ice cream and sorbets in 2018, possibly due to the hot weather. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said there was ""some encouraging progress"" from the food industry which he described as ""realistic at this early stage"". Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the tax on sugar was a ""success story"". But he said overall the food industry was ""largely asleep at the wheel - it is time for a wake-up call"". He added: ""If industry fails to act for child health, then we look forward to the introduction of mandatory sugar reduction targets in 2020."" The Food and Drink Federation said the industry was committed to cutting sugar. But it added: ""Public Health England set hugely aspirational targets and these could never be met across all categories in the ambitious time frame given."" There are no current plans. However, the idea has been raised. England's top doctor, Prof Dame Sally Davies, has previously accused the food industry of ""failing the public"". In May this year she said: ""I want parents to be incentivised to buy healthy food. ""We need to make sure that fresh fruit and vegetables are cheap. ""Maybe we have to subsidise them by charging more, by taxing unhealthy food."" Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

'Dose of reality needed' over Brexit deal hopes,"A no-deal Brexit would be damaging and difficult, says Simon Coveney There is still a ""wide gap"" between the UK and EU in their talks about a new Brexit deal, the Irish deputy prime minister has said. Simon Coveney said ""everyone needs a dose of reality"" after reports had emerged that progress had been made. Speaking on Friday, he said the EU was still waiting for ""serious proposals"" from the UK for an alternative to the Irish border backstop. The backstop has been the key sticking point in the Brexit deal debate. What happens next if PM gets Brexit deal? What are Irish border backstop options? UK shares Brexit documents with EU It is the controversial policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, unless and until another solution is found. It was a key part of the withdrawal agreement struck with the EU by former prime minister Theresa May and some MPs' opposition to the policy led to the deal being rejected three times by Parliament. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Mr Coveney told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There is still quite a wide gap between what the British government have been talking about in terms of the solutions they are proposing and what Ireland and the EU can support. He said that while the ""mood music"" had improved they two sides were ""not close to that deal right now"". ""We've got to be honest... there are serious problems that arise because of the change in approach by the British prime minister,"" he added. ""Asking to remove a very significant section within the withdrawal agreement that solves many of the Irish issues without any serious proposals on how you solve those problems is not going to be the basis for an agreement."" The issue of the Irish border has been the key sticking point in the Brexit talks Mr Coveney also said the Republic of Ireland ""is in no doubt what a a no-deal would mean for us"", adding that it would be ""damaging and difficult and poses huge questions"". Brexit SecretaryStephen Barclay is to hold talks with the EU's chief negotiatorMichel Barnier on Friday. It comes after European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said a new Brexit deal could still be reached before the 31 October deadline. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday he did not want to ""exaggerate progress"" but some was being made. He has urged the EU to scrap the backstop and has insisted he wants to leave the EU - with or without a deal - by the end of October. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has suggestedthe North-South Ministerial Council (NSMC) could have a rolein finding a solution to the deadlock over the Irish border. It is the main body for cross-border cooperation between the governments of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The DUP MP Sir Jeffrey Donaldson suggested that new arrangements to deal with cross-border trade after Brexit could involve the NSMC. His party has consistently opposed the backstop but has recently softened its language on the matter, saying it would be open to all-island arrangements on issues such as food standards.

What is climate change doing to Wales?,"Aberystwyth seafront was hit by storms in 2014 - the local council is worried rising sea levels leave it vulnerable One world problem, one corner of Wales - climate change is already ""happening before our eyes,"" according to a man watching the coastline closely. Aberystwyth is a seaside town which has already had experiences of extreme weather. Five years ago,properties were evacuated as waves crashed onto the promenade. It seems as good a place as any to take a look at what impact climate change may be having on communities. Its university is also the base for scientists who are researching the wider climate issues - and how we might adapt. And travel along the nearby Dyfi estuary and you find some of Wales' most important nature reserves and wildlife, which are vulnerable. Live: Global day of climate strikes 'I'll sacrifice my education for action' Hundreds miss school in Wales for climate change Is individual action pointless in the face of climate change? ""You can't put all the cost on county councils,"" says Councillor Alun Williams Alun Williams, cabinet member for carbon management in Ceredigion, said rising sea levels were threatening its flood defences. The local authority is trying to plan how to manage the effects of climate change along the coast. Stood on the shingle ridge which acts as a barrier between land and sea at Tanybwlch beach near Aberystwyth, Mr Williams said: ""The sea is overtopping this bank much more regularly than it used to - it's just a matter of time before it breaks through and moves inland."" Rising sea levels and more frequent storms mean there are fears this defence could soon be breached. This video can not be played Sea levels are rising, leaving Wales's coastline vulnerable It is an example of how global warming is already affecting Wales - the country's 1,680 mile-long (2,700km) coastline is on the frontline, leaving local authorities like Ceredigion with difficult decisions to make. Mr Williams highlighted one area where the waves have carried an avalanche of pebbles down into the River Ystwyth on the other side of the ridge. Beyond that, farmland is slowly getting wetter and saltier. The council hopes its research at this site, in partnership with Natural Resources Wales, will help inform its plans for managing the effects of climate change along the coast. What is climate change? Climate change activist Greta Thunberg: 'Listen to climate scientists' Greenland's rapidly vanishing glaciers Projected impacts from climate change from a medium emissions scenario No homes are threatened here, but the course of the river could change, affecting Aberystwyth harbour, and a long diversion to the Wales coastal path may also be needed. Elsewhere, defending seaside towns and villages, roads and railways will prove costly. ""We need to manage this on a Wales-wide level - you can't put all the cost on county councils that happen to have long coastlines, we need a wider strategy,"" Mr Williams urged. There are ""more losers than winners"" at RSPB's Ynyshir reserve in the Dyfi estuary The changing climate is also showing signs of hitting Wales' wildlife and the habitats they rely on. Some 13 miles (20km) from Tanybwlch, at the RSPB's Ynyshir reserve in the Dyfi estuary, site manager David Anning says his team are noticing changes ""all around us"". They include new visitors such as little and great egrets, usually found in southern Europe. ""A lot of the wetlands around the Mediterranean are gradually drying out - so we'll probably be seeing more and more of this effect where formerly southern species are moving north,"" he said. The golden plover has been a regular resident of the reserve, but is in decline But overall he claimed there were more ""losers than winners"" for the reserve, with regular residents such as black grouse and golden plover in decline. ""We're losing a lot of the species which have been here for millennia, and that's really sad as many of them are globally quite restricted,"" he added. The salt marsh habitats are under pressure, squeezed between the encroaching sea and existing flood defences. David Anning is site manager at Ynyshir reserve, where they are allowing the sea to flood certain fields during high tides and storms As a result the reserve has decided to remove sections of the mounds that have traditionally kept the sea out, allowing it to flood certain fields during high tides and storms, creating new marshland over time for the birds that want it. The ""headache"" - as Mr Anning puts it - is what to do with species such as the lapwing - who prefer freshwater habitats. ""Increasingly we're going to have to look at managing wildlife on a much wider, landscape scale as climate change has a bigger and bigger effect."" Milder winters could mean some crops like oilseed rape will not get cold enough to trigger flowering, says Dr Fiona Corke at Aberystwyth University Farmers face challenges too, with predictions Wales will face more rain, warmer temperatures and fiercer storms in future. Dr Fiona Corke, from the National Plant Phenomics Centre at Aberystwyth University, works in a giant robotic laboratory, the only facility of its kind in the UK, where they are stress-testing different plants to see how they would fare as climate change takes hold. Hundreds of pots are being watered automatically, some to the point of being waterlogged, others to simulate drought conditions. ""This is a barley trial - testing 250 varieties - but we've also done something comparable with oats, which is another very important crop in Wales,"" Dr Corke explained. ""Another issue is that as winters become milder, some crops like oilseed rape won't yield as well as they won't get [cold enough] to trigger flowering. Fiona Corke is stress-testing different varieties of crop ""By understanding the requirements of different plants we can possibly start to adapt the crops we're using in Wales,"" she said. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said it had published a series of proposals to ""re-focus billions of pounds of investment towards tackling the climate and ecological emergency"". ""Tackling climate change and species extinction are not issues which can be left to individuals or to the free market. They require collective action and the government has a central role in making collective action possible,"" she said.

Family outbid for war veteran's Oor Wullie statue,"Tom Gilzean's family wanted his Oor Wullie statue to remain in Edinburgh city centre The Edinburgh family of a 99-year-old war veteran who has raised more than Â£1m for charity have been outbid for his Oor Wullie statue. Tom Gilzean's sculpture went for Â£13,000 at auction on Thursday night to a mystery buyer. It follows a crowd fundraiser which raised Â£7,000 to buy the statue so it could be kept on display in Edinburgh. It was part of the Scotland-wide Oor Wullie's Bucket Trail over the summer - and one of 60 in the capital alone. The Edinburgh auction of all 60 statues, which included The Proclaimers, raised Â£318,000 for Edinburgh Children's Hospital Charity. The artist who made the statues has now pledged to make and gift a small Oor Wullie sculpture to Mr Gilzean in recognition of the prolific fundraiser's efforts. Tom Gilzean was awarded the Edinburgh Medal in 2014 He is well known in Edinburgh, where he is regularly seen with his collecting tin and trademark tartan trousers on Princes Street and the Royal Mile. Douglas Gilzean, son of Mr Gilzean, said: ""It would have been a wonderful gesture if we were able to purchase my dad's Oor Wullie sculpture as a tribute to him but we always knew that this may not be possible. ""What is most important to dad is that his sculpture has raised such a huge amount for Edinburgh Children's Hospital Charity to support children and young people in the Sick Kids. ""It is his life's passion to fundraise for the hospital so he is absolutely over the moon with the amount that his sculpture achieved at auction and through our crowdfunding efforts, and that this will now be donated to this wonderful cause. ""We would like to say a huge, heartfelt thank you to each and every person who contributed to our crowdfunding page, including Central Taxis for kindly sponsoring the sculpture and for their generous donation. ""The support we received was just incredible and we know it means everything to Dad. We cannot thank people enough."" Tom's Oor Wullie sculpture was on Princes Street during the summer Roslyn Neely, CEO of Edinburgh Children's Hospital Charity, said: ""Tom is an incredible man and has been such a fantastic supporter of ours for many years. ""As he holds such a special place in all of our hearts, our wonderful friends at Wild In Art are going to commission a mini Tom Oor Wullie sculpture to gift to him and his family. ""Wherever Tom decides to put this little sculpture, we know it will be loved and admired for many, many years to come."" Mr Gilzeanhas the Edinburgh Award, which recognises people who have made an outstanding contribution to the city. He raises money for Edinburgh Children's Hospital Charity - which had supported the move to keep his sculpture in the capital.

"Thousands join climate change protests across UKSchoolchildren and workers down tools and walk out of lessons, demanding ""climate justice for all"".","This video can not be played Global climate strike: Protests take place across England Thousands of people around the UK have joined a global climate change protest, with pupils walking out of schools and workers downing tools to demand action. Millions around the world are taking part in the""climate strike"" day, with rallies in British cities including Glasgow, Manchester and London. Anna Taylor, a co-founder of UK Student Climate Network, said it was ""very easy"" to persuade people to show up. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said ""every child"" should be in school. He added: ""They should be learning, they shouldn't be bunking off and it's very irresponsible for people to encourage children to do so."" Huge crowds join day of climate action - live updates Climate protest: A very different kind of school trip In pictures: Global climate strike Hundreds miss school for climate strike protest Student Jessica Ahmed, 16, emailed her school to warn that she would be joining the protests instead of being in class. Speaking at a protest in Westminster, she said: ""School is important but so is my future. ""If politicians were taking the appropriate action we need - and had been taking this action a long time ago when it was recognised the world was changing in a negative way -  then I would not have to be skipping school."" Pupils left the classroom for the coast in Cullercoats, North Tyneside Organisers estimated that around 100,000 people attended a rally in central London, while more than 20,000 were thought to have marched in Edinburgh and 10,000 in Brighton. In Belfast, organisers put the turnout at between 3,000 and 4,000, with young people taking over the Cornmarket area of the city centre and staging a ""mass die-in"". And in Birmingham, around 3,000 protesters, including hundreds of children, gathered in the city's Victoria Square before marching through nearby streets. UK Student Climate Network said more than 200 events had been organised across the country. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told young people at the Westminster rally: ""You and a whole generation have brought [climate change] centre stage and I am absolutely delighted about that. ""If we're going to sustain this planet we need to get to net zero emissions a lot, lot quicker than 2050 [the government's target],"" he said. He wants every country to sign up to theParis Agreement, which commits signatory nations to keeping global temperatures ""well below"" 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times. Referring to President Donald Trump, Mr Corbyn said it was ""disgraceful when you get a president of a major country like the US"" whosays they will walk away. The global protests come ahead of a summit at the UN next week that will urge countries to do more to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Children hold a similar ""die in"" in Cambridge Dozens of pupils from John Stainer Community Primary school in Brockley, south-east London, were among those taking part in protests in London. Head teacher Sue Harte said ""children need to know that they have a right to democratic protest"". Sebastian, a pupil at the school, said he joined the protests to help fight global warming. Sebastian says he knows how important it is to look after the planet ""They, the government, don't understand that we're going to go through it and they are not,"" he said. Eight-year-old Sohan and Nayan, five, also from south-east London, joined protesters with their mother, Celine. Sohan said: ""We want to save our planet and we hope that marching will help."" Sohan and Nayan with their mother, Celine At the Belfast protest, Extinction Rebellion activist Lorraine Montague, from County Tyrone, was dressed as a swan to highlight the threat of climate change to wildlife. ""Our climate is at crisis point and the government is not doing anything about it,"" she said. ""We are grieving for our future. I don't feel happy about having children, the way our climate is going."" Children join climate change protests in NI Thousands to join school strikes on climate change What is climate change doing to Wales? In Edinburgh, demonstrators - the majority of them young people - chanted and sang as they marched from the Meadows to Holyrood Park near the Scottish Parliament. They carried placards reading ""Scotland, you're not too wee to change the world"" and ""If you were smarter, I would be in school"". Young climate activists in Glasgow think children could ""save the planet"" Children from Terra Nova Secondary in Cheshire are attending the UK Student Climate Network's strike in Manchester Extinction Rebellion, which organised its own climate and environment protests in the UK earlier this year, said it stood ""in solidarity"" with those taking part. It added that its members were joining the strikes and holding their own events, including a choir and ""kids' space"" in Victoria Tower Gardens, Westminster, and outside King's College London. Protesters in Manchester, where at least one clothing store closed to support the strike This video can not be played Climate protest: 'This is more important than a maths lesson' Some trade unions, including the TUC, the University and College Union and Unite, are supporting members who take part in the ""strikes"". Co-operative Bank said it supported workers who want to join the action, while US clothing brand Patagonia closed all of its stores and took out adverts to back the protesters. But in Norwich, protester Tiffany Wallace said her employer declined to give her time off work to join demonstrators ""because they didn't think it was important"". ""The worst thing they can do is fire me,"" said the 33-year-old. ""I don't feel I should compromise my own values and integrity and what's important, so I can make money for a business."" Tiffany Wallace said her company declined to give her permission to join the protests Energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng said he could not ""endorse children leaving school"" to take part in the protests. But he said he did support ""their energy, their creativity, and the fact that they have completely mastered these issues and take them very seriously"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson all supported the walkout for the Youth Strike 4 Climate campaign. The Metropolitan Police said seven people were arrested for public order offences, but overall the day ran ""smoothly"". Commander Dave Musker said a ""tiny minority of protesters"" tried to block Lambeth Bridge, a key route for emergency services to St Thomas' Hospital. One other man was arrested on the bridge on suspicion of discharging a flare in a public place. Teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg - who inspired the protests - sailed to the US ahead of the UN Climate Action Summit in New York next week The global action follows a long-running series of school strikes initially inspired by activist Greta Thunberg. The teenager, from Sweden, is also playing a role in the day's events and is set to join a rally planned in New York, where world leaders will meet at the UN next week.

Rugby fans advised to cover tattoos in Japan,"Wales fan Gavin Baos admits he is ""concerned"" at causing offence in Japan Welsh rugby fans travelling to Japan for the World Cup have been urged to cover up tattoos to avoid offending some of their hosts. Hundreds of supporters are heading to the country ahead ofWales' opening gameof the tournament on Monday. Tattoos have long been associated by some in Japan with yakuza crime syndicates, and tattooed tourists could be barred from communal hot springs. Fans are also being asked to wear shirts when using gyms or pools. Gavin Baos, 42, from Cardiff, is spending 11 days following Wales in Japan with a group of friends. Mr Baos has Maori and Celtic-themed body art Mr Baos, a financial adviser, has extensive tattoos from elbow to wrist on both arms and covering much of his lower legs. ""They are pretty big tattoos so it has been a real concern,"" he said. ""A friend in Tokyo said there's no way you can go into some gyms or baths with tattoos as it would really cause offence. ""It's really important to know these customs because the last thing I want to do is cause offence. Buy a house or go to Japan? England football fans gets 'winners' tattoo Wales fan driving to Japan ""Normally I live in shorts, T-shirts and flip-flops but I've found myself buying long-sleeve shirts and jogging bottoms to have as a back-up, just in case. ""The only frustrating thing is that if it's 25 degrees and 100% humidity, it could get a bit uncomfortable."" Ross Moriarty is one of the Wales internationals with extensive body art Keith Dunn, the honorary Japanese consul to Wales, said: ""We like tattoos in Wales. ""I think making sure you understand the customs are different and making sure you cover up tattoos - if you're going to go swimming or to the gym, just cover up."" World Rugby, the sport's governing body,has posted advice,externalto the estimated 400,000 travelling fans. A 2015 survey found that 56% of hotels and inns did not allow tattooed guests to use communal bathing facilities. Japan's tourism agency has called on spas in the country to relax their rules. The organisation suggested that hot springs - onsens - and bath houses could offer visitors stickers to cover up tattoos, or set aside specific times of day when tattooed bathers can use the facilities. This video can not be played The end of Japanese tattoo art? Strachan Sports Travel, of Cowbridge in the Vale of Glamorgan, is taking six tour groups of Wales fans to the tournament, whichruns between 20 September and 2 November. General manager Angharad Griffiths said: ""It may be a little more relaxed during the World Cup, so not to upset certain cultures. ""However we have advised anyone with tattoos that there may be occasions when they need to cover them."" The advice is not limited to fans, with tattoos common among players, especially Pacific Islanders and Maoris. Wales player James Davies had his nickname ""Cubby Boi"" tattooed during a trip to Las Vegas While not required during matches, visiting players and officials have been warned by World Rugby to cover up in public. A Welsh Rugby Union spokesman said: ""Having toured Japan in 2013 and visited the country on many occasions as part of our Rugby World Cup preparations, the management and the squad are looking forward to embracing the local culture and will of course comply with all protocols."" Japan spas urged to relax tattoo rules Yakuza boss caught after tattoos go viral Japan artist's beautiful macabre tattoos New Zealand and Samoa players in Japan are already covering up in hot springs, hotel lobbies and other public areas. ""We've got an onsen, or a spa, at every hotel,"" All Blacks scrum-halfAaron Smith told the New Zealand Herald,external. He said in a public spa the players had to wear clothes to cover tattoos.

Thomas Cook races to secure more rescue fundsThe travel firm faces administration unless it finds another Â£200m demanded by bank creditors.,"Tour operator Thomas Cook has approached the government in an attempt to plug a gap in its funding. The travel company could fall into administration this weekend unless it finds Â£200m in extra funds needed to secure its future. ButBBC business editor Simon Jack saysif holidaymakers are hoping the government will save the day, they may be disappointed. A collapse would leave 150,000 UK holidaymakers stranded. The BBC's business editor said that while a private sector deal may still be possible, the noises coming out of the government at the moment suggested the UK taxpayer was unlikely to become Thomas Cook's saviour. The troubled operator hoped to seal a rescue led by China's Fosun this week. But the creditor banks issued a last-minute demand that the travel company find an extra Â£200m. The Civil Aviation Authority is on standby with a repatriation contingency plan called Operation Matterhorn. The potential cost of bringing home passengers is put at about Â£600m. In his blog,Simon Jack says the government does not recognise the choice being presented as between spending Â£200m on a cash injection to save the company versus a Â£600m bill to repatriate UK holidaymakers. He writes that the government's understanding is that most Thomas Cook customers will be covered by travel insurance or Atol protection - a fund paid for through industry levies. He also says the government's previous refusal to offer assistance to companieslike Carillionwould make helping Thomas Cook very difficult in principle and in practice. Furthermore, the matter is being handled by the Department for Transport - which organised the repatriation of customers of the failed airline Monarch - rather than the Department for Business, he adds. There has been a shift in tone from Thomas Cook on Twitter, with worried customers being told to ignore media speculation on Friday. Now they are being reminded they do have Atol protection ""in the event that Thomas Cook goes into administration"". Thomas Cook: Your questions answered What's gone wrong at Thomas Cook? Customers fear ruined weddings and trips Thomas Cook: MP calls for 'leadership' Travel expert Simon Calder said all Thomas Cook flights in and out of the UK were running normally on Saturday morning, and travel agencies would be opening at the usual times. He said that while Thomas Cook remains a going concern - albeit in terrible trouble - there was very little anyone who was on a Thomas Cook holiday or has one booked in the coming days or weeks could do. Anyone trying to cancel holidays could expect to be given short shrift and end up losing some or all of their money, he added. Currently there are 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British Thomas Cook, one of the world's largest travel companies, was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and now has annual sales of Â£9bn. It employs 22,000 staff, 9,000 of those in the UK and serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries. The TSSA union's general secretary Manuel Cortes told the BBC that his members' ""main concern was if they had a job on Monday morning"". Jacqui Cunningham and her partner Angus McNair are unsure whether they should pay the outstanding balance on their holiday Teacher Jacqui Cunningham and her partner, train driver Angus McNair, from Brentwood, Essex, have booked a holiday to the Maldives with Thomas Cook for December. The luxury trip is to celebrate Ms Cunningham's recovery from cancer. They have paid a deposit of Â£500 and the balance of Â£8,000 is due by midnight on Friday. Thomas Cook is, of course, still operating. But their predicament underlines the anxiety many customers are feeling. Ms Cunningham and Mr McNair called the customer service helpline and asked if they could delay paying the Â£8,000 until they know that the tour operator is not going to fall into administration. But they were told the deadline remains, or they would lose their Â£500 deposit. ""We were going to pay on debit card, but now I think we'll put it on the credit card if we go forward,"" she said. Thomas Cook's financial difficulties have mounted over the past year, culminating with the agreement in August of a rescue deal led by its biggest shareholder Fosun. Thomas Cook 'racing to finalise rescue deal' Weak pound boosting UK tourism industry In July, Thomas Cook produced a business plan saying that it needed Â£900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of Â£150m. The Â£900m would come from Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors. The group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional Â£200m on top of the Â£900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to Â£1.1bn. Thomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional Â£200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out and the group of creditors will not come back to the table unless that additional funding is found. A final vote on that deal was due to take place this week, but it has been delayed until next Friday in the face of the latest demand for extra standby funding. Earlier this week, Thomas Cook said it was ""focused on completing"" the deal. It is believed to be negotiating with its banks, bondholders and Fosun in an attempt to keep the rescue on track. In May, the operator reported a Â£1.5bn loss for the first half of the year. It has also recently issued three profit warnings and is struggling to reduce its debts. It has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit. If you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment. Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating. If you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme. If you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund. When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.

Family outbid for war veteran's Oor Wullie statueThe family of fundraiser Tom Gilzean had wanted the sculpture to stay on Edinburgh's Princes Street.,"Tom Gilzean's family wanted his Oor Wullie statue to remain in Edinburgh city centre The Edinburgh family of a 99-year-old war veteran who has raised more than Â£1m for charity have been outbid for his Oor Wullie statue. Tom Gilzean's sculpture went for Â£13,000 at auction on Thursday night to a mystery buyer. It follows a crowd fundraiser which raised Â£7,000 to buy the statue so it could be kept on display in Edinburgh. It was part of the Scotland-wide Oor Wullie's Bucket Trail over the summer - and one of 60 in the capital alone. The Edinburgh auction of all 60 statues, which included The Proclaimers, raised Â£318,000 for Edinburgh Children's Hospital Charity. The artist who made the statues has now pledged to make and gift a small Oor Wullie sculpture to Mr Gilzean in recognition of the prolific fundraiser's efforts. Tom Gilzean was awarded the Edinburgh Medal in 2014 He is well known in Edinburgh, where he is regularly seen with his collecting tin and trademark tartan trousers on Princes Street and the Royal Mile. Douglas Gilzean, son of Mr Gilzean, said: ""It would have been a wonderful gesture if we were able to purchase my dad's Oor Wullie sculpture as a tribute to him but we always knew that this may not be possible. ""What is most important to dad is that his sculpture has raised such a huge amount for Edinburgh Children's Hospital Charity to support children and young people in the Sick Kids. ""It is his life's passion to fundraise for the hospital so he is absolutely over the moon with the amount that his sculpture achieved at auction and through our crowdfunding efforts, and that this will now be donated to this wonderful cause. ""We would like to say a huge, heartfelt thank you to each and every person who contributed to our crowdfunding page, including Central Taxis for kindly sponsoring the sculpture and for their generous donation. ""The support we received was just incredible and we know it means everything to Dad. We cannot thank people enough."" Tom's Oor Wullie sculpture was on Princes Street during the summer Roslyn Neely, CEO of Edinburgh Children's Hospital Charity, said: ""Tom is an incredible man and has been such a fantastic supporter of ours for many years. ""As he holds such a special place in all of our hearts, our wonderful friends at Wild In Art are going to commission a mini Tom Oor Wullie sculpture to gift to him and his family. ""Wherever Tom decides to put this little sculpture, we know it will be loved and admired for many, many years to come."" Mr Gilzeanhas the Edinburgh Award, which recognises people who have made an outstanding contribution to the city.

"Tax cuts sugar in drinks, but we still eat moreSoft drinks have 29% less sugar on average since a levy was imposed, but we're eating more sugary food.Health","Efforts to cut a fifth of the sugar out of our food by next year are way off target, figures from Public Health England show. Between 2015 and 2018 the average sugar content of shop-bought food fell by just 2.9% and the amount of sugar we actually eat has gone up. This is despite a tax on sugary drinks leading to a 29% fall in their sugar content. The food industry said the voluntary target was too ambitious. But experts said parts of the industry were ""asleep at the wheel"" and not tackling obesity. Obesity increases the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease and is puttingmillions of peopleat risk of cancer. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has openly questioned whether ""sin taxes"" actually cut obesity. Boris Johnson promises review of 'unhealthy food taxes' Tax unhealthy food, says top doctor The sugar tax - officially the soft drinks industry levy - was introduced in April 2018. It charges manufacturers 24p per litre on very sweet drinks and 18p per litre on medium-sugar ones. Brands such as Fanta, Ribena and Irn Bru changed their recipes in response. On average, 100mls of sugary drinks now contain 28.8% less sugar than in 2015. Sales of soft drinks increased between 2015 and 2018, but shifted towards low- or zero-sugar versions. It works out as more than 30,000 tonnes less sugar - 5 billion fewer calories - being sold in such drinks each year. The progress on the sugar content of pop is in stark contrast to that in other foods. Public Health England has a voluntary sugar reduction programme with food manufacturers and retailers. Children's favourites - including cakes, chocolate, breakfast cereals, yoghurts and biscuits - are all being targeted. The aim is a 20% reduction in their average sugar content by 2020, compared with 2015 levels. In 2017 the amount cut had reached 2%, and by 2018 (the latest data we have) the figure had crept up to 2.9%. There was supposed to have been a 5% reduction in the first year of the plan. Sue Kellie, from the British Dietetic Association, said it was a ""worrying lack of progress"" and it was ""very unlikely"" the target would be met. Seemingly not, at least when we are at home. Despite the success of the sugar tax and the 2.9% cut in sugar due to reformulating foods - we are still eating more of the stuff. The report says the amount of sugar in foods bought at the supermarket has increased from 723,000 tonnes in 2015 to 743,000 tonnes in 2018. PHE officials said that was the equivalent of everybody increasing their sugar consumption by 0.5%. This could be because we are buying more or portion sizes are getting bigger. There was also a large increase in sales of ice cream and sorbets in 2018, possibly due to the hot weather. Duncan Selbie, chief executive of Public Health England, said there was ""some encouraging progress"" from the food industry which he described as ""realistic at this early stage"". Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the tax on sugar was a ""success story"". But he said overall the food industry was ""largely asleep at the wheel - it is time for a wake-up call"". He added: ""If industry fails to act for child health, then we look forward to the introduction of mandatory sugar reduction targets in 2020."" The Food and Drink Federation said the industry was committed to cutting sugar. But it added: ""Public Health England set hugely aspirational targets and these could never be met across all categories in the ambitious time frame given."" There are no current plans. However, the idea has been raised. England's top doctor, Prof Dame Sally Davies, has previously accused the food industry of ""failing the public"". In May this year she said: ""I want parents to be incentivised to buy healthy food. ""We need to make sure that fresh fruit and vegetables are cheap. ""Maybe we have to subsidise them by charging more, by taxing unhealthy food."" Follow Jameson Twitter,external.

"Trump denies 'troubling' promise to foreign leaderAn intelligence official found the comment ""so troubling"" they made a formal complaint, reports say.","Mr Trump says he would only do what's ""good for the USA"" Donald Trump has denied a report alleging he made a promise to a foreign leader, which sparked a whistleblower's formal complaint. The complaint is reported to relate to a July phone call with Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The Washington Post said an intelligence official found the comment ""so troubling"" they went to the department's inspector general. In a tweet, Mr Trump dismissed the claims as ""fake news"". Democrats are trying to get the complaint turned over to Congress, with the details still unknown. However, some reports allege that Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter - who previously served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company - in return for continued US military support. Joe Biden is currently the frontrunner to be the Democratic candidate competing against Mr Trump in the 2020 presidential election. It was filed on 12 August and only a few details have been made public. Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson saidthe complaint consists of a ""serious or flagrant problem, abuse or violation of the law"",externalthat involves classified information, a letter to lawmakers revealed. It is not yet known who made the complaint, which foreign leader Mr Trump was speaking to, what promise - if any - was made and whether Mr Trump took any action as a result. However,the Washington Post,externalandthe New York Times,externalboth said at least part of the complaint related to Ukraine, citing officials with knowledge of the matter. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has so far refused to share any details of the complaint with lawmakers, leading to an outcry among Democrats. Under US law,external, if the complaint is considered to be of ""urgent concern"", and if the inspector general considers the complaint to be ""credible"", then the department head is expected to share the information with Congress within seven days. Earlier this month, before the whistleblower's complaint came to light, House Democrats launched an investigation into Mr Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani's interactions with Ukraine. Three Democratic panel heads - Eliot Engel (foreign affairs), Adam Schiff (intelligence) and Elijah Cummings (oversight) - said Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani had attempted ""to manipulate the Ukrainian justice system to benefit the president's re-election campaign and target a possible political opponent"". They allege that Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani tried to pressure the Ukrainian government into investigating Joe and Hunter Biden. Why Ukraine has become ensnared in US collusion claims Hunter Biden's Ukrainian gas connection US Air Force orders review over Trump resort stays Mr Trump and President Zelensky had a phone call on 25 July, two and a half weeks before the complaint was filed. The two leaders will hold talks next week in New York,external, where Mr Zelensky will be attending the UN General Assembly, his office said. Analysis by Jonah Fisher, BBC Kiev correspondent No-one in Ukraine's presidential administration wants to talk about the 25 July phone call between Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky, or respond to the claims that Mr Trump asked Ukraine to investigate his possible opponent in 2020 in return for continued US military support. There are a few circumstantial clues. Firstly, the Ukrainian readout of the call,externalrefers to Mr Trump being ""convinced"" that the new government will ""complete (the) investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA"". Is that a diplomatic reference to the US president asking for a probe into Mr Biden? There's then the question as to why President Trump has kept Ukraine's new leader at arms' length since his election in April. Some $250m in US military assistance for Ukraine was mysteriously held up by the White House this summer, and a long-mooted visit for President Zelensky to Washington has still not materialised. Is Ukraine's leader being punished for refusing to play ball? On Thursday afternoon, Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that he knew all his phone calls to foreign leaders were listened to by US agencies. ""Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader,"" he asked. Allow Twitter content?

On Friday, Mr Trump tweeted that the conversation was ""perfectly fine and respectful"", without providing more details about who he spoke to. He also said the statement from the whistleblower was ""highly partisan"". Meanwhile,Mr Giuliani gave an interview to CNN,externalwhere he both confirmed, and denied, that he had asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. He explained the contradiction by saying that he had asked Ukraine ""to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme"". He also wrote on Twitter,externalthat ""a President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job"". Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans have questioned whether it represented a conflict of interest that Hunter Biden had served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company. In May, Ukraine's prosecutor general said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There is a disagreement between the acting director of national intelligence (DNI), Joseph Macguire, and Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who is responsible for conducting independent audits and investigations across the intelligence community. A lawyer for Mr Macguire's office said in a letter,externalto lawmakers that the complaint ""does not meet the definition of urgent concern"". The complaint ""concerned conduct by someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to any 'intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision"", the letter said. It also involved ""potentially privileged matters"", the letter added. Mr Atkinson told lawmakers in a letter,externalthat he disagreed with the DNI's assessment, and believed the complaint ""relates to one of the most significant and important of the DNI's responsibilities to the American people"".

What happens if PM gets a deal?,"It's still an ""if"" - in fact, a very big ""if"". Even though the EU had to admit today that it had, actuallyreceived some ""non-papers""from the UK government about how they might conceivably try to solve Brexit's many conundrums, a deal is still miles off, even though not impossible. A non-paper, for the uninitiated (yes, me too) is, in officialdom, like handing someone a menu saying: ""This is what is available and we'd recommend it all, so let us know what you would like to try. "" In this long saga, it's the latest effort from the UK government to prove it really is trying to broker an agreement, and to try to get the other side to engage. UK shares Brexit documents with EU Corbyn 'will deliver Brexit option people choose' What does 'podiumgate' say about Brexit deal? As we've discussed many times before, it's not clear on the other side that anything on the menu will tempt them to the table, butas I wrote last night, that's the stage we are at, described by one official, rather gruesomely, as the ""foreplay"". If though, it everisdone, thoughts are turning too in Westminster to how MPs would be persuaded ever to vote for the thing, and to vote for it at speed. Just as there is a touch of the Brexit-boiling fever on the hardcore of both sides of the debate, there is, in the middle, more Brexit frustration at how much damage the impasse is doing, and probably more MPs who are willing to vote for a deal, maybe any deal, just to get it over with. And some up-to-date number-crunching by communications agency Cicero suggests that it might just squeak through -have a look here,external. But there is no way Number 10 can be confident a deal would get through Parliament with any ease in this turbulent environment, especially as MPs have changed the law to make it much harder for the government to take us out of the EU without a formal arrangement in place. Not surprisingly, therefore, inside government there are conversations going on about how it might be able to maximise its chances, which of course, also would allow Boris Johnson to stick to his Halloween deadline. First off, there are discussions about getting the deal through at breakneck pace. The Lords were ready with their sleeping bags for all-night sittings long ago - this could be days and days of Parliament sitting almost non-stop - like a gruesome festival in SW1 where everyone is short of sleep, and no one is allowed to go home until it's done. But there are conversations, of course, about other things that might concentrate the mind. And I'm told there are live discussions between the government and Brussels about ruling out the idea of another delayifthere is a deal. That would hypothetically give MPs only the choice of backing this deal or leaving without one, if in practice the EU had said no to any potential extension. Remember, the law has been changed to force the prime minister to seek an extension if Parliament hasn't passed a deal, but it does not compel the EU to grant it. Brexit talks 'should not be a pretence' - Barnier Johnson attacked by Luxembourg PM over Brexit By potentially removing the chance of delay, this ploy could make it much more likely that MPs would come to Mr Johnson's wicket, and back it, however reluctantly. Described as an ""elegant path"" by some, a way out of this tangle, you can see the appeal for the UK government. But other sources on the UK and EU side are sceptical - concentrating on whether a deal is possible first, doubtful the EU would make such a political call. It seems an idea that is embryonic. But don't forget, beyond all else, the prime minister wants to stick to his Halloween deadline, for good or for ill. We've seen from how Number 10 operates already, there is no predicting what it might be willing to do to make it happen.

Climate change protests taking place across UKSchoolchildren and workers down tools and walk out of lessons to call for more action on climate change.,"This video can not be played Global climate strike: Protests take place across England Thousands of people around the UK have joined a global climate change protest, with pupils walking out of schools and workers downing tools to demand action. Millions around the world are taking part in the""climate strike"" day, with rallies in British cities including Glasgow, Manchester and London. Anna Taylor, a co-founder of UK Student Climate Network, said it was ""very easy"" to persuade people to show up. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said ""every child"" should be in school. He added: ""They should be learning, they shouldn't be bunking off and it's very irresponsible for people to encourage children to do so."" Huge crowds join day of climate action - live updates Climate protest: A very different kind of school trip In pictures: Global climate strike Hundreds miss school for climate strike protest Student Jessica Ahmed, 16, emailed her school to warn that she would be joining the protests instead of being in class. Speaking at a protest in Westminster, she said: ""School is important but so is my future. ""If politicians were taking the appropriate action we need - and had been taking this action a long time ago when it was recognised the world was changing in a negative way -  then I would not have to be skipping school."" Pupils left the classroom for the coast in Cullercoats, North Tyneside Organisers estimated that around 100,000 people attended a rally in central London, while more than 20,000 were thought to have marched in Edinburgh and 10,000 in Brighton. In Belfast, organisers put the turnout at between 3,000 and 4,000, with young people taking over the Cornmarket area of the city centre and staging a ""mass die-in"". And in Birmingham, around 3,000 protesters, including hundreds of children, gathered in the city's Victoria Square before marching through nearby streets. UK Student Climate Network said more than 200 events had been organised across the country. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told young people at the Westminster rally: ""You and a whole generation have brought [climate change] centre stage and I am absolutely delighted about that.

Climate change protests taking place across UK,"This video can not be played Global climate strike: Protests take place across England Thousands of people around the UK have joined a global climate change protest, with pupils walking out of schools and workers downing tools to demand action. Millions around the world are taking part in the""climate strike"" day, with rallies in British cities including Glasgow, Manchester and London. Anna Taylor, a co-founder of UK Student Climate Network, said it was ""very easy"" to persuade people to show up. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said ""every child"" should be in school. He added: ""They should be learning, they shouldn't be bunking off and it's very irresponsible for people to encourage children to do so."" Huge crowds join day of climate action - live updates Climate protest: A very different kind of school trip In pictures: Global climate strike Hundreds miss school for climate strike protest Student Jessica Ahmed, 16, emailed her school to warn that she would be joining the protests instead of being in class. Speaking at a protest in Westminster, she said: ""School is important but so is my future. ""If politicians were taking the appropriate action we need - and had been taking this action a long time ago when it was recognised the world was changing in a negative way -  then I would not have to be skipping school."" Pupils left the classroom for the coast in Cullercoats, North Tyneside Organisers estimated that around 100,000 people attended a rally in central London, while more than 20,000 were thought to have marched in Edinburgh and 10,000 in Brighton. In Belfast, organisers put the turnout at between 3,000 and 4,000, with young people taking over the Cornmarket area of the city centre and staging a ""mass die-in"". And in Birmingham, around 3,000 protesters, including hundreds of children, gathered in the city's Victoria Square before marching through nearby streets. UK Student Climate Network said more than 200 events had been organised across the country. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told young people at the Westminster rally: ""You and a whole generation have brought [climate change] centre stage and I am absolutely delighted about that. ""If we're going to sustain this planet we need to get to net zero emissions a lot, lot quicker than 2050 [the government's target],"" he said.

Brexit secretary meets EU's chief negotiator,"This video can not be played Barclay: No one wants to see a no-deal Brexit Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has said the UK and EU share a ""common purpose"" in reaching a new withdrawal deal, after a meeting in Brussels with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier. He said they had had ""serious detailed discussions"" and things were ""moving forward with momentum"". Mr Barnier said it had been a ""cordial"" meeting, but ""lots of work has to be done in the next few days"". The deadline for the UK to exit the EU is 31 October. On Thursday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said a new Brexit deal could still be reached by then. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said some ""progress"" was being made, although it was important not to ""exaggerate"" this. But Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told the BBC on Friday that there was a ""wide gap"" between the UK and the EU, with Brussels ""still waiting for serious proposals"" from London. And a leaked memo from the European Commission said the UK had confirmed its proposals for replacing the Irish backstop ""do not amount to legally operational solutions and would have to be developed during the transitional period"". The memo also said the UK's proposals did not avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, or preserve the integrity of the single market. However, a UK government source insisted their proposals were ""serious and workable"" and would avoid a hard border. ""As for the Commission, two months ago they said we couldn't reopen the withdrawal agreement and there was absolutely no alternative to the backstop - now we are having detailed discussions. ""Leaks from Brussels on Twitter are par for the course,  you can set your watch by them. ""What we're focused on is actually getting a deal in the room - we trust they'll do the same."" 'Dose of reality needed' over Brexit deal hopes UK shares Brexit documents with EU Kuenssberg: What happens next if the PM gets a Brexit deal? UK 'has 12 days to set out Brexit plans' The backstop - the policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit - has proved the biggest point of contention in EU-UK talks so far. It was a major sticking point in former Prime Minister Theresa May's attempts to get Parliament to back her withdrawal agreement, which was rejected three times by MPs. Amid the white noise of Brexit, there has only ever been one question that really matters: is there any sign that things might be about to change? Meetings get excitedly talked up in advance (I plead guilty). Anodyne statements follow shortly afterwards. In short, the EU says the UK has not yet provided enough detail on a plan to replace the so-called backstop, to keep the border on the island of Ireland open under all circumstances. The UK says it is dreaming up all sorts of ideas. So what happens next? New York. A shindig at the United Nations next week - and with it the chance for the prime minister to have one-on-one chats with the likes of President Macron of France and Chancellor Merkel of Germany. Could they provide the oomph needed to knock together a deal? It still looks less likely than likely, but who knows? Mr Johnson, who has said he wants to leave the EU - preferably with a deal - by 31 October, has urged the EU to scrap the backstop. But the EU has asked for detailed alternative proposals. Following the latest meeting, which overran, Mr Barclay said: ""There's a common purpose in Dublin, in London and here in Brussels to see a deal over the line."" He added that the two sides had been ""getting into the detail"" and that more ""technical"" discussions would happen next week. Mr Johnson and European Council President Donald Tusk are also expected to hold talks when the United Nations General Assembly takes place in New York next week. Mr Barclay said this ""underscores the purpose there is on both sides to get a deal and that is what we are working very hard to secure"". This video can not be played Barnier: UK Brexit proposals must protect peace in Ireland He added that ""a clear message has been given both by President Juncker and the prime minister"" and both sides were ""working hard"". Also speaking after the meeting, Mr Barnier said he was not optimistic or pessimistic but ""still determined"". ""Brexit is a school of patience but we are still ready to reach an agreement,"" he said. He said that any proposal from the UK to replace the backstop ""must reach all the objectives of the backstop"". These were to ""protect the peace in Ireland, to protect the all=Ireland economy, and also to protect the consumers and the businesses of the EU and the single market"", Mr Barnier said. The prime minister has said the UK needs to leave in a way that allows it to ""do things differently"" and ""not remain under the control of the EU in terms of laws and trade policy"". But he also reiterated the need to ensure no hard border returned to Northern Ireland, and the Good Friday Agreement -which helped bring an end to the Troubles- was protected. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button On Thursday, the UK government saidconfidential documents that ""reflect the ideas the UK has put forward"" on Brexit had been shared with the EU. This happened after Finland's prime minister said Mr Johnson had 12 days to set out his Brexit plans to the EU - although a government source said the development was not in response to those remarks. Thursday saw the final day of the legal battle over Mr Johnson's decision to prorogue - suspend - Parliament at the UK's Supreme Court. Its president, Lady Hale, promised a decision early next week.

YouTuber pays compensation after 'copycat' death,"The girls had allegedly been attempting a cooking video by Ms Yeah (pictured) - Ms Yeah says they used a different method A Chinese influencer has agreed to pay compensation to the families of two girls - after one died in what her family says was an attempt to copy a viral video. Ms Yeah, who has seven million subscribers on YouTube, is known for unconventional office cooking videos. The girls, aged 14 and 12, were allegedly copying a video in which Ms Yeah makes popcorn in a tin can. The girls were heating up alcohol in the cans when it exploded. The 14-year-old, identified only as Zhezhe, later died from her injuries. The 12-year-old girl, Xiaoyu, needs cosmetic surgery, according to her family. Despite paying compensation, Ms Yeah denied that the girls were replicating her video - saying they attempted a different method, and that her videos are not meant to be instructional. Representatives of Ms Yeah have met the families of both victims and agreed to pay them an undisclosed amount. Ms Yeah will cover the 12-year-old's hospital bills, though it is unclear if any more compensation will be included. The online star, who rose to fame in 2017, is known for videos in which she makes elaborate meals at work using equipment found in her office. Screenshot showing Ms Yeah's popcorn making video, which has since been taken down One of Ms Yeah's representatives, her cousin, said that they would provide financial assistance to the families ""regardless of who was right and who was wrong"". He said he hoped there would ""not be any hate"" between both parties. Xiaoyu's father told news site the Beijing News that his daughter had incurred high hospital bills, saying she ""no longer dared to step out of the house"" due to the burn marks. Zhezhe's father was pictured crying, saying no amount of money could bring his daughter back. The accident took place on 22 August when the girls decided to imitate a video by Ms Yeah in which she makes popcorn in a tin can. In the original video, which has now been taken down, Ms Yeah can be seen putting popcorn kernels in a tin can. She then ignites a small flame using an instrument resembling an alcohol burner. The girls had reportedly been heating up alcohol directly inside the tin cans when it exploded. Both of them were severely burnt. According to the Beijing News, Zhezhe suffered burns on 96% of her body. She died on 5 September. Xiaoyu was rushed to the hospital and pictures of her widely circulated on social media site Weibo show severe burns to her face and arms. The BBC was not able to independently verify the pictures. This picture, allegedly showing the 12-year-old victim, has been widely circulated on Weibo Ms Yeah, 25 - whose real name is Zhou Xiao Hui - broke her silence on Weibo, a platform where she has close to 8.2 million followers, on 10 September. In a post captioned ""The darkest day of my life"", Ms Yeah said news of the tragedy had caused her ""immense pain"". She apologised and said she had ""let her fans down"". However, she denied the girls had been copying her videos. ""I used only one tin can and an alcohol lamp, which is safer,"" she said. ""In [their video] we could clearly see that they used two cans and not a lamp."" She said the accident happened because the girls poured alcohol into the cans while the flame was lit and the spark ignited a 1kg (2.2lbs) bucket of industrial alcohol that was nearby. Ms Yeah said that all her videos included warnings advising viewers not to imitate her actions, emphasising that her videos were ""not meant to be instructional"". Ms Yeah posted this photo showing the aftermath of the girls' stunt and how it differed from hers Ms Yeah appears deadpan in most of her videos, which feature her colleagues sitting nonchalantly around her while she grills meat and cooks oysters using office supplies. Her videos are shot during work hours in her creative agency office with her help of a small team. The 25-year-old is popular on both English-language and Chinese social media platforms, with a combined following of more than 15 million on both platforms.

"Trump denies 'troubling' promise to foreign leaderAn intelligence official found the comment ""so troubling"" they made a formal complaint, reports say.US & Canada","Mr Trump says he would only do what's ""good for the USA"" Donald Trump has denied a report alleging he made a promise to a foreign leader, which sparked a whistleblower's formal complaint. The complaint is reported to relate to a July phone call with Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelensky. The Washington Post said an intelligence official found the comment ""so troubling"" they went to the department's inspector general. In a tweet, Mr Trump dismissed the claims as ""fake news"". Democrats are trying to get the complaint turned over to Congress, with the details still unknown. However, some reports allege that Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter - who previously served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company - in return for continued US military support. Joe Biden is currently the frontrunner to be the Democratic candidate competing against Mr Trump in the 2020 presidential election. It was filed on 12 August and only a few details have been made public. Intelligence Community Inspector General Michael Atkinson saidthe complaint consists of a ""serious or flagrant problem, abuse or violation of the law"",externalthat involves classified information, a letter to lawmakers revealed. It is not yet known who made the complaint, which foreign leader Mr Trump was speaking to, what promise - if any - was made and whether Mr Trump took any action as a result. However,the Washington Post,externalandthe New York Times,externalboth said at least part of the complaint related to Ukraine, citing officials with knowledge of the matter. The acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, has so far refused to share any details of the complaint with lawmakers, leading to an outcry among Democrats. Under US law,external, if the complaint is considered to be of ""urgent concern"", and if the inspector general considers the complaint to be ""credible"", then the department head is expected to share the information with Congress within seven days. Earlier this month, before the whistleblower's complaint came to light, House Democrats launched an investigation into Mr Trump and his lawyer Rudy Giuliani's interactions with Ukraine. Three Democratic panel heads - Eliot Engel (foreign affairs), Adam Schiff (intelligence) and Elijah Cummings (oversight) - said Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani had attempted ""to manipulate the Ukrainian justice system to benefit the president's re-election campaign and target a possible political opponent"". They allege that Mr Trump and Mr Giuliani tried to pressure the Ukrainian government into investigating Joe and Hunter Biden. Why Ukraine has become ensnared in US collusion claims Hunter Biden's Ukrainian gas connection US Air Force orders review over Trump resort stays Mr Trump and President Zelensky had a phone call on 25 July, two and a half weeks before the complaint was filed. The two leaders will hold talks next week in New York,external, where Mr Zelensky will be attending the UN General Assembly, his office said. Analysis by Jonah Fisher, BBC Kiev correspondent No-one in Ukraine's presidential administration wants to talk about the 25 July phone call between Mr Trump and Mr Zelensky, or respond to the claims that Mr Trump asked Ukraine to investigate his possible opponent in 2020 in return for continued US military support. There are a few circumstantial clues. Firstly, the Ukrainian readout of the call,externalrefers to Mr Trump being ""convinced"" that the new government will ""complete (the) investigation of corruption cases, which inhibited the interaction between Ukraine and the USA"". Is that a diplomatic reference to the US president asking for a probe into Mr Biden? There's then the question as to why President Trump has kept Ukraine's new leader at arms' length since his election in April. Some $250m in US military assistance for Ukraine was mysteriously held up by the White House this summer, and a long-mooted visit for President Zelensky to Washington has still not materialised. Is Ukraine's leader being punished for refusing to play ball? On Thursday afternoon, Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that he knew all his phone calls to foreign leaders were listened to by US agencies. ""Knowing all of this, is anybody dumb enough to believe that I would say something inappropriate with a foreign leader,"" he asked. Allow Twitter content?

On Friday, Mr Trump tweeted that the conversation was ""perfectly fine and respectful"", without providing more details about who he spoke to. He also said the statement from the whistleblower was ""highly partisan"". Meanwhile,Mr Giuliani gave an interview to CNN,externalwhere he both confirmed, and denied, that he had asked Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. He explained the contradiction by saying that he had asked Ukraine ""to look into the allegations that related to my client, which tangentially involved Joe Biden in a massive bribery scheme"". He also wrote on Twitter,externalthat ""a President telling a Pres-elect of a well known corrupt country he better investigate corruption that affects US is doing his job"". Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans have questioned whether it represented a conflict of interest that Hunter Biden had served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company. In May, Ukraine's prosecutor general said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There is a disagreement between the acting director of national intelligence (DNI), Joseph Macguire, and Inspector General Michael Atkinson, who is responsible for conducting independent audits and investigations across the intelligence community. A lawyer for Mr Macguire's office said in a letter,externalto lawmakers that the complaint ""does not meet the definition of urgent concern"". The complaint ""concerned conduct by someone outside the intelligence community and did not relate to any 'intelligence activity' under the DNI's supervision"", the letter said. It also involved ""potentially privileged matters"", the letter added. Mr Atkinson told lawmakers in a letter,externalthat he disagreed with the DNI's assessment, and believed the complaint ""relates to one of the most significant and important of the DNI's responsibilities to the American people"". However, Mr Atkinson added that he was bound by the acting director of national intelligence's decision.

The BBC highlighted over 20 new cases to the party, who said all those found to be members who shared or supported anti-Muslim posts on Twitter and Facebook were suspended immediately. However, the officials would not reveal the exact number of members suspended. A Conservative spokesman said the party was now ""establishing the terms"" of an investigation into the wider issue. But Baroness Warsi, the former Tory chairwoman who was the UK's first female Muslim cabinet minister, accused her party of ""backsliding"". There have been repeated calls for the party to hold an independent inquiry into allegations of Islamophobia among members, due to previous incidents that have been highlighted to the party and in the media. 'No place' for Islamophobia in Tory party Call for Tory Islamophobia investigation Muslim Conservatives speak out after criticism of the party over Islamophobia Tories 'will order Islamophobia inquiry' This video can not be played Tory ex-MEP Sajjad Karim: I've heard Islamophobia from a minister The BBC was alerted to details of the new cases by an anonymous Twitter user, and independently verified each one before passing details to the Conservative Party. The incidents ranged from individuals ""liking"" anti-Muslim pictures or statements on one or two occasions, to regular Islamophobic posts by people who said they were members of the Tory party. Among the content that has been shared on social media, a Conservative councillor responded to a tweet in March, writing: ""Islam and slavery are partners in crime."" When contacted, he said the BBC was misrepresenting his views and he did not judge people by their race or religion. He said out of 10,000 to 15,000 of his posts, three had been taken out of context as part of an effort by the BBC to ""besmirch the Conservative Party"". An independent parish councillor, who stated he had worked on Boris Johnson's 2012 Mayoral campaign, posted: ""Islam is THE religion of hate (sic)"" and ""Muslims hate = free speech (sic)."" When contacted, he told the BBC he was an atheist who was equally critical of Christianity and all other religions, and he found it annoying Islam was held aloft and critics of it were branded racist. Other incidents included individuals posting comments such as ""Muslim scum"" and ""I don't want Muslims in this country"". Party sources said not all of the cases highlighted had involved members of the Conservative Party. A spokesperson said: ""All those found to be party members have been suspended immediately, pending investigation. ""The Conservative Party will never stand by when it comes to prejudice and discrimination of any kind. ""That's why we are already establishing the terms of an investigation to make sure that such instances are isolated and robust processes are in place to stamp them out as and when they occur."" Business minister Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC Radio 4's Today that he believed an independent inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party was under way, but he was not able to provide details of it. He said the party was ""trying to get to grips with this problem"" and it had taken ""decisive action"" when shown the cases by the BBC. Allow Twitter content?

Since 2018, the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) has been calling for the Conservatives to launch an independent inquiry into alleged Islamophobia, and in May, the council formally asked the Equalities and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) to hold one. The MCB has listed a series of complaints against figures in the party, including Boris Johnson forcomments he made about Muslim women before becoming prime minister. During the Conservative leadership race, then-Home Secretary Sajid Javid challenged the other candidates to commit to an external investigation and the others appeared to agree to it. Later, though, Mr Johnson claimed he understood they had committed to an inquiry ""into all types of prejudice and discrimination including anti-Semitism"", not Islamophobia specifically. Baroness Warsi told BBC Radio 4's World at One the party was acting too slowly on the issue. ""You said you didn't need an inquiry; now acknowledge it,"" she said. ""You said you needed a definition; you now have it. What new nonsense excuse are you now going to come up with simply to avoid dealing with this issue?"" Sajjad Karim, a Conservative Party member and former MEP, said there should be no ""rowing back"" on the pledges made. He told the BBC: ""I have experienced conversations taking place with Islamophobic content directly about me, being conducted by very senior members of the Conservative Party -  in fact parliamentarians, one of whom is in fact a serving minister at this moment in time. ""Ultimately, this is about values and if we allow Islamophobia, or any other form of discrimination, to go unchecked, what we are doing actually is undermining our own values. ""That is going to lead to a very different sort of society developing in the coming decades, and that is not something I think most Brits aspire to.""

RBS is first UK big four bank to be led by a woman,"RBS has named Alison Rose as its new chief executive, making her the first woman to lead one of the UK's big four banks. Ms Rose, who joined the bank 27 years ago as a graduate trainee, will replace the incumbent Ross McEwan in November. She will be paid more than her predecessor, with her annual salary set at Â£1.1m compared with Mr McEwan's Â£1m. Ms Rose is currently the chief executive of the commercial and private banking division. Other lenders have been led by women. Ana Botin was formerly in charge of Santander UK, while Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia was chief executive of Virgin Money before it was sold to CYBG last year. However, Ms Rose is the only woman so far to lead one of the UK's four biggest banks, which are RBS, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and HSBC. It also means that two of the most senior roles at RBS will be held by women, after Katie Murray was promoted to chief financial officer earlier this year. RBS is still majority-owned by the UK government ""Rose looks like a continuity candidate, given she has 27 years at the bank, and she was the favourite for the role,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at online broker AJ Bell. ""It is notable that she will be the first woman to head a major British bank,"" he added. RBS remains majority-owned by the UK government, with a stake of 62%, after it was bailed out with Â£45.5bn of taxpayers' money during the financial crisis. Ms Rose said she was ""looking forward to getting started"" in her new job, adding: ""Maintaining the safety and soundness of this bank will continue to underpin everything we do."" The RBS veteran has been widely tipped to replace Mr McEwan, who will become chief executive of National Australia Bank. Ms Rose joined NatWest straight from university in 1992, before the bank was bought by RBS eight years later. She studied history at Durham University and is married with two children. Ms Rose helped restructure the bank's balance sheet in the aftermath of the financial crisis, a process which she described as ""challenging"". As well as heading RBS's commercial and private banking, Ms Rose is currently deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings, which includes the large retail bank, but whose funding is kept separate from the riskier investment banking operations. Her roles at the bank have been diverse. Earlier in her career she was head of non-investment grade origination in the bond market - raising money for companies with poor credit. She then had senior roles in the lender's investment bank before being promoted to leading its commercial and private banking, which includes bankers to the Queen, Coutts; and Lombard, which lends to companies so they can buy boats, vehicles, machinery and aircraft.

Climate change protests expected across UKSchoolchildren and workers are preparing for a walk-out to call for more action on climate change.UK,"This video can not be played Global climate strike: Protests take place across England Thousands of people around the UK have joined a global climate change protest, with pupils walking out of schools and workers downing tools to demand action. Millions around the world are taking part in the""climate strike"" day, with rallies in British cities including Glasgow, Manchester and London. Anna Taylor, a co-founder of UK Student Climate Network, said it was ""very easy"" to persuade people to show up. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said ""every child"" should be in school. He added: ""They should be learning, they shouldn't be bunking off and it's very irresponsible for people to encourage children to do so."" Huge crowds join day of climate action - live updates Climate protest: A very different kind of school trip In pictures: Global climate strike Hundreds miss school for climate strike protest Student Jessica Ahmed, 16, emailed her school to warn that she would be joining the protests instead of being in class. Speaking at a protest in Westminster, she said: ""School is important but so is my future. ""If politicians were taking the appropriate action we need - and had been taking this action a long time ago when it was recognised the world was changing in a negative way -  then I would not have to be skipping school."" Pupils left the classroom for the coast in Cullercoats, North Tyneside Organisers estimated that around 100,000 people attended a rally in central London, while more than 20,000 were thought to have marched in Edinburgh and 10,000 in Brighton. In Belfast, organisers put the turnout at between 3,000 and 4,000, with young people taking over the Cornmarket area of the city centre and staging a ""mass die-in"". And in Birmingham, around 3,000 protesters, including hundreds of children, gathered in the city's Victoria Square before marching through nearby streets. UK Student Climate Network said more than 200 events had been organised across the country. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told young people at the Westminster rally: ""You and a whole generation have brought [climate change] centre stage and I am absolutely delighted about that. ""If we're going to sustain this planet we need to get to net zero emissions a lot, lot quicker than 2050 [the government's target],"" he said. He wants every country to sign up to theParis Agreement, which commits signatory nations to keeping global temperatures ""well below"" 2.0C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times. Referring to President Donald Trump, Mr Corbyn said it was ""disgraceful when you get a president of a major country like the US"" whosays they will walk away. The global protests come ahead of a summit at the UN next week that will urge countries to do more to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Children hold a similar ""die in"" in Cambridge Dozens of pupils from John Stainer Community Primary school in Brockley, south-east London, were among those taking part in protests in London. Head teacher Sue Harte said ""children need to know that they have a right to democratic protest"". Sebastian, a pupil at the school, said he joined the protests to help fight global warming. Sebastian says he knows how important it is to look after the planet ""They, the government, don't understand that we're going to go through it and they are not,"" he said. Eight-year-old Sohan and Nayan, five, also from south-east London, joined protesters with their mother, Celine. Sohan said: ""We want to save our planet and we hope that marching will help."" Sohan and Nayan with their mother, Celine At the Belfast protest, Extinction Rebellion activist Lorraine Montague, from County Tyrone, was dressed as a swan to highlight the threat of climate change to wildlife. ""Our climate is at crisis point and the government is not doing anything about it,"" she said. ""We are grieving for our future. I don't feel happy about having children, the way our climate is going."" Children join climate change protests in NI Thousands to join school strikes on climate change What is climate change doing to Wales? In Edinburgh, demonstrators - the majority of them young people - chanted and sang as they marched from the Meadows to Holyrood Park near the Scottish Parliament. They carried placards reading ""Scotland, you're not too wee to change the world"" and ""If you were smarter, I would be in school"". Young climate activists in Glasgow think children could ""save the planet"" Children from Terra Nova Secondary in Cheshire are attending the UK Student Climate Network's strike in Manchester Extinction Rebellion, which organised its own climate and environment protests in the UK earlier this year, said it stood ""in solidarity"" with those taking part. It added that its members were joining the strikes and holding their own events, including a choir and ""kids' space"" in Victoria Tower Gardens, Westminster, and outside King's College London. Protesters in Manchester, where at least one clothing store closed to support the strike This video can not be played Climate protest: 'This is more important than a maths lesson' Some trade unions, including the TUC, the University and College Union and Unite, are supporting members who take part in the ""strikes"". Co-operative Bank said it supported workers who want to join the action, while US clothing brand Patagonia closed all of its stores and took out adverts to back the protesters. But in Norwich, protester Tiffany Wallace said her employer declined to give her time off work to join demonstrators ""because they didn't think it was important"". ""The worst thing they can do is fire me,"" said the 33-year-old. ""I don't feel I should compromise my own values and integrity and what's important, so I can make money for a business."" Tiffany Wallace said her company declined to give her permission to join the protests Energy minister Kwasi Kwarteng said he could not ""endorse children leaving school"" to take part in the protests. But he said he did support ""their energy, their creativity, and the fact that they have completely mastered these issues and take them very seriously"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan, Green Party MP Caroline Lucas and Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson all supported the walkout for the Youth Strike 4 Climate campaign. The Metropolitan Police said seven people were arrested for public order offences, but overall the day ran ""smoothly"". Commander Dave Musker said a ""tiny minority of protesters"" tried to block Lambeth Bridge, a key route for emergency services to St Thomas' Hospital. One other man was arrested on the bridge on suspicion of discharging a flare in a public place. Teenage campaigner Greta Thunberg - who inspired the protests - sailed to the US ahead of the UN Climate Action Summit in New York next week The global action follows a long-running series of school strikes initially inspired by activist Greta Thunberg. The teenager, from Sweden, is also playing a role in the day's events and is set to join a rally planned in New York, where world leaders will meet at the UN next week.

Two dead after fire on former steelworks site,"Fire crews were at the site overnight Two men have died in an explosion at a former steelworks site. Fire crews were called to the old coke ovens at the SSI site in South Bank, Middlesbrough, on Thursday afternoon. It is believed the men were inside a cherry picker at a height, working on pipes near a gas holder when the explosion happened. The site was evacuated and police widened a 250m (820ft) cordon after flames were seen coming from the blast area. Tees Valley Mayor Ben Houchen said: ""We will examine every single detail of the work that was being conducted. We will make sure we do everything to understand exactly what happened. ""It is impossible to imagine the pain and distress which this news will have brought the loved ones of those involved."" On Friday afternoon four firefighters remained at the scene ""on protective standby"", Cleveland Fire Brigade area manager Steve Johnson said. Although the fire had been contained the smoke could still be seen Dave Cocks, who used to work on the SSI site, said: ""It would appear that this terrible accident has happened in part of that gas-cleaning process. ""Clearing a site of this nature does take a lot of planning and preparation and there's no doubt over the last four years there will be areas off the plant where there would be materials that would need to be removed to keep the plant safe for demolition. ""The clearing of any industrial site does present certain risks and hazards that have to be eliminated wherever possible. ""Closing down an iron-making site of this size is very rarely done in the UK so the planning could take months or indeed years, and it could be years and years before we see the site cleared."" Cleveland Police has declared it a major incident. Det Supt Tariq Ali said: ""The families of those two men have been informed and our thoughts remain with them at this very difficult time."" The Health and Safety Executive has been informed and all work on the site has been suspended. The South Bank coke ovens were part of the SSI complex, which had offices and a blast furnace in nearby Redcar. The steelworks announced its closure in 2015when its Thai-based owners went into liquidation and 2,200 workers lost their jobs. In January,a deal was agreedto transfer more than half of the developable land at the former Redcar Steelworks to the South Tees Development Corporation.

Ministers will table ""formal written solutions when we are ready"" and not to an ""artificial deadline"", it added. Boris Johnson said he did not want to ""exaggerate progress"" of negotiations, but some was being made. It comes after Finland's prime minister said that Mr Johnson had 12 days to set out his Brexit plans to the EU. But a government source said the development was not in response to the remarks. Meanwhile, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has told Sky News that talks earlier this week with Mr Johnson were ""rather positive"" and that a deal could be reached in the next few weeks. Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he will try to get a deal with Mr Johnson when they meet at a UN summit in New York next week. But his deputy, Simon Coveney, said there was ""still a big gap"" between what the UK government wanted and what Ireland and the EU needed, in terms of getting a deal. Kuenssberg: What happens next if the PM gets a Brexit deal? UK 'has 12 days to set out Brexit plans' Brexit talks 'should not be a pretence' - Barnier The commission said it had received documents from the UK government and technical talks were taking place. Chief spokesperson Mina Andreeva also confirmed there would be talks at a political level at a meeting on Friday between the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, and Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay. The technical discussions were on some aspects of rules relating to customs and manufactured goods, as well as sanitary rules and phytosanitary rules - which relate to the health of plants - she said. The BBC also understands ""live discussions"" are taking place between the EU and UK about ruling out another delay to Brexit if a deal is agreed. Sources told BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg that, if a plan is signed off by both sides, the EU could then announce it would not grant an extension to 31 October deadline if MPs voted the deal down - essentially giving them a choice between the negotiated deal or a no-deal Brexit. Other sources on the EU and UK sides played down the possibility, denying there had been any formal consideration of the proposal and saying the current focus was on getting a deal. But Laura Kuenssberg said: ""It's clear that government officials are considering ways of sticking to the prime minister's October deadline, with, or without a deal being reached."" Mr Johnson has said he wants to leave the EU, preferably with a deal, on 31 October and has urged the EU to scrap the backstop in the withdrawal agreement reached by predecessor Theresa May. The backstop is the controversial policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and it was a key sticking point in Mrs May's attempts to get Parliament to back her plan. The EU has asked for alternative suggestions and had criticised the UK for not putting any plans in writing. Mr Juncker told Sky News that the EU did not ""need the backstop"" if all its objectives for the Irish border were met. He added that ""if the results are there, I don't care about the instruments"". Finnish PM Antti Rinne (left) says he and French President Emmanuel Macron (right) agreed the new deadline for Boris Johnson Mr Johnson said: ""I don't want to exaggerate the progress that we are making, but we are making progress."" He said the UK needed to leave in a way that allowed it to ""do things differently"" and ""not remain under the control of the EU in terms of laws and trade policy"". But he also reiterated the need to ensure no hard border returned to Northern Ireland, and the Good Friday Agreement was protected. ""We think we can do that,"" said the PM. ""We think we can solve that problem and I think we are making some progress."" He added: ""Let's see where we get. It is vital whatever happens that we prepare for no-deal and we will be ready for no-deal on 31 October. We have got to do both things at once."" Could the Supreme Court overrule the government? Could MPs return to Parliament? Parliament suspended 'to stop MPs interfering' Earlier, Mr Rinne said he and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed the UK needed to produce the proposals in writing by the end of September, adding if not, ""then it's over"". Finland currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. A French government official said the deadline was ""not at all a new proposal"" and added: ""If we don't get the proposals before the end of September, we will not have enough time to discuss them before the summit in October."" The sending of the documents to the EU comes as the legal battle over the suspension of the UK Parliament is in its third day at the UK's Supreme Court. The UK government is arguing the decision to prorogue Parliament was a political matter and not for the courts to ""design a set of rules"" around it. But campaigners say the move was used ""for an improper purpose"" - to stop MPs scrutinising Mr Johnson's plans in the run up to Brexit on 31 October. The prime minister prorogued Parliament earlier this month for five weeks, with MPs not scheduled to return until 14 October.

UK 'has 12 days to set out plans',"Finnish PM Antti Rinne (left) says he and French President Emmanuel Macron (right) agreed the new deadline for Boris Johnson Boris Johnson has 12 days to set out his Brexit plans to the EU, according to Finland's prime minister. Antti Rinne said he and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed the UK needed to produce the proposals in writing by the end of September, adding if not, ""then it's over"". Finland currently holds the EU's rotating presidency. A Downing Street source said: ""We will continue negotiating and put forward proposals at the appropriate time."" Mr Johnson has said a deal is possible at a crucial summit of EU leaders on 17 October, but he has insisted Brexit will happen by the 31 October deadline, even if a deal is not agreed. Brexit talks 'should not be a pretence' - Barnier Brexit solution must recognise NI status - Foster The UK government said talks with the EU have been making progress since Mr Johnson came into No 10 in July. It said it had put forward ""a number of proposals"" as alternatives to the Irish border backstop - the policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland and a key sticking point in former PM Theresa May's Brexit deal. But Mr Johnson has repeatedly refused to reveal details of the proposals in interviews, saying he did not want to negotiate in public. The EU has continued to criticise the UK for not putting any plans in writing. Earlier, the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, said a meeting with Mr Johnson on Monday had been ""constructive"". But he said until proposals had been put forward, ""I will not be able to tell you, looking you straight in the eye, that any real progress has been achieved"". Johnson attacked by Luxembourg PM over Brexit Politics, not process, will make the difference Mr Rinne spoke to reporters after a meeting with the French president in Paris on Wednesday. He said: ""We both agreed that it is now time for Boris Johnson to produce his own proposals in writing - if they exist. ""If no proposals are received by the end of September, then it's over."" The Finnish PM intends to discuss the new deadline with the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, and Mr Johnson in the coming days, but the position has not yet been agreed with other EU nations. An official at the Elysee said the plan was ""not at all a new proposal"" and added: ""If we don't get the proposals before the end of September, we will not have enough time to discuss them before the summit in October."" Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg insisted the prime minister was on course to deliver a ""fundamentally different"" Brexit deal to ensure the UK leaves on October 31. He told a Telegraph event that to achieve such an outcome the government had to ""listen very carefully to what the DUP says"". DUP Leader Arlene Foster spoke to the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on issues concerning devolution and Brexit On Wednesday, DUP leader Arlene Foster told business leaders in Dublin that she wanted a solution to Brexit thatdoes not affect Northern Ireland's constitutional position. Mrs Foster - whose party's support had until recently given the Conservatives a majority in Parliament - said a Brexit deal ""will not be achieved that involves a backstop - whether it is UK-wide or Northern Ireland specific"". The whole of the UK had to leave the customs union and single market, she said. But she added that the DUP was prepared to ""look at Northern Ireland-specific solutions achieved with the support and consent of the representatives of the people of Northern Ireland"". Protesters outside the UK's Supreme Court in London It comes as the legal battle over the suspension of the UK Parliament is to go into a third day at the Supreme Court later. The UK government is arguing the decision to prorogue Parliament was a political matter and not for the courts to ""design a set of rules"" around it. But campaigners say the move was used ""for an improper purpose"" - to stop MPs scrutinising Mr Johnson's plans in the run up to Brexit on 31 October. The prime minister prorogued Parliament earlier this month for five weeks, with MPs not scheduled to return until 14 October. Mr Rees-Mogg, who travelled to Balmoral to seek the Queen's approval over the move, said it was ""nonsense"" to suggest she was misled over the decision.

RBS names Alison Rose as its new chief executive,"RBS has named Alison Rose as its new chief executive, making her the first woman to lead one of the UK's big four banks.

Ana Botin was formerly in charge of Santander UK, while Dame Jayne-Anne Gadhia was chief executive of Virgin Money before it was sold to CYBG last year. However, Ms Rose is the only woman so far to lead one of the UK's four biggest banks, which are RBS, Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays and HSBC.

Ms Rose said she was ""looking forward to getting started"" in her new job, adding: ""Maintaining the safety and soundness of this bank will continue to underpin everything we do."" The RBS veteran has been widely tipped to replace Mr McEwan, who will become chief executive of National Australia Bank. Ms Rose joined NatWest straight from university in 1992, before the bank was bought by RBS eight years later. She studied history at Durham University and is married with two children.

New leather factory to create 100 jobs,"Scottish Leather Group is one of the largest leather manufacturers in the UK A major leather manufacturer will open a new factory in Renfrewshire next year, creating 100 jobs. The Scottish Leather Group, one of the largest leather manufacturers in the UK, already has facilities in Bridge of Weir, Paisley and Glasgow. Bosses say the new venue will be open in Paisley by autumn 2020 and will provide high-end car seat upholstery. Director James Lang said Renfrewshire offered the ""perfect environment for businesses to flourish"". It comes as Renfrewshire business leaders set out a strategy to grow the local economy. Scotland's economy shrinks on 'Brexit uncertainty' Scottish unemployment rises by 19,000 Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said: ""Scotland is an attractive place to do business with a skilled workforce and companies like Scottish Leather Group expanding their operations is testament to this. ""I welcome the publication of Renfrewshire's economic strategy which will help develop the local economy further."" The strategy set out aims for the next 10 years which include adding 9,000 jobs to the economy and boosting the value of goods and services in the area by Â£400m in one year. Business leaders also want to expand Renfrewshire's manufacturing sector by 30%, grow the working-age population by 5,000 people and reduce economic inactivity by 15%. Mr Lang chairs Renfrewshire's economic leadership panel, which developed the strategy. He said: ""As a locally-based business we can trace our Renfrewshire roots as far back as the 18th Century. ""We are delighted to be expanding our Renfrewshire operation further with this important new facility in Paisley, which will create new jobs and enable us to deliver on our expanding portfolio. ""We are at an exciting time with major economic investment taking place right across Renfrewshire, a region which has strong foundations upon which to build, with a high employment rate and businesses exporting Â£2bn of goods and services worldwide."" Renfrewshire Council leader Iain Nicolson added: ""Renfrewshire is a place of culture, creativity and design, a region that is globally connected and a place that is investing in its economy.

Thomas Cook told extra funds needed to seal rescueThe troubled travel firm must find Â£200m in extra contingency funds before banks will agree a deal.Business,"Tour operator Thomas Cook has approached the government in an attempt to plug a gap in its funding. The travel company could fall into administration this weekend unless it finds Â£200m in extra funds needed to secure its future. ButBBC business editor Simon Jack saysif holidaymakers are hoping the government will save the day, they may be disappointed. A collapse would leave 150,000 UK holidaymakers stranded. The BBC's business editor said that while a private sector deal may still be possible, the noises coming out of the government at the moment suggested the UK taxpayer was unlikely to become Thomas Cook's saviour. The troubled operator hoped to seal a rescue led by China's Fosun this week. But the creditor banks issued a last-minute demand that the travel company find an extra Â£200m. The Civil Aviation Authority is on standby with a repatriation contingency plan called Operation Matterhorn. The potential cost of bringing home passengers is put at about Â£600m. In his blog,Simon Jack says the government does not recognise the choice being presented as between spending Â£200m on a cash injection to save the company versus a Â£600m bill to repatriate UK holidaymakers. He writes that the government's understanding is that most Thomas Cook customers will be covered by travel insurance or Atol protection - a fund paid for through industry levies. He also says the government's previous refusal to offer assistance to companieslike Carillionwould make helping Thomas Cook very difficult in principle and in practice. Furthermore, the matter is being handled by the Department for Transport - which organised the repatriation of customers of the failed airline Monarch - rather than the Department for Business, he adds. There has been a shift in tone from Thomas Cook on Twitter, with worried customers being told to ignore media speculation on Friday. Now they are being reminded they do have Atol protection ""in the event that Thomas Cook goes into administration"". Thomas Cook: Your questions answered What's gone wrong at Thomas Cook? Customers fear ruined weddings and trips Thomas Cook: MP calls for 'leadership' Travel expert Simon Calder said all Thomas Cook flights in and out of the UK were running normally on Saturday morning, and travel agencies would be opening at the usual times. He said that while Thomas Cook remains a going concern - albeit in terrible trouble - there was very little anyone who was on a Thomas Cook holiday or has one booked in the coming days or weeks could do. Anyone trying to cancel holidays could expect to be given short shrift and end up losing some or all of their money, he added. Currently there are 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British Thomas Cook, one of the world's largest travel companies, was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and now has annual sales of Â£9bn. It employs 22,000 staff, 9,000 of those in the UK and serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries. The TSSA union's general secretary Manuel Cortes told the BBC that his members' ""main concern was if they had a job on Monday morning"". Jacqui Cunningham and her partner Angus McNair are unsure whether they should pay the outstanding balance on their holiday Teacher Jacqui Cunningham and her partner, train driver Angus McNair, from Brentwood, Essex, have booked a holiday to the Maldives with Thomas Cook for December. The luxury trip is to celebrate Ms Cunningham's recovery from cancer. They have paid a deposit of Â£500 and the balance of Â£8,000 is due by midnight on Friday. Thomas Cook is, of course, still operating. But their predicament underlines the anxiety many customers are feeling. Ms Cunningham and Mr McNair called the customer service helpline and asked if they could delay paying the Â£8,000 until they know that the tour operator is not going to fall into administration. But they were told the deadline remains, or they would lose their Â£500 deposit. ""We were going to pay on debit card, but now I think we'll put it on the credit card if we go forward,"" she said. Thomas Cook's financial difficulties have mounted over the past year, culminating with the agreement in August of a rescue deal led by its biggest shareholder Fosun. Thomas Cook 'racing to finalise rescue deal' Weak pound boosting UK tourism industry In July, Thomas Cook produced a business plan saying that it needed Â£900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of Â£150m. The Â£900m would come from Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors. The group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional Â£200m on top of the Â£900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to Â£1.1bn. Thomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional Â£200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out and the group of creditors will not come back to the table unless that additional funding is found. A final vote on that deal was due to take place this week, but it has been delayed until next Friday in the face of the latest demand for extra standby funding. Earlier this week, Thomas Cook said it was ""focused on completing"" the deal. It is believed to be negotiating with its banks, bondholders and Fosun in an attempt to keep the rescue on track. In May, the operator reported a Â£1.5bn loss for the first half of the year. It has also recently issued three profit warnings and is struggling to reduce its debts. It has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit. If you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment. Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating. If you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme. If you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund. When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.

He also says the government's previous refusal to offer assistance to companieslike Carillionwould make helping Thomas Cook very difficult in principle and in practice. Furthermore, the matter is being handled by the Department for Transport - which organised the repatriation of customers of the failed airline Monarch - rather than the Department for Business, he adds. There has been a shift in tone from Thomas Cook on Twitter, with worried customers being told to ignore media speculation on Friday. Now they are being reminded they do have Atol protection ""in the event that Thomas Cook goes into administration"". Thomas Cook: Your questions answered What's gone wrong at Thomas Cook? Customers fear ruined weddings and trips Thomas Cook: MP calls for 'leadership' Travel expert Simon Calder said all Thomas Cook flights in and out of the UK were running normally on Saturday morning, and travel agencies would be opening at the usual times. He said that while Thomas Cook remains a going concern - albeit in terrible trouble - there was very little anyone who was on a Thomas Cook holiday or has one booked in the coming days or weeks could do. Anyone trying to cancel holidays could expect to be given short shrift and end up losing some or all of their money, he added. Currently there are 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British Thomas Cook, one of the world's largest travel companies, was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and now has annual sales of Â£9bn. It employs 22,000 staff, 9,000 of those in the UK and serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries. The TSSA union's general secretary Manuel Cortes told the BBC that his members' ""main concern was if they had a job on Monday morning"". Jacqui Cunningham and her partner Angus McNair are unsure whether they should pay the outstanding balance on their holiday Teacher Jacqui Cunningham and her partner, train driver Angus McNair, from Brentwood, Essex, have booked a holiday to the Maldives with Thomas Cook for December. The luxury trip is to celebrate Ms Cunningham's recovery from cancer. They have paid a deposit of Â£500 and the balance of Â£8,000 is due by midnight on Friday. Thomas Cook is, of course, still operating. But their predicament underlines the anxiety many customers are feeling. Ms Cunningham and Mr McNair called the customer service helpline and asked if they could delay paying the Â£8,000 until they know that the tour operator is not going to fall into administration. But they were told the deadline remains, or they would lose their Â£500 deposit. ""We were going to pay on debit card, but now I think we'll put it on the credit card if we go forward,"" she said. Thomas Cook's financial difficulties have mounted over the past year, culminating with the agreement in August of a rescue deal led by its biggest shareholder Fosun. Thomas Cook 'racing to finalise rescue deal' Weak pound boosting UK tourism industry In July, Thomas Cook produced a business plan saying that it needed Â£900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of Â£150m. The Â£900m would come from Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors. The group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional Â£200m on top of the Â£900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to Â£1.1bn. Thomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional Â£200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out and the group of creditors will not come back to the table unless that additional funding is found. A final vote on that deal was due to take place this week, but it has been delayed until next Friday in the face of the latest demand for extra standby funding. Earlier this week, Thomas Cook said it was ""focused on completing"" the deal. It is believed to be negotiating with its banks, bondholders and Fosun in an attempt to keep the rescue on track. In May, the operator reported a Â£1.5bn loss for the first half of the year. It has also recently issued three profit warnings and is struggling to reduce its debts. It has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit. If you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment. Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating. If you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme. If you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund. When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.

"New leather factory to create 100 jobsScottish Leather Group's new facility, opening in 2020, will produce high-end car seat upholstery.","Scottish Leather Group is one of the largest leather manufacturers in the UK A major leather manufacturer will open a new factory in Renfrewshire next year, creating 100 jobs. The Scottish Leather Group, one of the largest leather manufacturers in the UK, already has facilities in Bridge of Weir, Paisley and Glasgow. Bosses say the new venue will be open in Paisley by autumn 2020 and will provide high-end car seat upholstery. Director James Lang said Renfrewshire offered the ""perfect environment for businesses to flourish"". It comes as Renfrewshire business leaders set out a strategy to grow the local economy. Scotland's economy shrinks on 'Brexit uncertainty' Scottish unemployment rises by 19,000 Finance Secretary Derek Mackay said: ""Scotland is an attractive place to do business with a skilled workforce and companies like Scottish Leather Group expanding their operations is testament to this. ""I welcome the publication of Renfrewshire's economic strategy which will help develop the local economy further."" The strategy set out aims for the next 10 years which include adding 9,000 jobs to the economy and boosting the value of goods and services in the area by Â£400m in one year. Business leaders also want to expand Renfrewshire's manufacturing sector by 30%, grow the working-age population by 5,000 people and reduce economic inactivity by 15%. Mr Lang chairs Renfrewshire's economic leadership panel, which developed the strategy. He said: ""As a locally-based business we can trace our Renfrewshire roots as far back as the 18th Century. ""We are delighted to be expanding our Renfrewshire operation further with this important new facility in Paisley, which will create new jobs and enable us to deliver on our expanding portfolio.

"Politics, not process, will make the difference","There is something extremely retro about what's going on at the moment - the diplomatic dance between the EU and the UK. The UK says: ""Of course there's a plan and we have lots of whizzo ideas we're sharing with our friends on the continent."" The EU then declares: ""There is no plan, we don't know what you want!"" - while at the same time making clear, as today, that they disapprove of some of the proposals that supposedly don't exist. Brexit talks 'should not be a pretence' - Barnier Johnson attacked by Luxembourg PM over Brexit What does 'podiumgate' say about Brexit deal? If it wasn't so serious for our economy, our politics, the UK's place in the world, you might wonder if it's like the start of a school disco, when the boys are sulking in one corner, trying to look cool and pretending they don't want even to talk to any of the girls. In the other corner, the girls are huddled, sneaking glances over to the other side of the hall, wondering who is going to be the first to make any contact. At that moment, there's a stand-off, even though both sides know that within a couple of hours, it will be complete bedlam - especially if someone has managed to slips a few cans of cider into the loos or a snifter of peach schnapps in their borrowed handbag. It's retro, not just because of the echoes of misspent youth, but because Theresa May's government went through some of this same warm-up. On countless occasions, EU leaders anywhere near a microphone demanded the UK give more information. And UK ministers were asked again, and again, and again, what exactly do you intend to do? The answer came repeatedly - we do have a plan, but of course we're not going to publish it until the right time. It was frustrating on all sides frankly, including for journalists trying to find out exactly what was going on. In fact, the time I saw Mrs May most angry was when I asked her about eight times exactly what kind of deal she was really after on a trip to China. Suffice to say, it did not end well. Theresa May's government went through some of this same warm-up Like everything about Boris Johnson's premiership though, this familiar process is happening at hyper-speed with an accompanying drama. Whether that's Xavier Bettel's (un)diplomatic and frustrated showboating, or the box office Supreme Court case unfolding right now, I can't say enough times, what is happening now in politics is not normal. But let's ignore the histrionics on all sides for a moment though, and try to understand where the state of play really is - could there, maybe, just maybe, be a deal? There are talks taking place. There might not be official talks with official joint press conferences afterwards, but there are discussions going on and possible solutions are being discussed, kept tantalisingly hidden in the UK negotiator David Frost's binders. And there is what the government describes as the ""broad shape"" of a deal, which has been put forward in recent weeks to different actors in the EU, to try to see if it could be the basis of something. It's important to say that it is, what one very well placed source describes it as, a ""selection of starters, amuse-bouches, main courses"", and other items that make up a menu of different options that could be chosen from and digested. It is not a fixed set of final proposals. But yes, you guessed it, most of them revolve around potential ways of solving the conundrum around the Irish border. So what are they? Well, the first part of the possible plan is to build on a system that already exists. The island of Ireland, north and south, is already treated as a single zone for animal health. So any livestock that goes into Northern Ireland from Great Britain is checked on entry. No 10 is looking at what else you can include in that regime. Could you have a single zone for all food products? Could you expand it to include all manufactured goods? There is already an electricity market for the whole island. How much can you lump into this existing regime? This is, you guessed it, not a straightforward discussion, but the government believes it could solve part of the problem. But no one in Whitehall, and certainly not in Brussels, believes that could solve the whole problem. Consider a return to Poland, ambassador suggests No-deal Brexit threatens EU peace projects in NI The next question, therefore, is if a part of the economy doesn't conveniently slot into that regime, how do you carry out checks without causing enormous disruption to trade? There are conversations going on about where and how this could be feasible, with the driving principle for checks to happen away from the actual border. But again, if you've been following this process, there have been many, many conversations about this already - none of which have reached a happy conclusion - but it is part of what the government would like to be the solution. Again - not straightforward. Even trickier is how to address the customs issue. It's clear the government does not want to go back to the idea of a Northern Ireland only backstop - not just because their sometime allies, the DUP, wouldn't want to accept it, but because that would mean it would essentially be in the EU customs union. When you hear the prime minister talk about the UK leaving EU apparatus ""as a whole"", this is what he is ruling out. The DUP - led by Arlene Foster - are sometimes allies of No 10 He wants Northern Ireland to be in the UK customs territory, but the implication of this is some kind of customs border - because when goods go from Northern Ireland into the EU they need to be checked somewhere. A border in the Irish sea?  Hmmm... Deeply complicated. And it feels unrealistically optimistic to imagine that the EU would allow these elements to be settled after the UK leaves. Then there's the question of who would actually police and monitor all of this stuff. Maybe the Northern Irish Assembly could be given a bigger role - that's one of the UK's ideas not necessarily beloved by the EU. And over the longer term, there is still the hope on the UK side that those ""alternative arrangements"" (remember them?) could replace the need for any kind of draconian arrangements. But there are now conversations happening between governments about the principle here, one of consent, that simply weren't happening a while ago. Again, a million miles from a happy conclusion, but progress of a sort. If you want to read more about the potential technical details of the possible shape of a deal, there have been thousands of column inches in the last few days devoted to it with lots of well informed speculation by different EU pundits, well plugged into to what's going on. And there's a good explanation here by one of my colleagues in Belfast about the border conundrum: What are the Brexit backstop options? The details of what, or might not be possible, of course do matter a lot. And it is abundantly clear that the EU does not, at the moment, consider what they have heard (in the non-existent talks remember!) to be anywhere near enough to replace what was agreed with Mrs May. But while the policy equations are important, the political choice on whether to try to make something work is the vital one. And there is palpable frustration in some quarters on the UK side that not everyone in the EU actually wants to listen. Perhaps, and who would blame them, some on the other side of the Channel would rather take their chances and wait to see what happens after the likely general election. Parliament's voted to delay departure if there is no deal after all. Why invest much in this administration's ideas when the political turbulence could just sweep them away in any case? One EU insider joked tonight, ""In Boris we trust?"".  But next week the prime minister is likely to use encounters with the major EU leaders, like Merkel and Macron, in the margins of the UN Assembly in New York to give the political dynamics a good shove. Some sources in government reckon that kind of intervention from a big continental player is the only way there can be a resolution in time. Another senior figure reckons, guess what, it's still all about Ireland. If they signal that they could be ready to take this set of proposals seriously, then it could be game on. Is that realistic? It would be a pretty enormous political turnaround. Part of getting any deal done when there has been such a confrontation is to find ways of every party finding a ""win"". There's talk tonight of the UK being given a deadline to publish its proposals. Who can blame the EU for making those kinds of demands for concrete and public commitments when events this side of the Channel are so turbulent. But as ever, it's the politics, not the process, that will likely make the difference in the end. Johnson attacked by Luxembourg PM over Brexit Does Luxembourg PM's scorn signal an EU shift?

Brexit secretary to meet EU's chief negotiator,"This video can not be played Barclay: No one wants to see a no-deal Brexit Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has said the UK and EU share a ""common purpose"" in reaching a new withdrawal deal, after a meeting in Brussels with chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier. He said they had had ""serious detailed discussions"" and things were ""moving forward with momentum"". Mr Barnier said it had been a ""cordial"" meeting, but ""lots of work has to be done in the next few days"". The deadline for the UK to exit the EU is 31 October. On Thursday, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said a new Brexit deal could still be reached by then. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said some ""progress"" was being made, although it was important not to ""exaggerate"" this. But Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told the BBC on Friday that there was a ""wide gap"" between the UK and the EU, with Brussels ""still waiting for serious proposals"" from London. And a leaked memo from the European Commission said the UK had confirmed its proposals for replacing the Irish backstop ""do not amount to legally operational solutions and would have to be developed during the transitional period"". The memo also said the UK's proposals did not avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, or preserve the integrity of the single market. However, a UK government source insisted their proposals were ""serious and workable"" and would avoid a hard border. ""As for the Commission, two months ago they said we couldn't reopen the withdrawal agreement and there was absolutely no alternative to the backstop - now we are having detailed discussions. ""Leaks from Brussels on Twitter are par for the course,  you can set your watch by them. ""What we're focused on is actually getting a deal in the room - we trust they'll do the same."" 'Dose of reality needed' over Brexit deal hopes UK shares Brexit documents with EU Kuenssberg: What happens next if the PM gets a Brexit deal? UK 'has 12 days to set out Brexit plans' The backstop - the policy aimed at preventing the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit - has proved the biggest point of contention in EU-UK talks so far. It was a major sticking point in former Prime Minister Theresa May's attempts to get Parliament to back her withdrawal agreement, which was rejected three times by MPs. Amid the white noise of Brexit, there has only ever been one question that really matters: is there any sign that things might be about to change? Meetings get excitedly talked up in advance (I plead guilty). Anodyne statements follow shortly afterwards. In short, the EU says the UK has not yet provided enough detail on a plan to replace the so-called backstop, to keep the border on the island of Ireland open under all circumstances. The UK says it is dreaming up all sorts of ideas. So what happens next? New York. A shindig at the United Nations next week - and with it the chance for the prime minister to have one-on-one chats with the likes of President Macron of France and Chancellor Merkel of Germany. Could they provide the oomph needed to knock together a deal? It still looks less likely than likely, but who knows? Mr Johnson, who has said he wants to leave the EU - preferably with a deal - by 31 October, has urged the EU to scrap the backstop. But the EU has asked for detailed alternative proposals. Following the latest meeting, which overran, Mr Barclay said: ""There's a common purpose in Dublin, in London and here in Brussels to see a deal over the line."" He added that the two sides had been ""getting into the detail"" and that more ""technical"" discussions would happen next week. Mr Johnson and European Council President Donald Tusk are also expected to hold talks when the United Nations General Assembly takes place in New York next week. Mr Barclay said this ""underscores the purpose there is on both sides to get a deal and that is what we are working very hard to secure"". This video can not be played Barnier: UK Brexit proposals must protect peace in Ireland He added that ""a clear message has been given both by President Juncker and the prime minister"" and both sides were ""working hard"". Also speaking after the meeting, Mr Barnier said he was not optimistic or pessimistic but ""still determined"". ""Brexit is a school of patience but we are still ready to reach an agreement,"" he said. He said that any proposal from the UK to replace the backstop ""must reach all the objectives of the backstop"". These were to ""protect the peace in Ireland, to protect the all=Ireland economy, and also to protect the consumers and the businesses of the EU and the single market"", Mr Barnier said. The prime minister has said the UK needs to leave in a way that allows it to ""do things differently"" and ""not remain under the control of the EU in terms of laws and trade policy"". But he also reiterated the need to ensure no hard border returned to Northern Ireland, and the Good Friday Agreement -which helped bring an end to the Troubles- was protected.

This happened after Finland's prime minister said Mr Johnson had 12 days to set out his Brexit plans to the EU - although a government source said the development was not in response to those remarks. Thursday saw the final day of the legal battle over Mr Johnson's decision to prorogue - suspend - Parliament at the UK's Supreme Court. Its president, Lady Hale, promised a decision early next week.
