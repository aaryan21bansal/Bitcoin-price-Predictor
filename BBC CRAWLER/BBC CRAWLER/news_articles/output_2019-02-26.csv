Fans demand Ryan Adams money back,"Ryan Adams performing in January in Inglewood, California Fans of singer-songwriter Ryan Adams are demanding their money back ahead of his upcoming UK tour. Followingaccusations of sexual misconduct, some fans say they don't want to go to his concerts until the allegations are proven or discounted. In arecent report,external, several women also accused him of psychological abuse. The FBI is looking at whether he sent explicit text messages to an underage teenager, something Adams has said he ""unequivocally"" denies. Adams' forthcoming album has been put on hold but tickets for his UK dates are still on sale. This has left some fans taking to social media to demand a refund from music venues and ticket companies.

Emma Buff from Peterborough spent just under Â£50 on tickets to see Adams perform in April and feels ""quite shocked"" by the allegations made against him. ""Reading the allegations upset me quite a lot and I decided I didn't want any of my money to go to Ryan Adams in the future,"" she said. ""I've tried to get a refund on the ticket [and] I've yet to hear anything back"" she added. Emma says she has been a fan of the musician for a long time. Due to the recent claims, though, she is now more wary of whom she chooses to support. ""In the current climate we live in now, I definitely think about who I want my hard-earned money to go to... and I do think the whole [music] industry needs to look at itself."" Ryan Adams tickets continue to be available on ticketing websites The BBC has approached three of the biggest ticketing websites in the UK to respond to whether or not fans will be given a refund. At the time of writing, none of them have replied. In an interview with Radio 4's You & Yours programme, New York Times European culture journalist Alex Marshall said there needed to be clarity on the issue from the music industry. Marshall said it was ""surprising"" that the companies involved in the tour have been silent since the allegations were published. ""I've tried to speak to the ticketing companies,"" he said. ""I've tried to speak to the venues and the promoter and I've had very little response back. ""That's leaving people in the dark about what's going on."" In cases where allegations have been made against an artist, consumers are not legally entitled to their money back. Ticket holders would only be entitled to a refund if the organiser cancels, moves or reschedules the event. Kate Hobson, Consumer Expert at Citizens Advice, said: ""Ticket holders who change their mind for whatever reason about going to see a concert have no legal right to a refund. ""They could try reselling their ticket, but they should first check the advice on reselling on theCitizens Advice website,external."" For the most part, artists and bands that have faced similar accusations have withdrawn plans to tour. In the case of Ryan Adams, Alex Marshall believes a delay in response as to whether the tour will go ahead as scheduled is down to many of the ticketing companies, venues and promoters who stand to lose money if the performances are cancelled. ""There seem to be some artists that believe they can keep going, no matter what's been said about them. ""But what you're hoping to see with the #MeToo movement is that people are raising these accusations, which will lead to a change in culture to make people aware of what's gone on in the past and what is deemed unacceptable."" Three music companies have already severed ties with the indie rock star. In astatement on social media,external, Adams said he was ""not a perfect man"" and had ""made many mistakes."" Yet he said the New York Times' article, which first raised the allegations, had painted an ""upsettingly inaccurate"" picture and that he ""would never have inappropriate interactions with someone I thought was underage.""

Huge fire on Saddleworth Moor,"This video can not be played The fire could be seen for miles around Fire crews have extinguished a huge blaze on moorland in West Yorkshire. The fire, described by one witness as ""apocalyptic"", started at about 19:30 GMT on Tuesday and covered about 1.5 sq km of land near Marsden. West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue said it was ""one of the biggest moorland fires we've ever had to deal with"". It came as the UK broke the record for the warmest winter day for a second time and on the same day as a gorse fire on Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh. Following a night spent tackling the blaze, near Saddleworth Moor between Huddersfield and Manchester, a fire service spokesperson said: ""The fire now looks to be out."" However, they said crews and specialist moorland firefighting units ""will remain at the scene for much of the day to tackle any further hot spots"". At its height, more than 35 firefighters were in attendance at the National Trust property and the A62 between Colne Valley and Diggle was closed as a precaution. Station manager Adam Greenwood said when crews arrived about 4 sq km of moorland was ablaze. ""It was one of the highest flame fronts we have seen, with flames of up to two metres high, and it was moving fast across the moorland,"" he said. ""The fire looks to be out however moorland fires can easily reignite so it's important that we monitor it closely. ""We expect to be at the moors for much of the day."" There have been no reports of any injuries. People living near to the scene have been advised to stay indoors and keep their doors and windows closed. But the fire service said ""risks to health are low"". BBC Yorkshire climate correspondent Paul Hudson said that, like much of the UK, the region had faced unseasonal winter temperatures. He said: ""These kind of temperatures, 18C or 19C, are what you would normally see in early June. ""There's been a prolonged abnormally warm spell and we've also had an exceptionally dry start to 2019. ""The temperature on Wednesday is also set to be pretty similar."" Pictures capture dramatic moorland fire Latest updates on moorland fire Why are there UK wildfires in February? Station commander Tony Pearson said moor fires in February were ""very unusual but not unheard of"". He said: ""We've had a few dry days and it's dried the land out a little bit."" He described the location as ""horrendous"" as it took firefighters an hour to get there due to the terrain. Mr Pearson said: ""It was really uneven ground, really difficult working conditions on there. Mike Elliot, from the National Trust, said the heather on the moorland had only just re-established itself after a blaze about three years ago. He said: ""It's gradually got back to its normal self, but unfortunately it's going to have to start again. ""What we're doing here is trying to stabilise the moorland with all the heather as that keeps all the peat out of the watercourse."" The Edinburgh gorse fire broke out at a similar time on Tuesday, andtwo large fires started within an hour of each otherin the Ashdown Forest in East Sussex earlier. In June and July last year, firefighters from 20 different brigades were drafted in to help tackle two huge moorland fires which burnt for several weeks. Firefighters spent more than a month battling a huge fire covering 18 sq km (6.9 sq miles) at Winter Hill, near Bolton. The Army was drafted in to help Greater Manchester crews deal with a blaze on Saddleworth Moor in Tameside. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Fat rat saved from tight spot by rescuers,"The unfortunate rat was almost - but not quite - small enough for its bolthole In the German town of Bensheim, rescue workers got an unusual call - a chubby rat needed help after getting stuck halfway out of a sewer manhole. ""She had a lot of winter flab and was stuck fast at her hip - there was no going forward or back,"" animal rescuer Michael Sehr told local media. A fairly large rescue operation ensued - leading some to question why all the effort was spent on saving a sewer rat. ""Even animals that are hated by many deserve respect,"" Mr Sehr responded. Volunteer firefighters reacted to a call on Sunday afternoon, the local fire department said, and noted the ""animal rescue, small animal"" code. Mr Sehr, from the local professional animal rescue in Rhein Neckar, was already there - but could not free the chunky rodent from the top of the manhole cover. It took about eight firefighters and an animal expert to put the sewer rat back where it belongs With the help of a full team of firefighters, the manhole cover was lifted and propped on wedges while Mr Sehr managed to pop the rotund rat free. She was released straight back into the sewer - but not before some close-up photographs were snapped. Men rescue 'dog' from ice, find wolf Is it time to stop hating the rat?

Pakistan vows response over India 'strikes',"This video can not be played Balakot: India launches air strike in Pakistan Pakistan says it will respond ""at the time and place of its choosing"" after India launched strikes against militants in Pakistani territory. India said it had killed a large number of militants but Pakistan called the claim ""reckless"". Tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours have been high following an attack on Indian troops in Kashmir. The attack was claimed by a group based in Pakistan, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), and India had vowed to retaliate. India accuses Pakistan of allowing militant groups to operate on its territory, something Pakistan denies. Viewpoint: India strikes in Pakistan a major escalation What is militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad? Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Both India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir, but control only parts of it. The two have fought three wars and a limited conflict since independence from Britain in 1947 - and all but one were over Kashmir. The strikes are the first launched across the line of control - the de facto border that divides India-administered Kashmir from Pakistan-administered Kashmir - since a war between the two countries in 1971. The two sides have given different versions of events. Indian officials said the strikes hit a camp in Balakot, in north-west Pakistan. Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale said a ""large number"" of militants were killed, defending the raids as a ""pre-emptive strike"" to stop further JeM attacks. This video can not be played India's foreign secretary said the air strikes hit a militant training camp Residents in Balakot told the BBC they were woken by loud explosions but there has been no confirmation of casualties. The Pakistani army denied there were any casualties. It said its jets forced Indian planes to withdraw and drop their ""payload"" in an sparsely inhabited area. Pakistan's Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said India had ""resorted to a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim"", pointing to elections due in India in May. A meeting of Pakistan's National Security Committee, which includes Prime Minister Imran Khan, ended with a warning Pakistan would ""respond at the time and place of its choosing"". There have been celebrations in Indian following news of the operation Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not directly mention the air strikes when he addressed a political rally in Rajasthan on Tuesday but he told crowds: ""I understand your enthusiasm and your energy. Today is a day we bow before our heroes."" Amid fears of escalation, the European Union urged ""maximum restraint"" from both sides, with China making a similar plea. Analysis by M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad The Indian air strikes that hit a target inside Pakistani territory have taken tensions to a dangerous level. In September 2016, an attack on an Indian army base in Uri created a similar situation when Delhi decided to respond with so-called ""surgical strikes"". India's claims that they airdropped special forces to destroy militant campson the Pakistani side of Kashmir were found to be largely exaggerated, but Indian troops did cross at several points along the Line of Control (LoC), inflicting some casualties on Pakistani forces. This time they have hit a target across the international border, inside Pakistani territory, at a location where a training camp of Kashmiri militants is known to have existed for several years. Pakistan's military has cordoned off the area and not even the local police are allowed in, so it will be some time before details of the attack become known. Also, Pakistani officials have been underplaying the severity of the incident by describing it as a strike ""across the LoC"", not one across the international border. Pakistan has vowed to respond but this may not go beyond diplomatic measures. However, as some observers point out, there may be punitive attacks by militants against Indian forces in Kashmir ""at an appropriate time"".

Trump in Vietnam for summit with Kim,"This video can not be played Mr Trump landed in Hanoi hours after Mr Kim arrived by car US President Donald Trump has arrived in Vietnam ahead of his second summit with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Air Force One landed at Hanoi's Noi Bai airport hours after Mr Kim reached the Vietnamese capital by train and car. The summit, which is due to take place on Wednesday and Thursday, follows a historic first round of talks in Singapore last year. The two leaders are expected to discuss progress towards ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons. Ceremonial guards had lined a red carpet laid out for Mr Kim as he arrived at Dong Dang border station on Tuesday morning. He was then driven to Hanoi, where heavy security and flag-waving crowds were waiting for him. This video can not be played Mr Kim arrived by train at the border station of Dong Dang Mr Kim is thought to be travelling with his sister Kim Yo-jong and one of his key negotiators, former General Kim Yong-chol, both familiar faces from the previous summit with Mr Trump. The journey from Pyongyang to Vietnam took more than two days and traversed about 4,000 km (2,485 miles). Had Mr Kim chosen to fly to Vietnam he would have got there in a matter of hours. As Mr Kim's train passed through China, roads were closed and train stations shut down.  Chinese social media was abuzz with road closures, traffic congestion and delayed trains. This video can not be played Kim Jong-un boards his train Vietnam's Dong Dang station was also closed to the public ahead of his arrival on Tuesday morning. He is now being driven around 170km (105mi) to Hanoi by car. It's little surprise that Mr Kim chose to take the train as this is how his grandfather, North Korea's first leader Kim ll-sung,  travelled when he went to Vietnam and Eastern Europe. That alone would have made it a highly symbolic move for the younger Mr Kim. Mr Kim's private green and yellow train has 21 bulletproof carriages and is luxurious, with plush pink leather sofas and conference rooms so the journey would not have been uncomfortable. Unlike the North Korean leader, Mr Trump travelled to Hanoi by plane. The presidential airliner Air Force One left Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, landing in the Vietnamese capital on Tuesday night local time. Details of their schedule are only just becoming clear. Mr Trump will meet Mr Kim for a brief one-on-one conversation on Wednesday evening and then they will have dinner together with their advisers, according to White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. On Thursday, the leaders will meet for a series of back-and-forth meetings. Why Kim will be looking closely at Vietnam What North Korea can learn from Vietnam's women Trump and Kim in Hanoi: Your need-to-know guide The Hanoi meeting is expected to build on the groundwork of what was achieved at the Singapore summit last June. That meeting produced a vaguely worded agreement, with both leaders agreeing to work towards denuclearisation - though it was never made clear what this would entail. Nothing concrete was produced as a result of the first Singapore summit However, little diplomatic progress was made following the summit. North Korea crisis in 300 words WATCH: 'I really miss our leader Kim' What was agreed at the first Trump-Kim summit? This time round, both leaders will be very conscious that expectations will be high for an outcome that demonstrates tangible signs of progress. However, Mr Trump appeared to be managing expectations ahead of the summit, saying he was in ""no rush"" to press for North Korea's denuclearisation. ""I don't want to rush anybody. I just don't want testing. As long as there's no testing, we're happy,"" he said. Washington had previously said that North Korea had to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons before there could be any sanctions relief. It's an ideal location for many reasons. It has diplomatic relations with both the US and North Korea, despite once having been enemies with the US - and could be used by the US as an example of two countries working together and setting aside their past grievances. Hanoi is all geared up for the upcoming summit Ideologically, both Vietnam and North Korea are communist countries - though Vietnam has rapidly developed since and become one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, all while the party there retains absolute power.

Making a Murderer case to be re-examined,"Steven Avery denies having committed the murder A US man whose murder conviction was the focus of the popular Netflix series Making a Murderer will have his case re-examined by a court in Wisconsin. Steven Avery is serving a life sentence for the murder of young freelance photographer Teresa Halbach in 2005. He says he is innocent. Avery has won a motion to appeal based on possible human bones found in a gravel pit. His lawyer says they were not tested for DNA and were given to the Halbach family, a violation of state law. Kathleen Zellner, who filed the motion, said the return of the bones meant that potentially crucial evidence in the case had been kept from further testing. Avery and his nephew Brendan Dassey were both sentenced to life in jail - in separate trials - for killing Ms Halbach, whose charred remains were found at Avery's car salvage yard a week after she went there to photograph a minivan for sale. If the bones - found near the Avery property - are found to belong to Ms Halbach, Ms Zellner says it undermines the prosecution's theory that she was killed on the Avery property. ""This evidence has the potential to undo the whole case, so it is a big win,"",externalshe told Newsweek magazine. Series leads to debate about convicted murderer ""The case is being remanded back to the circuit court to conduct proceedings, which can include a hearing. The circuit court can grant a new trial, or if not, back to appellate court who can reverse the conviction and/or grant a new trial."" Evidence related to the bones can now be submitted. On Twitter, Ms Zellner said:""We are going to have an extraordinary number of constitutional violations when we are done.,externalThe [court of appeals] is letting us create an avalanche of evidence in this record. Higher courts rule."" Making a Murderer cast doubt on the legal process used in the investigation and subsequent court cases. Avery previously served 18 years for another crime he did not commit.

Buhari re-elected as Nigerian president,"This video can not be played Supporters celebrate at Mr Buhari's campaign headquarters in Abuja Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has been re-elected for a second four-year term, the election commission says. The 76-year-old defeated his main rival, former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, with a margin of nearly four million votes. Mr Abubakar's People's Democratic Party (PDP) has rejected the result. Turnout was a record low at just 35.6%. Delays and violence marred the run-up to Saturday's poll but no independent observer has cited electoral fraud. ""The new administration will intensify its efforts in security, restructuring the economy and fighting corruption,"" Mr Buhari said after his victory was officially announced. Africa Live: Buhari tells supporters not to gloat Why Nigeria's 'generation democracy' didn't vote Is Africa going backwards on democracy? Overall, the APC got 15.2 million votes while the PDP received 11.3 million. Mr Buhari swept the north, while Mr Abubakar, 72, did better in the south and east. Full results by state Although turnout was low across the country, it was higher in the northern states - one factor behind Mr Buhari's victory. A former soldier, Mr Buhari led a military regime for 20 months in the 1980s and was first elected president in 2015, becoming the first opposition candidate to defeat an incumbent and win the presidency. Muhammadu Buhari was first elected president in 2015 (file photo) His record in office is mixed. Mr Buhari's critics say that the very attributes that won over voters four years ago - his strictness and inflexibility - have emerged as liabilities. They accuse him of autocratic leanings as well as a disastrous tendency towards inaction. Mr Buhari's supporters can argue that he has largely delivered on campaign pledges such as tackling corruption and cracking down on Boko Haram. But they may struggle to point to concrete achievements in other fields, such as fixing the economy. Read full profile ByFergal Keane, BBC Africa editor The breadth and depth of corruption is so great, it affects so many aspects of public life that making serious inroads into the problem would require a focus, energy and application that was lacking in President Buhari's first term. The second problem he faces in fighting corruption is having the necessary political support. There is undoubted public backing but Mr Buhari's party is compromised by senior members suspected of enriching themselves through graft. The fear is that across the board the looters will carry on pretty much as normal. Economically, ending the dependency on oil revenues needs to happen at a much faster pace. The World Bank has predicted sluggish economic growth: 2.2% for the coming year in a country with unemployment of more than 20% and nearly half the population living in extreme poverty President Buhari also faces an array of security threats from clashes between farmers and herdsmen in the Middle Belt, continuing instability in the oil-producing Niger Delta and - most worrying of all - a revived threat from Islamist extremists in the north of the country. Read more from Fergal Africa's most populous nation and largest economy faces a range of problems including power shortages, corruption, security threats, and an economic slowdown. Nigeria is Africa's leading oil producer but corruption and a failure to invest the proceeds from the industry have hampered development.

'I might have had her for a bit longer',"British teenager Shauna Davison was given an experimental transplant in 2012, in the hope of prolonging her life. Her mother says she was told in advance about two patients who had survived a similar operation - but not about others who had died. The BBC's Deborah Cohen asks whether Shauna, who died after two weeks, was a casualty of the rush to develop stem cell technology? Shauna Davison was born with one lung, a cleft palate and a major heart defect. But despite spending her life in and out of hospital she remained a happy child. ""Her illness never got her down and she always had a smile on her face,"" says Shauna's mother, Karen Davison. ""Everyone was so nice to her. They looked beyond her problems."" When she was 12 weeks old, doctors found problems with her trachea - or windpipe. It was very narrow and when it became obstructed, she couldn't breathe. She was given 48 hours to live. Karen Davison: ""She was a cheeky child but loved by everybody"" A surgeon in Leeds came to the rescue. David Crabbe warned that it might not work, but he managed to rebuild Shauna's windpipe out of her ribs. Shauna had to stay in hospital for six months and had ring-shaped stents put in her windpipe to keep it open. Mr Crabbe was really caring, Karen Davison says. ""The hospital was outstanding."" Over the years, Shauna's stents needed dilating as she grew bigger. She had a tracheostomy  - an opening in the front of her neck - to help her breathe. ""There were times we didn't think she'd make it because she kept collapsing,"" Karen Davison says. This story takes about 15 minutes to read You can also watch Deborah Cohen'sreport for Newsnight here,external At home in Middlesbrough, she learned how to change Shauna's tracheostomy tube, use a ventilator, do physiotherapy to help her clear her airway, suction her airway, do CPR, and give her intravenous antibiotics. ""I did everything for her,"" she says. ""Shauna coped marvellously. But she didn't know any different."" An avid Middlesbrough Football Club fan, Shauna loved wearing a football kit. She went to a mainstream school, with the support of a carer, where she could mix with other children. ""She was a cheeky child, but loved by everybody,"" her mother says. ""She brightened everyone's day."" Shauna had many operations but she'd always come through. At times, she didn't go near a hospital for ages, Karen says. A time came, however, when David Crabbe told her that his technique for treating Shauna was no longer going to be sufficient. Her airway was too small and they would have to look for other options. ""Mr Crabbe showed me pictures of a normal airway and her airway. It was tiny,"" Karen Davison says. Shauna started to go to Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London for tests and to have her stent changed. In 2011, doctors there told her the airway wouldn't last much longer. At 15, Shauna suffered a respiratory arrest - a serious incident in which she became unable to breathe - and the family was told about pioneering surgery by Prof Martin Elliott, a cardiothoracic surgeon and former medical director of Great Ormond Street Hospital. ""They said there'd been some research into tracheal transplants and there'd been two other cases where it'd been done, but they couldn't discuss them with me because of patient confidentiality,"" Karen Davison says. One of them was a 10-year-old boy, she adds. ""It would be the only chance she'd have."" Shauna's transplant wasn't a conventional one. She would receive a donor windpipe, but it would be laced with her own stem cells, making it almost like her own. She wouldn't need drugs to stop her body rejecting it. It was at the forefront of the new stem cell technology - and still very experimental. Doctors can use experimental treatments if someone is terminally ill and there is no alternative treatment. It's called ""compassionate use"". Karen says she was told Shauna wouldn't need a tracheostomy or a ventilator and she'd lead a normal life. But she was told about risks too, she adds - Shauna might still reject the transplant, and having a general anaesthetic is never risk-free. Martin Elliott had previously worked closely with the internationally renowned Martin Birchall, professor of ENT at University College London (UCL), on implanting a stem-cell-laced donor trachea in another child. They would work together again in Shauna's case. Shauna was being treated at Great Ormond Street at the time of a BBC documentary about the hospital in 2012. She was assessed by different specialists and asked what her hopes for the future were. Shauna told respiratory consultant Dr Martin Wallis she wanted to be able to go swimming. It was not an easy decision to have the operation. In Martin Wallis's words, it was not a situation where there was nothing to lose. ""They've got quite a bit to lose. And this is going to make for a difficult decision,"" he said. ""She's got a reasonable quality of life, she's got her good friend, she clearly has a sense of humour and is enjoying herself - it makes it harder."" ""I wanted her to have it done while she was well rather than wait until she was unwell and it might not happen,"" Karen Davison says. But because it was such an experimental procedure, her medical team discussed it with the Great Ormond Street Hospital ethics committee. ""I don't think she will die if we do the procedure. We're trying to do the procedure so that she doesn't. Or at least we prolong her life and her quality of life for as long as possible,"" the surgeon, Martin Elliott, tells the committee on camera. ""They couldn't give me a time when she'd die but they said she will die eventually. Because her airway would just give up. So there was this procedure they said they were willing to do,"" Karen Davison says. ""Like any other parent, if you thought this was going to help your child live, I agreed to it."" So in February 2012, Shauna was given a transplant of a donor trachea newly populated with her own stem cells. Shauna's transplant operation was filmed by the BBC Initially, everything seemed to go well. ""For the first couple of days she was marvellous,"" her mother recalls. ""I couldn't believe how well she recovered after it."" Two weeks after her operation Shauna was moved from Great Ormond Street by ambulance to a hospital in Leeds. But during the transfer Shauna started to cough a lot and was in need of suction to clear her throat. ""We thought that was strange, but thought it might have been due to the journey,"" Karen Davison says. ""I just thought, 'Another couple of weeks and we'll be home.'"" But the next morning, Shauna took a turn for the worse. ""Her chest was pulling in,"" Karen says. She remembers Shauna saying, ""Help me, help me."" ""It was the worst day of my life because I couldn't help her."" Shauna's new trachea had collapsed. ""They said she'd struggled that much to breathe, her heart had given up,"" Karen Davison says. ""She was a wonderful child. I miss her so much."" When the first transplant using a donated windpipe coated with the patient's own stem cells was carried out in 2008 it made global headlines. It was thought that stripping the donor's cells from the surface of the trachea and seeding it with the patient's own stem cells created a new organ that would be like the patient's own tissue. No anti-rejection drugs would be needed for the ""tissue-engineered"" trachea. The operation was carried out by Italian surgeon Paolo Macchiarini with the help of Martin Birchall, then a surgeon at Bristol University. The recipient was 30-year-old Claudia Castillo, who had tuberculosis in part of her windpipe that leads to the lungs - the bronchus. Her case was written up in The Lancet. Five months after she'd had her operation, she was reported to be in perfect health. Martin Birchall, who had helped to prepare the donor trachea, said at the time that it would ""represent a huge step change in surgery,external. Surgeons can now start to see and understand the potential for adult stem cells and tissue engineering to radically improve their ability to treat patients with serious diseases."" Many around the world agreed. It was a ""milestone in medicine,external"", ""unadulterated good news"" and ""a textbook example of international collaboration,external"". ""It was seen as revolutionary, as highly innovativeâ¦ opening the door for new and exciting tech using a marriage between stem cells and artificial scaffolds that could bring forth this entirely new field of regenerative medicine,"" recalls Prof John Rasko, of the University of Sydney Faculty of Health Sciences. It had ""the whiff of a Nobel Prize about it,"" he says. Indeed, soon the university that hands out the Nobel Prize for medicine, Stockholm's prestigious Karolinska Institute, offered Macchiarini a post. Birchall, for his part, moved to University College London (UCL), where Macchiarini was also made an honorary professor. Claudia Castillo's operation served as a template and soon others had similar procedures. In 2010, Professor Birchall told a conference ""we have done a further five adults"". Apart from Shauna, UK patients given a tissue-engineered trachea include 19-year-old Keziah Shorten and 10-year-old Ciaran Finn-Lynch. Shauna's surgeon, Martin Elliott, led the transplant team that performed Ciaran's operation, with the help of Macchiarini and Birchall. Like Claudia Castillo, his procedure was published in a medical journal and it garnered global headlines. Martin Birchall told journalists: ""He is left with a healthy organ there, made from his own stem cells, and that in a way is a kind of miracle."" But soon questions started to be asked about the stem-cell-laced tracheas. For Macchiarini, this meant his meteoric rise was mirrored by a rapid fall from grace. He had switched from using donated tracheas to plastic ones, also laced with stem cells. The results were disastrous - his patients died. Macchiarini was investigated several times by Karolinska before he was fired. Allegations made against him were initially dismissed but the institute has since found himguilty of scientific misconduct,externaland many of his scientific papers have been retracted. Swedish prosecutorsreopened a criminal negligence investigation,externalagainst him in December last year. He has previously denied any negligence. The director of the Swedish Public Prosecution, Mikael Bjork, announces the reopening of a criminal negligence investigation into Paolo Macchiarini in December 2018 Bo Risberg, professor emeritus of surgery at the University of Gothenberg and a former chairman of the Swedish Ethics Council has said the events amount to the biggest research scandal Sweden has experienced in modern times. ""Everything was swept under the carpet,"" he said. Macchiarini's failure to do pre-clinical tests on animals using the plastic tracheas was ""the worst crime you can commit"", he added. One of Macchiarini's early critics was Pierre Delaere, professor of ENT at University Hospital Leuven in Belgium, who has argued that it is ""impossible from a theoretical point of view"" to establish a new blood supply to a tissue-engineered trachea, whether plastic or donated. In 2015, he wrote to UCL casting doubt on the idea of ""tracheal regeneration"", calling it ""the biggest lie in medical history"". By this time Macchiarini had left UCL. Paolo Macchiarini operating In its subsequent unpublished report into Delaere's claims, seen by the BBC, UCL cast doubt on the suggestion that stem cells ""played any therapeutic role"" in Ciaran's operation. But, it said, there was no ""deliberate fraud"" or ""intent to mislead"" on Martin Birchall's part. Because of the ""lack of intent to deceive"" the university recommended education and training rather than other formal procedures. Meanwhile, the university was gearing up to conduct clinical trials into stem-cell-regenerated tracheas and larynxes - called Inspire and RegenVox respectively. Martin Birchall was principal investigator with responsibility for leading the trials. He and his team would bring in millions of pounds of research funding to the university. It wasn't the only time UCL produced a report into regenerative medicine at the university. In 2017, it published the findings of a special inquiry, set up after the Macchiarini revelations. This found no fault with Martin Birchall and cleared the way for future clinical trials to proceed. It said that, when asked, Shauna's family ""were grateful for the opportunity that her daughter received and held no rancour with the tracheal team at GOSH"". UCL told the BBC this was ""reported to the inquiry by the clinicians involved in the care of Shauna Davison"". But Shauna's mother, Karen Davison, says no-one connected to the inquiry had ever asked for her views. The more I have looked into Shauna Davison's story the more I have discovered that Karen Davison did not know. The two patients Karen and Shauna heard about were the 10-year-old boy, Ciaran Finn-Lynch, and Claudia Castillo, both of whom are still alive. But they weren't told that Claudia Castillo's windpipe transplant collapsed just over three weeks after she'd had it and she needed stents to keep it open. (She's since had to have a lung removed.) Nor did Karen and Shauna hear about most of the other cases Martin Birchall talked about in 2010. One of these operations was on Kent teenager Keziah Shorten, who about two years previously had been given a tissue-engineered donor trachea by Macchiarini in Florence, after she had been diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. But around a year after the operation, her transplant failed. Martin Birchall told a Swedish documentary in 2016 that her tissue-engineered windpipe had broken down. When she was subsequently operated on at University College London Hospital they replaced it with a plastic one. She died a month before Shauna's operation. According to John Rasko there is a ""strong obligation to give a full and frank account of all the information that's available. Exceptionalism and excluding bad cases is really something that is not acceptable."" A spokesperson for GOSH said: ""As a patient, Keziah's condition and her graft were very different to Shauna, so it was not clinically relevant to discuss her case."" The hospital added that the other patients were not discussed ""because the team did not know of other relevant cases from overseas at this time"". There was more that Karen and Shauna did not know. They did hear about Ciaran Finn-Lynch. But there were key differences between Shauna's operation and his. Ciaran had received a stent - but Shauna didn't. According to the 2017 UCL inquiry report, Martin Elliott said that he had wanted to use a stent but was advised not to. Ciaran had also received a fresh donor trachea. Shauna's wasn't fresh. It had been frozen and then thawed. It was a treatment that hadn't been used before - after the trachea had been thawed, the donor's cells had been removed using a special vacuum technique exclusive to members of Shauna's medical team. Martin Birchall is cited as saying that Shauna's initial surgery was successful, in a letter to the European Medicines Agency Trish Murray, professor of stem cell biology and regenerative medicine at Liverpool University, has a number of criticisms. ""The reality is that if you don't have a stent, the trachea will collapse, that's been the unanimous experience of all patients who've experienced trachea transplantation,"" she says. ""So although it's well-known that stents cause problems, if you don't have a stent, then the trachea will collapse and the patient will suffocate."" Another issue was the frozen trachea. For the team it made perfect sense to freeze a trachea, as the trachea could be stored up in advance and thawed when needed. But Trish Murray is critical of this decision too. ""Ciaran's trachea was not frozen beforehand whereas Shauna's was freeze-thawed and we know from papers that the group themselves have published that that would weaken the trachea... and that would make it more likely to collapse after it had been implanted,"" she says. However, UCL questions the relevance of these studies. It has told the BBC that they do not refer to the technique used on Shauna. Trish Murray says other worrying studies should have rung alarm bells. She points to an unpublished study looking at the vacuum technique, which shows that one pig that received a transplant died spontaneously and another developed ""respiratory compromise"" and had to be put down. The study was stopped on humane grounds. ""We know from information that's been obtained from FOI requests that the team in UCL have tried the technique on two pigs and both pigs died quite quickly. We also know that they've tried it on rabbits and there was 100% mortality in the rabbits as well,"" she says. The BBC asked UCL and Great Ormond Street whether the animal studies were done before or after Shauna's operation, but received no reply to this question. And like Belgian ENT professor Pierre Delaere, Trish Murray questions the role the stem cells played. ""There's actually no evidence that any of those cells survive, in fact quite a lot of evidence that they don't survive,"" she says. But how were doctors and scientists involved in the care of seriously ill patients able to use these tracheas when there was little evidence that they worked? Usually, researchers have to test their innovation in the lab and then on animals in preclinical research. Only then - with formal approval from a research ethics committee and the regulators - does it move into humans. Martin Birchall, however, wrote in the Lancet that ""compassionate studies"", the procedure for using new treatments on very ill patients, were ""powerful ways to inform robustly designed formal trials"" and would ""expedite the testing of novel therapies"". ""The surgeons involved have used this apparent loophole of compassionate use to actually experiment on patients and then they've used the data that they've obtained to go to the regulatory authorities to get permission for the trials,"" Trish Murray says. John Rasko agrees with Trish Murray that this is not how the system should work. ""Exercising the option of compassionate use brings with it great responsibility. It shouldn't be used as a way that doctors can fly under the radar of properly undertaken regulated medical practice,"" he says. And Great Ormond Street agrees too. ""We do not see compassionate use as a way of testing novel treatments,"" a spokesperson said. But Shauna's transplant, and those of other patients, were used to obtain funding and approval for clinical trials, as well as being written about in medical journals and an application to the European Medicines Agency. The BBC has found that at least seven of these documents and publications misrepresent Shauna's treatment or death in some way. For example, in one 2016 application to the European Medicines Agency, Martin Birchall is cited as saying Shauna's initial surgery was successful but she suffered a ""fatal cardiovascular event six weeks following surgery"" - whereas in fact she died after two weeks, because her trachea had collapsed. By the time the clinical trial to test the tissue-engineered trachea transplants was approved and funded by public bodies, a change had been made to the procedure. Having learned from what happened to Shauna, the team would make sure patients in the trial had a stent. And even then, the approved patient information sheets accompanying one of the trials contained erroneous information about Shauna and indeed about Claudia Castillo. Only they and Ciaran Finn-Lynch were included in the information sheet - despite the team knowing about at least 10 cases worldwide. As early as 2014, Martin Elliott had told a conference 10 patients had received a tissue-engineered trachea, all of whom had died apart from Claudia and Ciaran. Last year, the clinical trials were suspended. UCL says no-one had been recruited to participate. Much of what the BBC has uncovered about what happened to Shauna does not appear in UCL's special inquiry report. Leonid Schneider is a molecular-cell-biologist-turned-journalist who has been covering regenerative medicine since 2016. He was called to give evidence at UCL's inquiry and is damning in his appraisal of their report. ""Why didn't Shauna's mother have the full information? And whose idea it was not to give her a stent?"" he asks. ""Finally, how could UCL investigators recommend the donor trachea clinical trials to resume, after Prof Delaere and myself told them how many people have died of it?"" he adds. UCL says that clinical care was ""beyond the scope of the inquiry"". It adds: ""Any research undertaken at UCL is required to conform to the highest legal, ethical and regulatory standards, and we will not hesitate to take the necessary action, if and when this falls short."" After receiving ethical advice, I told Karen what the BBC had found out about tissue-engineered transplants. She was upset. She said this might have changed her decision about allowing Shauna's operation to go ahead. This video can not be played 'I hope nobody else has to go through what Iâve gone through' ""I hope that nobody else has to go through what I've gone through, I really do. They should be stopped. That is such a shock. People ask me, 'How did Shauna die?' And I always say, heart attack. I've never once blamed those surgeons for her death. They have a lot to account for."" GOSH said: ""Before Shauna's operation was carried out a comprehensive review was conducted of all the relevant published scientific and medical evidence."" They also said: ""We are sorry the treatment did not work for Shauna and the family feel they did not receive all relevant information. We are contacting Shauna's family to offer to meet them to talk through any concerns."" ""It's taken them all this time, but you'd think they would have phoned me and said something to me,"" says Karen Davison. ""I know I wouldn't have had her forever, but at least I might have had her for a bit longer.""

'I drove my sister to pub bombs death',"Maxine Hambleton, 18, was killed while handing out party invitations in one of the pubs The brother of a Birmingham pub bombings victim felt he had ""driven my sister to her death"" by giving her a lift to the city on the night she died. Brian Hambleton, whose sister Maxine was among 21 killed in the 1974 blasts, recalled his final memory of her as inquests into the atrocity resumed. His was one of a number of emotional ""pen portrait"" tributes read at the outset of the new hearings. Family members said the dead were ""cruelly robbed"" of their lives. Two bombs ripped through the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on 21 November, killing 21 and injuring 220. Twenty-one people died when two bombs were detonated in Birmingham in 1974 Mr Hambleton told the hearing at Birmingham Civil Justice Centre he had driven 18-year-old Maxine into the city in return for her ironing his shirt. He said: ""I will always remember her closing the car door and walking away from me, waving at me. My joyful, carefree, upbeat, talented sister I would never see again."" ""I had literally driven my sister to her death,"" he said. Jurors also heard one of the victims, Michael Beasley, gave away a ""lucky charm"" to the wife of the Mulberry Bush's landlord that night. Ten people died in the first blast at the Mulberry Bush, below the Rotunda building ""He told her he'd found a lucky Cornish pixie charm on the bus on the way to town that night and gave the charm to her,"" said Peter Skelton QC, for the coroner. ""Mary kept the charm and always carried it with her."" Latest news from the West Midlands The inquest heard statements about 16 victims on Tuesday, including: Neil 'Tommy' Marsh, aged 16, the youngest victim of the bombing. His cousin, Danielle Fairweather-Tipping, said he ""died as a child"", days before his 17th birthday Neil's friend, 17-year-old Paul Davies. His daughter Michelle Sealey and son Paul Bridgewater paid tribute to their reggae-loving father who ""loved martial arts and Bruce Lee"" Punchcard operator Lynn Bennett, who met up with fellow victim Stephen Whalley after the pair made contact through the NME's lonely hearts column Motor factory worker James Craig, known as Jimmy, whose family was originally from Northern Ireland. ""His only interest was playing football,"" his brother Bill Craig said John Rowlands, who served in the Second World War with the Fleet Air Arm, was an electrician in peacetime and a ""bit of a card and a joker"", his son Paul said Trevor Thrupp, a 33-year-old father and a railway guard, had an ""infectious"" laugh and was the ""life and soul of the party"", son Paul said Stanley Bodman, who was described by son Paul as ""larger-than-life"" character. A father-of-three and an electrician, Mr Bodman had served with the RAF in wartime James Caddick, 56, who was a porter at the nearby Birmingham markets and was drinking with friends in the Mulberry Bush the night of the bombings John Clifford Jones, known as Cliff, whose son George described the post office worker as ""modest and unassuming"" Charles Gray, 44, a toffee factory worker who was said to be a ""mild-mannered and agreeable"" man Pamela Palmer, whose sister Pauline Curzon said ""her companionship and kindness is a memory I treasure"" Maureen Roberts, 20, who was said to have striking auburn hair, ""the colour of gold"", who was ""happy-go-lucky"" with a great sense of humour Marilyn Nash, 22, who worked at Miss Selfridge and often went for a drink in the Tavern in the Town after work The remaining statements are due to be heard on Wednesday.

Capital and Heart cull local radio showsMore than 100 jobs are thought to be at risk with the changes to breakfast and drivetime programming.,"Vick Hope and Roman Kemp present Capital breakfast in London, while until recently Jamie Theakston co-hosted Heart breakfast with Emma Bunton Global media has announced it will launch UK-wide national breakfast shows on Capital, Heart and Smooth radio. Global say they will be creating the three largest commercial radio breakfast shows in the UK, with 4.8m, 3.7m and 2.7m listeners respectively each week. But it means a reduction in locally produced programmes, with more than 100 jobs at risk due to the changes. Ofcom has approved the move following achange in guidelines,externalfor local radio. Capital will launch their network breakfast show first in April, with Heart and Smooth following later in the year. Capital London's breakfast show will replace 14 breakfast programmes on the Capital network in England, Scotland and Wales Capital will have nine drivetime shows (including London, Liverpool, North East and Yorkshire) instead of the current 14 Heart will have a single breakfast show across England, Scotland and Wales instead of the current line-up of 22 breakfast shows Heart will carry 10 drivetime shows instead of the current 23 separate drivetime shows Smooth will create a new national breakfast show replacing breakfast programmes in East Midlands, West Midlands, North West, Lake District, North East, Scotland and Wales Smooth's drivetime programmes will be reduced to seven Global says local news and travel information ""will continue to air on a local licence level as per legislation requirements"". But it said its news teams would see ""refreshed structures"" along with engineering and marketing. Analysis by Radio Today,externalsaid that 95 local radio presenters could lose their jobs as a result of the changes. The changes will also mean the closure of broadcast facilities. The sites earmarked for closure are Brighton, Cambridge, Chelmsford, Exeter, Gloucester, Kendal, Kent, Lancaster, Norwich and Swindon. Global's revamp is likely to be replicated at its biggest commercial rival, Bauer, which owns stations like Kiss, Absolute and Magic. The companies have been given the go-ahead by broadcasting regulator Ofcom, which relaxed its rules on how and where stations make their programmes last October. Stations still need to apply to change their formats, and Ofcom haspublished,externala number of approved format changes for Global Radio stations across the UK. Ashley Tabor, Global's founder, told staff the news at a meeting on Tuesday and said it ""would mean change"". Yet he also said ""the ability to lead the commercial radio sector's next huge step, and to properly compete with BBC Radio 1 and 2 at breakfast time"" was ""a huge opportunity"". Meanwhile, Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson - who is also the shadow culture secretary - said the announcement was a ""terrible blow"". He added: ""The loss of more than 100 local radio jobs across the country is a travesty and particularly damaging at a time when local news is already under extreme pressure. ""Replacing local voices with London-based presenters will be a terrible loss to communities across the country.""

Two bombs ripped through the Mulberry Bush and Tavern in the Town pubs on 21 November, killing 21 and injuring 220. Twenty-one people died when two bombs were detonated in Birmingham in 1974 Mr Hambleton told the hearing at Birmingham Civil Justice Centre he had driven 18-year-old Maxine into the city in return for her ironing his shirt. He said: ""I will always remember her closing the car door and walking away from me, waving at me. My joyful, carefree, upbeat, talented sister I would never see again."" ""I had literally driven my sister to her death,"" he said. Jurors also heard one of the victims, Michael Beasley, gave away a ""lucky charm"" to the wife of the Mulberry Bush's landlord that night. Ten people died in the first blast at the Mulberry Bush, below the Rotunda building ""He told her he'd found a lucky Cornish pixie charm on the bus on the way to town that night and gave the charm to her,"" said Peter Skelton QC, for the coroner. ""Mary kept the charm and always carried it with her."" Latest news from the West Midlands The inquest heard statements about 16 victims on Tuesday, including: Neil 'Tommy' Marsh, aged 16, the youngest victim of the bombing. His cousin, Danielle Fairweather-Tipping, said he ""died as a child"", days before his 17th birthday Neil's friend, 17-year-old Paul Davies. His daughter Michelle Sealey and son Paul Bridgewater paid tribute to their reggae-loving father who ""loved martial arts and Bruce Lee"" Punchcard operator Lynn Bennett, who met up with fellow victim Stephen Whalley after the pair made contact through the NME's lonely hearts column Motor factory worker James Craig, known as Jimmy, whose family was originally from Northern Ireland.

Emma Thompson takes Time's Up stand,"Thompson suggested any change Lasseter displayed would be ""an act"" Emma Thompson has revealed she quit an animated project because the company making it had hired John Lasseter. Lasseter was recruited to head Skydance Animation following his departure from Pixar in the wake of claims he sexually harassed female colleagues. In a letter, Thompson questioned the studio ""hiring someone with Mr Lasseter's pattern of misconduct"". The actress had been due to voice a character in Luck, a comedy about how luck affects our daily lives. BBC News has contacted Skydance to request a comment. Animation chief Lasseter to leave Disney ""If a man has been touching women inappropriately for decades, why would a woman want to work for him if the only reason he's not touching them inappropriately now is that it says in his contract that he must behave 'professionally'?"" Thompson wrotein a letter published by the Los Angeles Times,external. Thompson then referenced past allegations made against Lasseter and questioned whether the respect he shows to his new female colleagues would be ""anything other than an act he's required to perform"". ""The message seems to be, 'I'm learning to feel respect for women so please be patient while I work on it, It's not easy',"" she added. Melissa Silverstein, founder of Women and Hollywood which campaigns for gender equality and inclusion, said Thompson's decision to leave Luck was ""one of the most significant moments in the [#MeToo] movement.

When Lasseter's hiring was first announced in early January, Skydance's CEO David Ellison sent an internal memo to staff. It said,externalhe had conducted an independent investigation into the accusations and was ""confident"" that his mistakes had been recognised. Thompson officially withdrew from Luck a few weeks later. Towards the end of her letter, the British actress said she regretted exiting the project because the film's director, Alessandro Carloni, was ""incredibly creative"". ""But I can only do what feels right during these difficult times of transition and collective consciousness raising,"" she continued. Thompson concluded that if people like herself did not ""take this sort of stand, things are very unlikely to change."" This video can not be played Emma Thompson: ""This man is at the top of a very particular iceberg"" In the wake of the #MeToo movement, the actress has been vocal about the harassment she has faced in the industry. Speaking to BBC Newsnightin 2017, she called disgraced mogul Harvey Weinstein a ""predator"" and said allegations made against him were ""the tip of the iceberg"". Weinstein is currently facing criminal charges on five counts of sexual abuse, charges he denies. The producer has denied any allegations of non-consensual sex.

Rail franchise model 'cannot continue',"The rail timetable overhaul was billed as the biggest in the UK Britain's rail franchise system no longer delivers clear benefits and cannot continue as it is, says the man leading a review of the network. Keith Williams said in a speech to industry leaders that firms are not adapting to changing consumer demands. Rail franchising - contracting out passenger services - has drawn heavy criticism, with some contracts failing and customer complaints rising. The rail industry said it accepts that the status quo cannot continue. Mr Williams was appointed by the government last year,externalto lead a ""root-and-branch"" review of the rail network. Speaking in London, he said: ""I have heard a great deal about the franchising modelâ¦ driving growth in passengers and benefits to services. But with this growth, the needs of passengers have changed, whilst many of the basic elements of our rail system have not kept pace. ""Put bluntly, franchising cannot continue the way it is today. It is no longer delivering clear benefits for either taxpayers or farepayers."" The current ""one-size-fits-all"" approach to franchising does not work for every part of the country and every passenger, he said in the annual Bradshaw Address, named in honour of George Bradshaw, who developed the Bradshaw's Guide to the railways. However, the former British Airways chief executive, who is now deputy chairman of John Lewis, acknowledged that ""there's real hunger for change within the industry as well as outside"". Train firms want overhaul of ticket system Thousands of trains axed due to lack of staff 'Broken' rail system to be reviewed The Rail Review was set up to recommend the most appropriate organisational and commercial framework for the network. The government will publish a White Paper in the autumn based on the review's recommendations, with the implementation of reforms planned to start from 2020. Last year's timetable fiasco, failed franchises and delays caused by strikes have put the spotlight firmly on the UK's ailing rail network. Punctuality across Britain sank to a 13-year low in 2018, with one in seven trains delayed by at least five minutes as a series of major issues plagued the railway. Mr Williams said: ""I see our role not just to tackle those recent problems that passengers have experienced, but also to tackle the more fundamental underlying causes of those problems."" Passenger groups welcomed Mr Williams' comments. Independent watchdog Transport Focus said: ""At the halfway point of his root-and-branch review, Keith Williams is right to acknowledge that the rail industry has lost sight of its passengers and must put their needs and experience at the heart of what it delivers. ""Having consulted Transport Focus promptly, he also knows that our research shows that passengers want to know someone is in overall charge of the railway and answers for the quality of services. Overcrowding is now a daily experience for millions of travellers ""Passengers will judge the success of the Rail Review on how far it meets their priorities for improvement: more punctual and reliable services, more chance of getting a seat or standing in comfort and better value for money."" The Rail Delivery Group (RDG), which represents train operators and Network Rail, accepted that there was a need ""for big and lasting change"". RDG chief executive Paul Plummer said: ""As we've long argued, maintaining the status quo on the railway is not an option."" Last week, the RDG published proposals to change the fares and ticketing system, suggestions that it has fed into the Williams Review. The majority of rail services in Britain are operated by fixed-term franchises, which involve the Department for Transport (DfT) setting out a specification covering areas such as service levels, upgrades and performance. Train companies then submit bids to run the franchise and the DfT selects one of the applicants. A report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) in April last year claimed the DfT's management of the Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) and Virgin Trains East Coast franchises was ""completely inadequate"". The GTR network was marred by an ""appalling level of delays and cancellations"" while the department ""failed to learn the lessons from previous failings"" on the East Coast route, according to the committee. PAC chairwoman Meg Hillier said at the time that passengers are paying the price for the ""broken model"" of rail franchising.

UK beats winter temperature record again,"Dorset in February: A surfer gets ready to catch some morning waves at Boscombe beach The UK has broken the record for its warmest winter day for the second consecutive day, with a temperature of 21.2Â°C in Kew Gardens, London. Monday was the first time temperatures of over 20C had been reported in winter, breaking a record that had stood since 1998. It means parts of Britain have been hotter than destinations such as Ibiza. Last February, temperatures in the UK plunged as low as -11.7C at South Farnborough, Hampshire. Temperatures broke the previous day's record of 20.6C in two other places, the Met Office said. Porthmadog in north-west Wales hit 20.8C while temperatures of 20.7C were reported in Teddington, south-west London. In Scotland, the temperature reached 18.3C on 21 February in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, breaking a record of  17.9C which had stood for more than 120 years. In Northern Ireland, temperatures reached 15.6C in Castlederg, County Tyrone. The February record of 17.8C was recorded in 1998. Signs of spring from around England Hedgehogs to swimsuits: How a warm winter affects us all Meanwhile, firefighters have warned the warm weather could lead to a greater risk of outdoor fires. The warning, from East Sussex Fire Service, came aftertwo large fires broke out in Ashdown Forest- the East Sussex forest made famous by AA Milne's Winnie the Pooh novels. The BBC Weather Centre said it was likely to be one of the warmest Februaries since records began in 1878. Sunny, warm conditions are expected to last into Wednesday, when maximum temperatures at Kew Gardens and Porthmadog are forecast to be slightly cooler at 19C and 17C respectively. On Thursday, a high pressure system is expected to break down as wetter, windier weather moves in across Wales and into England. Dr Friedericke Otto, acting director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University, said people were right to ask themselves whether the record temperatures were being driven by climate change. ""I am very confident to say that there's an element of climate change in these warm temperatures,"" she said. ""But climate change alone is not causing it. You have to have the right weather systems too."" BBC science editor David Shukman said scientists such as those at the Met Office were usually reluctant to link individual heatwaves, storms or floods directly to climate change without a specific study to prove it. But he said research had shown that events like last summer's heatwave were made more likely by the rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

The unusually high temperatures have promptedhedgehogs to come out of hibernation, butterflies to emerge and migrating birds such as swallows and house martins to arrive more than a month early. The RSPB said birds, insects and other wildlife could face ""a real crisis"" if the weather turns colder, as forecasts predict. Trees such as field maples and European larches have also been budding early, according to the Woodland Trust. The sea near Dungeness, Kent, sparkled in the sunshine as a sailing boat went by The scene at Brighton beach on Monday afternoon Inverleith Park in Edinburgh was bathed in light in the early morning The warm weather is in stark contrast to February 2018, when the so-called ""Beast from the East"" brought freezing temperatures and heavy snow, with 21cm recorded at Copley, Durham, on the last day of the month. Then, high pressure moving north into Scandinavia drew cold air towards the UK from Siberia. This week's conditions come instead from the tropical Atlantic and parts of north Africa.

No-deal Brexit impact assessment published,"The government has published its assessment of the impact of a no-deal Brexit on business and trade. The report,externalsaid ""some food prices are likely to increase"" and customs checks could cost business Â£13bn a year in a no-deal scenario. It also said there was ""little evidence that businesses are preparing in earnest"". But the government said it had undertaken ""significant action"" to prepare for no deal on 29 March. It comes as the PM has promised MPs votes on delaying Brexit or ruling out no deal, if her deal is rejected again. Theresa May's Brexit deal was comprehensively rejected by MPs on 15 January and she has said they will get a second chance to vote on it - possibly with some changes - by 12 March. The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 29 March - with or without a deal. May offers MPs Brexit delay vote Brexit will make UK worse off, government warns Pound rises amid Brexit delay speculation The government's report, which was drawn up for the cabinet, said: ""One of the most visible ways in which the UK would be affected by delays in goods crossing the Channel is our food supply, 30% of which comes from the EU."" Possible disruption to cross-Channel trade ""would lead to reduced availability and choice of products"", the document said. ""This would not lead to an overall shortage of food in the UK, and less than one in 10 food items would be directly affected by any delays across the short Channel crossings. ""However, at the time of year we will be leaving the EU, the UK is particularly reliant on the short Channel crossings for fresh fruit and vegetables. ""In the absence of other action from government, some food prices are likely to increase, and there is a risk that consumer behaviour could exacerbate, or create, shortages in this scenario. ""As of February 2019, many businesses in the food supply industry are unprepared for a no-deal scenario."" It repeated analysis suggesting a no-deal scenario could leave the UK economy 6.3% to 9% smaller after 15 years, compared to what it would have been. It said the worst-hit areas economically in a no-deal scenario would be Wales (-8.1%), Scotland (-8.0%), Northern Ireland (-9.1%) and the north east (-10.5%). The document said slightly more than two-thirds of the government's most critical preparation projects - and fewer than 85% overall - were ""on track"" for completion in time for 29 March. It also warned that a no-deal Brexit would ""affect the viability of many businesses across Northern Ireland"", and saidsome businesses could relocate to the Republic of Ireland. The publication of the document follows a proposed amendment last month from former Conservative MP Anna Soubry and backed by ex-Labour MP Chuka Umunna - who are both now members of the newly-formed Independent Group. In the Commons, Ms Soubry told MPs that the document was only a summary and she asked for access to the papers ""which actually go into the detail"", which she was shown in privy council terms (confidential terms). ""It's the detail that actually fully explains the impact of a no-deal Brexit, leaving the Brexit Secretary to comment that it would be 'ruinous' for this country,"" she said. Deputy speaker Lindsay Hoyle said he was ""sorry"" that Ms Soubry felt she had been ""slightly short-changed on what would be available"". ""I would expect ministers to take on board your request and hopefully... you will pursue it other than on this point of order,"" he said. And Mr Umunna said the report painted ""a disastrous picture of the catastrophe which would befall our country if there is a no-deal Brexit"". ""In light of what she knows, it is utterly irresponsible for the Prime Minister to keep a no-deal Brexit on the table given the extreme damage it will do,"" he said. ""These papers set out how food prices will rise, we may see panic buying, there will be severe disruption at the border, and jobs and livelihoods would immediately be put at risk. ""Today she told the House of Commons she is listening, but MPs have passed a motion rejecting a no-deal Brexit and yet she refuses to request an extension of the Article 50 process in order to stop no-deal happening."" Please upgrade your browser Ms Soubry's amendment instructed the government to publish within seven days ""the most recent official briefing document relating to business and trade on the implications of a no-deal Brexit presented to cabinet"". It drew the backing of some mostly Remain-supporting Labour and Conservative backbenchers. But Ms Soubry withdrew the amendment after Brexit Minister Chris Heaton-Harris indicated that Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington would meet her and would be publishing the relevant information.

Facebook bans Tommy Robinson's page,"Facebook has taken down anti-Islamic activist Tommy Robinson's official page and Instagram profile for violating its policies on hate speech. The former English Defence League leader was deemed to have been engaged in ""organised hate"". A number of posts on his page had violated the social network's community standards, Facebook saidin a blogpost.,external It said that it had not taken the decision to remove his page lightly but added he would not be allowed back. ""When ideas and opinions cross the line and amount to hate speech that may create an environment of intimidation and exclusion for certain groups in society - in some cases with potentially dangerous offline implications - we take action,"" Facebook said in a post. ""Tommy Robinson's Facebook page has repeatedly broken these standards, posting material that uses dehumanising language and calls for violence targeted at Muslims. ""He has also behaved in ways that violate our policies around organised hate."" The ban means that Tommy Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, will not be allowed to set up an official Facebook page or Instagram profile in future. According to Facebook, a written warning had been sent to Mr Robinson last month about a number of posts on his page that had violated its community standards, including: a post calling Muslims ""filthy scum bags"" a post urging people to terrorise and behead those who follow the Koran a post urging people to ""make war"" on Muslims multiple videos depicting individuals being bullied In January, YouTube suspended adverts on Mr Robinson's account, saying he had broken the site's advertising rules. At the time, Mr Robinson denied they contained any ""hateful"" content and said he was the victim of censorship. In November, PayPal said it would no longer process payments for Mr Robinson. In May, Mr Robinson, 35, was jailed for contempt of court. The 13-month sentence sparked a series of #freetommy protests. The conviction was later quashed after procedural concerns. The case has now been referred to the attorney general. In March 2018, Mr Robinson was banned from Twitter.

Sticker cheapskates fall foul of Man Utd,"Alex and Sian Pratchett began by drawing every player in the 2014 World Cup Manchester United has ordered a couple who make their own ""terrible"" football stickers to stop selling ""wonky drawings"" of the team's ex-players. Alex and Sian Pratchett, known as the Panini Cheapskates, have won a loyal fanbase with their crude imitations of the playground collectables. Premier League side Man Utd contacted the Pratchetts over the use of its trademarks such as its Red Devil badge. The Oxford couple's stickers have now been withdrawn from sale. A Manchester United spokesman said the stickers had infringed the club's ""intellectual property rights"". On Twitter, the couple wrote: ""Sad times. Man Utd got in touch and made us stop selling our wonky drawings of their ex-players. If you've ordered one, we'll be in touch. ""Though on the plus side, learned a lot about EU trademark directives this morning."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Baby among migrants crossing Channel,"Border Force vessels were involved in the operations to bring migrants ashore over the last three days A boat carrying 13 migrants including a baby has been found in the English Channel off the Kent coast. The 10 adults and three children were given medical checks and transferred to immigration officials for interview, the Home Office said. News of their arrival in Dover was revealed by Kent's chief constable during a select-committee appearance. He said some migrants were now calling police from their boats, confident they would be allowed to stay in the UK. ""They want to be found and helped,"" chief constable Alan Pughsley told MPs. The latest group of migrants, who according to the Home Office said they were from Iraq and Iran, were intercepted on their small boat by Border Force after staff were alerted by French officials at about 03:00 GMT. Two more boats containing migrants were brought into Dover harbour on Monday More than 30 people, mainly from Iraq, have arrived on the Kent coast since Saturday, taking the overall total since 3 November to more than 350. At the Home Affairs Select Committee, Steve Rodhouse, director-general of operations at the National Crime Agency, told MPs there had been a ""significant"" change in approach from migrants looking to get into the UK. He said: ""Typically, in the past, if people had been using what we call general maritime, they would be doing so in a clandestine fashion. ""What we see... today is markedly different because the business model is essentially for the migrants to reach the point where they can engage with UK authorities, whether that be on land or at sea, and claim asylum at that point."" Mr Rodhouse said on average they were paying Â£5,000 to ""facilitators"", adding: ""People are actively seeking being caught or engaging with UK authorities because rightly or wrongly, they don't fear being returned. ""That, I think, is something that is a significant player in the issue here. I know that Home Office colleagues... will say there have been a number of returns.""

Yemen prisoner 'no spy' says Welsh family,"Luke Symons - now known as Jamal - on his wedding day in Yemen A grandfather has spoken of his anger and anguish over the plight of his grandson - imprisoned without charge in war-torn Yemen for nearly two years. Robert Cummings said his family feel let down by the UK government over its failure to secure the release of Luke Symons. The 26-year-old from Cardiff was seized as a suspected spy in 2017. Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said it was a ""very distressing case"" after his local MP brought his plight to light. Born and bred in south Wales, Luke converted to Islam in his late teens - taking the name Jamal. Aged 20, he made a pilgrimage to Mecca before travelling to Egypt and then Yemen, where he taught English and married. This video can not be played Luke tells family in Cardiff he is refusing to eat until he is released When conflict broke out in 2015, the couple left the country but could not return to the UK because Luke's wife, Tagreed, had lost her passport amid the chaos. They returned to Yemen and had a baby though continued to explore ways of escaping the bloodycivil war that has claimed thousands of lives. Luke with his baby son Hoode However two years ago, as he presented his British passport to withdraw money to fund his family's passage out of Yemen, Luke was arrested as a suspected spy. His family in Cardiff were told by Luke's friend he had been taken to a political prison and has been badly beaten. ""He said Luke will come under a death sentence if they find him guilty of spying, which we thought ridiculous at that time,"" re-called Robert, 69. Mum reunited with daughter after 34 years The Muslim women gaining confidence ""Luke wasn't a spy, he couldn't even spy in Cardiff - never mind anywhere else - but that's what they were going to charge him with."" His mother, Jane Lawrence, has felt powerless. She said: ""As a mum you want to get on that plane and do something - but you can't. ""You're in limbo. You don't sleep at night. Every time you close your eyes you see them doing bad things to him. It's terrible."" At least 6,800 civilians have been killed and 10,700 injured in the civil war in Yemen, according to the UN The family told the Foreign Office and South Wales Police about Luke's plight but said the only information they have has come from the local Yemeni community in Cardiff. ""They [officials] would come here to have meetings with us and we've gone to London - what for?"" said Jane. ""Luke is still in the same predicament he was when all this started."" The Foreign and Commonwealth Office would only confirm it has provided advice to the UK-based family of a British national detained in Yemen since 2017 and continue to do so. Mr Brennan brought the case to light in the Commons on Tuesday The family's case has been taken up by local MP, Kevin Brennan, who raised Luke's plight on the floor of the House of Commons on Tuesday. Speaking ahead of that intervention, Mr Brennan said: ""We don't know, for sure, the Foreign Office's workings are around this.  I understand that, they are in a war zone. Family flees Islamophobic abuse A Muslim policemen in Wales ""But it is frustrating that Mr Cummings feels he's had more assistance from the local Yemeni community in Cardiff than from the Government itself."" Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt responded in the Commons: ""We continue to have contact with Luke's family. We aren't able to offer consular assistance in Yemen. We appreciate that he was in Yemen before the conflict broke and we'll continue to exert every effort we can to try and find a way to get him home."" Luke's mother Jane said the uncertainty of his whereabouts is ""breaking"" the family Luke's family understands an investigation in Yemen has now cleared Luke of spying and before Christmas their hopes were raised further when release papers were signed. Last month Robert and Luke were even able to talk by phone, the first time anyone had spoken to Luke for two years. However he remains behind bars. ""We want him home. Whether we can do it, or the Yemeni community or the British Government - they've got to take action now. ""There's no reason for him to be in that prison.""

Indian strikes target militants in Pakistan,"Some Indians took to the streets, burning an effigy of Pakistan, after news of the air strikes broke India says it launched air strikes against militants in Pakistani territory, in a major escalation of tensions between the two countries. The government said strikes targeted a training camp of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) group in Balakot. Pakistan said its jets had forced back the Indian planes and denied there were any casualties. Relations between the countries were strained by a militant attack on Indian troops in Kashmir earlier this month. India accuses Pakistan of allowing militant groups to operate on its territory and says Pakistani security agencies played a role in the suicide attack on 14 February, which was claimed by JeM and killed 40 Indian troops. Pakistan denies any role and says it does not provide safe haven to militants. Viewpoint: India strikes in Pakistan a major escalation What is militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad? Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Balakot is in Pakistan's north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Residents there told BBC Urdu they were woken by loud explosions. Pakistan condemned the strike and said it would respond ""at the time and place of its choosing"". The strikes are the first launched across the line of control - the de facto border that divides India-administered Kashmir from Pakistan-administered Kashmir - since a war between the two countries in 1971. Both India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir, but control only parts of it. The nuclear-armed nations have fought three wars and a limited conflict since independence from Britain in 1947 - and all but one were over Kashmir. Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale told a news conference,externalthat the strikes had killed a ""large number"" of militants, including commanders, and had avoided civilian casualties. ""Credible intel [intelligence] was received that JeM was planning more suicide attacks in India. In the face of imminent danger, a pre-emptive strike became absolutely necessary,"" he said. This video can not be played India's foreign secretary said the air strikes hit a militant training camp Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not directly mention the air strikes when he addressed a political rally in Rajasthan later on Tuesday but he told cheering crowds: ""I understand your enthusiasm and your energy. Today is a day we bow before our heroes."" India is due to hold elections by the end of May. In Srinagar city, in Indian-administered Kashmir, residents expressed concerns over the spike in tensions. ""Whatever is happening between these two hostile neighbours, it's us who are in the middle of this war theatre,"" Shabir Aakhoon, a banker, said. Local reporter Sameer Yasir says a heavy military build-up in the past three days has caused panic. Anticipating full-scale war, civilians have stockpiled food and crowded petrol pumps, triggering traffic jams in many places, he adds. Pakistan's army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor said the strikes caused no casualties. He tweeted that Pakistani jets were scrambled and forced the Indian planes to make a ""hasty withdrawal"", dropping their payload in an open area. Allow Twitter content?

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan later convened an urgent meeting of national security chiefs and condemned ""irresponsible Indian policy"". ""Once again [the] Indian government has resorted to a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim,"" a statement issued after the meeting said. ""This action has been done for domestic consumption, being in an election environment, putting regional peace and stability at grave risk."" After Kashmir attack, what are Modi's options? Mr Khan has summoned a special meeting of the National Command Authority (NCA) - the body that oversees Pakistan's nuclear arsenal - to take place on Wednesday, officials said. Analysis by M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad The Indian air strikes that hit a target inside Pakistani territory have taken tensions to a dangerous level. In September 2016, an attack on an Indian army base in Uri created a similar situation when Delhi decided to respond with so-called ""surgical strikes"". India's claims that they airdropped special forces to destroy militant campson the Pakistani side of Kashmir were found to be largely exaggerated, but Indian troops did cross at several points along the Line of Control (LoC), inflicting some casualties on Pakistani forces. This time they have hit a target across the international border, inside Pakistani territory, at a location where a training camp of Kashmiri militants is known to have existed for several years. Pakistan's military has cordoned off the area and not even the local police are allowed in, so it will be some time before details of the attack become known. Also, Pakistani officials have been underplaying the severity of the incident by describing it as a strike ""across the LoC"", not one across the international border. Pakistan has vowed to respond but this may not go beyond diplomatic measures. However, as some observers point out, there may be punitive attacks by militants against Indian forces in Kashmir ""at an appropriate time"".

Soldier's mother claims son 'murdered',"Pte Geoff Gray was found with two gunshot wounds to his head The family of a 17-year-old soldier found shot dead at Deepcut barracks have made fresh claims they believe he was murdered. Pte Geoff Gray's mother also voiced doubts a second inquest due to begin in Surrey would bring any answers. Diane Gray said witnesses asked for by the family would not appear. Four young soldiers died at Deepcut between 1995 and 2002. Pte Gray was found with two gunshot wounds to his head in 2001. A first inquest in 2002 into the death of the soldier from Seaham, County Durham, who lived in Hackney, London, from the age of five, ended with an open verdict. A new hearing is taking place at Woking Coroner's Court after the family won the right to apply for a new hearing, arguing fresh evidence had come to light. Second inquests held into the deaths of Pte Cheryl James and Pte Sean Benton concluded they had killed themselves, after hearing evidence of bullying and a lack of care at the barracks. Mrs Gray, who has viewed material from Surrey Police disclosed to the family, said she had been left shocked by what she had been shown, but was unable to talk about it under a legal order. At a pre-inquest review last year, Judge Coroner Peter Rook QC heard the issue facing the second inquest was""simply who pulled the trigger"". Four young soldiers died at Deepcut barracks between 1995 and 2002 Mrs Gray said the family had wanted former senior Surrey Police detective Colin Sutton to give evidence afterhe told ITV he ""felt pressured to conclude the soldier deaths were suicides"",external. But she said: ""The coroner doesn't deem it necessary."" Mrs Gray added: ""There is no evidence at all of Geoff being bullied. ""We believe he was murdered, that somebody else killed him."" Pte Sean Benton's death was suicide Army recruit Pte Cheryl James shot herself The malevolent culture at Deepcut Mrs Gray added that she was not looking forward to the inquest, but said: ""We have no choice. We have had no choice from the very beginning. ""It's something we have to do. We owe it to our son to find out how he died."" The inquest, which is being held without a jury, is due to hear from 60 witnesses before final submissions are made in May. Fellow trainee 'could have shot soldier' Who were the Deepcut four?

Ratings rise for host-less Oscars,"Lady Gaga with her best song Oscar for A Star Is Born's Shallow Ratings for this year's Academy Awards were up on last year's record low, according to data released by US broadcaster ABC. The broadcast averaged 29.6 million viewers - an 11% increase on last year's audience of 26.5 million. Instead of using a host, the Academy had celebrities - among them Daniel Craig, Julia Roberts and Dame Helen Mirren - announce each category. But don't get used to it, as a host may be back for next year's ceremony. Oscars draw smallest US TV audience Rob Mills, ABC's senior vice president said that while the show ""works when it's host-less... a host will be in the conversation for next year"". ""Imagine what would have happened if Envelopegate had happened this year and we didn't have a host?"" he toldVariety.,external Mills was referring to the moment when La La Land was accidentally named best picture instead of Moonlight in 2017. ""It's hard to imagine that moment now without Jimmy, who was able to rein in the chaos"" he added. Truth behind 'Envelopegate' emerges While Hollywood's stars delight in their victories and nurse their after-party hangovers, here's a final round-up of this year's event. Following their sizzling duet of Shallow during Sunday's telecast, Gaga has praised her A Star Is Born co-star and director Bradley Cooper as an ""artistic genius"". The pop star, who won best original song for Shallow, posted a picture of the pair on Instagram celebrating their moment on stage together. Allow Instagram content?

Thompson criticises Lasseter hiring,"Thompson suggested any change Lasseter displayed would be ""an act"" Emma Thompson has revealed she quit an animated project because the company making it had hired John Lasseter. Lasseter was recruited to head Skydance Animation following his departure from Pixar in the wake of claims he sexually harassed female colleagues. In a letter, Thompson questioned the studio ""hiring someone with Mr Lasseter's pattern of misconduct"". The actress had been due to voice a character in Luck, a comedy about how luck affects our daily lives. BBC News has contacted Skydance to request a comment. Animation chief Lasseter to leave Disney ""If a man has been touching women inappropriately for decades, why would a woman want to work for him if the only reason he's not touching them inappropriately now is that it says in his contract that he must behave 'professionally'?"" Thompson wrotein a letter published by the Los Angeles Times,external. Thompson then referenced past allegations made against Lasseter and questioned whether the respect he shows to his new female colleagues would be ""anything other than an act he's required to perform"". ""The message seems to be, 'I'm learning to feel respect for women so please be patient while I work on it, It's not easy',"" she added. Melissa Silverstein, founder of Women and Hollywood which campaigns for gender equality and inclusion, said Thompson's decision to leave Luck was ""one of the most significant moments in the [#MeToo] movement.

When Lasseter's hiring was first announced in early January, Skydance's CEO David Ellison sent an internal memo to staff. It said,externalhe had conducted an independent investigation into the accusations and was ""confident"" that his mistakes had been recognised. Thompson officially withdrew from Luck a few weeks later. Towards the end of her letter, the British actress said she regretted exiting the project because the film's director, Alessandro Carloni, was ""incredibly creative"". ""But I can only do what feels right during these difficult times of transition and collective consciousness raising,"" she continued. Thompson concluded that if people like herself did not ""take this sort of stand, things are very unlikely to change.""

Referendum on May deal - Labour,"If Theresa May's Brexit deal gets through Parliament, Labour wants it to be put to a referendum - with remaining in the EU as the other option. Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer confirmed the party's new policy in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said Labour would attempt to get its own Brexit proposals through Parliament on Wednesday. But if that failed then the party would back another referendum, he added. Kuenssberg: What does Labour's change of policy mean? Labour move to back new Brexit referendum Which Brexit amendments will be tabled? ""We specifically agreed yesterday (Monday), as the Labour Party, that if the prime minister's deal gets through, that deal should be subject to the lock, if you like, of a public vote in the way that Jeremy (Corbyn) spelled out yesterday,"" he told Today. Sir Keir rejected claims from anonymous Labour sources who had briefed that shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry ""misspoke"" when she set out the party's position on the referendum. Asked if advisers to Mr Corbyn did not agree with the position, Sir Keir said he ""didn't know who said what"" but Ms Thornberry had been ""setting out what the position is we agreed as the Labour Party"". Labour will seek backing for its own Brexit proposals, which include a ""comprehensive customs union"" with the EU and ""close alignment"" with the single market in a Commons vote on Wednesday. This video can not be played The BBC's Jonathan Blake explains the impact Jeremy Corbyn's move could have The House of Commons last monthrejected Labour's proposals by 39 votes- and Conservative MPs will again be whipped to vote against it, reducing its chances of success. At the same time, 30 or more Labour MPs are thought to be against another EU referendum, making it potentially difficult for that to get a Commons majority too. Labour MP John Mann said the move would be ""catastrophic to Labour in the Midlands and the north"". The Bassetlaw MP, who voted to leave the EU, told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""Voters won't have it. The last person to renege on their manifesto was Nick Clegg, it didn't end very well for him on tuition fees. ""Our manifesto was unambiguous, we would accept the result of the referendum. A second referendum doesn't do that and the voters - in very, very large numbers - will not accept that."" Stoke Central MP Gareth Snell suggested Sir Keir Starmer had engineered the shift in Labour's stance, which he said was ""disappointing"" because he had thought the shadow Brexit secretary had been listening to the concerns of Labour MPs in Leave-voting areas. Asked about a potential Labour rebellion on a second referendum, Sir Keir said: ""I'm well aware of different views across my own party and across Parliament on pretty well all Brexit issues."" If Labour did not get MPs to back its own Brexit proposals on Wednesday, Sir Keir said: ""We, the Labour Party will either put down ourselves, or support an amendment, in favour of a public vote"". The precise wording of the question on the ballot paper would have to be decided by Parliament, he told the Today programme. But he said the referendum choice should be between a ""credible leave deal"", that ""has the confidence of Parliament"", and staying in the EU, which he would support. Sir Keir said Labour would also support a cross-party amendment, proposed by Labour's Yvette Cooper and Tory MP Sir Oliver Letwin, designed to rule out the prospect of a no-deal exit by delaying Brexit day. Mr Corbyn had resisted pressure from Remain-supporters in his own party to get behind another referendum, insisting he preferred to force a general election, even after he failed in a bid to unseat the PM in a confidence vote last month. But on Monday, Mr Corbyn announced a change of heart, telling his MPs: ""One way or another, we will do everything in our power to prevent no deal and oppose a damaging Tory Brexit based on Theresa May's overwhelmingly rejected deal. This video can not be played Emily Thornberry: 'We need the people to break Brexit log jam' ""That's why, in line with our conference policy, we are committed to also putting forward or supporting an amendment in favour of a public vote to prevent a damaging Tory Brexit being forced on the country."" Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell said the prime minister had pushed MPs ""so near the edge"" that Labour had little room for manoeuvre. If the party could not get its Brexit proposals through Parliament, then ""we have to fall back on going back to people - not what we wanted but that's the only last sanction we've got,"" he told reporters on Tuesday morning. He said Labour had abided by its 2017 election manifesto to respect the referendum result, but that the party had also agreed at its party conference in September conference to block ""no deal"" or a ""reckless deal"". ""If Parliament backs another option and it's not our deal, that's the one that will have to go before the people - and people will have chance to vote for that or remain,"" he said. He said it would be ""difficult"" for Labour MPs who were against a second referendum, but added: ""We think we can hold the vote together."" Eight Labour MPs quit the party last week, partly in protest at its refusal to get behind another referendum. Chuka Umunna, a leading member of the new Independent Group of MPs, said Labour's new stance was ""better late than never"". ""It's welcome that the party seems to have moved in the right direction,"" he told BBC Two's Newsnight. ""It's a shame it took the departure of eight Labour MPs to help nudge it over the line."" The UK voted to leave the EU in a referendum in June 2016, but the withdrawal deal Mrs May negotiated with the EU has to be agreed by MPs - and it suffered a huge defeat by them last month. Mrs May has ruled out a ""meaningful vote"" on her Brexit deal this week - saying one would be held by 12 March - but she is giving MPs the chance on Wednesday to have their say on how the next steps for Brexit. By BBC Political Correspondent Iain Watson I asked the Labour leader's spokesman that very question twice last night. He said a lot of things in his answers, but he didn't say ""yes"". And this is why. First, it's not yet clear what form this commitment to a referendum will take. What would constitute a ""credible leave option""? Sir Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry are clear -  if Theresa May's deal passes through Parliament, then that is the ""leave option"" and it should be put to a referendum. Labour, under these circumstances, would campaign to Remain. But sources close to the Labour leader say a ""credible leave option"" could also be the party's plan for a customs union - and in a subsequent ""public vote"" Labour MPs would be expected to back this Brexit plan over Remain. Any definitive decision will be taken further down the line, close to the ""meaningful vote"" on Mrs May's deal. Second, there is a question over whether a referendum in any form would get through Parliament. Don't forget, not only Jeremy Corbyn himself but some of his shadow cabinet have never been keen on the idea. Estimates of how many Labour MPs from Leave-voting areas would rebel against a ""public vote"" vary. But I am told the working assumption in the  Labour leader's office is that - as things stand - there would be enough to defeat it. Support for a referendum could grow if 29 March approaches and there is still no deal with the EU. That's why the Labour policy shift is seen as important by People's Vote campaigners. But just because the Labour leadership are now formally moving to back the referendum option doesn't mean it will actually happen.

Reality Check: Delaying Brexit,"The European Union (EU) has accepted the UK's request for a Brexit delay until 31 January 2020, with an option to leave sooner if a deal is approved by Parliament. Delaying the UK's exit date requires an extension to Article 50, the part of the Lisbon Treaty that sets out what happens when a country decides it wants to leave the EU. Article 50 allows an initial two-year period for negotiations on the terms of exiting. It was triggered by then Prime Minister Theresa May on 29 March 2017, giving an exit date of 29 March 2019. But this date was extended twice, first to 12 April and then until 31 October, after Mrs May's deal was rejected in successive votes in the House of Commons. Now it is being extended for a third time - so how does this process work? The UK cannot make a decision about extending Article 50 on its own - it has to send a request to the 27 other EU countries. All 27 have to agree in order to secure an extension. On Saturday 19 October, Mr Johnson sent a letter, as he was compelled to by alaw known as the Benn Act. The law stated he must send an extension request should he fail to get a Brexit deal through the House of Commons by the end of 19 October. Mr Johnson also sent a second letter saying he believed that a ""further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners"". Nevertheless, on 28 October the EU agreed to the extension proposed in his first letter. The EU was not obliged to say yes. Once it received the UK's delay request, in the form of a letter, the 27 leaders consulted with each other on their decision. It was then made following a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels. If EU leaders had decided to offer a longer extension they would have been likely to have met in person to set conditions of the extension. It's worth pointing out that Article 50 can also be revoked - effectively cancelling Brexit. The UK can in theory do that without consulting anyone else. That would mean that Brexit would not happen and the UK would remain in the EU on the same terms it has now. The Liberal Democrats are the only party to say that would they would revoke Article 50 without a referendum if they won a majority in a general election. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that a revocation should be ""unequivocal and unconditional"", suggesting that the ECJ would take a dim view of any attempt to withdraw an Article 50 notification and then resubmit it again a short time later.

M&S and Ocado in home delivery deal talks,"Marks & Spencer (M&S) and Ocado have confirmed they are in discussions about a Â£1.8bn joint venture. If the two companies reach agreement, it would give M&S a food delivery service for the first time. Ocado is best known for delivering Waitrose goods, with whom it pioneered online grocery deliveries 20 years ago. However, their latest arrangement, which prevents Ocado delivering any other retailer's own branded goods, is due to come to end next year. M&S has the most limited range of groceries of any of the leading food retailers and has held well back from the move to online delivery. Retail analyst Natalie Berg from NBK Retail said such a new deal would mean the end of the current one. ""It's safe to assume that any deal with M&S will require Ocado to dissolve its long-standing relationship with Waitrose."" Online behemoth Amazon is making inroads into the UK grocery market and Ms Berg said this had sparked a defensive scramble among retailers. ""The prospect of Amazon shaking up the grocery sector and transforming the way we shop is creating some strange bedfellows. ""But this move is a win-win for both parties. I think most would welcome M&S and its expertise in high-quality, prepared foods. This will be important for Ocado as they look to cater to the 'for tonight' shopping mission, having just announced plans for one-hour delivery."" Marks & Spencer food and clothing hit Ocado losses widen but sales grow M&S has a far more limited range of groceries than its main rivals, something that would make online shopping with them exclusively, even if available, less attractive. But Ms Berg said a tie-up would bolt Ocado's wider range on to M&S's:  ""M&S would never be able to do online grocery on its own because the average transaction size is too small. Most customers don't do a full, weekly shop at M&S, the economics just don't stack up. Teaming up with Ocado would allow M&S to fill gaps in their food range and finally offer home delivery to customers."" Vincent Lee, retail analyst at Bernstein Reserch, said Marks and Spencer would effectively be ""buying Ocado's customers"" and the company's food delivery technology - allowing them to increase their market share. He added that the M&S food business had been struggling, so it was clear that they needed a delivery business. The latest figures from M&S showed food sales fell 2.1%. M&S said there was no certainty the discussions would lead to a tie-up. Currently Ocado has a deal to deliver Waitrose-branded goods and also delivers its own Ocado-branded products. In addition, it has a delivery deal with Morrisons, although this is done under the Yorkshire-based supermarket's own brand. The food retailing landscape is a complex one. Morrisons also sells its products through Amazon, and after pioneering online delivery with Ocado, Waitrose also delivers its own products under its own-branded vans. Ocado, founded by three Goldman Sachs bankers, has recently undertaken a number of new international deals, striking licensing deals with retailers in Sweden, the US and Canada. Shares in M&S were up 3% on the news while Ocado was up 10%.

Brexit delay from May not all 'simples',"This video can not be played Aleksandr the Meerkat gets a surprise mention in the Brexit debate when the prime minister uses his catchphrase. What just happened? ""Simples"", the prime minister said (yes, actually seeming to quote a meerkat from a TV advert, welcome to 2019 everyone). But, if you are finding it not quite so ""simples"" to work out what's changed in Westminster today, I don't blame you. Something has changed and, at the same time, not that much has. No 10 believed that they were going to lose a vote in the Commons on Wednesday on a plan put forward by Labour's Yvette Cooper. Under that plan, the government would have been forced to put the brakes on Brexit if their compromise deal with the EU was rejected again by Parliament next month. And, on top of that, it would have given MPs more say over what happens next, designed with the specific aim of giving Parliament a breathing space to pursue consensus for a softer Brexit - a closer relationship with the EU than the PM has agreed. May offers MPs Brexit delay vote Put May's deal to public vote - Labour Pound rises amid Brexit delay speculation Add to that pressure, a fair number of ministers were willing to resign if Theresa May didn't say, ""OK, if the choice is leaving without a deal, or delaying, I'll delay"". Remember, that's a question that she has avoided for months and months and months, because she regards the promise to leave as planned on 29 March as a solemn one she made to the electorate. And also, because she believed that being willing to walk away without a deal has been an important element of her negotiating stance. As the law stands too, the default is that we leave, whatever happens. But if MPs were going to force her to rule out leaving on time without a deal by trying to change the law, the choice for the prime minister this week was: let the Commons inflict the defeat tomorrow or at least take the decision herself and try to stay in control of events. One cabinet source disappointed with the decision described it as an ""unhappy, but maybe necessary"" choice. What the Cabinet has therefore agreed to do - with one of those threatening to resign saying ""it does the trick for now"" - is set out a real showdown in the middle of next month. By 12 March - probably on 12 March, depending what goes on with the negotiations in Brussels - MPs will have another chance to vote on the PM's deal with the EU. Remember, last month it was kicked out with a thumping defeat. If the government loses that vote again, the next day, MPs will vote explicitly on whether we should leave the EU without a formal deal or not. The overwhelming expectation is that MPs collectively would say no to departure without a deal. If they did reject that idea, there would be another vote on 14 March. This time it would be on whether or not to extend the process for a short time - to delay Brexit for another couple of months while the government keeps trying to untangle the mess. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""An extension cannot take no deal off the table."" This is not the same as the prime minister saying that she wants to delay Brexit. She is still insisting that she wants her deal to go through, stick to the timetable and leave at the end of March. But it is, after many months of promising that we'd leave as planned, the first time she has had to acknowledge it might run very late. And because Parliament would almost inevitably reject leaving without a deal at the end of March, it changes the choice for MPs in the next fortnight. No 10 has tried to make the case that MPs will have to choose between the PM's deal, or no deal. Now it's a choice between her deal, no deal, or delay. Her move today does not change the law and make it impossible for us to leave without a deal at any point. There's also a really fundamental question about what an extension would actually achieve, when the government, the EU and MPs have been staring at the same set of problems for more than two years and haven't found a happy solution. The government won't say today what choice they would recommend at the end of March, or what they would do at the end of that extension - leaving with no formal arrangement in place at that point is still a possibility. But today's move does definitely mean one thing -  it is now extremely unlikely that we will leave at the end of March without a deal, that much at least is ""simples"".

"UK breaks winter temperature record againThe Met Office records 20.8C in Wales, making the UK warmer than holiday destinations such as Ibiza.","Dorset in February: A surfer gets ready to catch some morning waves at Boscombe beach The UK has broken the record for its warmest winter day for the second consecutive day, with a temperature of 21.2Â°C in Kew Gardens, London. Monday was the first time temperatures of over 20C had been reported in winter, breaking a record that had stood since 1998. It means parts of Britain have been hotter than destinations such as Ibiza. Last February, temperatures in the UK plunged as low as -11.7C at South Farnborough, Hampshire. Temperatures broke the previous day's record of 20.6C in two other places, the Met Office said. Porthmadog in north-west Wales hit 20.8C while temperatures of 20.7C were reported in Teddington, south-west London. In Scotland, the temperature reached 18.3C on 21 February in Aboyne, Aberdeenshire, breaking a record of  17.9C which had stood for more than 120 years. In Northern Ireland, temperatures reached 15.6C in Castlederg, County Tyrone. The February record of 17.8C was recorded in 1998. Signs of spring from around England Hedgehogs to swimsuits: How a warm winter affects us all Meanwhile, firefighters have warned the warm weather could lead to a greater risk of outdoor fires. The warning, from East Sussex Fire Service, came aftertwo large fires broke out in Ashdown Forest- the East Sussex forest made famous by AA Milne's Winnie the Pooh novels. The BBC Weather Centre said it was likely to be one of the warmest Februaries since records began in 1878. Sunny, warm conditions are expected to last into Wednesday, when maximum temperatures at Kew Gardens and Porthmadog are forecast to be slightly cooler at 19C and 17C respectively. On Thursday, a high pressure system is expected to break down as wetter, windier weather moves in across Wales and into England. Dr Friedericke Otto, acting director of the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University, said people were right to ask themselves whether the record temperatures were being driven by climate change. ""I am very confident to say that there's an element of climate change in these warm temperatures,"" she said. ""But climate change alone is not causing it. You have to have the right weather systems too."" BBC science editor David Shukman said scientists such as those at the Met Office were usually reluctant to link individual heatwaves, storms or floods directly to climate change without a specific study to prove it. But he said research had shown that events like last summer's heatwave were made more likely by the rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Family plea for Yemen prisoner,"Luke Symons - now known as Jamal - on his wedding day in Yemen A grandfather has spoken of his anger and anguish over the plight of his grandson - imprisoned without charge in war-torn Yemen for nearly two years. Robert Cummings said his family feel let down by the UK government over its failure to secure the release of Luke Symons. The 26-year-old from Cardiff was seized as a suspected spy in 2017. Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said it was a ""very distressing case"" after his local MP brought his plight to light. Born and bred in south Wales, Luke converted to Islam in his late teens - taking the name Jamal. Aged 20, he made a pilgrimage to Mecca before travelling to Egypt and then Yemen, where he taught English and married. This video can not be played Luke tells family in Cardiff he is refusing to eat until he is released When conflict broke out in 2015, the couple left the country but could not return to the UK because Luke's wife, Tagreed, had lost her passport amid the chaos. They returned to Yemen and had a baby though continued to explore ways of escaping the bloodycivil war that has claimed thousands of lives. Luke with his baby son Hoode However two years ago, as he presented his British passport to withdraw money to fund his family's passage out of Yemen, Luke was arrested as a suspected spy. His family in Cardiff were told by Luke's friend he had been taken to a political prison and has been badly beaten. ""He said Luke will come under a death sentence if they find him guilty of spying, which we thought ridiculous at that time,"" re-called Robert, 69. Mum reunited with daughter after 34 years The Muslim women gaining confidence ""Luke wasn't a spy, he couldn't even spy in Cardiff - never mind anywhere else - but that's what they were going to charge him with."" His mother, Jane Lawrence, has felt powerless. She said: ""As a mum you want to get on that plane and do something - but you can't. ""You're in limbo. You don't sleep at night. Every time you close your eyes you see them doing bad things to him. It's terrible."" At least 6,800 civilians have been killed and 10,700 injured in the civil war in Yemen, according to the UN The family told the Foreign Office and South Wales Police about Luke's plight but said the only information they have has come from the local Yemeni community in Cardiff. ""They [officials] would come here to have meetings with us and we've gone to London - what for?"" said Jane. ""Luke is still in the same predicament he was when all this started."" The Foreign and Commonwealth Office would only confirm it has provided advice to the UK-based family of a British national detained in Yemen since 2017 and continue to do so. Mr Brennan brought the case to light in the Commons on Tuesday The family's case has been taken up by local MP, Kevin Brennan, who raised Luke's plight on the floor of the House of Commons on Tuesday. Speaking ahead of that intervention, Mr Brennan said: ""We don't know, for sure, the Foreign Office's workings are around this.  I understand that, they are in a war zone. Family flees Islamophobic abuse A Muslim policemen in Wales ""But it is frustrating that Mr Cummings feels he's had more assistance from the local Yemeni community in Cardiff than from the Government itself."" Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt responded in the Commons: ""We continue to have contact with Luke's family. We aren't able to offer consular assistance in Yemen. We appreciate that he was in Yemen before the conflict broke and we'll continue to exert every effort we can to try and find a way to get him home."" Luke's mother Jane said the uncertainty of his whereabouts is ""breaking"" the family Luke's family understands an investigation in Yemen has now cleared Luke of spying and before Christmas their hopes were raised further when release papers were signed. Last month Robert and Luke were even able to talk by phone, the first time anyone had spoken to Luke for two years. However he remains behind bars. ""We want him home. Whether we can do it, or the Yemeni community or the British Government - they've got to take action now. ""There's no reason for him to be in that prison.""

"Children 'failed in first 1,000 days'","Families in England need more support in the early years to give children the best start in life, MPs say. The Health and Social Care Committee said the first 1,000 days were critical, but not enough was done. It warned cuts to children's centres, health visiting and services to support parents had left families vulnerable. Nearly a third of children are not ""school ready""by the time they reach five, because they have not developed the necessary skills and behaviours. The cross-party group wants the government to pay for extra contact with health visitors beyond the age of two-and-a-half. The MPs pointed to the approach taken elsewhere in the UK - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all fund more than the minimum of five visits provided in England. Improving child mental health 'years off' Children 'deserve better' healthcare Wales, in particular, was praised for its Flying Start programme which provides intensive support for the most disadvantaged families. But the MPs also said there needed to be better support to tackle problems such as substance misuse, mental health problems and domestic abuse among parents. Adverse experiences in childhood have been shown to increase the chances of poor health and development in later life. The report wants a cross-government strategy to be developed to herald an early years ""revolution"", including more support for families pre-birth. Councils, working with NHS and voluntary sector, could then be put in charge of implementing this strategy. But it also acknowledged ""massive investment"" was needed to boost services. Dr Paul Williams, who led the inquiry for the committee, said: ""Quite simply I want this country to be the most supportive and caring place in the world that a child could be born into."" Councillor Ian Hudspeth, of the Local Government Association, said councils have been undermined by cuts to their budgets. ""Councils have pulled out all the stops to try to prioritise early years and intervention services, but can only do so much."" A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care said children's health was a ""key priority"", pointing out investment in mental health services for new mothers was already increasing. She said more plans for the early years would be set out soon in the government's forthcoming green paper on prevention.

Vandals decapitate 800-year-old 'crusader',"The crusader's head was ""severed from his body and taken away"" An 800-year-old ""crusader"" from a crypt in a Dublin church has been decapitated by vandals. Archdeacon David Pierpoint said the crusader's head had been ""severed from his body and taken away"". The discovery was made as a tour guide was preparing to open the church for visitors on Monday afternoon. Archdeacon Pierpoint said he was upset and disappointed that the church had been targeted again by vandals. The crypt of St Michan's was vandalised in 1996. Archdeacon Pierpoint told RTÃ the incident was devastating for the parish and community. He said initially he was ""quite disgusted"" when he saw what had happened, but now he was ""just sad"". ""It's a sad day for the church and a sad day for humanity that someone would do such a thing."" Crusaders fought in a series of religious wars known as the Crusades which were sanctioned by the Church in the medieval period. The most commonly known of the crusades were campaigns in the eastern Mediterranean aimed at recovering the Holy Land from Muslim rule. There were seven major crusades as well as many less significant ones. The discovery was made as a tour guide was preparing to open the church for visitors on Monday Tours of the site are being cancelled for the foreseeable future. Last year about 27,000 people visited the church. In a statement, the Church of Ireland said the crypt had been badly damaged and several of the mummies, including the 400-year-old remains of a nun, had been desecrated in the incident. The crusader's body was turned over and his head was removed. Archdeacon Pierpoint said a solid steel internal gate was also taken but the immediate concern was securing the vaults. There are also concerns the remains will disintegrate in the open air as the conditions in the crypt keep them preserved. GardaÃ­ (Irish police) are examining CCTV footage from the church. The crypt of St Michan's was previously vandalised in 1996, when a group of teenagers broke in and took a number of mummified bodies from their coffins. ""They dragged them onto the ground and seemed to be playing football with their heads,"" Archdeacon Pierpoint told the Irish Times. He added: ""Thankfully at that time the guards did their jobs extremely well and they caught the perpetrators."" Following the 1996 break-in, the crypts were closed to the public for a week, while the bodies were recovered.

Pound rises amid delay speculation,"The pound has hit a 21-month high against the euro, following increased speculation about a delay to Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa May said in the Commons that if no deal was agreed and if a no-deal exit was rejected, then there could bea short extension to the date for Britain to leave the EU. At one point, sterling hit â¬1.1643, its highest level since May 2017. However, Mrs May's concession was not as wide-ranging as investors had hoped, causing sterling to dip again. Against the US dollar, it reached $1.3239 at one point, its highest level since the end of January, before starting to lose ground. Analyst Jane Foley at Rabobank said Mrs May's remarks in the Commons had been ""discouraging for investors"", giving the impression that even if Brexit were delayed, ""the cliff-edge could be even sharper in three months' time"". ""The markets have not particularly liked what they've heard,"" she said. However, she added that there was still a consensus among investors that a no-deal Brexit would be avoided, because ""neither Parliament, the electorate or Europe want it"". How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket Why did the pound gain after May's Brexit defeat? The value of the pound fell sharply in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum result in 2016. On Tuesday, Bank of England governor Mark Carney told MPs on the Treasury Committee that the Bank would provide more support for the economy in the event of a no-deal Brexit. He said the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee had emphasised that its response to the shock of a no-deal Brexit would depend on the economic situation. ""Given the exceptional circumstance associated with Brexit, I would expect the committee to provide whatever monetary support it can consistent with the price stability remit given to the committee by Parliament. But there are clearly limits to its ability to do so,"" he said. He also warned that interest rates might have limited scope to support any damage to activity or jobs in event of a no-deal scenario, as they may have to rise instead to curb inflationary pressures. He added that if Britain left the EU with no deal, ""I guarantee you the path of GDP in our forecast will be materially lower than it is in our February forecast, which assumes that there is a deal and there is a smooth transition"".

What does Labour's move mean?,"Campaigners and MPs who have been pushing hard for another go at the EU referendum might be popping corks tonight, you may think. It's certainly significant in Labour circles, and satisfying to those who have been cajoling, urging, demanding that the leadership pay more attention to the many members of the party who want another referendum and make a concrete promise. If you are one of those people who'd love a chance to stop Brexit via another referendum, beware. Your celebratory drink tonight might go flat rather fast. Because, while this move counts politically, of course, the move does not mean that there will be another referendum. Labour, since its conference, has had the option on the table to push for another vote if other things don't happen. Labour move to back new Brexit referendum May 'focused' on scheduled Brexit date No-deal Brexit risks 'economic crisis' Their position was to campaign for a referendum if they couldn't force a general election - that didn't happen. Their position now is that if they can't get Labour's version of Brexit through the Commons next week, they'll move to a promise of another say for all of us at a future date. That will ease the irritation of many Labour MPs who have for a long time, hoped that Jeremy Corbyn would be a bit more enthusiastic about having another go. For those like Keir Starmer who have tried to push him in that direction, this is in a way a victory. But hold on, it really doesn't mean it's about to happen. The Labour leadership has moved to this position believing that, as things stand, a plan to hold another referendum would not get the votes it needs in Parliament. Right now, they reckon it's a promise they can make, but will probably never have to keep. But if, as this political moment implies, there is a total meltdown, the prime minister's deal falls and chaos beckons, the move tonight keeps Labour's options firmly open, and has a better shout at keeping anxious Labour Europhiles happy. In such volatile times it is, of course, not impossible that a majority for another vote could emerge. But there is already some angst over the move. It is not entirely clear what this theoretical referendum would decide. Expect therefore lots of tricky questions, over the question itself. And it's awkward for the many Labour MPs, including some in the shadow cabinet, who believe that holding another vote would be a mistake. Nothing for any of our political parties is easy when it comes to Brexit. The opposition, just like the government, is trying to keep a lot of different balls in the air.

Cardinal Pell guilty of child sexual abuse,"This video can not be played George Pell is the most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted of such crimes Cardinal George Pell has been found guilty in Australia of sexual offences against children, making him the highest-ranking Catholic figure to receive such a conviction. Pell abused two choir boys in Melbourne's cathedral in 1996, a jury found. He had pleaded not guilty. As Vatican treasurer, the 77-year-old Australian was widely seen as the Church's third most powerful official. Pell, due to face sentencing hearings from Wednesday, has lodged an appeal. His trial was heard twice last year because a first jury failed to reach a verdict. A second jury unanimously convicted him of one charge of sexually penetrating a child under 16, and four counts of committing an indecent act on a child under 16. The verdict was handed down in December, but it could not be reported until now for legal reasons. Pell: Poisoned power at the top Who is George Pell? Why his conviction was kept a secret Inside a strictly controlled trial Pell was swarmed by media and heckled by onlookers as he left a court on Tuesday. The Vatican later confirmed that Pell was prohibited from public ministry, and had been banned from having contact with minors. He has to abide by these rules until any appeal is over. They added that while the ruling was ""painful"", and the Church has the ""utmost respect"" for the Australian authorities, Pell has the right to ""defend himself to the last degree"". The Catholic Church worldwide has in recent yearsfaced a damaging series of allegations relating to sex abuse by priests, and claims that these cases were covered up. Pope Francis has just held an unprecedented summiton paedophilia in the Church. Pell was archbishop of Melbourne in 1996 when he found the two 13-year-old boys in cathedral rooms following a mass, the County Court of Victoria was told. After telling them they were in trouble for drinking communion wine, Pell forced each boy into indecent acts, prosecutors said. He abused one of the boys again in 1997. Pell was swarmed by media as he left court on Tuesday The court heard testimony from one of the victims. The other died of a drug overdose in 2014. A jury rejected an argument by Pell's lawyer, Robert Richter QC, that the allegations were fantasies contrived by the victims. In a statement on Tuesday, Pell's surviving victim - who cannot be named - called the case stressful and ""not over yet"". The man said he had experienced ""shame, loneliness, depression and struggle"" because of the abuse. Tireless fighter against Catholic sex abuse How will the Pope tackle abuse in the Catholic Church? ""Like many survivors it has taken me years to understand the impact upon my life,"" he said. The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference said the conviction had ""shocked many across Australia and around the world"", reiterating its vow to make the Church ""a safe place for all"". Abuse survivor groups welcomed the verdict. The Vatican said the ruling was ""painful"", but added that Pell had the right to ""defend himself to the last degree"". ""We reiterate the utmost respect for Australian judicial authorities,"" spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said in a statement, which he read out in a press conference. ""In the name of this respect, we now await the outcome of the appeal process."" He added that ""Cardinal Pell has reaffirmed his innocence and has the right to defend himself to the last degree"". ""It is painful news that, we are well aware, has shocked many people, not just in Australia,"" he added. ""As we await the definitive verdict, we join the Australian bishops in praying for all victims of abuse, reaffirming our commitment to do everything possible so that the Church is a safe home for everyone, especially for children."" ""Cardinal George Pell has always maintained his innocence and continues to do so,"" read a statement issued on his behalf on Tuesday. Pell (l) was considered one of the Pope's closest advisers Pell would await the outcome of his appeal, the brief note read. Last May, a judge handed down a legal order which prevented any reporting of Pell's trial and conviction. It was designed to prevent a separate trial - which will no longer go ahead - from being influenced by the first trial. The abandoned trial was to hear unrelated allegations - strongly denied by Pell - that he had indecently assaulted boys in the 1970s. Prosecutors withdrew their case on Tuesday, citing insufficient evidence. The collapse of the second trial led to the lifting of the publication ban. How the gag order caused controversy Hywel Griffith, BBC News Australia correspondent George Pell would sit in the dock with his notebook, listening, writing, but never really betraying any emotion. As the court heard vivid descriptions of how in 1996 he had forced himself upon two victims, pushing his archbishop's robes to one side in order to expose himself, he didn't flinch. After two trials, one hung jury and many months of waiting, the results of this long process are now public. The pace of justice has felt slow at times, but it has resulted in one of the Church's most prominent figures being held to account. Read more about what happened in the courtroom The Australian cleric rose in prominence as a strong supporter of traditional Catholic values, often taking conservative views and advocating for priestly celibacy. He was summoned to Rome in 2014 to clean up the Vatican's finances, and was often described as the Church's third-ranked official. This video can not be played Pell's early court hearings drew enormous interest But his career has been dogged first by claims that he covered up child sexual abuse by priests, and then later that he was himself an abuser. Pell was demoted from the Pope's inner circle in December. His term as Vatican treasurer expired on Sunday. Profile: The cardinal convicted of abuse The sexual abuse of children was rarely discussed in public before the 1970s, and it was not until the 1980s that the first cases of molestation by priests came to light, in the US and Canada. In the decades since, evidence of widespread abuse has emerged globally. In Australia,an inquiry heard that 7% of the nation's Catholic priests had abused children. Australia sexual abuse 'a national tragedy' Abuse and the Church: What you need to know US Cardinal defrocked over abuse allegations Pope Francis has established a committee to tackle sexual abuses. In recent days,he has promised concrete action, calling clergy guilty of abuse ""tools of Satan"". But critics say he could do more to combat paedophiles and those who conceal abuse.

Thousand fewer UK students at Oxbridge,"Oxford versus Cambridge: The competition for places for UK students has become even tougher There are more than a thousand fewer UK undergraduate students at Oxford and Cambridge universities than a decade ago, official figures show. Student figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency and from the universities show 7% fewer UK undergraduates at Oxford and 5% fewer at Cambridge, compared with 2007-08. Overseas undergraduate students rose by 51% at Oxford and 65% at Cambridge. Oxford says it recruits the ""best talent from around the world"". Students from outside the EU pay higher fees and the more prestigious a university and course the greater the cost will likely be - more than Â£30,000 a year in some cases. But a spokeswoman for Oxford said its overseas student intake had not been influenced by ""the fees they may bring with them"". There is intense competition for Oxford and Cambridge places and there has been much controversy about fair access and social mobility. There have been calls for more placesfor disadvantaged youngsters,as well asethnic minority studentsandwhite working-class youngsters. While such arguments have continued about widening opportunities, the total number of UK students being awarded places at Oxbridge has been reducing. There were about 1,200 fewer UK undergraduates in 2017-18 compared with a decade before - with about 11,300 in Oxford and 12,150 in Cambridge taking undergraduate degree courses, even though more have applied for places. The figures show there were about 720 fewer UK undergraduate students at Oxford University in 2017-18 compared with 2007-08. At Cambridge, the numbers have fallen by about 480 students across the decade. But the numbers of overseas students, both EU and non-EU, have climbed sharply, according to the data from Hesa, the official statistics body for higher education. In postgraduate courses at Cambridge, there are now more overseas students than UK. Sir Peter Lampl, chairman of the Sutton Trust social mobility charity, said the figures showed the need for the universities to put ""widening access at the heart of their admissions policies"". ""Oxford and Cambridge attract many international students, but they must ensure that their student body is balanced. ""This means letting in UK and international students based on ability and not on ability to pay,"" said Sir Peter. A University of Oxford spokeswoman said the same entry standards applied to all students, UK or overseas, based on ""academic talent and ability alone"" - and UK applicants had a higher rate of success than those from overseas. She said: ""Places to study are won by demonstrating academic potential through open competition, following the same rigorous application and admission process."" A spokesman for the University of Cambridge said: ""Applications from international students for undergraduate courses have increased by 56% over the period, which means UK students find themselves in a competitive field."" David Lammy in Twitter row with Oxford over fair access Oxbridge recruits more students from eight schools than 3,000 other state schools First student in the family starts at Cambridge Oxbridge accused of being 'more elitist than we thought' Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said the reduction in UK student numbers at Oxford and Cambridge was the ""sad but inevitable consequence"" of the universities becoming more international but not adding places. ""In those circumstances, something has to give and it seems to be places for home students,"" he says. Mr Hillman says if the universities do not want to ""squeeze out"" UK students they need to ""bite the bullet and accept more expansion"". The Hesa figures also show how other leading universities have been expanding their undergraduate intake much more than Oxford and Cambridge. University College London has expanded by 65%, Bristol by 41% and Exeter by 74%. The Office for Students (OFS), the regulator for higher education, wants more young people from disadvantaged backgrounds to go to university. But the watchdog says this could require a significant increase in places. If all young people went to university at the rate of the richest 20%, says the OFS, it would mean having to double the number of places in Russell Group universities. The Hesa figures also show an even more dramatic drop in adult and continuing education. In Cambridge, if people taking certificate and diploma courses were included alongside those on undergraduate degree courses, the overall fall in UK students would be about 29% over the decade. Both Oxford and Cambridge have run extensive outreach projects to attract a wider range of students. An Oxford spokeswoman said the university was committed to becoming ""more open and diverse"", with more ethnic minority and students from deprived areas. ""Sustaining excellence requires diversity, and our commitment to achieving this balance, and making Oxford more reflective of modern society, includes reaching out to and selecting, the best talent from all over the world,"" she said. A University of Cambridge spokesman said that despite the pressure on places, including from overseas, the university has widened access, including acceptingrising numbers of state school pupils. ""The university has made significant progress in all its widening participation measures over the same period. The university accepts students on merit, regardless of their background,"" he said.

PM faces Brexit revolt as cabinet meets,"Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Claire Perry left Cabinet without saying anything to waiting reporters Theresa May is facing the threat of a revolt by Remain-supporting ministers who want her to rule out a no-deal Brexit. The PM has just chaired a cabinet meeting on Brexit strategy and will make a statement to MPs at 1230 GMT. Six or more Remain-supporting ministers could quit unless she rules out no-deal in her statement. But one of the PM's closest allies has warned pushing back the 29 March exit would not make getting a deal easier. The BBC's Nick Watt says the feeling is Mrs May will ""lean into"" the rebel ministers' demands and Brexiteers have been told to expect a ""very difficult message"". Live: May to update MPs on Brexit Put May's deal to public vote - Labour Brexit: All you need to know Which Brexit amendments will be tabled? She has just returned from a summit in Egypt where she held a number of meetings with EU leaders and continued to press for more concessions to placate critics of her deal, in particular onthe Irish border backstop. News of the growing unrest within the cabinet came afterLabour announced a significant shift in its policy- a decision to back another referendum if its own alternative Brexit plan is rejected. Mrs May's Brexit deal was comprehensively rejected by MPs on 15 January and she has said they'll get a second chance to vote on it - possibly with some changes - by 12 March. Margot James, Richard Harrington and Claire Perry have threatened to quit unless no deal is taken off the table But writing in the Daily Mail,external, ministers Richard Harrington, Claire Perry and Margot James said Mrs May must promise now that she will rule out the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a deal if her agreement is rejected again, and instead seek a way to delay. Mr Harrington, a business minister, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire that it was ""absolutely absurd"" that, with 31 days to go before the UK is due to leave, a no-deal exit was still a possibility. ""The idea that no deal is a negotiating tool is absolutely incorrect. No-one believes it in the EU. As far as we are concerned the responsible thing is to rule it out."" Theresa May held talks with Angela Merkel and other EU leaders at a summit in Egypt Unless Mrs May was willing to provide the necessary reassurances, he said he would vote for Parliament to ""take control"" of the process by backing an amendment - a legislative tool - being put before the Commons by Labour's Yvette Cooper and Conservative Oliver Letwin. If passed, it would give MPs the power to demand a delay to Brexit if a deal cannot be agreed by 13 March. He said he was prepared to rebel and quit, if necessary, insisting this would be the ""honourable thing"" to do. ""Warm words alone will not be enough. It has to be a clear undertaking that she is prepared to remove no-deal and have a short extension to Article 50."" Three other senior cabinet ministers, Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke, have alreadysignalled they could also be prepared to vote for the Cooper-Letwin optionif there is no breakthrough in the next few days. Mrs May has long resisted any suggestion that the UK's departure from the EU could be postponed beyond 29 March. Leading Tory Brexiteer Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet in November, said those pressuring the PM to rule out no deal should be making their views known in private. Going public showed they were ""losing their nerve"" and ""bottling"" it, she told the BBC. ""These people should not be threatening and going to the papers and weakening her hand. If they are going to go, then just go."" If the UK did leave without a formal agreement on 29 March, she said the UK and EU should enter into what she described as a short ""static period"" where everything remained the same. This, she said, would give both sides the time and space to discuss how trade would operate, such as what, if any tariffs, would apply to imports and exports. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said that calls to avoid a no-deal Brexit by delaying the deadline for leaving the EU did not resolve the issues. ""It ends up simply deferring the need to face up to taking decisions. It's not an actual course of action in its own right,"" he told the BBC. Labour has said it will support the Cooper-Letwin amendment, making its chances of success far higher. But leader Jeremy Corbyn also wants to use Wednesday to put his own plan for Brexit - which includes a ""comprehensive customs union"" with the EU and ""close alignment"" with the single market - before the Commons. He told his MPs on Monday night that if - as expected - that plan is rejected, the party will formally throw its weight behind another public vote. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said that if Labour's Brexit proposals did not get through Parliament ""we, the Labour Party will either put down ourselves, or support an amendment, in favour of a public vote"". That vote, he added, ""ought to be on the option, on the one hand, of a credible leave deal and. on the other hand, remain"".

What is Jaish-e-Mohammad?,"It was the single deadliest attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir since 1989 Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), a Pakistan-based group, has claimed responsibility for the suicide bombing on 14 February in Indian-administered Kashmir. At least 46 soldiers died, making it the deadliest single attack against Indian forces in the region since 1989. The group is designated a terror organisation by India and the UN, as well as the UK and the US. It aims to unite Kashmir with Pakistan and has been held responsible for attacks in India and Kashmir. Media reports say JeM spokesman Muhammad Hassan spoke of ""dozens of [Indian] forces' vehicles"" destroyed in the attack, when the bomber rammed a convoy in a vehicle filled with explosives. Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Viewpoint: How far might India go to 'punish' Pakistan? Jaish-e-Mohammad literally means the Army of Mohammad. Pakistan-based Muslim cleric Masood Azhar founded the group after he was released by India in 1999. He was one of three men set free in exchange for the crew and passengers of an Indian Airlines plane hijacked and flown to Taliban-ruled Afghanistan. Maulana Masood Azhar founded JeM in 1999 Mr Azhar reportedly met with the former Taliban leader Mullah Omar and with al-Qaeda head Osama Bin Laden when he was in the country. India blame JeM for an attack on their parliament in New Delhi in December 2001 - a claim JeM denies. JeM was officially banned in Pakistan soon after that attack but the group still operates, sometimes using the names Afzal Guru Squad, Al-Murabitoon and Tehreek-al-Furqan. More recently,India has blamed JeM for an attack on its Pathankot airbasenear the Pakistani border in January 2016, which left three security forces dead. Is India losing Kashmir? Kashmir territories - full profile JeM commander Noor Mohammad Tantray was killed by Indian forcesin December 2017, which was seen as a massive blow to the organisation. But the violence did not abate, and a report in the Indian newspaper The Print suggests covert Pakistani support may be the reason for its expansion. JeM has however attacked Pakistani military targets and even made an attempt on former leader Pervez Musharraf's life in 2003, despite India's accusations that Pakistan harbours the group. India frequently asks its neighbour to extradite Masood Azhar - reportedly in the eastern Pakistani province of Punjab - but Pakistan refuses, saying there is a lack of proof against him. Right wing Hindus burn photos of Mr Azhar and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan New Delhi has also called on the UN to list Masood Azhar as a global terrorist, but Pakistan's close ally China continues to block the move. Speaking after the Pulwama attack, India's foreign ministry demanded that Pakistan ""stop supporting terrorists and terror groups operating from their territory, and dismantle the infrastructure operated by terrorist outfits to launch attacks in other countries"". But Pakistan has condemned any suggestion it is linked to the attack. ""We have always condemned acts of violence anywhere in the world,"" a foreign office spokesman said.

Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir,"Kashmir has been a source of conflict between India and Pakistan for more than 70 years Nuclear-armed neighbours India and Pakistan have fought two wars and a limited conflict over Kashmir. But why do they dispute the territory - and how did it start? Kashmir is an ethnically diverse Himalayan region, covering around 86,000 sq miles ( 222,738 sq km), and famed for the beauty of its lakes, meadows and snow-capped mountains. Even before India and Pakistan won their independence from Britain in August 1947, the area was hotly contested. Under the partition plan provided by the Indian Independence Act, Kashmir was free to accede to either India or Pakistan. The maharaja (local ruler), Hari Singh, initially wanted Kashmir to become independent - but in October 1947 chose to join India, in return for its help against an invasion of tribesmen from Pakistan. Kashmir profile - Timeline A war erupted and India approached the United Nations asking it to intervene. The United Nations recommended holding a plebiscite to settle the question of whether the state would join India or Pakistan. However the two countries could not agree to a deal to demilitarise the region before the referendum could be held. In July 1949, India and Pakistan signed an agreement to establish a ceasefire line as recommended by the UN and the region became divided. Kashmir is known by some as India's Switzerland, due to its verdant fields and sweeping mountainscapes A second war followed in 1965. Then in 1999, India fought a brief but bitter conflict with Pakistani-backed forces. By that time, India and Pakistan had both declared themselves to be nuclear powers. Today, Delhi and Islamabad both claim Kashmir in full, but control only parts of it - territories recognised internationally as ""Indian-administered Kashmir"" and ""Pakistan-administered Kashmir"". An armed revolt has been waged against Indian rule in the region for three decades, claiming tens of thousands of lives. India blames Pakistan for stirring the unrest by backing separatist militants in Kashmir - a charge its neighbour denies. Now a sudden change to Kashmir's status on the Indian side has created further apprehension. Indian-administered Kashmir has held a special position within the country historically, thanks to Article 370 - a clause in the constitution which gave it significant autonomy, including its own constitution, a separate flag, and independence over all matters except foreign affairs, defence and communications. Why a special law on Kashmir is controversial What happened in Kashmir and why it matters On 5 August, India revoked that seven-decade-long privileged status- as the governing party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), had promised in its 2019 election manifesto. The Hindu nationalist BJP has long opposed Article 370 and had repeatedly called for its abolishment. Telephone networks and the internet were cut off in the region in the days before the presidential order was announced. Public gatherings were banned, and tens of thousands of troops were sent in. Tourists were told to leave Kashmir under warnings of a terror threat. This video can not be played Baramulla resident: 'Our livelihood is affected, nobody is at peace' Two former chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir - the Indian state which encompasses the disputed territory - were placed under house arrest. One of them, Mehbooba Mufti, said the move would ""make India an occupational force in Jammu and Kashmir,""and that ""today marks the darkest day in Indian democracy"". Allow Twitter content?

Pakistan fiercely condemned the development, branding it ""illegal""and vowing to ""exercise all possible options"" against it. It downgraded diplomatic ties with India and suspended all trade. India responded by saying they ""regretted"" Pakistan's statement and reiterating that Article 370 was an internal matter as it did not interfere with the boundaries of the territory. Within Kashmir, opinions about the territory's rightful allegiance are diverse and strongly held. Many do not want it to be governed by India, preferring either independence or union with Pakistan instead. Religion is one factor: Jammu and Kashmir is more than 60% Muslim, making it the only state within India where Muslims are in the majority. Critics of the BJP fear this move is designed to change the state's demographic make-up of - by giving people from the rest of the country to right to acquire property and settle there permanently. Ms Mufti told the BBC: ""They just want to occupy our land and want to make this Muslim-majority state like any other state and reduce us to a minority and disempower us totally."" Feelings of disenfranchisement have been aggravated in Indian-administered Kashmir by high unemployment, and complaints of human rights abuses by security forces battling street protesters and fighting insurgents. Former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti has accused India of betraying Kashmir Anti-India sentiment in the state has ebbed and flowed since 1989, but the region witnessed a fresh wave of violenceafter the death of 22-year-old militant leader Burhan Wani in July 2016. He died in a battle with security forces, sparking massive protests across the valley. Wani - whose social media videos were popular among young people - is largely credited with reviving and legitimising the image of militancy in the region. The teenager blinded by pellets in Kashmir 'Modi's Kashmir move will fuel resentment' WATCH: The boy drawing Kashmir's conflict Thousands attended Wani's funeral, which was held in his hometown of Tral, about 40km (25 miles) south of the city of Srinagar. Following the funeral, people clashed with troops and it set off a deadly cycle of violence that lasted for days. More than 30 civilians died, and others were injured in the clashes. Since then, violence has been on the rise in the state. More than 500 people were killed in 2018 - including civilians, security forces and militants - the highest toll in a decade. India and Pakistan did indeed agree a ceasefire in 2003 after years of bloodshed along the de facto border (also known as the Line of Control). Pakistan later promised to stop funding insurgents in the territory, while India offered them an amnesty if they renounced militancy. In 2014, India's current Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power promising a tough line on Pakistan, but also showed interest in holding peace talks. Nawaz Sharif, then prime minister of Pakistan,attended Mr Modi's swearing-in ceremony in Delhi. Pakistan and India's prime ministers promised peace in 2014 But a year later, India blamed Pakistan-based groups for an attack on its airbase in Pathankot in the northern state of Punjab.Mr Modi also cancelled a scheduled visit to the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, for a regional summit in 2017. Since then, there hasn't been any progress in talks between the neighbours. The bloody summer of street protests in Indian-administered Kashmir in 2016 had already dimmed hopes for a lasting peace in the region. Then, in June 2018, the state government there was upended when Mr Modi's BJP pulled out of a coalition government run by Ms Mufti's People's Democratic Party. Jammu and Kashmir was since under direct rule from Delhi, which fuelled further anger. The deaths of more than 40 Indian soldiers in a suicide attack on 14 February, 2019 have ended any hope of a thaw in the immediate future. India blamed Pakistan-based militant groups for the violence - the deadliest targeting Indian soldiers in Kashmir since the insurgency began three decades ago. Following the bombing,India said it would take ""all possible diplomatic steps"" to isolate Pakistanfrom the international community. On 26 February, it launched air strikes in Pakistani territory which it said targeted militant bases. Pakistan shows off disputed air strike site Pakistan's dilemma over anti-India militants Pakistan denied the raids had caused major damage or casualties but promised to respond, fuelling fears of confrontation. A day later it said it had shot down two Indian Air Force jets in its airspace, and captured a fighter pilot - who was later returned unharmed to India. This video can not be played Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was handed over to Indian officials near a border crossing with Pakistan Kashmir remains one of the most militarised zones in the world. India's parliament has now passed a bill splitting Indian-administered Kashmir into two territories governed directly by Delhi: Jammu and Kashmir, and remote, mountainous Ladakh. China, which shares a disputed border with India in Ladakh, has objected to the reorganisation and accused Delhi of undermining its territorial sovereignty. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed to challenge India's actions at the UN security council, and take the matter to the International Criminal Court. In an ominous warning, he said: ""If the world does not act today... (if) the developed world does not uphold its own laws, then things will go to a place that we will not be responsible for."" But Delhi insists that there is no ""external implication"" to its decision to reorganise the state as it has not changed the Line of Control or boundaries of the region. US President Donald Trump has offered to mediate in the crisis - an overture that Delhi has rejected.

What are Modi's options?,"Mr Modi's government is under pressure to respond to the attack in Pulwama A suicide bomber killed more than 40 paramilitary police in Indian-administered Kashmir last week in what was the deadliest attack on Indian forces in the region for decades. Pakistan denies any role in the attack by militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad, which is based on its soil. With Indian general elections around the corner, the government is under pressure to respond, or at least demonstrate that such actions are not without consequences. Dhruva Jaishankar weighs in with the options before India - diplomatic, economic and military. Political relations between India and Pakistan have been frozen for almost three years. In his first two years in office after coming to power in 2014, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi invited his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif to his inauguration, resumed talks between national security advisers,made an unscheduled visit to Lahore, andapproved a much-criticised effort at collaborative counter-terrorism investigations,external. The de facto border between India and Pakistan, also known as Line of Control Pakistan responded to these efforts withfiring across the Line of Control separating the two sides,external, insisting on meeting with Kashmiri separatists in India, andarresting and sentencing to death an alleged Indian spy. Days after Mr Modi and Mr Sharif met in Lahore to launch a peace initiative,six soldiers were killed in an attack on an Indian air force base in Pathankot. Indian officials blamed the attack on the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a militant group close to Pakistani intelligence. By July 2016, Delhi's patience dried up and its position on a number of issues hardened. What is militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad? How far might India go to 'punish' Pakistan? Despite a new government in Pakistan under Imran Khan, a meeting between the two countries' foreign ministers at last year's UN General Assembly was cancelled. Normal diplomatic channels have, however, continued. After the attack in Pulwama on Thursday, India has renewed its diplomatic efforts to make the case against what it says is Pakistan's state support for terrorism. This builds upon many years of India condemning Pakistan in diplomatic pronouncements made with friendly countries. In India's joint statements with the US and others, they now name specific Pakistan-based terrorist groups such as  JeM, Lashkar-e-Taiba and D-Company, a criminal syndicate led by the Pakistan-based Indian fugitive Dawood Ibrahim. Mr Modi invited his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif to his inauguration in 2014 India has also linked Pakistan to the primary security challenges of its partners: for example, Japan's concerns about North Korea. Such moves have sensitised others to India's concerns about Pakistan, facilitated intelligence cooperation on Pakistan-based terrorist groups and encouraged crackdowns on their financing in many countries. Delhi's continued efforts also increase acceptability for any economic or military costs that India might impose at a later date. The challenge facing India is that other countries, however sympathetic, will continue to see value in retaining their ties with Pakistan. Although theUS has become increasingly frustrated with Pakistan ""tolerating and encouraging groups which use violence against Pakistan's neighbours"",external, China remains Pakistan's closest ally, as it has for decades. It has provided Pakistan with nuclear and missile technology and equipment, conventional arms and - under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor - billions of dollars of investment in strategic projects. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates too have continuing economic and security ties with Pakistan, although both have also been warming their relations with India over the past few years. India has already begun to crackdown on suspected militants in Kashmir The US and European Union continue to offer Pakistan preferential trading benefits, in some cases resulting in lower tariffs on imports compared to India. Some EU officials have privately blamed the United Kingdom for Brussels' accommodative approach towards Pakistan - and have suggested that they may take sterner measures after Brexit. The day after the Pulwama attack, India revoked Pakistan's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status, raised customs duties to 200% and vowed to isolate it in the international community. The absence of MFN will significantly raise customs duties on Pakistani exports to India, effectively resulting in unilateral Indian sanctions. Given that direct trade between the two countries is negligible, this move is largely symbolic. In some ways, India has been implementing punitive measures against Pakistan for years. For instance, India has not played Pakistan in a bilateral Test cricket series since late 2007, in part because such a series would result in afinancial windfall for the Pakistan Cricket Board.,external The funerals driving youth to militancy Injured baby refuels India pellet gun row Other, more severe, measures such asabrogating the 1960 Indus Waters Treatyhave been suggested. Such a step would have significant costs, including eroding India's relations with other countries - China, Nepal, and Bangladesh - with which it has water-sharing arrangements. India will also likely continue to apply diplomatic pressure to raise the costs of economic ties with Pakistan. Pakistan PM Imran Khan has said Pakistan was not behind the Pulwama attack It is expected to advocate adding Pakistan to the black list (which includes Iran and North Korea) of the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body that combats money laundering. This would raise scrutiny on financial transactions involving Pakistan and effect its currency inflows, credit rating, stock market and banking sector. However, China will likely resist such a move - it only dropped its opposition to Pakistan's ""grey listing"" last year in exchange for India's support for Beijing's vice presidency of the task force. Other multilateral efforts may extend to leveraging India's position at various export control groups in which it recently acquired membership. The biggest challenge for India is that Pakistan possesses a nuclear deterrent - including possibly one of the fastest growing nuclear arsenals - and a potent military. For all the sabre-rattling in the Indian press and public, these are realities that the Indian leadership must keep in mind. However, both Pakistan and India have explored options below the nuclear threshold. In 1999, Pakistani forces made an incursion onto India's side of the de facto border (also know as the Line of Control) resulting in the limited Kargil conflict. On several occasions after that, India retaliated to Pakistani provocations with coordinated small-scale raids across the Line of Control.The 2016 attacks, in response to the Uri base attack, became widely known as ""surgical strikes"". Other military options would be long-term in nature. Indian efforts against cross-border infiltration from Pakistan have already benefited from new security technologies as well as intelligence partnerships with other countries. Improvement in this area - such as buying unmanned aircraft and enhancing technical intelligence cooperation - would count as a major investment in countering cross-border terrorism from Pakistan. Of course, these are only some of the many ways in which India might choose to respond. If recent history is any guide, we may witness something entirely unprecedented and unexpected.

Cardinal Pell guilty of child sexual abuseThe ex-Vatican treasurer is the most senior Catholic figure receive such a conviction.,"This video can not be played George Pell is the most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted of such crimes Cardinal George Pell has been found guilty in Australia of sexual offences against children, making him the highest-ranking Catholic figure to receive such a conviction. Pell abused two choir boys in Melbourne's cathedral in 1996, a jury found. He had pleaded not guilty. As Vatican treasurer, the 77-year-old Australian was widely seen as the Church's third most powerful official. Pell, due to face sentencing hearings from Wednesday, has lodged an appeal. His trial was heard twice last year because a first jury failed to reach a verdict. A second jury unanimously convicted him of one charge of sexually penetrating a child under 16, and four counts of committing an indecent act on a child under 16. The verdict was handed down in December, but it could not be reported until now for legal reasons. Pell: Poisoned power at the top Who is George Pell? Why his conviction was kept a secret Inside a strictly controlled trial Pell was swarmed by media and heckled by onlookers as he left a court on Tuesday. The Vatican later confirmed that Pell was prohibited from public ministry, and had been banned from having contact with minors. He has to abide by these rules until any appeal is over. They added that while the ruling was ""painful"", and the Church has the ""utmost respect"" for the Australian authorities, Pell has the right to ""defend himself to the last degree"". The Catholic Church worldwide has in recent yearsfaced a damaging series of allegations relating to sex abuse by priests, and claims that these cases were covered up. Pope Francis has just held an unprecedented summiton paedophilia in the Church. Pell was archbishop of Melbourne in 1996 when he found the two 13-year-old boys in cathedral rooms following a mass, the County Court of Victoria was told. After telling them they were in trouble for drinking communion wine, Pell forced each boy into indecent acts, prosecutors said. He abused one of the boys again in 1997. Pell was swarmed by media as he left court on Tuesday The court heard testimony from one of the victims. The other died of a drug overdose in 2014. A jury rejected an argument by Pell's lawyer, Robert Richter QC, that the allegations were fantasies contrived by the victims. In a statement on Tuesday, Pell's surviving victim - who cannot be named - called the case stressful and ""not over yet"". The man said he had experienced ""shame, loneliness, depression and struggle"" because of the abuse. Tireless fighter against Catholic sex abuse How will the Pope tackle abuse in the Catholic Church? ""Like many survivors it has taken me years to understand the impact upon my life,"" he said. The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference said the conviction had ""shocked many across Australia and around the world"", reiterating its vow to make the Church ""a safe place for all"". Abuse survivor groups welcomed the verdict. The Vatican said the ruling was ""painful"", but added that Pell had the right to ""defend himself to the last degree"". ""We reiterate the utmost respect for Australian judicial authorities,"" spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said in a statement, which he read out in a press conference. ""In the name of this respect, we now await the outcome of the appeal process."" He added that ""Cardinal Pell has reaffirmed his innocence and has the right to defend himself to the last degree"". ""It is painful news that, we are well aware, has shocked many people, not just in Australia,"" he added. ""As we await the definitive verdict, we join the Australian bishops in praying for all victims of abuse, reaffirming our commitment to do everything possible so that the Church is a safe home for everyone, especially for children."" ""Cardinal George Pell has always maintained his innocence and continues to do so,"" read a statement issued on his behalf on Tuesday. Pell (l) was considered one of the Pope's closest advisers Pell would await the outcome of his appeal, the brief note read. Last May, a judge handed down a legal order which prevented any reporting of Pell's trial and conviction. It was designed to prevent a separate trial - which will no longer go ahead - from being influenced by the first trial. The abandoned trial was to hear unrelated allegations - strongly denied by Pell - that he had indecently assaulted boys in the 1970s. Prosecutors withdrew their case on Tuesday, citing insufficient evidence. The collapse of the second trial led to the lifting of the publication ban. How the gag order caused controversy Hywel Griffith, BBC News Australia correspondent George Pell would sit in the dock with his notebook, listening, writing, but never really betraying any emotion. As the court heard vivid descriptions of how in 1996 he had forced himself upon two victims, pushing his archbishop's robes to one side in order to expose himself, he didn't flinch. After two trials, one hung jury and many months of waiting, the results of this long process are now public. The pace of justice has felt slow at times, but it has resulted in one of the Church's most prominent figures being held to account. Read more about what happened in the courtroom The Australian cleric rose in prominence as a strong supporter of traditional Catholic values, often taking conservative views and advocating for priestly celibacy. He was summoned to Rome in 2014 to clean up the Vatican's finances, and was often described as the Church's third-ranked official. This video can not be played Pell's early court hearings drew enormous interest But his career has been dogged first by claims that he covered up child sexual abuse by priests, and then later that he was himself an abuser. Pell was demoted from the Pope's inner circle in December. His term as Vatican treasurer expired on Sunday. Profile: The cardinal convicted of abuse The sexual abuse of children was rarely discussed in public before the 1970s, and it was not until the 1980s that the first cases of molestation by priests came to light, in the US and Canada. In the decades since, evidence of widespread abuse has emerged globally. In Australia,an inquiry heard that 7% of the nation's Catholic priests had abused children. Australia sexual abuse 'a national tragedy' Abuse and the Church: What you need to know US Cardinal defrocked over abuse allegations Pope Francis has established a committee to tackle sexual abuses. In recent days,he has promised concrete action, calling clergy guilty of abuse ""tools of Satan"". But critics say he could do more to combat paedophiles and those who conceal abuse.

M&S and Ocado in talks about joint venture,"Marks & Spencer (M&S) and Ocado have confirmed they are in discussions about a Â£1.8bn joint venture. If the two companies reach agreement, it would give M&S a food delivery service for the first time. Ocado is best known for delivering Waitrose goods, with whom it pioneered online grocery deliveries 20 years ago. However, their latest arrangement, which prevents Ocado delivering any other retailer's own branded goods, is due to come to end next year. M&S has the most limited range of groceries of any of the leading food retailers and has held well back from the move to online delivery. Retail analyst Natalie Berg from NBK Retail said such a new deal would mean the end of the current one. ""It's safe to assume that any deal with M&S will require Ocado to dissolve its long-standing relationship with Waitrose."" Online behemoth Amazon is making inroads into the UK grocery market and Ms Berg said this had sparked a defensive scramble among retailers. ""The prospect of Amazon shaking up the grocery sector and transforming the way we shop is creating some strange bedfellows. ""But this move is a win-win for both parties. I think most would welcome M&S and its expertise in high-quality, prepared foods. This will be important for Ocado as they look to cater to the 'for tonight' shopping mission, having just announced plans for one-hour delivery."" Marks & Spencer food and clothing hit Ocado losses widen but sales grow M&S has a far more limited range of groceries than its main rivals, something that would make online shopping with them exclusively, even if available, less attractive. But Ms Berg said a tie-up would bolt Ocado's wider range on to M&S's:  ""M&S would never be able to do online grocery on its own because the average transaction size is too small. Most customers don't do a full, weekly shop at M&S, the economics just don't stack up. Teaming up with Ocado would allow M&S to fill gaps in their food range and finally offer home delivery to customers."" Vincent Lee, retail analyst at Bernstein Reserch, said Marks and Spencer would effectively be ""buying Ocado's customers"" and the company's food delivery technology - allowing them to increase their market share. He added that the M&S food business had been struggling, so it was clear that they needed a delivery business. The latest figures from M&S showed food sales fell 2.1%. M&S said there was no certainty the discussions would lead to a tie-up. Currently Ocado has a deal to deliver Waitrose-branded goods and also delivers its own Ocado-branded products. In addition, it has a delivery deal with Morrisons, although this is done under the Yorkshire-based supermarket's own brand. The food retailing landscape is a complex one. Morrisons also sells its products through Amazon, and after pioneering online delivery with Ocado, Waitrose also delivers its own products under its own-branded vans. Ocado, founded by three Goldman Sachs bankers, has recently undertaken a number of new international deals, striking licensing deals with retailers in Sweden, the US and Canada. Shares in M&S were up 3% on the news while Ocado was up 10%.

Rodgers set to quit Celtic for Leicester,"This video can not be played Wrong to say Rodgers wasn't backed - McDonald Celtic boss Brendan Rodgers is expected to be confirmed as Leicester City's new manager after holding talks with the Premier League club. Former Liverpool boss Rodgers is in the Midlands after discussions on Monday night and a deal to replace the sacked Claude Puel is believed to be close. Former boss Neil Lennonhas agreed to take overat Celtic until the end of the season, and could be in charge for Wednesday's Scottish Premiership trip to Hearts. He will be assisted by current first-team coach John Kennedy. ""We're still waiting on hearing back from Leicester,"" Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell told reporters. ""Brendan is down there at the moment and I think they have a few things to sort out."" Ex-Liverpool manager Rodgers cut short a BBC Scotland interview after the champions' win over Motherwell on Sunday when asked about the Leicester vacancy. Celtic are eight points clear of nearest rivals Rangers in the league as they chase an eighth successive title. Rodgers has won every domestic trophy he has contested - two Scottish Premierships, three Scottish League Cups and two Scottish Cups - since arriving at Parkhead in the summer of 2016. They reached the group stages of the Champions League in his first two seasons, but were knocked out in the third qualifying round by AEK Athens this term amid unrest between Rodgers and the Celtic board over a failure to strengthen the squad last summer. Last week, they bowed out of the Europa League at the last-32 stage for the second successive season, losing to Valencia. LIVE: Rodgers poised to leave Celtic Celtic job 'bigger than Leicester' Analysis: Rodgers' route to Premier League redemption? This video can not be played 'Disgusted with the decision' - Celtic fans react to Rodgers news Rangers boss Steven Gerrard played under Rodgers at Liverpool, where he narrowly failed to guide them to the Premier League title in 2014 before his departure in October 2015. Gerrard, speaking on Tuesday, said: ""Brendan has done ever so well at Celtic over the last few years. It is no surprise other clubs watch him and want to acquire his services. ""I have worked with Brendan, he is a very good coach. I am not surprised at the timing. From our point of view, we will keep an eye on it and see how it pans out. My focus is on Rangers."" Puel was dismissed after 16 months in charge following Saturday's 4-1 defeat by Crystal Palace. The 57-year-old Frenchman left the club 12th in the Premier League having lost five of their past six league games. First-team coaches Mike Stowell and Adam Sadler were put in temporary charge. Leicester play Brighton at home in the Premier League on Tuesday (19:45 GMT). BBC Scotland sports news correspondent Chris McLaughlin It's the news the Celtic fans had been dreading. Since taking over in 2016 he has delivered everything domestically - the double treble was secured at the end of last season and the club were on the way to making it three in a row. But there was always a feeling the former Liverpool boss wanted to try his luck once again in English football's top flight. Suggestions he wasn't getting the boardroom backing he was looking for may also have hastened his exit - but it leaves Celtic looking to replace one of their most successful managers. BBC chief football writer Phil McNulty Rodgers has rebuilt his reputation in Scotland after his ultimate failings at Liverpool and is certainly not short of personality or charisma. The 46-year-old also plays attractive, attacking football and shares in Puel's penchant for promoting young talent. And after three years and seven trophies - to date - maybe Rodgers will feel that the time is right to leave.

Zarif: Iran's foreign policy 'poisoned',"Mohammad Javad Zarif announced his resignation in an Instagram post on Monday night Iran's President Hassan Rouhani has rejected the resignation of his Foreign Minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif. In a letter, Mr Rouhani praised Mr Zarif's record and said: ""I think your resignation is against the country's interests and I do not accept it."" Mr Zarif offered to resign on Monday, saying he hoped to allow his ministry to reclaim its ""proper statutory role"". His role negotiating the landmark 2015 nuclear deal with world powers exposed him to sharp criticism from hardliners. Many hardliners opposed the decision to accept limits on the country's nuclear activities in return for the lifting of crippling sanctions. Pressure on Mr Zarif grew last year after US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal and reinstated US sanctions targeting Iran's oil and banking sectors. Mr Zarif initially gave no explanation. ""I would like to sincerely apologise for not being able to continue my service and for all my shortcomings during my service,"" he wrote on Instagram on Monday night. Allow Instagram content?

On Tuesday morning, he urged fellow diplomats not to follow his lead and suggested that he had resigned because he felt he had been sidelined. ""I hope my resignation will act as a spur for the foreign ministry to regain its proper statutory role in the conduct of foreign affairs,"" he said. He was also quoted by the centrist newspaper Jomhuri Eslami as saying in an interview that political infighting was hampering the foreign ministry's work. ""The deadly poison for foreign policy is for foreign policy to become an issue of party and factional fighting,"" he said. By Kasra Naji, BBC Persian Mr Zarif's exclusion from top-level meetings in Tehran on Monday during the previously unannounced visit of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was the final straw. When photos were released showing Mr Assad attending talks with President Rouhani and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Mr Zarif saw them as a new low for his ministry's role in overseeing Iran's foreign policy. Hassan Rouhani met his Syrian counterpart Bashar al-Assad on Monday - without Mr Zarif He wrote in a message to a reporter for a reformist newspaper that that the pictures had left him with ""no credibility in the world as Iran's foreign minister"". The fact is that Iranian hardliners resent him for agreeing to dismantle much of the country's nuclear programme. Those around the supreme leader have gradually wrested more and more control of Iran's foreign policy from him, particularly in relation to Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon. Mr Zarif, most observers agree, has put up a robust defence of Iran on the world stage in spite of the fact that many of Iran's positions, actions and behaviours - with which he has had little to do - have been indefensible. In a speech on Tuesday, Mr Rouhani made no mention of Mr Zarif's resignation, but he did praise the foreign minister for his ""resistance"" and ""capabilities"". ""If our foreign ministry is doing something, it is because it is from the people and it represents the people,"" he said. Later, the president's chief-of-staff, Mahmoud Vaezi, wrote on Instagram: ""In the view of Dr Rouhani, the Islamic Republic of Iran has only one foreign policy and one foreign minister."" Mr Zarif was the architect of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers But it was not until Wednesday morning thatMr Rouhani formally rejected Mr Zarif's resignation,external. ""It is the belief of myself and the Supreme Leader that you are a trusted, brave and devout individual standing on the frontline against America's multilateral pressures."" Soon afterwards, Mr Zarif was seen alongside the president at a welcoming ceremony in Tehran for visiting Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. In an Instagram post,Mr Zarif said he ""had no other concern but the glory of foreign policy and the credibility of the foreign ministry"",external.

Max and Keira's organ law set to pass,"This video can not be played ""She's a hero"" - Max, his parents and Keira's parents tell the story that gave the legislation its name Plans to change the rules on organ donation consent in England have cleared the final hurdle in Parliament. The legislation will be known as Max and Keira's Law after a boy who received a heart transplant and the girl who donated it. Under the new system, which comes into effect next year, consent will be presumed unless people have opted out. Currently, there is a voluntary opt-in scheme. Presumed consent has been operating in Wales since December 2015. Organ donation consent rates in Walesare now the highest in the UK,externalat 75%. A voluntary opt-in system still exists in Northern Ireland while theScottish Parliament is this week considering its own opt-out scheme. Government ministers argue the change in the rules in England could save up to 700 lives a year by increasing the number of organs available. Keira Ball, from Devon, was nine when she was involved in a car accident with her mum and brother. Keira's organs helped save four lives. Her father Joe was approached by the organ donor consent team after doctors in Bristol confirmed they could not save her life. He told the BBC: ""Although we'd never discussed organ donation, I knew it was what Keira would have wanted - it was in her nature."" Keira's organs were used to save four lives, among them Max Johnson, then also aged nine, who received her heart. At the time of Keira's accident, Max was in hospital in Newcastle with heart failure following a viral infection. Max Johnson is now 11 and his new heart is working well He was being kept alive with a mechanical pump. He told the BBC: ""To be honest I was ready to die - I didn't think I would make it.Â  I hugged Mum and Dad thinking this was the last hug with my parents."" The operation was a success and Max, now 11, is doing well, although the anti-rejection drugs he must take every day sometimes make him quite poorly. Max's story prompted the prime minister to pledge to introduce presumed consent for organ donation in England. There are currently around 6,000 people on the transplant waiting list in the UK and last year more than 400 patients died while waiting for a suitable organ. Under the new system, people will be encouraged to register their consent for organ donation, or to opt out.Â It will still be open to relatives to block a donation, so it will be important that families discuss their wishes. Max and Keira's families both back public education campaigns. Loanna Ball, Keira's mum, told the BBC:Â ""If this issue was raised in school from a young age, children would happily talk about it with their friends and family; it would be an everyday conversation."" The family has set up acharity,externalin memory of their daughter to offer support to bereaved families. Max said:Â ""I want everyone to talk toÂ each other - if a member of your family died, would you let their organs go to waste and decay or save a few people's lives?"" The new legislation was a Private Members' Bill, introduced by Geoffrey Robinson MP. It was piloted through the House of Lords by Lord Hunt, who told the BBC he was ""absolutely delighted"" the Bill was on course to pass into law, adding: ""I am convinced that as a result, many more organs will be donated and lives saved as a consequence.""

Housebuilder Persimmon's profits top ÃÂ£1bn,"Profits have topped Â£1bn for the first time at housebuilder Persimmon, which was caught in a pay row last year and is under scrutiny over its continued involvement in the Help to Buy scheme. Annual profits jumped 13% to Â£1.091bn, up from Â£966m in 2017. The firm also said its interim chief executive, Dave Jenkinson, would now take on the role permanently. Mr Jenkinson's predecessor, Jeff Fairburn, left last year following controversy over his Â£75m pay package. ""We are the first company to make over Â£1bn profit in this sector,"" Mr Jenkinson said. ""The whole team are very proud."" The results come a day aftershares in Persimmon fell 5%because of questions over its continued involvement in the Help to Buy scheme. The firm sold 7,970 homes under the scheme in 2018, up from 7,682 in 2017. At the weekend, a source close to Housing Minister James Brokenshire said the minister was ""increasingly concerned"" by Persimmon's practices, including its use of leasehold contracts, the quality of its buildings and its leadership. He said this meant its inclusion in the Help to Buy scheme was under review. Mike Amey, managing director of global investment management firm Pimco, told the BBC that profit per house at Persimmon had trebled since Help To Buy was introduced. And housing expert Henry Pryor told the BBC: ""There is no doubt that Help to Buy has been the crack cocaine of the housing industry. We've all got addicted to it and when we are weaned off it, it is going to be painful."" By Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter The Persimmon money machine rolls on, profits past the Â£1bn mark and Â£2.2bn returned to shareholders in the past seven years, with the promise of more - much more - to come. Persimmon has been an astonishing success for its investors, and of course its executives, who are benefiting from a giant pay scheme agreed in 2012. Sometimes, though, you can have too much success, particularly when you are a big beneficiary of a taxpayer-funded housing scheme, in this case Help to Buy. Jeff Fairburn, the former chief executive, had to fall on his sword after public and investor opinion swung sharply against the size of his remuneration - Â£75m, although he gave some to charity. The danger now is that a similar shift in sentiment undermines the company as a whole. Politicians might decide that Â£1bn a year in profits, a 30% operating margin and giant dividends to shareholders are evidence the new-build housing market is no longer sufficiently competitive, and has instead turned into an oligopoly, a market carved up between a few big players. There was a hint of that in weekend reports that Persimmon's participation in Help to Buy was under government scrutiny - a hint strong enough to send the shares down nearly 5%. If the hint were to turn into reality, the Persimmon money machine would judder to a halt. Housing costs: Five surprises explained Reality Check: How does the government help first-time buyers? Persimmon boss retained Â£15m in bonus deal Mr Jenkinson has been with the firm for 22 years and had been interim chief executive since November, following Mr Fairburn's departure. He said: ""2018 has been a year of disciplined high quality growth again for Persimmon Homes. ""We have a lower average selling price than our competitors, but that is a function of our desire to hit all parts of the market."" He added: ""It is important for me as the new CEO to acknowledge that we still have work to do in customer care."" This video can not be played Last year, Persimmon's previous chief, Jeff Fairburn, refused to answer questions about his pay Chairman Roger Devlin said: ""Persimmon is changing. In his short time as interim CEO, Dave Jenkinson has introduced new approaches to customer satisfaction and colleague engagement, whilst also ensuring that the group delivered another year of growth."" The company's total group revenue for the year increased by 4% to Â£3.74bn, up from Â£3.60bn in 2017. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Conditions are about as good as they can be, with low interest rates, record low unemployment and helpful government schemes like Help to Buy all helping people get on the property ladder. ""With Persimmon's participation in the Help to Buy programme under heavy scrutiny, following its former use of controversial leasing fees, and poor quality builds, these conditions have to end at some point."" Looking ahead, the company said in its results statement: ""Whilst sales expectations remain subject to a degree of uncertainty at the start of any financial year, the lack of clarity with respect to the UK's exit from the EU is currently creating additional unpredictability."" It added: ""We have worked with our suppliers to identify any material supplies which may be exposed to some disruption to availability as a result of Brexit and we are working with them to adopt appropriate mitigating measures.""

Cardinal Pell guilty of sexual offences,"This video can not be played George Pell is the most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted of such crimes Cardinal George Pell has been found guilty in Australia of sexual offences against children, making him the highest-ranking Catholic figure to receive such a conviction. Pell abused two choir boys in Melbourne's cathedral in 1996, a jury found. He had pleaded not guilty. As Vatican treasurer, the 77-year-old Australian was widely seen as the Church's third most powerful official. Pell, due to face sentencing hearings from Wednesday, has lodged an appeal. His trial was heard twice last year because a first jury failed to reach a verdict. A second jury unanimously convicted him of one charge of sexually penetrating a child under 16, and four counts of committing an indecent act on a child under 16. The verdict was handed down in December, but it could not be reported until now for legal reasons. Pell: Poisoned power at the top Who is George Pell? Why his conviction was kept a secret Inside a strictly controlled trial Pell was swarmed by media and heckled by onlookers as he left a court on Tuesday. The Vatican later confirmed that Pell was prohibited from public ministry, and had been banned from having contact with minors. He has to abide by these rules until any appeal is over. They added that while the ruling was ""painful"", and the Church has the ""utmost respect"" for the Australian authorities, Pell has the right to ""defend himself to the last degree"". The Catholic Church worldwide has in recent yearsfaced a damaging series of allegations relating to sex abuse by priests, and claims that these cases were covered up. Pope Francis has just held an unprecedented summiton paedophilia in the Church. Pell was archbishop of Melbourne in 1996 when he found the two 13-year-old boys in cathedral rooms following a mass, the County Court of Victoria was told. After telling them they were in trouble for drinking communion wine, Pell forced each boy into indecent acts, prosecutors said. He abused one of the boys again in 1997. Pell was swarmed by media as he left court on Tuesday The court heard testimony from one of the victims. The other died of a drug overdose in 2014. A jury rejected an argument by Pell's lawyer, Robert Richter QC, that the allegations were fantasies contrived by the victims. In a statement on Tuesday, Pell's surviving victim - who cannot be named - called the case stressful and ""not over yet"". The man said he had experienced ""shame, loneliness, depression and struggle"" because of the abuse. Tireless fighter against Catholic sex abuse How will the Pope tackle abuse in the Catholic Church? ""Like many survivors it has taken me years to understand the impact upon my life,"" he said. The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference said the conviction had ""shocked many across Australia and around the world"", reiterating its vow to make the Church ""a safe place for all"". Abuse survivor groups welcomed the verdict. The Vatican said the ruling was ""painful"", but added that Pell had the right to ""defend himself to the last degree"". ""We reiterate the utmost respect for Australian judicial authorities,"" spokesman Alessandro Gisotti said in a statement, which he read out in a press conference. ""In the name of this respect, we now await the outcome of the appeal process."" He added that ""Cardinal Pell has reaffirmed his innocence and has the right to defend himself to the last degree"". ""It is painful news that, we are well aware, has shocked many people, not just in Australia,"" he added. ""As we await the definitive verdict, we join the Australian bishops in praying for all victims of abuse, reaffirming our commitment to do everything possible so that the Church is a safe home for everyone, especially for children."" ""Cardinal George Pell has always maintained his innocence and continues to do so,"" read a statement issued on his behalf on Tuesday. Pell (l) was considered one of the Pope's closest advisers Pell would await the outcome of his appeal, the brief note read. Last May, a judge handed down a legal order which prevented any reporting of Pell's trial and conviction. It was designed to prevent a separate trial - which will no longer go ahead - from being influenced by the first trial. The abandoned trial was to hear unrelated allegations - strongly denied by Pell - that he had indecently assaulted boys in the 1970s. Prosecutors withdrew their case on Tuesday, citing insufficient evidence. The collapse of the second trial led to the lifting of the publication ban. How the gag order caused controversy Hywel Griffith, BBC News Australia correspondent George Pell would sit in the dock with his notebook, listening, writing, but never really betraying any emotion. As the court heard vivid descriptions of how in 1996 he had forced himself upon two victims, pushing his archbishop's robes to one side in order to expose himself, he didn't flinch. After two trials, one hung jury and many months of waiting, the results of this long process are now public. The pace of justice has felt slow at times, but it has resulted in one of the Church's most prominent figures being held to account. Read more about what happened in the courtroom The Australian cleric rose in prominence as a strong supporter of traditional Catholic values, often taking conservative views and advocating for priestly celibacy. He was summoned to Rome in 2014 to clean up the Vatican's finances, and was often described as the Church's third-ranked official. This video can not be played Pell's early court hearings drew enormous interest But his career has been dogged first by claims that he covered up child sexual abuse by priests, and then later that he was himself an abuser. Pell was demoted from the Pope's inner circle in December. His term as Vatican treasurer expired on Sunday. Profile: The cardinal convicted of abuse The sexual abuse of children was rarely discussed in public before the 1970s, and it was not until the 1980s that the first cases of molestation by priests came to light, in the US and Canada. In the decades since, evidence of widespread abuse has emerged globally. In Australia,an inquiry heard that 7% of the nation's Catholic priests had abused children. Australia sexual abuse 'a national tragedy' Abuse and the Church: What you need to know US Cardinal defrocked over abuse allegations Pope Francis has established a committee to tackle sexual abuses. In recent days,he has promised concrete action, calling clergy guilty of abuse ""tools of Satan"". But critics say he could do more to combat paedophiles and those who conceal abuse.

India jets 'hit Pakistan-based militants',"Some Indians took to the streets, burning an effigy of Pakistan, after news of the air strikes broke India says it launched air strikes against militants in Pakistani territory, in a major escalation of tensions between the two countries. The government said strikes targeted a training camp of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) group in Balakot. Pakistan said its jets had forced back the Indian planes and denied there were any casualties. Relations between the countries were strained by a militant attack on Indian troops in Kashmir earlier this month. India accuses Pakistan of allowing militant groups to operate on its territory and says Pakistani security agencies played a role in the suicide attack on 14 February, which was claimed by JeM and killed 40 Indian troops. Pakistan denies any role and says it does not provide safe haven to militants. Viewpoint: India strikes in Pakistan a major escalation What is militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad? Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Balakot is in Pakistan's north-western Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. Residents there told BBC Urdu they were woken by loud explosions. Pakistan condemned the strike and said it would respond ""at the time and place of its choosing"". The strikes are the first launched across the line of control - the de facto border that divides India-administered Kashmir from Pakistan-administered Kashmir - since a war between the two countries in 1971. Both India and Pakistan claim all of Muslim-majority Kashmir, but control only parts of it. The nuclear-armed nations have fought three wars and a limited conflict since independence from Britain in 1947 - and all but one were over Kashmir. Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale told a news conference,externalthat the strikes had killed a ""large number"" of militants, including commanders, and had avoided civilian casualties. ""Credible intel [intelligence] was received that JeM was planning more suicide attacks in India. In the face of imminent danger, a pre-emptive strike became absolutely necessary,"" he said. This video can not be played India's foreign secretary said the air strikes hit a militant training camp Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did not directly mention the air strikes when he addressed a political rally in Rajasthan later on Tuesday but he told cheering crowds: ""I understand your enthusiasm and your energy. Today is a day we bow before our heroes."" India is due to hold elections by the end of May. In Srinagar city, in Indian-administered Kashmir, residents expressed concerns over the spike in tensions. ""Whatever is happening between these two hostile neighbours, it's us who are in the middle of this war theatre,"" Shabir Aakhoon, a banker, said. Local reporter Sameer Yasir says a heavy military build-up in the past three days has caused panic. Anticipating full-scale war, civilians have stockpiled food and crowded petrol pumps, triggering traffic jams in many places, he adds. Pakistan's army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor said the strikes caused no casualties. He tweeted that Pakistani jets were scrambled and forced the Indian planes to make a ""hasty withdrawal"", dropping their payload in an open area. Allow Twitter content?

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan later convened an urgent meeting of national security chiefs and condemned ""irresponsible Indian policy"". ""Once again [the] Indian government has resorted to a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim,"" a statement issued after the meeting said. ""This action has been done for domestic consumption, being in an election environment, putting regional peace and stability at grave risk."" After Kashmir attack, what are Modi's options? Mr Khan has summoned a special meeting of the National Command Authority (NCA) - the body that oversees Pakistan's nuclear arsenal - to take place on Wednesday, officials said. Analysis by M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad The Indian air strikes that hit a target inside Pakistani territory have taken tensions to a dangerous level. In September 2016, an attack on an Indian army base in Uri created a similar situation when Delhi decided to respond with so-called ""surgical strikes"". India's claims that they airdropped special forces to destroy militant campson the Pakistani side of Kashmir were found to be largely exaggerated, but Indian troops did cross at several points along the Line of Control (LoC), inflicting some casualties on Pakistani forces. This time they have hit a target across the international border, inside Pakistani territory, at a location where a training camp of Kashmiri militants is known to have existed for several years. Pakistan's military has cordoned off the area and not even the local police are allowed in, so it will be some time before details of the attack become known. Also, Pakistani officials have been underplaying the severity of the incident by describing it as a strike ""across the LoC"", not one across the international border. Pakistan has vowed to respond but this may not go beyond diplomatic measures. However, as some observers point out, there may be punitive attacks by militants against Indian forces in Kashmir ""at an appropriate time"".

Why was the conviction kept secret?,"Pell's case has drawn huge attention around the world They were sex abuse allegations that rocked the Catholic Church and generated enormous interest - only for the case to vanish suddenly from public view for nine months. The trial and conviction of Cardinal George Pell can now be reportedafter an Australian judge lifted a legal order that had prohibited coverage. The sweeping ban, known as a suppression order, was handed down last May. It was deemed necessary to give Pell fair hearings but caused big debate. Police charged Pell with sex offences in June 2017, saying only that he faced ""historical"" allegations by ""multiple complainants"". The cardinal immediately denied any wrongdoing. Some pre-trial hearings wherePell was swamped by media outside courtwere allowed to be reported. Cardinal Pell found guilty of sexual offences How will the Pope tackle sexual abuse? Those hearings revealed for the first time that Pell faced separate accusations from the 1990s and the 1970s. Consequently, a judge ordered that two trials - with separate juries - would take place. Pell was swarmed by media during his pre-trial hearings in Melbourne last year In a bid to prevent the first trial influencing the second, the judge agreed to an immediate suppression order. It made it illegal to report that any trial was taking place. Even saying that the suppression order existed was prohibited. It allowed reporting that Pell was facing abuse allegations, but nothing more specific. The legal order legally applied only to Australia. But it effectively extended to international media which publish or broadcast into Australia, or can be accessed there, a tough thing to avoid in the internet age. That may be subject to legal debate but the judge expressed fury about some reporting. Australian outlets were generally most cautious, with journalists sitting in regularly on Pell's case and adhering to the ban. The blackout did not go totally unnoticed publicly. Social media users, for instance, frequently speculated about it. But matters escalated dramatically in December when numerous non-Australian outlets published stories reporting that Pell had been convicted. The words ""George Pell"" were soon trending online, including in Australia. A protester outside court after the reporting ban was lifted on Tuesday It prompted some of Australia's biggest newspapers to run front-page editorials criticising the suppression order. Unlike overseas media, they did not name Pell. ""The world is reading a very important story that is relevant to Victorians,"" wrote Melbourne's Herald Sun, below a headline ""CENSORED"". ""The Herald Sun is prevented from publishing details of this significant news. But trust us. It's a story you deserve to read."" Abuse and the Church: What you need to know Inquiry hears 7% of Australian Catholic priests abused children Sydney's Daily Telegraph described it as the nation's biggest story, and wrote: ""An awful crime. The person is guilty. Yet we can't publish it."" Melbourne newspaper The Age and other publications also published articles, some giving details of the case. In a specially convened court hearing on 13 December, Judge Peter Kidd said he was ""angry"" about media reports though he did not mention specific outlets. ""Given how potentially egregious and flagrant these breaches are, a number of very important people in the media are facing, if found guilty, the prospect of imprisonment and indeed substantial imprisonment,"" he told lawyers for the prosecution and defence. The judge left the matter with prosecutors to investigate. Digital versions of some front pages were later unavailable. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some say it was not but others disagree, arguing that most people did not know about Pell's conviction before Tuesday. And, ultimately, his second trial will not proceed. On Tuesday, prosecutors withdrew the charges relating to the 1970s. Lawyer Justin Quill, whose firm is acting on behalf of local media outlets, argued that judges needed to ""have more faith"" in jurors to form their view from a courtroom even if they had seen something related to the case on social media. ""For the public to not be told [about Pell's conviction] until nearly three months later is, in my view, a situation that is not appropriate,"" he told the BBC. Pope compares sex abuse to human sacrifice US cardinal defrocked over abuse allegations Cardinal says abuse files destroyed He also said courts could not ""go around charging 10,000 people for one or two comments they've made on Twitter"", adding: ""Mainstream media is being held to one standard, and the general public is being held to another - it just doesn't make sense."" Suppression orders are common in Australia unlike in other countries such as the US. But the state of Victoria in particular has come in for criticism, accounting for more than half of the country's orders, local media reports.  Critics sometimes deride it as ""The Suppression State"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

State Premier Daniel Andrews has vowed to implement 18 recommendations from a review by a retired judge that called for a ""real-world"" approach to suppression orders, given how quickly information can be spread online. ""This is about making sure the laws relating to contempt of court and suppression orders are working effectively by protecting victims, but also the public's right to know as well as court processes,"" state Attorney General Martin Pakula said in October.

Pell: Poisoned power at the top,"Cardinal Pell photographed with Pope Francis in 2015 - he was a close aide to the pontiff Last weekend's unprecedented Vatican summit on child sexual abuse was closed with a Sunday homily by Australian Mark Coleridge, the Archbishop of Brisbane. ""In sexual abuse,"" Archbishop Coleridge said, ""the powerful lay hands on the Lord'sâ¦ weakest and most vulnerable."" He could have been describing his fellow countryman, Cardinal George Pell, for there are few as powerful to have fallen from grace within the Roman Catholic Church. Pell is certainly the most senior churchman to have been convicted of offences against children. Pell was appointed by the Pope as Prefect of the Secretariat of the Economy, which effectively runs the Vatican's voluminous finances. Following his appointment, he relocated to Rome from Australia, where he had been the Archbishop of Sydney since 2001. Pell, who began a five-year term in 2014 with offices on the first floor of the Apostolic Palace, quickly set about introducing new accounting standards, established the Holy See's financial watchdog to deal with suspicious transactions, and ensured that the Vatican Bank's accounts were independently audited. Pell's rise and fall Why was Pell's conviction kept secret? Inside a strictly controlled trial A bullish figure who faced plenty of obstruction, he was known among some officials as ""Cardinal Rambo"".  But that was more a term of endearment â because Pell was having a positive impact on the church's finances. News of his conviction for child sexual abuse is a grave blow not just to the church, but also to Pope Francis personally. He was one of the Pope's closest aides. Pell was appointed to oversee the Vatican's finances in 2014 He was not only leading the crucial reform of the church's sprawling finances, but was also appointed by Francis to his nine-member Council of Cardinal Advisors, known as the C9. It was the C9 that encouraged Pope Francis to host this first-ever summit on child sexual abuse. But that was just one of many Vatican departments in which Pell played a significant role. Cardinal Pell was a member of the Congregation of Bishops, the Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples, the Congregation for the Institutes of the Consecrated Life and the Societies of Apostolic Life, and the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation. His conviction confirms that the poison of sexual abuse has infected every level of the Roman Catholic Church. Abuse and the Church: What you need to know Australia sexual abuse 'a national tragedy' Back in 2012, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard established a Royal Commission to inquire into institutional responses to child abuse in Australia. It found that 7% of priests in Australia had abused children. The charges against Pell emerged from Australia's rigorous inquiry into every institution that had access to children. The state began a process that the church itself seemed incapable of managing â and now this 77-year-old ambitious Cardinal will swap the Apostolic Palace for a jail cell. And in a final turn of providence, or coincidence, it won't even be necessary for Pope Francis to fire Cardinal Pell from office. His five-year term as Prefect of the Secretariat of the Economy expired on 24 February. Cardinal Pell guilty of child sexual abuse Why was Pell's conviction kept secret?

Inside a strictly controlled trial,"George Pell is the most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted of such crimes Reporting on a secret trial can be confronting and confusing. For several months, journalists like me have been going back and forth to Melbourne's County Court, unable to broadcast what we'd learnt about George Pell's crimes. Now the suppression order on the case has been lifted, those details can finally be made public. Outside court, there was at times high drama - all the sound and fury of cameramen jostling and campaigners brandishing placards at the cardinal as he arrived. But after the initial hearings, the crowds and the cameras petered out, and the cardinal no longer needed a police escort to sweep him into the building. Cardinal Pell: Poisoned power at the top Why Pell's conviction was kept a secret How will the Pope tackle abuse in the Catholic Church? Sex abuse and the Catholic Church Inside court, things also settled into a predictable routine. George Pell would sit in the dock with his notebook, listening, writing, but never really betraying any emotion. He was excused from standing due to a knee injury, and often sat with his legs stretched out. He wasn't called to give evidence, and so we didn't hear a word from him for the majority of the trial. As the court heard vivid descriptions of how in 1996 he had forced himself upon two victims, pushing his archbishop's robes to one side in order to expose himself, he didn't flinch Pell's case has drawn huge attention around the world The jury was told how one young boy had pleaded for Pell to let him go - only to be shocked into a silence that would last for decades. Pell's defence barrister is one of Australia's most experienced and expensive lawyers - his speeches focused on areas of doubt. Robert Richter QC repeated over and over how highly improbable - if not impossible - it would have been for any of the abuse to have occurred. Instead, he insisted that his client had become a scapegoat for the crimes of other Catholic clerics. At one stage, Mr Richter even referred to Pell as ""the Darth Vader of the Catholic Church"", painting him as a bold leader vilified by the media. Profile: Who is George Pell? Pell certainly has his critics - some came to the court to watch and see him in the dock. Although the proceedings couldn't be reported, there was nothing to stop members of the public coming in to listen. Campaigners and abuse survivors sat mixed in with the media, some sighing as they heard accounts of the abuse. Some of Pell's supporters attended too, sending sympathetic smiles in his direction, and exchanging small talk as he went in and out of the court. After two trials, one hung jury and many months of waiting - the results of this long process are now public. The pace of justice has felt slow at times, but it has resulted in one of the Catholic Church's most prominent and powerful figures being held to account.

Iran foreign minister submits resignation,"Mr Zarif played an important role negotiating the 2015 Iranian nuclear accord Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said he is stepping down, in a surprise announcement posted to his Instagram account. He apologised for ""shortcomings"" during his time in government. Mr Zarif played a prominent role in negotiating the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and major international powers. But the future of the deal has been put into doubt after US President Donald Trump ended US involvement. Mr Zarif's resignation was confirmed,externalby Iran's state-run news agency, Irna, which cited a spokesman for the foreign ministry. The 59-year-old was educated in the US and holds a PhD in international law from the University of Denver. He has served as Iran's ambassador to the UN and became foreign minister in 2013 after President Hassan Rouhani was elected promising a more moderate, outward-looking Iran. By Lyse Doucet, Chief International correspondent A cloud of speculation hangs over Javad Zarif's sudden resignation. It's not clear if President Rouhani will want to accept his departure at a time when Iran faces major challenges on every front. That decision lies with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei. Mr Zarif, a leading architect of Iran's landmark nuclear accord, has been spearheading diplomatic efforts to save it as new sanctions cause growing economic hardship. But he's under huge pressure from hardliners who never liked or trusted his negotiations with the West. There are reports Mr Zarif's move was finally triggered by his exclusion from the visit to Tehran of Syria's President Assad. Is Mr Zarif's resignation a tactic? Or is this the exit of the US-educated diplomat who became the smiling face of Iran's new engagement with the world? Some observers believe Tehran's foreign policy will start hardening in the face of a concerted campaign by Washington and its allies which Mr Zarif described, in a defiant interview last week in Munich, as all about regime change. It is far from clear. His post on Instagram thanked the Iranian people and authorities but gave no reason for the resignation. ""I apologise for not being able to continue in the post and for all the shortcomings and flaws in the period,"" he wrote. Allow Instagram content?

Unlike other major social media networks, Instagram is not blocked in Iran. It is not clear if his resignation will be accepted by President Rouhani, although the president's chief-of-staff tweeted to deny reports it had been accepted. Mr Zarif has been under pressure at home from hardliners since the US withdrew from the Iranian nuclear pact, which binds Iran to limit its nuclear activities. On Monday Syrian President Bashar al-Assad met Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the capital, Tehran, but analysts noticed that Mr Zarif did not attend discussions. Iran has been one of the Syrian government's main backers during its civil war. Apart from Russia, this trip to Tehran is thought to be Mr Assad's first foreign visit since the start of the war in 2011. The 2015 pact was was agreed by Iran, the US, the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany, and saw Iran limit its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. But President Trump called the deal ""horrible"" and argued it did not do enough to rein in Iranian nuclear activity or curb its actions abroad, such as in Syria. Last year he announced the US was pulling out of the deal and re-imposed sanctions. The other signatories in the agreement have vowed to continue and Mr Zarif had been spearheading efforts to keep it alive. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful. Its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has said Iran is honouring its commitments. Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers, with exports worth billions of dollars each year. Its economy has been under strain and the country has seen large-scale protests over rising prices and a decline in the value of its currency, the rial. Reacting to Mr Zarif's announcement, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter the Trump administration's policy towards Iran would remain ""unchanged"". Allow Twitter content?

Hollywood star launches homeless helpline,"Rough sleepers are seen on the street but charities say the real homeless number could be much higher Cameron is 18, about to move into a new flat and studying computer science at college with plans to go to university. He sounds like any other teenager but with one important difference - Cameron is rebuilding his life after becoming homeless at just 14. He is part of what one of Wales' biggest charities called a ""hidden epidemic"" of youth homelessness. Stories like his inspired actor Michael Sheen to help set up Wales' first national out-of-hours helpline. Cameron, not his real name, said his relationship with his family broke down so badly he had to leave. He slept on friends' sofas and spent a night on the streets. ""It was quite sudden, it was a lot of stress... I panicked, I didn't know where to go or what to do. It was overwhelming,"" he said. ""When I left I had a spare set of clothes and that was it. I didn't have much money or anything, it was difficult."" Michael Sheen has backed the helpline He soon felt a burden to his friends and their families and the uncertainty of what was going to happen had a devastating impact on his education. ""When things started to kick off at home, my grades were dropping and my behaviour was getting out of control,"" he said. ""In the end, the school asked me to leave, which didn't help my situation, because the problems I was having at home were a lot harder. ""I wasn't happy, I was fighting back against everyone and everything. I lost a few friends and opportunities."" 'Art helped lift me out of homelessness' Homeless man walks 8,000 miles with dog Street homelessness 'at crisis point' Cameron did not know where to find help or who to talk to - something other young people told Hollywood star Michael Sheen when he spoke with them about youth homelessness. That conversation led to the creation of the first national out of hours free helpline for young people at risk of homelessness. The Youth Homeless Helpline is now open through the night and on weekends and trained volunteers will provide information on where young people can access safe temporary accommodation and offer advice and support. Welsh Government statistics show 7,584 young people, aged between 16 and 24, approached their local authority for help with homelessness in 2017-18 - an increase of 23% from 2015. The number of young people asking for help with homelessness is increasing The charity Llamau,externalhas joined forces with other homeless charities under End Youth Homelessness Cymru. Frances Beecher, from Llamau, said: ""Homelessness is a hidden epidemic and what is so scary is that 76% of homeless young people have no idea where to turn. ""This helpline is trying to respond to what young people are asking for - a helpline in Wales and to raise understanding of problems young people are facing today."" Public donations and Nationwide Building Society have raised more than Â£90,000, securing the helpline for a year. Llamau stepped in to help Cameron and he has been living in supported accommodation and has returned to education. He is determined that his past will not shape his future. The End Youth Homelessness Cymru helpline number is 0800 328 0292. You can also gethelp and information from Llamau online,external.

North Korea's Kim arrives in Vietnam,"This video can not be played Mr Trump landed in Hanoi hours after Mr Kim arrived by car US President Donald Trump has arrived in Vietnam ahead of his second summit with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. Air Force One landed at Hanoi's Noi Bai airport hours after Mr Kim reached the Vietnamese capital by train and car. The summit, which is due to take place on Wednesday and Thursday, follows a historic first round of talks in Singapore last year. The two leaders are expected to discuss progress towards ridding the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons. Ceremonial guards had lined a red carpet laid out for Mr Kim as he arrived at Dong Dang border station on Tuesday morning. He was then driven to Hanoi, where heavy security and flag-waving crowds were waiting for him. This video can not be played Mr Kim arrived by train at the border station of Dong Dang Mr Kim is thought to be travelling with his sister Kim Yo-jong and one of his key negotiators, former General Kim Yong-chol, both familiar faces from the previous summit with Mr Trump. The journey from Pyongyang to Vietnam took more than two days and traversed about 4,000 km (2,485 miles). Had Mr Kim chosen to fly to Vietnam he would have got there in a matter of hours. As Mr Kim's train passed through China, roads were closed and train stations shut down.  Chinese social media was abuzz with road closures, traffic congestion and delayed trains. This video can not be played Kim Jong-un boards his train Vietnam's Dong Dang station was also closed to the public ahead of his arrival on Tuesday morning. He is now being driven around 170km (105mi) to Hanoi by car. It's little surprise that Mr Kim chose to take the train as this is how his grandfather, North Korea's first leader Kim ll-sung,  travelled when he went to Vietnam and Eastern Europe. That alone would have made it a highly symbolic move for the younger Mr Kim. Mr Kim's private green and yellow train has 21 bulletproof carriages and is luxurious, with plush pink leather sofas and conference rooms so the journey would not have been uncomfortable. Unlike the North Korean leader, Mr Trump travelled to Hanoi by plane. The presidential airliner Air Force One left Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, landing in the Vietnamese capital on Tuesday night local time. Details of their schedule are only just becoming clear. Mr Trump will meet Mr Kim for a brief one-on-one conversation on Wednesday evening and then they will have dinner together with their advisers, according to White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders. On Thursday, the leaders will meet for a series of back-and-forth meetings. Why Kim will be looking closely at Vietnam What North Korea can learn from Vietnam's women Trump and Kim in Hanoi: Your need-to-know guide The Hanoi meeting is expected to build on the groundwork of what was achieved at the Singapore summit last June. That meeting produced a vaguely worded agreement, with both leaders agreeing to work towards denuclearisation - though it was never made clear what this would entail. Nothing concrete was produced as a result of the first Singapore summit However, little diplomatic progress was made following the summit. North Korea crisis in 300 words WATCH: 'I really miss our leader Kim' What was agreed at the first Trump-Kim summit? This time round, both leaders will be very conscious that expectations will be high for an outcome that demonstrates tangible signs of progress. However, Mr Trump appeared to be managing expectations ahead of the summit, saying he was in ""no rush"" to press for North Korea's denuclearisation. ""I don't want to rush anybody. I just don't want testing. As long as there's no testing, we're happy,"" he said. Washington had previously said that North Korea had to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons before there could be any sanctions relief. It's an ideal location for many reasons. It has diplomatic relations with both the US and North Korea, despite once having been enemies with the US - and could be used by the US as an example of two countries working together and setting aside their past grievances. Hanoi is all geared up for the upcoming summit Ideologically, both Vietnam and North Korea are communist countries - though Vietnam has rapidly developed since and become one of the fastest growing economies in Asia, all while the party there retains absolute power.

Elon Musk may be in contempt over tweet,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has hit back at a top US financial regulator, sayingits oversight system is ""broken"",external. His comments came after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) asked the courts to hold him in contempt for violating a settlement aimed at limiting his social media comments. The rule was imposed after he upset markets in August with tweets about taking Tesla private. The judge has given Mr Musk until 11 March to formally respond. However, Mr Musk has already defended himself on Twitter. He argued thatthe offending tweet,external, a prediction of the electric car firm's production rate, replicated comments he had already made on a call with financial analysts. ""SEC forgot to read Tesla earnings transcript, which clearly states 350k to 500k. How embarrassing ..."" he wrote. ""Something is broken with SEC oversight,"" he added later. Allow Twitter content?

Last year, Mr Musk agreed that he would not make statements about Tesla's financial performance without prior agreement with the company. Elon Musk has 'no respect' for US regulator Musk out as Tesla chair over fraud case The weird and wonderful life of Elon Musk The rule was part of a settlement reached after the SEC accused Mr Musk of misleading investors with a tweet in August that claimed he had secured funding to take the firm private. US authorities also ordered Tesla and Mr Musk to pay a $20m (Â£15.2m) fine and forced Mr Musk to relinquish his role as chairman for three years. In court papers filed in New York on Monday, the SEC said Mr Musk did not follow the Twitter protocol agreed to in the settlement. It pointed to his Twitter activity last week, in which he posted an aerial picture of thousands of new Tesla vehicles, and followed that by saying he expected the firm to make 500,000 cars in 2019.

Mr Musk later clarified the tweet, saying he ""meant to say"" that he was referring to an annualized production rate - not overall deliveries. However, the SEC said the tweet was inaccurate and in breach of Mr Musk's agreement, noting that it was disseminated to more than 24 million people. ""Musk has thus violated the Court's Final Judgment by engaging in the very conduct that the preapproval provision of the Final Judgment was designed to prevent,"" the SEC wrote in its motion filed on Monday in federal court in Manhattan. The filing prompted a sell-off in Tesla shares in after-hours trading. But the price rebounded on Tuesday. The exchange renewed questions over Mr Musk's judgment, which attracted scrutiny last summer after a spate oferratic behaviour. Mr Musk has remained defiant, despite the SEC penalty and investor calls for stronger oversight. In an earlier interview with news channel CBS, he said that he had ""no respect"" for the SEC, but he had chosen to pay the settlement fine because he believed in the justice system.

Vandals decapitate 800-year-old 'Crusader',"The crusader's head was ""severed from his body and taken away"" An 800-year-old ""crusader"" from a crypt in a Dublin church has been decapitated by vandals. Archdeacon David Pierpoint said the crusader's head had been ""severed from his body and taken away"". The discovery was made as a tour guide was preparing to open the church for visitors on Monday afternoon. Archdeacon Pierpoint said he was upset and disappointed that the church had been targeted again by vandals. The crypt of St Michan's was vandalised in 1996. Archdeacon Pierpoint told RTÃ the incident was devastating for the parish and community. He said initially he was ""quite disgusted"" when he saw what had happened, but now he was ""just sad"". ""It's a sad day for the church and a sad day for humanity that someone would do such a thing."" Crusaders fought in a series of religious wars known as the Crusades which were sanctioned by the Church in the medieval period. The most commonly known of the crusades were campaigns in the eastern Mediterranean aimed at recovering the Holy Land from Muslim rule. There were seven major crusades as well as many less significant ones. The discovery was made as a tour guide was preparing to open the church for visitors on Monday Tours of the site are being cancelled for the foreseeable future. Last year about 27,000 people visited the church. In a statement, the Church of Ireland said the crypt had been badly damaged and several of the mummies, including the 400-year-old remains of a nun, had been desecrated in the incident. The crusader's body was turned over and his head was removed. Archdeacon Pierpoint said a solid steel internal gate was also taken but the immediate concern was securing the vaults. There are also concerns the remains will disintegrate in the open air as the conditions in the crypt keep them preserved. GardaÃ­ (Irish police) are examining CCTV footage from the church. The crypt of St Michan's was previously vandalised in 1996, when a group of teenagers broke in and took a number of mummified bodies from their coffins. ""They dragged them onto the ground and seemed to be playing football with their heads,"" Archdeacon Pierpoint told the Irish Times. He added: ""Thankfully at that time the guards did their jobs extremely well and they caught the perpetrators."" Following the 1996 break-in, the crypts were closed to the public for a week, while the bodies were recovered.

PM faces revolt ahead of cabinet meeting,"Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Claire Perry left Cabinet without saying anything to waiting reporters Theresa May is facing the threat of a revolt by Remain-supporting ministers who want her to rule out a no-deal Brexit. The PM has just chaired a cabinet meeting on Brexit strategy and will make a statement to MPs at 1230 GMT. Six or more Remain-supporting ministers could quit unless she rules out no-deal in her statement. But one of the PM's closest allies has warned pushing back the 29 March exit would not make getting a deal easier. The BBC's Nick Watt says the feeling is Mrs May will ""lean into"" the rebel ministers' demands and Brexiteers have been told to expect a ""very difficult message"". Live: May to update MPs on Brexit Put May's deal to public vote - Labour Brexit: All you need to know Which Brexit amendments will be tabled? She has just returned from a summit in Egypt where she held a number of meetings with EU leaders and continued to press for more concessions to placate critics of her deal, in particular onthe Irish border backstop. News of the growing unrest within the cabinet came afterLabour announced a significant shift in its policy- a decision to back another referendum if its own alternative Brexit plan is rejected. Mrs May's Brexit deal was comprehensively rejected by MPs on 15 January and she has said they'll get a second chance to vote on it - possibly with some changes - by 12 March. Margot James, Richard Harrington and Claire Perry have threatened to quit unless no deal is taken off the table But writing in the Daily Mail,external, ministers Richard Harrington, Claire Perry and Margot James said Mrs May must promise now that she will rule out the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a deal if her agreement is rejected again, and instead seek a way to delay. Mr Harrington, a business minister, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire that it was ""absolutely absurd"" that, with 31 days to go before the UK is due to leave, a no-deal exit was still a possibility. ""The idea that no deal is a negotiating tool is absolutely incorrect. No-one believes it in the EU. As far as we are concerned the responsible thing is to rule it out."" Theresa May held talks with Angela Merkel and other EU leaders at a summit in Egypt Unless Mrs May was willing to provide the necessary reassurances, he said he would vote for Parliament to ""take control"" of the process by backing an amendment - a legislative tool - being put before the Commons by Labour's Yvette Cooper and Conservative Oliver Letwin. If passed, it would give MPs the power to demand a delay to Brexit if a deal cannot be agreed by 13 March. He said he was prepared to rebel and quit, if necessary, insisting this would be the ""honourable thing"" to do. ""Warm words alone will not be enough. It has to be a clear undertaking that she is prepared to remove no-deal and have a short extension to Article 50."" Three other senior cabinet ministers, Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke, have alreadysignalled they could also be prepared to vote for the Cooper-Letwin optionif there is no breakthrough in the next few days. Mrs May has long resisted any suggestion that the UK's departure from the EU could be postponed beyond 29 March. Leading Tory Brexiteer Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet in November, said those pressuring the PM to rule out no deal should be making their views known in private. Going public showed they were ""losing their nerve"" and ""bottling"" it, she told the BBC. ""These people should not be threatening and going to the papers and weakening her hand. If they are going to go, then just go."" If the UK did leave without a formal agreement on 29 March, she said the UK and EU should enter into what she described as a short ""static period"" where everything remained the same. This, she said, would give both sides the time and space to discuss how trade would operate, such as what, if any tariffs, would apply to imports and exports. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said that calls to avoid a no-deal Brexit by delaying the deadline for leaving the EU did not resolve the issues. ""It ends up simply deferring the need to face up to taking decisions. It's not an actual course of action in its own right,"" he told the BBC. Labour has said it will support the Cooper-Letwin amendment, making its chances of success far higher. But leader Jeremy Corbyn also wants to use Wednesday to put his own plan for Brexit - which includes a ""comprehensive customs union"" with the EU and ""close alignment"" with the single market - before the Commons. He told his MPs on Monday night that if - as expected - that plan is rejected, the party will formally throw its weight behind another public vote. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said that if Labour's Brexit proposals did not get through Parliament ""we, the Labour Party will either put down ourselves, or support an amendment, in favour of a public vote"". That vote, he added, ""ought to be on the option, on the one hand, of a credible leave deal and. on the other hand, remain"".

India launches air strikes on militants,"Some Indians took to the streets, burning an effigy of Pakistan, after news of the air strikes broke India says it launched air strikes against militants in Pakistani territory, in a major escalation of tensions between the two countries. The government said strikes targeted a training camp of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) group in Balakot. Pakistan said its jets had forced back the Indian planes and denied there were any casualties. Relations between the countries were strained by a militant attack on Indian troops in Kashmir earlier this month. India accuses Pakistan of allowing militant groups to operate on its territory and says Pakistani security agencies played a role in the suicide attack on 14 February, which was claimed by JeM and killed 40 Indian troops.

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan later convened an urgent meeting of national security chiefs and condemned ""irresponsible Indian policy"". ""Once again [the] Indian government has resorted to a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim,"" a statement issued after the meeting said. ""This action has been done for domestic consumption, being in an election environment, putting regional peace and stability at grave risk."" After Kashmir attack, what are Modi's options? Mr Khan has summoned a special meeting of the National Command Authority (NCA) - the body that oversees Pakistan's nuclear arsenal - to take place on Wednesday, officials said. Analysis by M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad The Indian air strikes that hit a target inside Pakistani territory have taken tensions to a dangerous level. In September 2016, an attack on an Indian army base in Uri created a similar situation when Delhi decided to respond with so-called ""surgical strikes"". India's claims that they airdropped special forces to destroy militant campson the Pakistani side of Kashmir were found to be largely exaggerated, but Indian troops did cross at several points along the Line of Control (LoC), inflicting some casualties on Pakistani forces. This time they have hit a target across the international border, inside Pakistani territory, at a location where a training camp of Kashmiri militants is known to have existed for several years. Pakistan's military has cordoned off the area and not even the local police are allowed in, so it will be some time before details of the attack become known. Also, Pakistani officials have been underplaying the severity of the incident by describing it as a strike ""across the LoC"", not one across the international border. Pakistan has vowed to respond but this may not go beyond diplomatic measures. However, as some observers point out, there may be punitive attacks by militants against Indian forces in Kashmir ""at an appropriate time"".

Anticipating full-scale war, civilians have stockpiled food and crowded petrol pumps, triggering traffic jams in many places, he adds. Pakistan's army spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor said the strikes caused no casualties. He tweeted that Pakistani jets were scrambled and forced the Indian planes to make a ""hasty withdrawal"", dropping their payload in an open area. Allow Twitter content?

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan later convened an urgent meeting of national security chiefs and condemned ""irresponsible Indian policy"". ""Once again [the] Indian government has resorted to a self-serving, reckless and fictitious claim,"" a statement issued after the meeting said. ""This action has been done for domestic consumption, being in an election environment, putting regional peace and stability at grave risk."" After Kashmir attack, what are Modi's options? Mr Khan has summoned a special meeting of the National Command Authority (NCA) - the body that oversees Pakistan's nuclear arsenal - to take place on Wednesday, officials said. Analysis by M Ilyas Khan, BBC News, Islamabad The Indian air strikes that hit a target inside Pakistani territory have taken tensions to a dangerous level. In September 2016, an attack on an Indian army base in Uri created a similar situation when Delhi decided to respond with so-called ""surgical strikes"". India's claims that they airdropped special forces to destroy militant campson the Pakistani side of Kashmir were found to be largely exaggerated, but Indian troops did cross at several points along the Line of Control (LoC), inflicting some casualties on Pakistani forces. This time they have hit a target across the international border, inside Pakistani territory, at a location where a training camp of Kashmiri militants is known to have existed for several years. Pakistan's military has cordoned off the area and not even the local police are allowed in, so it will be some time before details of the attack become known. Also, Pakistani officials have been underplaying the severity of the incident by describing it as a strike ""across the LoC"", not one across the international border. Pakistan has vowed to respond but this may not go beyond diplomatic measures. However, as some observers point out, there may be punitive attacks by militants against Indian forces in Kashmir ""at an appropriate time"".

UN to make record aid appeal for Yemen,"An evaluation mission from the World Food Programme reached the Red Sea Mills UN aid officials have for the first time in six months reached a vast store of desperately-needed food on the frontline in Yemen's Hudaydah port. The Red Sea Mills facility holds enough grain to feed 3.7 million people for a month, but the UN had warned the grain was at risk of rotting. The Yemeni government and the rebel Houthi movement agreed a ceasefire around Hudaydah in December. But they have yet to implement a UN-brokered plan to pull out of the port. UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres announced that a World Food Programme evaluation mission had been able to reach the Red Sea Mills at the start of an aid pledging conference in Geneva on Tuesday. Why is there a war in Yemen? Shaky truce in Hudaydah Member states have so far promised $2.6bn (Â£2bn) - a 30% increase on the amount pledged at a similar conference last year, but $1.6bn short of the total the UN hopes to raise. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the biggest potential donors this year, having pledged $500m each. This video can not be played The hidden victims of the Yemen war The two countries are leading a coalition of mostly Sunni Arab states that intervened in the conflict in Yemen in March 2015 and imposed a partial blockade after President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi was forced to flee abroad by the Houthis - a group they consider to be a proxy of regional Shia power Iran. Tens of thousands of people have been killed or injured since then, many of them civilians. Many more have died from preventable diseases, exacerbated by malnutrition. The UN estimates that 24 million people - 80% of Yemen's population - are in need of assistance. Up to 10 million of them are believed to be on the verge of famine. By Lyse Doucet, BBC chief international correspondent Finally getting access to the Red Sea Mills is a breakthrough. When we visited this vital granary in January we saw how Yemen's desperately needed grain was at risk of rotting. But the UN needs sustained access. That requires progress on promises made in December's Stockholm Agreement. Sources say they are now more hopeful the Houthis' long-delayed pull out from the main port of Hudaydah and two smaller ports will soon commence. This video can not be played Where the fighting in Yemen has stopped... but not the suffering That should lead to the phased redeployment of Yemeni government forces backed by the Saudi-led coalition. Both sides have been dragging their feet, raising fears this rare deal will collapse. There is no trust, and much tension. And, away from this strategic corner of Yemen, fighting intensifies in some areas, and the risk of famine still looms. There seems to be - at last - a greater recognition on all sides that there is no military solution to this conflict. But moving toward peace is still fraught with risk. The charity MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res said it was ironic,externalthat many of the governments announcing donations at the Geneva conference were involved in the war in Yemen ""Donor governments pledging funds must work to resolve the obstacles that are preventing aid from reaching the people who need it, and to ensure that the aid delivered responds to their actual needs,"" it said in a statement. ""Ultimately, Yemen's humanitarian crisis can only be resolved when donor governments end their involvement in the war and hold the warring parties accountable for their atrocious conduct endangering the lives of millions."" The Norwegian Refugee Council meanwhile said the pledges of donations fell short of what was required,externalto help all those in need. ""While billions are spent on bombs and weapons bringing death and destruction, much less is made available to save lives of Yemeni civilians,"" said Mohamed Abdi, its Yemen country director. Why is there a war in Yemen? Billions raised for Yemen, where's it all going?

PM 'faces revolt' ahead of cabinet meeting,"Amber Rudd, David Gauke and Claire Perry left Cabinet without saying anything to waiting reporters Theresa May is facing the threat of a revolt by Remain-supporting ministers who want her to rule out a no-deal Brexit. The PM has just chaired a cabinet meeting on Brexit strategy and will make a statement to MPs at 1230 GMT. Six or more Remain-supporting ministers could quit unless she rules out no-deal in her statement. But one of the PM's closest allies has warned pushing back the 29 March exit would not make getting a deal easier. The BBC's Nick Watt says the feeling is Mrs May will ""lean into"" the rebel ministers' demands and Brexiteers have been told to expect a ""very difficult message"". Live: May to update MPs on Brexit Put May's deal to public vote - Labour Brexit: All you need to know Which Brexit amendments will be tabled? She has just returned from a summit in Egypt where she held a number of meetings with EU leaders and continued to press for more concessions to placate critics of her deal, in particular onthe Irish border backstop. News of the growing unrest within the cabinet came afterLabour announced a significant shift in its policy- a decision to back another referendum if its own alternative Brexit plan is rejected. Mrs May's Brexit deal was comprehensively rejected by MPs on 15 January and she has said they'll get a second chance to vote on it - possibly with some changes - by 12 March. Margot James, Richard Harrington and Claire Perry have threatened to quit unless no deal is taken off the table But writing in the Daily Mail,external, ministers Richard Harrington, Claire Perry and Margot James said Mrs May must promise now that she will rule out the possibility of the UK leaving the EU without a deal if her agreement is rejected again, and instead seek a way to delay. Mr Harrington, a business minister, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire that it was ""absolutely absurd"" that, with 31 days to go before the UK is due to leave, a no-deal exit was still a possibility. ""The idea that no deal is a negotiating tool is absolutely incorrect. No-one believes it in the EU. As far as we are concerned the responsible thing is to rule it out."" Theresa May held talks with Angela Merkel and other EU leaders at a summit in Egypt Unless Mrs May was willing to provide the necessary reassurances, he said he would vote for Parliament to ""take control"" of the process by backing an amendment - a legislative tool - being put before the Commons by Labour's Yvette Cooper and Conservative Oliver Letwin. If passed, it would give MPs the power to demand a delay to Brexit if a deal cannot be agreed by 13 March. He said he was prepared to rebel and quit, if necessary, insisting this would be the ""honourable thing"" to do. ""Warm words alone will not be enough. It has to be a clear undertaking that she is prepared to remove no-deal and have a short extension to Article 50."" Three other senior cabinet ministers, Greg Clark, Amber Rudd and David Gauke, have alreadysignalled they could also be prepared to vote for the Cooper-Letwin optionif there is no breakthrough in the next few days. Mrs May has long resisted any suggestion that the UK's departure from the EU could be postponed beyond 29 March. Leading Tory Brexiteer Esther McVey, who quit the cabinet in November, said those pressuring the PM to rule out no deal should be making their views known in private. Going public showed they were ""losing their nerve"" and ""bottling"" it, she told the BBC. ""These people should not be threatening and going to the papers and weakening her hand. If they are going to go, then just go."" If the UK did leave without a formal agreement on 29 March, she said the UK and EU should enter into what she described as a short ""static period"" where everything remained the same. This, she said, would give both sides the time and space to discuss how trade would operate, such as what, if any tariffs, would apply to imports and exports. Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said that calls to avoid a no-deal Brexit by delaying the deadline for leaving the EU did not resolve the issues. ""It ends up simply deferring the need to face up to taking decisions. It's not an actual course of action in its own right,"" he told the BBC. Labour has said it will support the Cooper-Letwin amendment, making its chances of success far higher. But leader Jeremy Corbyn also wants to use Wednesday to put his own plan for Brexit - which includes a ""comprehensive customs union"" with the EU and ""close alignment"" with the single market - before the Commons. He told his MPs on Monday night that if - as expected - that plan is rejected, the party will formally throw its weight behind another public vote. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said that if Labour's Brexit proposals did not get through Parliament ""we, the Labour Party will either put down ourselves, or support an amendment, in favour of a public vote"". That vote, he added, ""ought to be on the option, on the one hand, of a credible leave deal and. on the other hand, remain"". Tuesday Crucial cabinet meeting to focus on the Brexit impasse Theresa May gives a statement to the House of Commons updating them on her progress Meanwhile, members of her negotiating team return to Brussels to continue talks Wednesday MPs get another chance to debate Brexit Speaker John Bercow chooses which amendments - proposals for alternative strategies - get a hearing Then MPs cast their votes on those amendments Please upgrade your browser What does Corbyn's announcement mean?

Kelly has been released from a Chicago jail after posting his $100,000 (Â£76,000) bail, a Cook County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman said. Earlier on Monday he pleaded not guilty to 10 charges of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against four women, three of whom were minors at the time. The 52-year-old, dressed in a blue coat, did not speak to media as he was escorted from jail by his lawyer. He had turned himself in to police on Friday and spent the weekend in jail. The singer has faced decades of sexual abuse claims without being convicted, and has denied all previous allegations. Cook County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Sophia Ansari confirmed on Monday night R. Kelly had raised the $100,000 bail, which was 10% of the $1m bond set by a judge over the weekend. His court appearance and plea came weeks after the documentary series Surviving R Kelly aired. It contained allegations of abuse from many women including the star's former wife. R. Kelly on $1m bail over abuse charges The history of allegations against R. Kelly He is being tried for sexual assaults alleged to have happened since 1998. He met one of the four women at a restaurant on her 16th birthday, and another - who was also 16 - when she asked for his autograph. R. Kelly was seen leaving jail after posting bail on Monday night The court ordered the singer, whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, to surrender his passport and to have no contact with anyone under the age of 18. He had reportedly struggled to pay the $100,000 bail payment required to leave Cook County Jail.

Who is George Pell?,"Pell has previously given evidence to inquiries into abuse by priests in Australia Cardinal George Pell's child sexual abuse conviction has rocked the Catholic Church, where for years he has been one of its highest-ranked officials. It has had the same effect in Australia, Pell's home nation, where his career began decades ago. The cleric made his name as a determined figure who championed traditional Catholic values and conservative views against same-sex marriage, abortion and contraception. But his career has been dogged first by claims that he covered up child sexual abuse by priests, and then later that he himself was an abuser. He has always denied any wrongdoing, but has been jailed for six year years after being found guilty of abusing two boys in 1996. Cardinal Pell guilty of sexual offences Poisoned power at the top Why Pell's conviction was kept a secret Pell was born in the city of Ballarat, near Melbourne, Victoria, in 1941, the son of an Anglican father and an Irish Roman Catholic mother. His early education was at Loreto Convent and later at St Patrick's College where he excelled in sports, particularly Australian Rules football. Such was his prowess on the football field that towards the end of his studies he signed a contract with Richmond Football Club, but then switched his attention to the priesthood. He later said he had tried to fight his calling for a long time. Pope John Paul II appointed Pell a cardinal in 2003 Pell began his training for the priesthood in 1960 at Corpus Christi College, the regional seminary for Victoria and Tasmania, and in 1963 went to Rome to continue his studies. He was ordained at St Peter's Basilica in Rome in 1966 and went on to take a doctorate in Church history in Oxford. He returned to Australia in 1971, taking a post as an assistant priest in Swan Hill, Victoria, and then at parishes in and around Ballarat. By 1996, he had risen to be archbishop of Melbourne, where he was responsible for initiating one of the Church's first programmes directly responding to claims of child sexual abuse. The plan, called the Melbourne Response, offered modest pay-outs to victims, and was criticised by some who said it was designed to discourage cases in the courts. But supporters called it a pro-active measure to tackle abuse. He was later appointed archbishop of Sydney, before Pope John Paul II nominated him to the Vatican's College of Cardinals in 2003, a position that allowed him to vote in papal elections. Pell and then Australian PM Kevin Rudd welcomed Pope Benedict to Australia in 2008 In 2014, Cardinal Pell was summoned to Rome to become chief of the Vatican's finances, a new position created by Pope Francis in the wake of scandals at the Vatican Bank. But he left behind growing anger over revelations of child sex abuse by members of the Catholic clergy in Australia. Cardinal Pell repeatedly faced allegations from abuse victims of a cover-up and his critics accused him of appearing aloof and arrogant. He was accused of moving one notorious paedophile priest - Gerald Ridsdale - around parishes rather than reporting him, and of attempting to bribe one of the victims to keep quiet. Victims of abuse by priests in Australia have been highly critical of Pell He strongly denied any wrongdoing but said he could have done more to investigate claims of abuse. Pell has also denied subsequent allegations that he himself committed abuse in Ballarat in the 1970s. Prosecutors have withdrawn charges charges against him relating to that era. But he was convicted for abusing two choir boys in a Melbourne cathedral in 1996, during his time as the archbishop of the city. Ina video of Pell's first police interview in relation to the 1996 allegations, which was recorded in 2016 but released this year, Pell describes the accusations at the time as ""a load of absolute disgraceful rubbish... madness"". He was placed on a leave of absence from the Vatican in June 2017. Pell was demoted from Pope Francis' inner circle in December. He was sentenced to six years in prison by a Victorian court in March, but immediately lodged an appeal.

The Pope's biggest challenge,"In an effort to deal with the sex scandals rocking the Roman Catholic Church, the Pope has convened an extraordinary summit of bishops in Rome. This follows his recent, unprompted, admission that priests had exploited nuns as ""sex slaves"" at a convent in France. Pope Francis decided to call this global conference after discussions with the so-called C9. This is the group of nine cardinal advisers who were appointed soon after Francis was elected. The Pope is under serious pressure to provide leadership and generate workable solutions to what is the most pressing crisis facing the modern Church. Stories of abuse have emerged in every corner of the world. And the Church has been accused of covering up crimes committed by priests, leaving its moral authority in tatters. Pope Francis must also confront the assumptions, attitudes and practices that have allowed a culture of abuse to flourish. The extent of this challenge may prove overwhelming. Journalist Jason Berry was one of the first people to expose the extent of abuse in the Church The summit, to be attended by the heads of all national bishops' conferences from more than 130 countries, is only the beginning of an attempt to address a sickness that has been poisoning the Church since at least the 1980s. When Jason Berry, a local newspaper reporter in the US state of Louisiana, began following the story of an abusive priest called Father Gilbert Gauthe, he did not expect his work to ignite an international scandal that is still ablaze more than 30 years later. Mr Berry's work led to the 1992 book Lead Us Not Into Temptation, based on civil legal actions that the Church settled with multiple accusers towards the end of the 1980s. In 2002, Mr Berry's work was followed by an investigation at the Boston Globe newspaper that provided an even more extensive narrative of clergy abuse and cover-up. The journalists won a prestigious Pulitzer Prize and their work was dramatised in the film Spotlight. The work of the Boston Globe's Michael Rezendes, (left), Walter V Robinson, and Sacha Pfeiffer (right) led to the Academy Award-winning film Spotlight The scandals kept coming. Consider six of the eight Roman Catholic dioceses in the state of Pennsylvania, which were the subject of scrutiny last year. The State Attorney, Josh Shapiro, subpoenaed and reviewed half a million internal diocesan documents. Dozens of witnesses gave evidence, some clergy admitted to their offences. Mr Shapiro's report, published in December, was devastating. ""Over 1,000 child victims were identifiable from the Church's own records,"" he wrote, with ""credible allegations against over 300 predator priests"". The report, which is more than 1,000 pages long, covers the past 70 years - and the examples are horrific. Pope admits clerical abuse of nuns including sexual slavery Child sexual abuse and the Catholic Church: What you need to know Pope Francis condemns child sex abuse and Church cover-ups In the diocese of Scranton, a priest raped a girl and when she became pregnant arranged for an abortion. The priest's line manager, his area bishop, wrote a letter. ""This is a very difficult time in your life and I realise how upset you are,"" he wrote. ""I too share your grief."" The letter was not addressed to the girl, but the priest. In another diocese, a priest visited a seven-year-old girl in hospital after she had undergone a tonsillectomy - and raped her. In another, a priest abused a nine-year-old and then rinsed out the boy's mouth with holy water ""to purify him"". The report concluded that predatory paedophiles had been able to abuse children because the Church hid their activities by moving accused clerics on to other parishes and not reporting their offences to the police. The Rt Rev Franco Mulakkal had risen from small-town Kerala, on India's south-west coast, to become a bishop in the north of the country. He was arrested in September 2018, following allegations from a nun that he regularly visited her convent in order to rape her. The bishop, who has temporarily stood down from ministry, has denied all the charges, telling reporters the accusations are ""baseless and concocted"". Catholic nuns in Kerala, India, are calling for the arrest of the Rt Rev Franco Mulakkal, of Jalandhar, for alleged rape In a letter, written by the nun to her superiors, she claimed the first rape had happened in May 2014 and the last in September 2016. In January, the nuns appealed to the chief minister of Kerala to intervene on their behalf, after Church officials allegedly ordered them to leave the state, in an effort to clean up the mess. Nuns have complained that they are exploited because they are often reliant upon priests and bishops for their accommodation and fear abandonment if they fight back against abusive clergy. In Malawi, where HIV prevalence among adults up to the age of 64 is more than 10%, nuns are also alleged to have been targeted because they are regarded as ""pure"" and much less likely to be carrying the virus. In 2012, the Australian government announced a Royal Commission, which was charged with investigating institutional responses to child abuse. The organisations involved included residential care centres for young people, schools, sports, arts and other community groups, and the Church. The commission concluded that 7% of Australia's Roman Catholic priests had allegedly abused children between 1950 and 2010. In one religious order, the St John of God Brothers, 40% of its leaders were accused of abusing children. Chrissie Foster, the mother of two children who were abused by priests in Melbourne, complained to the authorities. She told BBC News that instead of addressing her concerns, the family became the subject of a whispering campaign. ""They said that we were liars, that we were after money,"" she said. ""That's what they would say to parishioners. And parishioners would believe [it] because who would believe that a priest would rape a child?  It was much easier to believe that lie than the truth that priests were sexually abusing children."" In August 2018, the Roman Catholic Church in Australia published its formal response to the Royal Commission. Chrissie Foster is the mother of two children who were abused by priests in Melbourne, Australia Archbishop the Most Reverend Mark Coleridge, president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, said that ""far too many"" clergy, religious and lay people within the Church in Australia had ""failed in their duty to protect and honour the dignity of all including and especially the most vulnerable, our children and our young people"". ""With one voice, the bishops and the leaders of religious orders here this morning make the pledge, 'Never again,'"" he said. Last summer, Britain's Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse published a report on two of the most prestigious Roman Catholic schools in the UK: Ampleforth College, in North Yorkshire, and Downside School, in Somerset. According to the report, the schools ""prioritised the monks and their own reputations over the protection of children"" and ""appalling abuse was inflicted over decades on children as young as seven at Ampleforth and 11 at Downside"". The inquiry heard witness testimony from those who were forced into sexual acts, sometimes in the presence of fellow pupils. In conclusion, the report found that ""many perpetrators did not hide their sexual interests from the children"". ""The blatant openness of these activities demonstrates there was a culture of acceptance of abusive behaviour,"" it said. Following publication, Ampleforth said the ""abbey and college wishes to repeat their heartfelt apology to all victims and survivors of abuse"". Downside expressed similar regret, saying: ""The abbey and school fully acknowledges the serious failings and mistakes made in both protecting those within our care and responding to safeguarding concerns."" Downside Abbey and school apologised for failing its pupils For an organisation that numbers more than 1.2 billion adherents and is present in virtually every country on Earth, the focus is now firmly fixed on Pope Francis. When he was elected, in March 2013, the Pope was fully aware of the impact of clerical abuse scandals on the Church. Within a year, in July 2014, he met six victims from three countries - two people each from Ireland, Britain and Germany. At a private Mass, with the six victims among the congregation, he offered an explicit apology. ""Before God and his people, I express my sorrow for the sins and grave crimes of clerical sexual abuse committed against you,"" Pope Francis said during his homily, published later by the Vatican. A demonstration near the Vatican in support of the victims of paedophile priests ""And I humbly ask forgiveness. I beg your forgiveness, too, for the sins of omission on the part of Church leaders who did not respond adequately to reports of abuse made by family members, as well as by abuse victims themselves."" Soon after, Pope Francis added eight new members to the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, from Africa, Oceania, Asia, and South America. But this body was soon hit by defections. The only two individuals on the commission who'd been victims of abuse, Marie Collins and Peter Saunders, resigned. Marie Collins, who was molested by a priest when she was 13, wrote a letter saying that while the Pope may have wanted to address clerical abuse, the Vatican's bureaucracy kept obstructing proposals for change. After the commission made a recommendation that all correspondence from victims and survivors should receive a response, she discovered that none had received replies. ""I find it impossible to listen to public statements about the deep concern in the Church for the care of those whose lives have been blighted by abuse,"" she wrote, ""yet to watch privately as a congregation in the Vatican refuses to even acknowledge their letters."" She concluded with these words: ""It is a reflection of how this whole abuse crisis in the Church has been handled: with fine words in public and contrary actions behind closed doors."" Clerical abuse survivor Marie Collins resigned from the Church's commission for the protection of minors Pope Francis has decided to open the doors, convening an unprecedented summit to address the issue. But he's already tried to reduce expectations by warning the media, during the flight back to Rome from the United Arab Emirates, that a three-day conference represents only the beginning of a conversation. Others have argued that he should simply issue an edict for the Church to follow. But implementing universal protocols is challenging because the Church exists in a range of cultures and judicial systems. It's hard to imagine a more pressing challenge for the 82-year-old pontiff. His pontificate began with widespread enthusiasm for a man who chose pastoral appeal over pomp and ceremony, humility and compassion over the trappings of status. But how it ends is likely to depend on the action he takes, and the protocols he implements, to deal with the scourge of abuse.

Green Book Oscar win proves divisiveFive most inspiring momentsWhich Oscars outfits have caused a stir?VideoVideoA-listers on the Oscars red carpet,"This video can not be played Spike Lee on why Green Book, which stars Mahershala Ali, was ""not my cup of tea"" Spike Lee did not do much to hide his displeasure when Green Book beat his film and six others to this year's best picture Oscar. According to one report,external, the BlacKkKlansman director tried to storm out of the Dolby Theatre when the winner was read out by Julia Roberts. ""I thought I was courtside at the [Madison Square] Garden and the ref made a bad call,"" Lee later told reporters, saying the film was ""not his cup of tea"". ""I'm snake-bit,"" he joked, using a euphemism for experiencing failure or bad luck. ""Every time somebody's driving somebody, I lose."" His comment was a reference to Driving Miss Daisy, winner of the best picture Oscar in 1990 and a film to which Green Book has been compared. Lee's film Do the Right Thing was nominated for two Oscars in 1990 - best original screenplay and best supporting actor - but missed out on both. Colman and Green Book win Oscars Oscars 2019: As it happened Oscars 2019: Winners in full In Green Book, an African-American classical pianist is driven around the American south of the 1960s by an Italian-American chauffeur. In Driving Miss Daisy, an elderly Southern matron grudgingly agrees to be chauffeured by an African-American driver. ""They changed the seating arrangement!"" said Lee of Green Book, which also won Oscars for its screenplay and for supporting actor Mahershala Ali. Black Panther star Chadwick Boseman also expressed disappointment as Green Book director Peter Farrelly and his predominantly white production team took to the stage. Allow Twitter content?

Justin Chang from the Los Angeles Times was particularly scathing of Green Book's triumph, calling it ""the worst best picture Oscar winner since Crash,external."" Crash, a multi-stranded drama about race relations in contemporary Los Angeles, was the widely reviled winner of the best picture award in 2006. ""Green Book is about as traditional a choice as you can get,"" wrote The Independent's Clarisse Loughrey, describing its win as ""a case of the same old, same old,external"". The film, which was released in the UK earlier this month, takes its title from a guidebook African-American travellers once used to negotiate the United States. Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali as Tony Vallelonga and Don Shirley So what is it about Farrelly's film that has rubbed so many the wrong way? For many, it's the idea that the film perpetuates the ""white saviour"" trope that can be found in so many Hollywood films about bigotry and intolerance. Ali's character, real-life musician Don Shirley, is pivotal to the story. Yet its real protagonist is Viggo Mortensen's Tony ""The Lip"" Vallelonga, a bouncer-cum-bodyguard whose friendship with Shirley makes him wise up to his own racial prejudices. According to Vox's criticTodd VanDerWerff,external, the film ""lets white folks off the hook for whatever responsibility we bear for the crushing weight of systemic racism"". The film has also been criticised for its use of a so-called""magical negro"" figure,externalwhose sole function is to facilitate positive change in a white character. Green Book won the People's Choice award at last year's Toronto Film Festival - an award seen by many as a reliable indicator of Oscar glory. Yet the film would soon run into a number of public relations potholes that made last night's win seem like a remote possibility. First came Mortensen's use of 'the N-word' in a post-screening Q&A session, an incident for which he issueda fulsome apology,external. Then came criticism from members of Shirley's family, who dismissed the film as ""a symphony of lies,external"" that exaggerated Vallelonga's relationship with his employer. Nick Vallelonga with two of Green Book's Oscars In January, Farrelly issued his own apology forexposing his penisto colleagues in the late 1990s, saying he had been ""an idiot"" and that he was now ""deeply sorry"". More contrition followedfrom Vallelonga's son Nick, one of Green Book's writers, over a 2015 tweet in which he claimed he had seen Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the 9/11 attacks. Controversy dogged Green Book all the way to the Oscar ceremony itself, with some questioning whether it was right to have veteran congressmanJohn Lewis present its best picture citation,external. The US author and journalistRaquel Cepeda,externalwrote that President Donald Trump ""would have been a better peddler of Green Book's saccharine propaganda"". Yet it would be wrong to say the film is entirely without friends. ""I don't care about what they say, Green Book is a such a fantastic movie and deserved that freaking Oscar!""tweeted,externalone defiant fan on Monday.

Five most inspiring momentsWhich Oscars outfits have caused a stir?VideoVideoA-listers on the Oscars red carpet,"Other than crazy red carpet moments and glamorous gowns, the Oscars is often a chance for actors to inspire fans with their speeches.

""Be heroes of your own stories"" - Constance Wu Wu presented the award for best original song alongside Black Panther's Chadwick Boseman When chatting to Ryan Seacrest on the red carpet, Wu described Crazy Rich Asians as a ""historic"" moment, as it saw a major studio telling a story centred on her experience as an Asian-American. ""To be something like that for young women today,"" she said, ""to let them know they can be heroes of their own stories and their stories are worthy and interesting and people want to know themâ¦ that has been so meaningful to me."" 3. ""We're longing for stories like this"" - Rami Malek Rami is the champion, my friends As Rami Malek accepted his award for best actor for his performance in Bohemian Rhapsody, he said the film might offer hope to those struggling with their identity. ""We made a film about a gay man, an immigrant, who lived his life unapologetically himself,"" he said. ""And the fact that I'm celebrating him and this story with you is proof that we're longing for stories like this."" He also embraced being ""the son of immigrants from Egypt"" and a ""first-generation American"". 4. ""To all the nerdy girls out there that hide behind their sketch books, don't be afraid"" - Domee Shi Winners Becky Neiman-Cobb (L) and Domee Shi at the Vanity Fair Oscars party Chinese-Canadian animator Domee Shi collected an Academy Award for best animated short for her directorial debut, Bao. The Disney-Pixar film resonated with many Asian communities around the world for representing their culture and heritage. In her acceptance speech, Shi gave a shout out to all the ""nerdy girls"" in the world. ""To all the nerdy girls out there that hide behind their sketch books, don't be afraid to tell your stories to the world!"" she said. ""You're gonna creep them out but you're probably gonna connect with them too and that's an amazing feeling to have."" 5. ""Having the dream is easy, making it come true is hard"" - Serena Williams While Serena Williams may not be an actress or singer, she knows a thing or two about what it's like to become a star.

""Having the dream is easy, making it come true is hard."" As her speech drew to a close, she said: ""There's the rush of fame, the pressure of success, and the heartache that comes with sacrificing love for career... or career for love.""

Iran's foreign minister suddenly quits,"Mr Zarif played an important role negotiating the 2015 Iranian nuclear accord Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif has said he is stepping down, in a surprise announcement posted to his Instagram account. He apologised for ""shortcomings"" during his time in government. Mr Zarif played a prominent role in negotiating the landmark 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and major international powers. But the future of the deal has been put into doubt after US President Donald Trump ended US involvement. Mr Zarif's resignation was confirmed,externalby Iran's state-run news agency, Irna, which cited a spokesman for the foreign ministry. The 59-year-old was educated in the US and holds a PhD in international law from the University of Denver. He has served as Iran's ambassador to the UN and became foreign minister in 2013 after President Hassan Rouhani was elected promising a more moderate, outward-looking Iran. By Lyse Doucet, Chief International correspondent A cloud of speculation hangs over Javad Zarif's sudden resignation. It's not clear if President Rouhani will want to accept his departure at a time when Iran faces major challenges on every front. That decision lies with Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei. Mr Zarif, a leading architect of Iran's landmark nuclear accord, has been spearheading diplomatic efforts to save it as new sanctions cause growing economic hardship. But he's under huge pressure from hardliners who never liked or trusted his negotiations with the West. There are reports Mr Zarif's move was finally triggered by his exclusion from the visit to Tehran of Syria's President Assad. Is Mr Zarif's resignation a tactic? Or is this the exit of the US-educated diplomat who became the smiling face of Iran's new engagement with the world? Some observers believe Tehran's foreign policy will start hardening in the face of a concerted campaign by Washington and its allies which Mr Zarif described, in a defiant interview last week in Munich, as all about regime change. It is far from clear. His post on Instagram thanked the Iranian people and authorities but gave no reason for the resignation. ""I apologise for not being able to continue in the post and for all the shortcomings and flaws in the period,"" he wrote. Allow Instagram content?

Unlike other major social media networks, Instagram is not blocked in Iran. It is not clear if his resignation will be accepted by President Rouhani, although the president's chief-of-staff tweeted to deny reports it had been accepted. Mr Zarif has been under pressure at home from hardliners since the US withdrew from the Iranian nuclear pact, which binds Iran to limit its nuclear activities. On Monday Syrian President Bashar al-Assad met Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the capital, Tehran, but analysts noticed that Mr Zarif did not attend discussions. Iran has been one of the Syrian government's main backers during its civil war. Apart from Russia, this trip to Tehran is thought to be Mr Assad's first foreign visit since the start of the war in 2011. The 2015 pact was was agreed by Iran, the US, the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany, and saw Iran limit its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. But President Trump called the deal ""horrible"" and argued it did not do enough to rein in Iranian nuclear activity or curb its actions abroad, such as in Syria. Last year he announced the US was pulling out of the deal and re-imposed sanctions. The other signatories in the agreement have vowed to continue and Mr Zarif had been spearheading efforts to keep it alive. Iran insists its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful. Its compliance with the deal has been verified by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which has said Iran is honouring its commitments. Iran is one of the world's largest oil producers, with exports worth billions of dollars each year. Its economy has been under strain and the country has seen large-scale protests over rising prices and a decline in the value of its currency, the rial. Reacting to Mr Zarif's announcement, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Twitter the Trump administration's policy towards Iran would remain ""unchanged"". Allow Twitter content?

Alabama editor in KKK row replaced,"Elecia Dexter will take over the roles of editor and publisher of the Democrat-Reporter An African-American woman will replace the editor of an Alabama newspaper who came under fire last week after calling for mass lynchings of Democrats. Elecia Dexter, 46, will take over as the Democrat-Reporter's editor and publisher, ""moving the paper into a new direction"", the paper said on Thursday. Longtime editor Goodloe Sutton, who made the comments about raiding Washington DC, still owns the paper. Alabama lawmakers applauded Sutton's departure and replacement. ""The Democrat-Reporter has provided the community of West Alabama with quality news for over 140 years and you may have full confidence that Ms Dexter will continue in this tradition as well as moving the paper into a new direction,"" the newspaper said in a statement to US media. The announcement noted Dexter was entering her role ""at a pivotal"" and ""challenging"" time. US editor calls for KKK to lynch Democrats Why US right-wing groups are on the rise It added that the newspaper had always been devoted to ""integrity and excellence in journalism"" under the leadership of Sutton and his wife, Jean. However, there was no apology from Sutton for his 14 February ""Klan needs to ride again"" article. Goodloe Sutton had received nationwide praise for his journalism in the 1990s The Ku Klux Klan (KKK) is one of the oldest white supremacy groups in the US, formed just after the Civil War. The group was behind many of the lynchings, rapes and violent attacks on African Americans in the 1900s, and there are still some 5,000 to 8,000 members across the country,according to the Southern Poverty Law Center,external. Sutton had called for the KKK to raid gated communities in Washington DC in retaliation for Democrats proposing higher taxes, and later insisted he only wanted to hang ""socialist-communists"". The op-ed went viral last week, receiving nationwide condemnation, but it was not the first time Sutton published racist opinion pieces in his paper. In 2017, an anonymous editorial,externaldiscussing the topic of NFL players kneeling in protest of racism said: ""That's what black folks were taught to do two hundreds years ago, kneel before a white man...Let them kneel!"" KKK members gather for a cross burning in 1994 Alabama lawmakers who had called for Sutton to step down were pleased at Dexter's appointment to the position. Senator Doug Jones tweeted: ""Good riddance Goodloe."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Why was Pell's conviction kept secret?,"Pell's case has drawn huge attention around the world They were sex abuse allegations that rocked the Catholic Church and generated enormous interest - only for the case to vanish suddenly from public view for nine months. The trial and conviction of Cardinal George Pell can now be reportedafter an Australian judge lifted a legal order that had prohibited coverage. The sweeping ban, known as a suppression order, was handed down last May. It was deemed necessary to give Pell fair hearings but caused big debate. Police charged Pell with sex offences in June 2017, saying only that he faced ""historical"" allegations by ""multiple complainants"". The cardinal immediately denied any wrongdoing. Some pre-trial hearings wherePell was swamped by media outside courtwere allowed to be reported. Cardinal Pell found guilty of sexual offences How will the Pope tackle sexual abuse? Those hearings revealed for the first time that Pell faced separate accusations from the 1990s and the 1970s. Consequently, a judge ordered that two trials - with separate juries - would take place. Pell was swarmed by media during his pre-trial hearings in Melbourne last year In a bid to prevent the first trial influencing the second, the judge agreed to an immediate suppression order. It made it illegal to report that any trial was taking place. Even saying that the suppression order existed was prohibited. It allowed reporting that Pell was facing abuse allegations, but nothing more specific. The legal order legally applied only to Australia. But it effectively extended to international media which publish or broadcast into Australia, or can be accessed there, a tough thing to avoid in the internet age. That may be subject to legal debate but the judge expressed fury about some reporting. Australian outlets were generally most cautious, with journalists sitting in regularly on Pell's case and adhering to the ban. The blackout did not go totally unnoticed publicly. Social media users, for instance, frequently speculated about it. But matters escalated dramatically in December when numerous non-Australian outlets published stories reporting that Pell had been convicted. The words ""George Pell"" were soon trending online, including in Australia. A protester outside court after the reporting ban was lifted on Tuesday It prompted some of Australia's biggest newspapers to run front-page editorials criticising the suppression order. Unlike overseas media, they did not name Pell. ""The world is reading a very important story that is relevant to Victorians,"" wrote Melbourne's Herald Sun, below a headline ""CENSORED"". ""The Herald Sun is prevented from publishing details of this significant news. But trust us. It's a story you deserve to read."" Abuse and the Church: What you need to know Inquiry hears 7% of Australian Catholic priests abused children Sydney's Daily Telegraph described it as the nation's biggest story, and wrote: ""An awful crime. The person is guilty. Yet we can't publish it."" Melbourne newspaper The Age and other publications also published articles, some giving details of the case. In a specially convened court hearing on 13 December, Judge Peter Kidd said he was ""angry"" about media reports though he did not mention specific outlets. ""Given how potentially egregious and flagrant these breaches are, a number of very important people in the media are facing, if found guilty, the prospect of imprisonment and indeed substantial imprisonment,"" he told lawyers for the prosecution and defence. The judge left the matter with prosecutors to investigate. Digital versions of some front pages were later unavailable. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Some say it was not but others disagree, arguing that most people did not know about Pell's conviction before Tuesday. And, ultimately, his second trial will not proceed. On Tuesday, prosecutors withdrew the charges relating to the 1970s. Lawyer Justin Quill, whose firm is acting on behalf of local media outlets, argued that judges needed to ""have more faith"" in jurors to form their view from a courtroom even if they had seen something related to the case on social media. ""For the public to not be told [about Pell's conviction] until nearly three months later is, in my view, a situation that is not appropriate,"" he told the BBC. Pope compares sex abuse to human sacrifice US cardinal defrocked over abuse allegations Cardinal says abuse files destroyed He also said courts could not ""go around charging 10,000 people for one or two comments they've made on Twitter"", adding: ""Mainstream media is being held to one standard, and the general public is being held to another - it just doesn't make sense."" Suppression orders are common in Australia unlike in other countries such as the US. But the state of Victoria in particular has come in for criticism, accounting for more than half of the country's orders, local media reports.  Critics sometimes deride it as ""The Suppression State"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

State Premier Daniel Andrews has vowed to implement 18 recommendations from a review by a retired judge that called for a ""real-world"" approach to suppression orders, given how quickly information can be spread online. ""This is about making sure the laws relating to contempt of court and suppression orders are working effectively by protecting victims, but also the public's right to know as well as court processes,"" state Attorney General Martin Pakula said in October.

Cardinal Pell: Poisoned power at the top,"Cardinal Pell photographed with Pope Francis in 2015 - he was a close aide to the pontiff Last weekend's unprecedented Vatican summit on child sexual abuse was closed with a Sunday homily by Australian Mark Coleridge, the Archbishop of Brisbane. ""In sexual abuse,"" Archbishop Coleridge said, ""the powerful lay hands on the Lord'sâ¦ weakest and most vulnerable."" He could have been describing his fellow countryman, Cardinal George Pell, for there are few as powerful to have fallen from grace within the Roman Catholic Church. Pell is certainly the most senior churchman to have been convicted of offences against children. Pell was appointed by the Pope as Prefect of the Secretariat of the Economy, which effectively runs the Vatican's voluminous finances. Following his appointment, he relocated to Rome from Australia, where he had been the Archbishop of Sydney since 2001. Pell, who began a five-year term in 2014 with offices on the first floor of the Apostolic Palace, quickly set about introducing new accounting standards, established the Holy See's financial watchdog to deal with suspicious transactions, and ensured that the Vatican Bank's accounts were independently audited. Pell's rise and fall Why was Pell's conviction kept secret? Inside a strictly controlled trial A bullish figure who faced plenty of obstruction, he was known among some officials as ""Cardinal Rambo"".  But that was more a term of endearment â because Pell was having a positive impact on the church's finances. News of his conviction for child sexual abuse is a grave blow not just to the church, but also to Pope Francis personally. He was one of the Pope's closest aides. Pell was appointed to oversee the Vatican's finances in 2014 He was not only leading the crucial reform of the church's sprawling finances, but was also appointed by Francis to his nine-member Council of Cardinal Advisors, known as the C9. It was the C9 that encouraged Pope Francis to host this first-ever summit on child sexual abuse. But that was just one of many Vatican departments in which Pell played a significant role. Cardinal Pell was a member of the Congregation of Bishops, the Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples, the Congregation for the Institutes of the Consecrated Life and the Societies of Apostolic Life, and the Pontifical Council for the Promotion of the New Evangelisation. His conviction confirms that the poison of sexual abuse has infected every level of the Roman Catholic Church. Abuse and the Church: What you need to know Australia sexual abuse 'a national tragedy' Back in 2012, then Prime Minister Julia Gillard established a Royal Commission to inquire into institutional responses to child abuse in Australia. It found that 7% of priests in Australia had abused children. The charges against Pell emerged from Australia's rigorous inquiry into every institution that had access to children. The state began a process that the church itself seemed incapable of managing â and now this 77-year-old ambitious Cardinal will swap the Apostolic Palace for a jail cell. And in a final turn of providence, or coincidence, it won't even be necessary for Pope Francis to fire Cardinal Pell from office. His five-year term as Prefect of the Secretariat of the Economy expired on 24 February. Cardinal Pell guilty of child sexual abuse Why was Pell's conviction kept secret?

EU sticks to Brexit script,"All smiles? As the clock ran down, speculation was rife about a Brexit delay Determined to appear positive, Jean-Claude Juncker's spokeswoman described the European Commission President's latest meeting with Theresa May as ""constructive"". He said ""good progress"" was made. That's the same Jean-Claude Juncker who just a few days ago complained of Brexit fatigue, and said no agreement on a revised Brexit deal was on the horizon. So what changed? In short, nothing. Not on the EU side, anyway. But as we know, the EU wants to avoid a no-deal Brexit. It wants a deal by 29 March so that it can move on with other EU business and towards new talks with the UK on a post Brexit trade deal. Hence the bouncier, sunnier words from the Juncker camp. Remember that, despite rising mistrust and frustration, EU leaders are on the same side as Theresa May in wanting to get the Withdrawal Agreement passed through parliament. But the chasm between Downing Street and Brussels remains deep when it comes to the backstop â the workaround to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. On the sidelines of the EU-League of Arab States summit this weekend, Mrs May has been busy reminding Europe's leaders that she needs a fixed end date to the backstop or a unilateral get-out mechanism for the UK, in order to persuade sceptical MPs that the UK won't get stuck indefinitely in a customs arrangement with the EU. She also wants the EU to commit to finding â or accepting â alternatives to the backstop, such as sophisticated border technology. Cue weary, grumpy EU leaders sighing behind their hands. They know the drill. They know the prime minister's script. They are not budging from theirs. EU leaders say they won't change the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement â which contains the backstop text, and which Theresa May and her cabinet signed off on in November. A fixed end date or unilateral get-out mechanism would definitely mean changes. What the EU is open to ""24/7"", as I'm constantly told, is agreeing a legally binding text of assurances about the backstop - as long as said text involves assurances only, no changes. Brussels is waiting to hear from the UK Attorney General, Geoffrey Cox, who is working on a document. But now that Theresa May has delayed a meaningful vote on the Brexit deal until anytime up until 12 March, EU leaders wonder when Mr Cox's text might actually materialise. MPs to have Brexit vote by 12 March Brexit: Talk of delay, but no conclusions Downing Street fears that as soon as pen has hit paper and exchanged hands, the document could be leaked and potentially savaged in the UK media before there's even a chance for EU leaders to approve or discuss it. For example, if the attorney general were to come up with an end date to the backstop that in reality wasn't one, say, a maximum five-year backstop after which time there would be an investigation and a process â then, in the words of one of my diplomatic contacts: ""The European Research Group and arch-Brexiteers aren't fools. They'll see the legal veil of words for what it is."" This video can not be played Rutte: 'Wake up and close the Brexit deal' EU leaders are acutely aware that the criteria they will find acceptable in the legally binding document may make it unacceptable to the Brexiteers - because it would not go ""far enough"" on the backstop. And Brussels has told Mrs May that the EU will not move on the Brexit deal until she can persuade them that she will have a solid majority of MPs behind her. European Council President Donald Tusk said on Monday it was ""absolutely clear"" that Mrs May did not have the parliamentary majority required to give that guarantee. Which takes us back to the possibility of the Brexit process going right down to the wire. EU diplomats and politicians have repeatedly described to me what they view as the prime minister's three-way blackmail gamble - where Labour and the EU are faced with a no-deal Brexit and Brexiteers with the possibility of no Brexit at all. ""All she needs is for one of us to blink,"" said one European politician, ""and then she has her deal. Probably."" ""But it's a high-risk strategy,"" he added, ""as businesses and civilians are beginning to very much sense."" This video can not be played What happens in the event of no deal? And would the EU blink, in the end, if 29 March were nigh with no deal in sight? Would leaders budge more than they've so far indicated?As I've written before, the answer is: no-one knows. Only the EU leaders in the room at their summit on 21 March can decide. Maybe they'll hold an emergency Brexit summit even later in March. Nothing at the moment is clear. ""If we're really at that stage by then, with no confirmed extension of this process in sight, then a fixed end date of 2025 might be possible,"" said a well-placed European source. ""After all, if we don't manage to get a trade deal sorted with the UK in all the years in between, then the backstop will hardly be our only concern.""
