Storms and floods cause travel delays,"Traffic queued up on the approach to the Eurotunnel terminal in Kent Storms and flooding have disrupted road travel and caused flights to be cancelled as the UK heatwave came to an end. In Northern Ireland, up to 88.2mm of rainfall was recorded in a few hours. Homes were flooded in County Antrim and traffic brought to a standstill. Travellers have facedlong delays at Eurotunnel, after air-conditioning failed on trains, and there were two-hour waits for ferries in Dover. Storms in Europe affected airlines. Flights from Edinburgh, Birmingham, Luton and Stansted have been delayed and some cancelled after temporary restrictions were put in place during thunderstorms on Friday. Yellow warnings are in place for south-west Scotland and also Northern Ireland,where heavy rain and thunderstorms have led to flooding. Allow Twitter content?

On one of its busiest weeks of the year, cross-Channel operator Eurotunnel said it was taking time to bring back carriages after they were removed from service during hot weather on Friday because of air-conditioning issues. Lightning strikes cause rail chaos Third day of Channel Tunnel disruption Eurostar and SWR workers begin strike Storms cause 'chaos' at Stansted The company says the situation had improved and it had restored a full service of four departures per hour from Folkestone. It said delays were likely to continue for the rest of the day but it would be running additional trains overnight to clear waiting times. Eurotunnel said the problems were due to ""unprecedented"" weather conditions and not a lack of investment in the stock. Passengers were advised to take drinking water and find toilet facilities before arriving at the Folkestone terminal. Trying to reach the terminal on Saturday morning Sarah Dodwell said: ""Queuing on the M20 for Eurotunnel - how to ruin a one-week big family holiday. ""Huge delays to check-in and departure, followed by a six-hour drive to come, with young children, means nine very tired people."" She said traffic on the M20 was very slow-moving and some cars were driving down the hard shoulder to beat the queues. It took Rebecca Kelly several hours to reach the terminal building Rebecca Kelly from Lewes said she had left at 07:00 BST for Folkestone - a journey that should have been one-and-a-half hours - however by 11:00 she had still not yet reached the terminal building car park. She described the situation as ""annoying"" but praised the check-in staff for their helpfulness. However Dom Hughes, who was delayed by three hours, said: ""I can accept delays but the total lack of communication is adding to the stress... Not a soul around to ask."" BBC environment correspondent Claire Marshall was caught up in the delays as she and her family headed on their summer holidays. She described the mood among would-be travellers as ""stoic"" with many accepting they were going to be stuck for hours. National Air Traffic Services (Nats) put temporary restrictions in place during the thundery weather on Friday, affecting flights from Edinburgh, Birmingham, Luton and Stansted. The UK air traffic control service said: ""Thunderstorms are particularly disruptive as they effectively block large swathes of airspace because aircraft cannot fly through them."" On Friday 30 flights were cancelled at Stansted airport with delays and further cancellations continuing into Saturday. A Stansted Airport spokesman said long queues shown in social media posts were caused by passengers who stayed overnight in the airport trying to re-book cancelled flights with airlines. Ryanair was forced to cancel a number of flights from the airport on Saturday and apologised for the ""weather and ATC [air traffic control] disruptions which are entirely beyond our control"". The company said affected passengers would be offered a refund or a place on the next available flight. Passengers wait following flight disruption at London Stansted Airport Joe Allen was trying to get to Berlin from Stansted said: ""It's midnight, Ryanair have just cancelled my flight after waiting roughly six hours. ""The queue is just unending. It's just incredible how unaccountable they are, there's no one here to deal with it."" Gatwick and Luton airports tweeted that they are experiencing delays and possible cancellations because of adverse weather across Europe, and Heathrow said it had minor delays. 2018 and 1976 - a tale of two heatwaves UK heatwave: The winners and losers Human actions boosted heatwave odds Traffic struggled through floodwater in Belfast The weather has had an impact across the country: In Clacton, Essex the body of a teenage boy who went missing after going into the seahas been found.

Children die in California wildfire,"This video can not be played Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years Two children and their great-grandmother are among five people to have died in a raging wildfire in northern California. ""My babies are dead,"" said the children's mother, Sherry Bledsoe, through tears at the Shasta County sheriff's office. Members of her family became trapped before they were able to evacuate. Two firefighters died on Thursday, 17 people are missing and tens of thousands have fled their homes. The blazes, known as the Carr fire, have destroyed at least 500 structures and are threatening thousands of homes. In Shasta County, the flames are being sucked up by strong winds to form ""fire tornados"", which are uprooting trees and overturning cars, fire officials say. By Saturday night, only 5% of the fire was contained. It began last Monday after a car malfunctioned, and has scorched more than 48,000 acres (194 sq km) of land - an area larger than the city of San Francisco. The photos that explain the world's wildfires Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Why wildfires are breaking out in the 'wrong' countries Ms Bledsoe confirmed that her grandmother Melody, 70, and her two children Emily Roberts, five, and James Roberts, four, died in the fire. They were caught in its path as they were about to evacuate their home in the town of Redding, NBC reported. Melody Bledsoe's husband, Ed, earlier described how she had called him while he was out shopping and told him to return home because the fire was getting close to the house. When he reached home he found it destroyed and surrounded by police tape, he said. ""I didn't think the fire could cross the river,"" he told Redding Record Searchlight. ""Within 15 minutes, it burned my house down,external."" Two firefighters - fire inspector Jeremy Stoke, and a bulldozer operator who has not yet been named, also died trying contain the blaze. This video can not be played Wildfire rips through city in northern California More than 3,400 firefighters have been deployed,external- but the local fire department has warned that hot, dry weather is forecast for the rest of the week, and could make the blaze worse. ""We are seeing fire whirls - literally what can be described as a tornado,"" California department of forestry and fire protection (CalFire) chief Ken Pimlott told reporters. ""This fire was whipped up into a whirlwind of activity"" by gale-force winds, he said, ""uprooting trees, moving vehicles, moving parts of roadways."" ""These are extreme conditions... we need to take heed and evacuate, evacuate, evacuate."" This video can not be played 'Fire whirls' spotted in Arizona Fire whirls, also known as fire ""tornadoes"", are spinning vortexes of air, ash and fire They form when rising hot air begins to rotate and forms a vortex that picks up flammable gases and burning debris vegetation Fire whirls typically only last a few minutes but can be very dangerous because they can move quickly They can reach dozens of metres in height, with core temperatures as high as 1,090C. About 37,000 residents have been forced to leave the area. One local, Liz Williams, found herself and her two children stuck in traffic as people rushed to evacuate. She eventually fled by foot. ""I've never experienced something so terrifying in my life,"" she told AP news agency. ""I didn't know if the fire was just going to jump out behind a bush and grab me and suck me in."" About 500 buildings have been destroyed by the Carr fire The Carr fire is one of almost 90 active large fires in the US,external, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. In California, the Ferguson fire has killed one firefighter and led to the closure of much of Yosemite National Park, while the Cranston fire in Riverside County in the south has burned 11,500 acres (46 sq km) of land. Wildfires are a common occurrence in California during the state's long, hot, dry summers. However,experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years,external- partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. In December,Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"", and that large fires ""could happen every year or every few years"".

Storms in Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played 'You can smell the sewage' Flooding has caused disruption in parts of Northern Ireland after more than a month's worth of rain fell within a few hours. A number of elderly people had to leave their homes in the County Antrim village of Muckamore due to flooding. One pensioner told the BBC that at one stage there was more than one foot of water and sewage at her front door. Downpours led to havoc on the roads, cancelled flights and lefthundreds of homes and businesses,externalwithout power. The Met Office upgraded its weather warning to amber for Saturday afternoon, and said that as well as disruption on the roads and rail network, buildings were at risk of damage from flooding and lightning strikes. A less severe yellow warning for rain was in place across all counties but that ended on Saturday evening. This video can not be played Flooding aftermath in County Antrim Muckamore resident, Florence Allison, described the scene as she was forced to leave her home. ""It's just horrendous - water everywhere. It's coming in some people's back doors and out the front because they opened their doors. ""My doors haven't been opened but it has come in, seeped in below the doors in my dining room and my kitchen and the front hall."" Allow Twitter content?

She said she would not know how much damage had been done until she was able to get back inside. Mrs Allison added that the situation was ""very upsetting"" for herself and her elderly neighbours. Traffic struggled through the Stockman's Lane underpass in Belfast The Met Office said Belfast International Airport recorded an ""incredible"" 88.2mm of rainfall on Saturday afternoon. The figure was more than the average rainfall for the whole of July - 81.2mm. The severe weather resulted in at lease five flights being cancelled at the airport, while other passengers complained of long delays at baggage collection. The cancellations have affected customers travelling between Belfast and Faro, Naples, Glasgow and Gdansk. EasyJet customer Cathal O'Doherty told BBC News NI that he and up to 240 other Belfast-bound passengers were stranded in Naples Airport after an earlier flight from Belfast did not take off. In a message on its flight tracker service, easyJet apologised and said the cancellation was ""due to adverse weather in Belfast which caused delays with ground handling services"", which in turn caused crew on the flight to ""reach their maximum legal working hours"". Belfast International Airport's business development director, Uel Hoey, confirmed that for a short period on Saturday afternoon, ground staff had to stop working due to safety concerns caused by the ""horrendous"" weather. He explained that passengers could not be taken on and off aircraft when there was ""thunder and lightning above the airfield"". Mr Hoey added it was not the only UK airport to be affected and said his staff ""did what they had to do to keep people safe"". Flooding in Saintfield, County Down Tamsin Armstrong, who returned to Belfast from Portugal, said she and her young family had to wait three hours and 20 minutes to collect their bags. She said there were ""hundreds of people crammed into baggage reclaim"" and described the communication as ""completely useless"". Across Northern Ireland, officials from councils and other agencies held a telephone conference on Saturday to discuss the response to the severe weather. ""All agencies have been in a state of readiness since Friday and are responding to numerous calls from across Northern Ireland,"" a statement said. ""The rain is expected to lessen from 19:00 BST onwards however all agencies will continue to monitor the situation and take action accordingly."" Flooding caused significant delays on the A1 outside Dromore In other developments: Delays on the A1 in Dromore, County Down, due to flooding Asda stores in Larne, Antrim and Ballyclare were deluged and two of them were forced to close for a few hours to mop up the foyers Translink cancelled some buses Glenavy Road, Upper Ballinderry, Lisburn, closed at the Moira roundabout due to flooding Reports of drivers having to pull over at Nutts Corner near Belfast International Airport Lurgan's Lough Road was also affected Outside Newcastle, at Bloody Bridge, there were reports of major traffic delays because of rising water In Belfast, a number of manhole covers have been pushed up causing flooding on the Upper Malone Road Belfast City Council has made sandbags available to residents - they can be collected from St John the Baptist School, Finaghy Road North, and Whiterock Leisure Centre Motorbike racing at Armoy was abandoned because of the bad weather. Some shops in the Andersontown area of Belfast experienced flooding Police say they are receiving a high number calls relating to flooding and are asking people to call Floodline in the first instance on 0300 2000 100. The police have also asked drivers to slow down and take care on the roads. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Photos that explain global wildfires,"24 July: Firefighters and volunteers try to extinguish flames during a wildfire at the Greek village of Kineta Wildfires have been sweeping through coastal towns east of the Greek capital, Athens. Dozens of people - including families with children - have died as they tried to escape the flames. But fires are also raging in Sweden, as far north as the Arctic Circle, and have caused huge damage in countries including Portugal, the UK and the US in recent months. So what is happening to cause these infernos and how can we tackle them? Fires can occur naturally in woodland or brush, ignited by heat from the sun or a lightning strike. However, the vast majority of wildfires - as many as 90% worldwide - are started by humans, according to experts. The cause could be barbecue charcoal, a discarded cigarette or even arson. As long as there is fuel and oxygen available, the flames can take hold easily. A strong wind blows embers in California Greece had an unusually dry winter and spring this year, leaving grass and scrubland particularly flammable, says Thomas Smith, assistant professor in environmental geography at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE). As well as a lack of rainfall, wind also determines how devastating the fire will be, depending on its strength and direction. ""Burning embers can travel quite far and start new fires that could spread for kilometres if they are big enough,"" says Smith. Wildfires kill dozens on Greek coast In pictures: Wildfires devastate Greek region How wildfires start and how to stop them 23 July: Dry grass burns as fire crews tackle the flames in Greece Surface fires - burning on a forest floor, for instance - tend to spread slowly and can be more easily controlled. In fact some surface fires can be good, says Cathelijne Stoof, a wild land fire expert based in the Netherlands. ""It helps plants regenerate,"" she adds. ""The problem is when the flames can climb up low level branches and get to the tops of the trees. That's when you can't stop it."" 15 July: Due to the dry weather, about 80 wildfires have been burning in Sweden The most dangerous part of a blaze is called the head fire, explains Thomas Smith. It is driven forward by the wind and is very difficult to fight directly because it has long flame lengths. Moorland fire out after three weeks What the moorland fire means for wildlife 17 July: This aerial view provided by the European Space Agency shows smoke billowing from several fires between the west coast of Norway to central Sweden. Head fires burn with blacker smoke But it is not just wood and grass that quickly become fuel for wildfires. Nearby homes and vehicles will combust because of the materials they contain, such as plastics and rubber. In Greece, cars in the road caught fire before the surrounding verdant trees because they were more flammable. And they did not need to be directly licked by the flames to do so. ""It comes down to the amount of energy given off by the flames,"" says Smith. ""The cars could be tens of metres away and still be close enough to ignite."" 24 July: Burned cars are seen following a wildfire at the village of Mati near Athens Sadly, people are often killed by wildfires as they attempt to escape. Many of the victims in Greece were trapped in traffic jams as people tried to flee as fast as possible, according to forest risk management expert Alexander Held. But this could have been avoided with better evacuation plans in place, he says. Fine fuel such as dry shrubs should be cleared away from roadsides and houses to stop flames getting close, he adds. ""This was a bomb waiting to explode."" 23 July: The contents of a home, including dry wooden beams, go up in flames in Greece Heat and flames are the most immediate dangers people face in a wildfire. However, smoke can also be harmful if you have an existing condition such as asthma or lung disease, or are exposed for weeks or months. 23 July: A road block is set up as smoke fills the air near Athens Although smoke from burning vegetation is toxic, it will usually disappear quickly. Fumes produced by burning plastic or asbestos inside homes are much more hazardous. 25 March: Ruins of a house are out of bounds after a bushfire in Tathra, Australia As well as changing climates, the differing land use over the centuries has led to more wildfires in some places around the world, according to experts. ""There used to be small agricultural fields across Southern Europe and people would manage the land,"" says Cathelijne Stoof. ""But in the 20th Century people moved away and the land became overgrown. So when you do have a fire it spreads much more easily."" In the case of the huge fire near Saddleworth Moor in North West England, it was not just the vegetation that caught fire. At its peak, the fire on Saddleworth Moor covered an area of 7 sq miles (18 sq km) and burned for three weeks ""This fire definitely did get into the soil,"" says Dr Thomas Smith. The moorland is made up of peat soil, which is carbon-rich and needs little oxygen to burn, he explains. ""The fire gets underground and smoulders away.... It makes it much more difficult to put out."" 28 June: Firefighters tackle a wildfire with beaters on Winter Hill near Bolton, UK Firefighters have a range of techniques to try to tackle a blaze by depriving it of oxygen or fuel. They need to have the right training to know which one will work the best. In the recent UK wildfires, they used beaters and water hoses to extinguish the flames. Dropping water and fire retardant containing fertiliser from planes and helicopters may also slow the spread of flames. 7 December 2017: A plane drops fire retardant near a home near Los Alamos Road in Murrieta, California, last December Experts say one of the most effective methods of tackling wildfires is building firebreaks by clearing vegetation. But this is ""dirty and hard work"", says Alexander Held, and not an option that is always popular in public opinion. ""You can send a lot of helicopters and planes but without crews on the ground you won't put it out,"" he insists. Cathelijne Stoof agrees on the importance of creating firebreaks: in some places firefighters will create controlled fires to draw the energy out of the blaze they are battling. And she says fire prevention and land management should be ""sexier"" than it is now. 21 July: Firefighters create a firebreak in the Stanislaus National Forest, near Yosemite National Park, California Teams with the right training can understand fire behaviour and choose the best way to respond, she says. But fire also behaves very unpredictably. ""It's dangerous. So I very much respect the people that put everything on the line to save others."" 1 July: A fire service vehicle is surrounded by flames as the Pawnee wildfire jumps across a road in California Images subject to copyright Wildfires kill dozens on Greek coast What the moorland fire means for wildlife How wildfires start and how to stop them Â© 2025 BBC.

Reality Check: Global heatwave,"Countries across the world have been facing extremely high temperatures this summer. From the UK, across to Scandinavia and Japan, the hot weather is expected to continue for the rest of the month. Japan has just declared a natural disaster, with high temperatures leading to thousands being admitted to hospital with heat stroke. Various temperature records forJuly were brokenin southern California, eastern Canada, Algeria and Norway. In Oman, the coolest overnight temperature was recorded at 42.6 C - which may well have been the highest low ever. Sweden has been hit by forest fires spreading as far north asthe Arctic Circle. In Greece, at least 60 people have diedin wildfiresin the region around Athens. Reality Check has looked at the global picture - which countries have been hotter than normal? Many countries have experienced above average temperatures in the month of July so far. The map shows the countries where temperatures are higher or lower compared with what you'd expect for this period of time. Blue colours indicate cooler temperatures than the 1981-2010 regional average, and red shows where's its been hotter. The countries where it has been much warmer than average: UK, Scandinavia (in particular Norway and Sweden), eastern Canada, parts of eastern Siberia, Japan and the region around the Caspian Sea. It's been colder than average in: Parts of southern Europe including Spain and Portugal, parts of northern Siberia in Russia and and the southernmost part of South America. Based on the data used to populate the map, collected by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, the hottest July on record in Europe was 2010. Then it was two degrees above the average. July 2018 is likely to rank among the hottest for Europe, but is unlikely to be number one. Globally the month was the fifth hottest June since 1880, according to the US National Centers for Environmental Information. The hottest June was 2016 where the global temperature was 0.91C above the average. It was the 42nd consecutive June and the 402nd consecutive month with temperatures above average, according to their data. In the UK, this June was provisionally the third warmest since 1910 and the average maximum temperatures were between 2 and 3 Â°C above average in most areas, according to theUK Met Office,external. There's never one single factor that explains hot weather around the world. The BBC's science editor David Shukman says: ""What is striking now is that multiple heatwaves are happening at the same time."" ""The key is the jet stream. This year it's been meandering in great loops and the UK has ended up to the south of it. Add to that sea temperatures similar to previous heatwaves and climate change, the warming of the atmosphere - it all makes heatwaves more likely. ""Climate scientists are not saying we will get heatwaves every year. But they do say the risks of extreme heat are going up.""

Wildfires in the 'wrong' countries,"At least 80 people have been killed in wildfires in Greece, with blazes also reported as far apart as the US, Sweden, Canada and the UK. It's a summer that has seen an unusually high number of fires in some countries. Worldwide, an area equivalent to about 20 times the size of Great Britain is burnt by wildfires in a typical year. Most are in remote areas such as the savannah grasslands of Africa and South America, or the boreal forests which stretch from western Alaska to eastern Siberia. But we rarely hear about wildfires in such isolated places. It tends to be those which threaten lives, infrastructure, or natural resources that hit the headlines. Indeed, in Europe, the number of fires so far this year is well above average - but not in the countries which are usually worst affected. There were 427 blazes between 1 January and 24 July, compared with an average of 298 for the same period in the past decade. But, very importantly, the area they burned is only about half what is usually seen - 55,700 hectares, compared with 112,000 hectares. In the US, the number of fires this year isslightly below average.,externalHowever, there has been a small increase in the area burned, from just over 1.4m hectares to almost 1.6m hectares. The most important change is not how many fires there have been, but where they are burning. The north-west of Europe is experiencing a rare heatwave. This has brought unusually dry conditions which have allowed large fires in regions which usually see very few. In the UK the area burned so far - 13,888 hectares - is more than four times the average of the past decade. The fires have included an area ofpeatland near Manchesterandgrassland in London. In Sweden, the figure, 18,500 hectares, is an astounding 41 times the 10-year average. Dozens of fires have burnedfrom the Arctic Circle down to the Baltic Sea. Other northern European countries including Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany and Latvia have seen between 20 and 200 times the normal area burned. In contrast, Mediterranean Europe - which usually sees a large number of fires - has had a relatively cool and wet spring and early summer. In Italy and Croatia the area burned is well below average. Spain and Portugal, which normally have fire damage over a greater area than any other European countries, have suffered relatively few fires - with only 12% and 5% of the average area burned, respectively. However, fire season is not over and there is a danger that strong vegetation growth in parts of the Mediterranean may fuel fires later in the coming months. A firefighter tackles wildfires in Lancashire While no single factor explains hot weather around the world, experts sayclimate change is bringing greater and more frequent weather extremes. It is not that the 2018 fires in the UK and Sweden will be the ""new normal"", but they may be more common. Higher temperatures worldwide increase the risk of wildfires in many regions, but other factors are also important. To explain fire, scientists and firefighters use something called the ""fire triangle"": an ignition source, plus fuel such as dry vegetation and oxygen to keep going. Wildland firefighters also use the ""30-30-30 rule"" under which extreme fire conditions are expected when temperatures are above 30C, relative humidity is below 30% and winds are greater than 30km per hour (18.6 mph). Wildfires have blazed across Sweden this summer, with hot weather and persistent drought cited as the main causes Drought-stricken vegetation, such as the Swedish forests and the British moorlands, catches and carries fire more easily than it would in a wetter year. In other words, there is more ""fuel"" available when the vegetation is dry. Oxygen is readily available in the air - particularly when wind fans the fires. And sources of ignition are plentiful where there are people, whether that is a campfire, a spark from a power line, or arson. In pictures: Wildfire devastation 'A friend died in the sea' - Eyewitness accounts How wildfires start and how to stop them Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Natural ignition by lightning is common in some regions, such as the North America boreal forest, but in Europe the vast majority of fires are human-caused. The deadly fires in Greece are a prime example of weather being only one important factor. Until a few days ago, Greece had experienced fewer fires than is typical. But, in a densely-populated region near Athens, the presence of villages and towns amid highly-flammable pine forests and shrubland has had tragic consequences. Spanish firefighters combat a forest fire in Portugal in 2017 Sadly, such events have happened before. More than100 people were killed by wildfires in Portugalonly last year and173 people died in the Black Saturday Fires in Australiain 2009. In recent decades, there has been an increase of ""megafires"". These are too big and fierce to be stopped, irrespective of the efforts and resources thrown at them. More like this How many people do volcanoes kill? How a killer disease was stopped in its tracks Where a six-figure salary is 'low income' Why 'dangerous' drugs are still being used to treat pain While climate change may have made more fuel available for such fires, human behaviour has also played a role. In many rural areas of Europe land has been abandoned - leading to the growth of more vegetation close to and among homes. People often enjoy living or holidaying in forest areas, which also increases the risk of being directly affected by fire. Fortunately, it is possible to reduce the risks this poses - by clearing ""fuel"" close to buildings and building fire shelters in areas where the population might need them. Educating people about the risks and having evacuation plans in place can also reduce the threat to human lives and the economy. We need to adapt and learn how to coexist with fire. Fire has been transforming the Earth's landscapes and vegetation for millions of years. It is not going to go away.

"Qatar 2022 bid team accused of sabotageThe Qatar 2022 World Cup bid team ran a secret campaign in 2010 to sabotage competing host bids, according to a report published by the Sunday Times.","The Qatar World Cup will take place from 21 Nov to 18 Dec 2022 The Qatar 2022 World Cup bid team ran a secret campaign in 2010 to sabotage competing host bids, according to a report published by the Sunday Times. The paperclaims to have seen,externalleaked documents that show the Qatari bid team employed a US PR firm and ex-CIA agents to smear its rivals - mainly the United States and Australia. The alleged aim was to create propaganda to give the impression that a World Cup would not be supported domestically. The Qatar tournament organisers deny the allegations. Such a campaign alleged by the Sunday Times would have broken Fifa's bidding rules. Qatar beat rival bids from the United States, Australia, South Korea and Japan to the right to host the 2022 World Cup. Fifa's rules say World Cup bidders should not make ""any written or oral statements of any kind, whether adverse or otherwise, about the bids or candidatures of any other member association"". The Qatar bid team has been previously accused of corruption,but was cleared following a two-year Fifa inquiry. A respected academic was paid $9,000 to write a negative report on the huge economic cost of an American World Cup, which was then distributed to news media around the world. Journalists, bloggers and high-profile figures were recruited in each country to hype up negative aspects of their respective bids. A group of American physical education teachers were recruited to ask their US Congressmen to oppose a US World Cup on the grounds that the money would be better used on high school sports. Grassroots protests were organised at rugby games in Australia opposing the country's bid. Intelligence reports were compiled on individuals involved in rival bids. The documents seen by the Sunday Times - which the paper says were leaked by a whistleblower who worked on the 2022 bid team - were apparently unavailable during the Fifa inquiry. The Qatar bid team is alleged to have employed the New York office of communications company Brown Lloyd Jones, which is now BLJ Worldwide, along with a team of former intelligence officers to run a campaign aimed at undermining one of Fifa's key criteria in the bidding process - that each bid should have strong backing at home. In a statement Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy said it ""rejects each and every allegation put forward by the Sunday Times"". ""We have been thoroughly investigated and have been forthcoming with all information related to our bid, including the official investigation led by US attorney Michael Garcia,"" it said. ""We have strictly adhered to all FIFA's rules and regulations for the 2018/2022 World Cup bidding process."" A Fifa statement said ""a thorough investigation was conducted by Michael Garcia and his conclusions are available in the report"", referring to the completed two-year inquiry. BLJ Worldwide did not respond to a request for comment from The Sunday Times. Qatar won the right to stage the tournament in December 2010. Russia was awarded the 2018 World Cup at the same time, beating three other bids including England. Dan Roan, BBC's Sports Editor Once again, Qatar's hosting of the 2022 World Cup is mired in controversy. Ever since its shock win in the race to stage the event eight years ago, the country has faced questions over how it triumphed, its winter scheduling, and the human cost of building the infrastructure required. So what will these latest allegations mean? On the one hand, we do not yet know the explanations of those named in the documents obtained by the Sunday Times. The allegations relate to events several years ago, and some will point out that Qatar's is hardly the first bid suspected of using private intelligence and covert tactics. Indeed it has been claimed England's 2018 bid spied on its rivals. Crucially, Qatar was cleared of corruption by Fifa's two-year long investigation, headed up by American lawyer Michael Garcia. However, there is bound to be speculation that if this is found to be a breach of the rules, linked directly to the bid team, and that Garcia was not aware of this new information, then it could increase the risk of Qatar being sensationally stripped of the event. With the tournament now just four years away and tens of billions of pounds already spent on preparations, that remains unlikely. Fifa would be worried about the threat of being sued if it took such action. However, its new leadership has vowed to regain trust after the years of scandal, so perhaps it will feel it has no choice but to launch a fresh investigation. Qatar is embroiled in a diplomatic dispute with some of its neighbours, which perhaps explains the timing of this leak. And with Fifa President Gianni Infantino known to be keen on a 48-team 2022 World Cup, this could lead to fresh pressure being applied on Qatar to agree, and to share their tournament with other countries in the region. But less than two weeks after Fifa hailed Russia's World Cup, it has not taken long for the governing body - and its next host - to face yet more scrutiny.

The event, which was first held in 1996, involved 712 sailors travelling in difficult conditions to destinations including Uruguay, South Africa, China andNorthern Ireland. Professional sailors captain teams of amateurs. Nearly half of the crews, who come from 41 countries, had no previous sailing experience before signing up. The yachts returned to Liverpool after 11 months Race co-founder Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who was the first person to sail solo nonstop around the world, said: ""If you realise that more people have climbed Mount Everest than have sailed around the world, you realise just what these people have done. ""There has never been a round-the-world sailing race where the leading skippers are women,"" he added. ""To have men and women competing together in sport on a level playing field is very special."" He said the success of Tuck and Henderson ""cannot be overestimated"". Sailors with Sir Robin Knox-Johnston (centre front) before leaving for Liverpool Tuck said she was experiencing ""a bit of shock, disbelief, joy, sadness,external- you name that emotion, I'm probably feeling it right now."" Henderson said: ""We didn't get the win but I am so proud of how my team dug deep and kept fighting right until the end."" Nottinghamshire firefighter Rebecca Sims, who sailed in Henderson's team during one leg of the race, said: ""To have a female one-two is probably the best outcome, really, so it's fantastic for women in sport. ""The women have dominated, they've done fantastic and I'm really pleased."" Londonderry hosted a maritime festival when the yachts reached the city Sports Minister Tracey Crouch said she had been ""watching it quite obsessively"", especially as Henderson is the daughter of her Conservative colleague, Guildford MP Anne Milton. ""It is really nice to be here at the end and to celebrate some remarkable achievements for two amazing female skippers."" More than 220,000 people watched the sailors set out from Liverpool last August. In November, Bristol sailor Simon Speirs, 60,died after being swept overboardduring gale force winds.

Lebanon sinks tanks to make new reef,"The tanks were once used by the Lebanese army Environmentalists dumping 10 old army tanks off the coast of a city trying to deal with a massive rubbish problem may seem counterintuitive. However, that is exactly what one group in the Lebanese city of Sidon have done in the hope it will not only attract tourists to the region, but also create a new haven for wildlife in the Mediterranean Sea. Onlookers watched as the tanks were lowered into the water 3km (1.8 miles) off the coast on Saturday. The 81-year-old woman inspiring a nation to recycle Plastic pollution: Scientists' plea on threat to ocean giants ""This will be a paradise for divers and a place where we can develop underwater life,"" Kamel Kozbar, of Friends of the Coast of Sidon, the group spearheading the project, told news agency AFP. He hopes seaweed will soon cover the tanks, a gift from the army, creating the group's vision of an ""underwater park"" - a world away from the beaches which have not escaped Lebanon's overflowing rubbish crisis. The tanks will be a novel attraction for divers They will also create new habitats It is hoped they will soon be covered in seaweed In January for example, pictures emerged showingmounds of rubbish dumped on the beachesnorth of the capital Beirut. But this is not just an environmental project. The group have also purposefully pointed the tanks towards their southern neighbour, Israel.

Thousands flee 'tornado' California fires,"This video can not be played Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years A wildfire in northern California has killed five people, including two children and their great-grandmother, and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. Six other people are reportedly missing. The fires in Shasta county are being sucked up by strong winds to form ""fire tornados"" that are uprooting trees and overturning cars, fire officials say. The blazes, known as the Carr fire, have destroyed at least 500 structures. Firefighters are battling the blaze, which is only 5% contained so far. Thousands of homes are under threat. The wildfire began on Monday after a car malfunctioned. It has scorched over 48,000 acres (194 sq km) of land - an area larger than the city of San Francisco. The photos that explain the world's wildfires Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Why wildfires are breaking out in the 'wrong' countries ""We are seeing fire whirls - literally what can be described as a tornado,"" California department of forestry and fire protection (CalFire) chief Ken Pimlott told reporters. ""This fire was whipped up into a whirlwind of activity"" by gale-force winds, he said, ""uprooting trees, moving vehicles, moving parts of roadways."" This video can not be played Wildfire rips through city in northern California ""These are extreme conditions... we need to take heed and evacuate, evacuate, evacuate."" More than 3,400 firefighters have been deployed,external- but the local fire department has warned that hot, dry weather is forecast for the rest of the week, and could make the blaze worse. Sherry Bledsoe has confirmed that her grandmother Melody Bledsoe, 70, and her two children Emily Roberts, five, and James Roberts, four, died in the fire, reports say. Relatives had been searching for them since the fire destroyed their home in the town of Redding. Melody Bledsoe's husband, Ed, earlier described how she had called him and told him to return home because the fire was getting close. Six other people are also missing. This video can not be played 'Fire whirls' spotted in Arizona Fire whirls, also known as fire ""tornadoes"", are spinning vortexes of air, ash and fire They form when rising hot air begins to rotate and forms a vortex that picks up flammable gases and burning debris vegetation Fire whirls typically only last a few minutes but can be very dangerous because they can move quickly They can reach dozens of metres in height, with core temperatures as high as 1,090C. About 37,000 residents have been forced to leave the area. One local, Liz Williams, found herself and her two children stuck in traffic as people rushed to evacuate. She eventually fled by foot. ""I've never experienced something so terrifying in my life,"" she told AP news agency. ""I didn't know if the fire was just going to jump out behind a bush and grab me and suck me in."" About 500 building structures have been destroyed by the Carr fire The Carr fire is one of almost 90 active large fires in the US,external, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. In California, the Ferguson fire has killed one firefighter and led to the closure of much of Yosemite National Park, while the Cranston fire in Riverside County in the south has burned 11,500 acres (46 sq km) of land. Wildfires are a common occurrence in California during the state's long, hot, dry summers. However,experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years,external- partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. In December,Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"", and that large fires ""could happen every year or every few years"".

Crash victim 'will be missed terribly',"Evalyn Collie was one of five people killed in the A96 crash One of the five people who died in a crash on the A96 in Moray has been described as a ""really lovely"" woman who will be missed terribly. Evalyn Collie, 69, from Aberchirder, Aberdeenshire, died along with two friends when their car was involved in a collision with a minibus near Keith. Two Italians in the minibus, one of them a four-year-old boy, were also killed in the smash on Thursday. Relatives of the Italian tourists are to arrive in Scotland later. Ms Collie was said to be active in the local community and a member of the Aberchirder community and district association.

International hunt for speedboat killer,"This video can not be played Jack Shepherd told police he never asked if Charlotte Brown could swim An international hunt is under way to find a man who killed his date in a speedboat crash on the River Thames. Jack Shepherd was jailed for six years for the manslaughter of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown. The pair were thrown overboard in London in December 2015. Police said the 30-year-old, who was absent throughout the trial, had travelled abroad in the past year ""so we have to follow that lead"". Ms Brown's family said it was ""not fair"" Shepherd had not faced justice. Det Sgt Christopher Davies told BBC Breakfast that officers were following up ""intelligence and leads to addresses and where he's last been seen and where he's known"". ""We work with a number of agencies, including the National Crime Agency, and we're open to worldwide inquiries,"" he said. Charlotte Brown and Shepherd shared two bottles of wine at dinner before the speedboat crash The Met Police found out that Shepherd, of Paddington, would not appear at his trial three days before it was due to begin, although he had appeared at previous hearings. Shepherd's trial heard he had entertained up to 10 women on the vessel and had previously been warned by police about speeding on the river. An arrest warrant has been issued for Shepherd, who was found guilty at the Old Bailey on Thursday ofmanslaughter by gross negligence. The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error First date speedboat death man sentenced This video can not be played Roz Wickens and Katie Brown said they were ""devastated"" Jack Shepherd had not faced justice In court, the web designer's barrister Stephen Vullo QC said Shepherd was not trying to avoid justice but ""could not have faced the Brown family"". ""It's cowardice,"" he said. Mr Vullo also revealed his client married a childhood friend shortly after the crash, and has a two-year-old child, but the relationship has since broken down. Roz Wickens, pictured here with her daughter Charlotte, said Shepherd had sent them no messages of condolence Ms Brown's family have appealed for Shepherd to hand himself in. The 24-year-old's mother Roz Wickens told BBC Breakfast that her family found it ""pretty devastating"" he had skipped bail ""because... he's brought devastation to us"". ""He's been able to choose not to turn up and it just didn't seem fair. We wanted him to face the trial,"" Ms Brown's twin sister Katie said. The family said they saw Shepherd at three previous court hearings, but had not received a message of condolence from him. Ms Wickens said they were told ""he had written it and sent it to his solicitor"" but the family had not heard anything. The court heard Shepherd's speedboat had several defects Man guilty of first date speedboat death Man's boat 'seduction routine' went wrong The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error Speedboat death accused stays absent Paramedics 'drilled into boat death woman' Speedboat taken to Old Bailey as evidence Boat death accused 'wanted to show off' Boat trial: Life jacket 'not pointed out' HM Courts & Tribunals Service What the papers say â January 9 Buying Coordinator (14 months FTC) Robot-guided âsmart biopsyâ technique tested on patients in UK first South London's Christmas Lane The 13 London restaurants named as finalists in the 2025 Good Food Guide Awards Aspiring Psychologist Ealing January 2025 LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

US cardinal resigns over abuse claims,"More allegations against Theodore McCarrick have since emerged Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of a prominent US cardinal accused of sexually assaulting a teenager nearly 50 years ago. Theodore McCarrick, 88, a former Archbishop of Washington, must also carry out ""penance and prayer"" pending a canonical trial, the Vatican said. Last month US Church officials said the allegations were credible. Archbishop McCarrick has said he has ""no recollection"" of the alleged abuse. Further allegations have since emerged. Sex abuse and the Catholic Church Australia abuse victim: 'I feel like a weight has been lifted' Chile protesters challenge Pope on Church sex abuse Archbishop McCarrick was one of the most prominent US cardinals and is one of the most high-profile Catholic leaders to face abuse claims. In a statement, the Vatican said Pope Francis had accepted Theodore McCarrick's resignation from the cardinalate and had ordered his suspension from the exercise of any public ministry. The statement also said he would be placed in seclusion ""for a life of prayer and penance until the accusations made against him are examined in a regular canonical trial"". His resignation meansthe titles of Cardinal and ""your eminence"" are removed,external, America Magazine editor and Jesuit priest James Martin said on Twitter. Archbishop McCarrick's resignation from the cardinalate is the first since 1927, whenFather Louis Billot resigned because of political tensions with the Holy See,external, according to the New York Times newspaper. It is also the first time thatan order to carry out penance and prayer has been made before a Church trial takes place,external, according to Catholic University legal expert Kurt Martens, quoted by AP news agency. The Church is now ""running out of options,externalif you want to impose a further penalty"" after a canonical trial, Mr Martens told the Washington Post. ""I would not be surprised if he gets dismissed from the clerical state,"" he said. The Pope appears to ""understand the gravity of the situation and further harm to the Catholic Church's status"", AP quoted Terence McKiernan from BishopsAccountability.org as saying. The Vatican's quick action stands in contrast to previous instances where cardinals have faced allegations that they carried out or covered up abuse. In 2013 ScottishCardinal Keith Patrick O'Brien resigned as Archbishop of St Andrews and Edinburghafter being accused of sexual misconduct. However he remained in the college of cardinals until he died earlier this year. Mr McCarrick (R), here seen with former US President George W Bush, had a reputation in Washington as someone who could work with powerful figures from all sides Cardinal Bernard Law stepped down as archbishop of Boston in 2002 after reports he had moved paedophile priests between parishes rather than addressing victims' claims. But he was then allowed to take a job at the Vatican, where he worked until 2011.He died in Rome last year. Archbishop McCarrick is alleged to have assaulted the teenager while working as a priest in New York in the early 1970s. The claims were made public in June by the current Archbishop of New York, Cardinal Timothy Dolan. He said an independent forensic agency had investigated the allegations. A review board, including legal experts, psychologists, parents and a priest, then found the allegations ""credible and substantiated"". At the time,Mr Archbishop  McCarrick said in a statement that had ""no recollection of this reported abuse"",externaland believed in his innocence. Several more men have since said the cleric forced them to sleep with him at a beach house in New Jersey, while they studied for the priesthood as adult seminarians. One man has come forward saying he was assaulted while still a minor. Archbishop McCarrick has not commented on the more recent allegations. The alleged abuses may have taken place too long ago for criminal charges to be filed because of the statute of limitations. It has also since emerged that financial settlements were reached in at least two cases of alleged sexual misconduct with adults involving Archbishop McCarrick. They involved ""allegations of sexual misconduct with adults decades ago"", while he was working as a bishop in New Jersey, bishops in the state told US media. He became a priest in 1958 and later worked in New York and New Jersey before becoming Archbishop of Washington between 2001 and 2006. Despite having officially retired, he has continued to attend events abroad, including those focusing on human rights issues. He has been heavily involved in the response to allegations of abuse by Catholic priests in the US, local media reports say. In Washington he was also known for his focus on the plight of Christians and other religious minorities in the Middle East and had a reputation as someone who could work with powerful figures on all sides, US media report.

Woman finds 'escape artist' python in bed,"The royal python was located the following evening in a corridor by the RSPCA A woman got the ""fright of her life"" when she woke to find she was sharing her bed with a 3ft (90cm) long snake. The royal python, which is thought to be an escaped pet, had curled up next to her as she slept in her flat in Kensington, west London, on Monday. The woman rushed out of her room and called the RSPCA but the snake slithered away before they arrived. The harmless reptile was finally captured in the flat on Tuesday evening by officer Jill Sanders. She said: ""The poor resident must have had the fright of their life waking up to a snake in their bed."" The RSPCA said it did not know how it got into the flat but believe it belongs to someone living nearby. ""Reptiles, particularly snakes, can be extremely good escape artists and will take the opportunity of a gap in an enclosure door, or a loose-fitting lid,"" Ms Sanders added. Originate from West Africa, from countries including the republics of Ghana, Togo and Benin Grow to up to 150cm (4ft 9ins) and can live more than 20 years in captivity Typically ""docile"" in nature, and curl into a ball when threatened Require a diet of defrosted mice and rats Source: RSPCA Toilet snake 'missing for two months' Boy finds python lurking in toilet RSPCA What the papers say â January 9 Buying Coordinator (14 months FTC) Robot-guided âsmart biopsyâ technique tested on patients in UK first South London's Christmas Lane The 13 London restaurants named as finalists in the 2025 Good Food Guide Awards Aspiring Psychologist Ealing January 2025 LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

"Thousands flee 'tornado' California firesStrong winds have whipped the flames into ""fire whirls"" that are overturning trees and cars.","This video can not be played Experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years A wildfire in northern California has killed five people, including two children and their great-grandmother, and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes. Six other people are reportedly missing. The fires in Shasta county are being sucked up by strong winds to form ""fire tornados"" that are uprooting trees and overturning cars, fire officials say. The blazes, known as the Carr fire, have destroyed at least 500 structures. Firefighters are battling the blaze, which is only 5% contained so far. Thousands of homes are under threat. The wildfire began on Monday after a car malfunctioned. It has scorched over 48,000 acres (194 sq km) of land - an area larger than the city of San Francisco. The photos that explain the world's wildfires Reality Check: Mapping the global heatwave Why wildfires are breaking out in the 'wrong' countries ""We are seeing fire whirls - literally what can be described as a tornado,"" California department of forestry and fire protection (CalFire) chief Ken Pimlott told reporters. ""This fire was whipped up into a whirlwind of activity"" by gale-force winds, he said, ""uprooting trees, moving vehicles, moving parts of roadways."" This video can not be played Wildfire rips through city in northern California ""These are extreme conditions... we need to take heed and evacuate, evacuate, evacuate."" More than 3,400 firefighters have been deployed,external- but the local fire department has warned that hot, dry weather is forecast for the rest of the week, and could make the blaze worse. Sherry Bledsoe has confirmed that her grandmother Melody Bledsoe, 70, and her two children Emily Roberts, five, and James Roberts, four, died in the fire, reports say. Relatives had been searching for them since the fire destroyed their home in the town of Redding. Melody Bledsoe's husband, Ed, earlier described how she had called him and told him to return home because the fire was getting close. Six other people are also missing. This video can not be played 'Fire whirls' spotted in Arizona Fire whirls, also known as fire ""tornadoes"", are spinning vortexes of air, ash and fire They form when rising hot air begins to rotate and forms a vortex that picks up flammable gases and burning debris vegetation Fire whirls typically only last a few minutes but can be very dangerous because they can move quickly They can reach dozens of metres in height, with core temperatures as high as 1,090C. About 37,000 residents have been forced to leave the area. One local, Liz Williams, found herself and her two children stuck in traffic as people rushed to evacuate. She eventually fled by foot. ""I've never experienced something so terrifying in my life,"" she told AP news agency. ""I didn't know if the fire was just going to jump out behind a bush and grab me and suck me in."" About 500 building structures have been destroyed by the Carr fire The Carr fire is one of almost 90 active large fires in the US,external, according to the National Interagency Fire Center. In California, the Ferguson fire has killed one firefighter and led to the closure of much of Yosemite National Park, while the Cranston fire in Riverside County in the south has burned 11,500 acres (46 sq km) of land. Wildfires are a common occurrence in California during the state's long, hot, dry summers. However,experts say this has been the worst start to the fire season in 10 years,external- partly due to the 2012-2017 drought that killed off large amounts of vegetation. In December,Governor Jerry Brown said devastating wildfires fuelled by climate change had become ""the new normal"", and that large fires ""could happen every year or every few years"".

The event, which was first held in 1996, involved 712 sailors travelling in difficult conditions to destinations including Uruguay, South Africa, China andNorthern Ireland. Professional sailors captain teams of amateurs. Nearly half of the crews, who come from 41 countries, had no previous sailing experience before signing up. The yachts returned to Liverpool after 11 months Race co-founder Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who was the first person to sail solo nonstop around the world, said: ""If you realise that more people have climbed Mount Everest than have sailed around the world, you realise just what these people have done. ""There has never been a round-the-world sailing race where the leading skippers are women,"" he added. ""To have men and women competing together in sport on a level playing field is very special."" He said the success of Tuck and Henderson ""cannot be overestimated"". Sailors with Sir Robin Knox-Johnston (centre front) before leaving for Liverpool Tuck said she was experiencing ""a bit of shock, disbelief, joy, sadness,external- you name that emotion, I'm probably feeling it right now."" Henderson said: ""We didn't get the win but I am so proud of how my team dug deep and kept fighting right until the end."" Nottinghamshire firefighter Rebecca Sims, who sailed in Henderson's team during one leg of the race, said: ""To have a female one-two is probably the best outcome, really, so it's fantastic for women in sport. ""The women have dominated, they've done fantastic and I'm really pleased."" Londonderry hosted a maritime festival when the yachts reached the city Sports Minister Tracey Crouch said she had been ""watching it quite obsessively"", especially as Henderson is the daughter of her Conservative colleague, Guildford MP Anne Milton.

"International hunt for speedboat killerIt's ""not fair"" convicted killer Jack Shepherd is yet to face justice, says the family of his victim.","This video can not be played Jack Shepherd told police he never asked if Charlotte Brown could swim An international hunt is under way to find a man who killed his date in a speedboat crash on the River Thames. Jack Shepherd was jailed for six years for the manslaughter of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown. The pair were thrown overboard in London in December 2015. Police said the 30-year-old, who was absent throughout the trial, had travelled abroad in the past year ""so we have to follow that lead"". Ms Brown's family said it was ""not fair"" Shepherd had not faced justice. Det Sgt Christopher Davies told BBC Breakfast that officers were following up ""intelligence and leads to addresses and where he's last been seen and where he's known"". ""We work with a number of agencies, including the National Crime Agency, and we're open to worldwide inquiries,"" he said. Charlotte Brown and Shepherd shared two bottles of wine at dinner before the speedboat crash The Met Police found out that Shepherd, of Paddington, would not appear at his trial three days before it was due to begin, although he had appeared at previous hearings. Shepherd's trial heard he had entertained up to 10 women on the vessel and had previously been warned by police about speeding on the river. An arrest warrant has been issued for Shepherd, who was found guilty at the Old Bailey on Thursday ofmanslaughter by gross negligence. The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error First date speedboat death man sentenced This video can not be played Roz Wickens and Katie Brown said they were ""devastated"" Jack Shepherd had not faced justice In court, the web designer's barrister Stephen Vullo QC said Shepherd was not trying to avoid justice but ""could not have faced the Brown family"". ""It's cowardice,"" he said. Mr Vullo also revealed his client married a childhood friend shortly after the crash, and has a two-year-old child, but the relationship has since broken down. Roz Wickens, pictured here with her daughter Charlotte, said Shepherd had sent them no messages of condolence Ms Brown's family have appealed for Shepherd to hand himself in. The 24-year-old's mother Roz Wickens told BBC Breakfast that her family found it ""pretty devastating"" he had skipped bail ""because... he's brought devastation to us"". ""He's been able to choose not to turn up and it just didn't seem fair. We wanted him to face the trial,"" Ms Brown's twin sister Katie said. The family said they saw Shepherd at three previous court hearings, but had not received a message of condolence from him. Ms Wickens said they were told ""he had written it and sent it to his solicitor"" but the family had not heard anything. The court heard Shepherd's speedboat had several defects Man guilty of first date speedboat death Man's boat 'seduction routine' went wrong The speedboat seducer who made a fatal error Speedboat death accused stays absent Paramedics 'drilled into boat death woman' Speedboat taken to Old Bailey as evidence Boat death accused 'wanted to show off' Boat trial: Life jacket 'not pointed out' HM Courts & Tribunals Service What the papers say â January 9 Buying Coordinator (14 months FTC) Robot-guided âsmart biopsyâ technique tested on patients in UK first South London's Christmas Lane The 13 London restaurants named as finalists in the 2025 Good Food Guide Awards Aspiring Psychologist Ealing January 2025 LA fire chief leaves mid-briefing to confront new wildfire in Hollywood Hills In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Midwife school attacked in Afghanistan,"Black smoke could be seen rising from the scene of the attack Militants have attacked a midwife training centre in Afghanistan, killing two guards and a driver and injuring at least eight other people. The attackers set off explosives and fired gunshots at the centre in Jalalabad, Nangarhar province. Afghan security forces regained control after a gunfight lasting six hours. No group has yet said it was behind the attack, although Islamic State militants have claimed several recent attacks in the eastern province. The Taliban have denied any involvement. The attack began at around 11:30 local time (07:00 GMT) and ended around 18:00. The attackers placed explosive devices in the street near the complex, an eyewitness told AFP. Attaullah Khogyani, Nangarhar spokesman for the provincial governor, told the BBC one of the assailants died when he detonated an explosive vest, while the other was killed by security forces. Afghan police inspect the damaged centre In total, 61 midwives and two children were rescue from the compound, Mr Khogyani added. However, two guards and one driver were killed in the attack, while three members of the security forces, three civilians and two centre employees were hurt. The centre offers two-year midwifery training courses for women from the province. It is not clear why the midwife training centre was targeted. However, militants often choose official buildings and medical facilities for their attacks, and many Afghans are opposed to unmarried women working outside their homes. More than 50% of births in Afghanistan take place without a trained midwife. The country has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world -396 deaths per 100,000 live births,external- well above the global average of 216 deaths.

Obituary: Mary Ellis the air pioneer,"Mary Ellis was a pioneering woman pilot of the Air Transport Auxiliary Mary Ellis blazed a trail for female aviators, as one of the first women to fly Spitfires, heavy bombers and jet aircraft. She was a member of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), which employed civilians to deliver planes from factories to airfields during the Second World War. However, her contribution to the war effort was not always appreciated. At one RAF base, the ground crew refused to believe she was the pilot of the Wellington bomber she had just landed. ""They actually went inside the aeroplane and searched it,"" she recalled. ""Everybody was flabbergasted that a little girl like me could fly these big aeroplanes all by oneself."" Mary Ellis died on Tuesday at the age of 101. Born Mary Wilkins to a farming family in Leafield, Oxfordshire, she grew up close to RAF bases at Bicester and Port Meadow. ""I was interested in aeroplanes from almost the year dot,"" she said. As a child, her father paid a flying circus to take her on a pleasure flight in a de Havilland 60 Moth. ""I think that sealed my fate forever,"" she later recalled. Her teenage ""passion for the skies"" led to flying lessons at Witney airfield. When war broke out, a flying licence and that experience made her a suitable candidate for the ATA, which allowed qualified women to join as pilots from 1940. Mary Ellis joined the ATA in 1941 after hearing an advertisement on BBC radio This video can not be played Mary Ellis said she had flown ""about 1,000 aeroplanes"" during the war The idea had a mixed reception. The Aeroplane magazine fumed in a 1940 editorial: ""Women anxious to serve their country should take on work more befitting their sex instead of encroaching on a man's occupation."" Another editor wrote: ""The menace is the woman who thinks that she ought to be flying in a high-speed bomber when she really has not the intelligence to scrub the floor of a hospital properly."" ""Girls flying aeroplanes was almost a sin at that time,"" Mary Ellis later recalled. Against this background and despite her mother's misgivings, she applied to the ATA after hearing an advertisement on BBC radio and was ""readily accepted"" in 1941. The first ATA women had a mixed reception in the media She was soon flying ""fast and furious aeroplanes and bombers all over the country"", as aircraft production and casualties rose. The work was ""exhilarating and sometimes very dangerous"", she recalled. Pilots often flew unfamiliar aircraft, guided by the ""Ferry Pilots notes"", which gave landing instructions. ""We'd say to each other, 'Oh look what I've got, look what I've got'. And that was terribly exciting. Sometimes frightening as well because the aeroplanes were all different. You'd get out of a Tiger Moth into a Wellington bomber and then into a Spitfire."" Based at an all-women's ATA pool in Hamble, Hampshire, she recalled that she flew ""about 1,000"" aircraft during the war including 76 different types. Mary Ellis said the women ""proved that we could handle aeroplanes and do the job that we were supposed to do."" Mary Ellis came close to death on several occasions. She was shot at over Bournemouth, possibly by friendly fire, and had a near-miss as she landed in fog at the same time as another Spitfire coming in the opposite direction. She also survived a crash-landing when the undercarriage on her Spitfire jammed, causing the engine to overheat. ""I just knew that I had to do something before the engine blew up. One didn't get excited or anything else. It's just a part of the job of coping with an aeroplane."" Nearly one in 10 of the ATA's 168 female members were killed during the war, including aviation pioneer Amy Johnson. Mary's friend Dora Lang died in a crash in 1944. ""I missed her terribly"", she recalled. ""And for two days I was not allowed to fly - I didn't want to. But after that one realised, well, there is a war on, we must get on with our jobs. And we did."" Mrs Ellis recalled flying ""about 1,000 aeroplanes"" during the war The ATA's founder, Pauline Gower, had joked the organisation's acronym could stand for ""Always Terrified Airwomen"". But Mary said the women ""proved that we could handle aeroplanes and do the job that we were supposed to do."" They were also able to enjoy an active social life. ""We had lots of boyfriends. Because at that time we were called the 'glamour girls' - I don't know why. But there were always plenty of escorts around."" Mary Ellis said the Spitfire was ""everybody's favourite"" aircraft When the ATA was disbanded in 1945, Mary Wilkins was seconded to the RAF, where she became one of the first women to fly Britain's first jet fighter, the Gloster Meteor. She went on to become manager of Sandown Airport on the Isle of Wight in the 1950s and 1960s, hiring a former ATA colleague, Vera Strodl, as chief flying instructor. A correspondent for Flight Magazine, visiting the airport in 1951, described it as a ""woman pilots' Utopia"", whose ""extra quota of feminine charm... has had no disturbing effect on the enthusiasm of club members."" Away from the airport, she indulged a love of fast cars, entering and winning sports car rallies, and ran a fashion boutique. ""She is the most glamorous person I know,"" her niece Rosemarie Martin recalled before Mary's death. ""She enjoys fashion and always wears nail polish. Very strong on etiquette - the right china, the right cutlery, your manners, she could write a book on that."" At the age of 101, Mary Ellis was still driving daily to local shops Mary married Don Ellis, a fellow pilot, in 1961, and began to host ""legendary parties"", Ms Martin said. She continued to live in the marital home beside the runway at Sandown after his death in 2009. At the age of 101, she was still driving daily to local shops. In November 2016, she and fellowATA pilot Joy Lofthousewere honoured in front of members of the Royal Family at the annual Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall in London. ""Being an ATA pilot was fantastic,"" Mary Ellis recalled. ""Up in the air on your own. And you can do whatever you like. I flew 400 Spitfires. And occasionally I would take one up and go and play with the clouds. ""I would like to do it all over again. There was a war on but otherwise it was absolutely wonderful.""

The 'Snapchat Queen' who filmed her boyfriend's death,"Fatima Khan helped to orchestrate the murder of her boyfriend Khalid Safi. On a December night in west London, Fatima Khan approached her boyfriend as he lay dying from multiple stab wounds on the pavement. But instead of helping him, or even calling emergency services, she took out her mobile phone and videoed him. Witnesses who were trying to help the fatally injured man, Khalid Safi, challenged her, asking what she was planning to do - put the video on social media? That is exactly what Fatima did. She posted the image of her dying boyfriend on Snapchat with a warning that that was what happened when people messed with her. She used an expletive instead of the word ""mess"". The 21-year-old self-confessed ""Snapchat addict"" orchestrated the killing of Khalid. She arranged for a rival for her affections, a man called Raza Khan, to kill him, her trial at the Old Bailey heard. CCTV images showed her calmly filming the scene of the attack as she talked on another phone to her accomplice while he was making his escape. As with all Snapchat videos, the pictures would have been automatically deleted within 24 hours. However, one of the group of friends who followed her online posts filmed the message and two years later it re-emerged as the key evidence in her trial. Fatima's own defence barrister told the jury how she seemed to live her entire life on social media. ""She may be Ilford's Snapchat queen,"" Kerim Fuad QC said. ""I don't say that to make light of it,"" he told the court. ""She's another example of youngsters who seem to live their life through the prism of Snapchat. ""It's a product of a mobile telephone driven obsession. It's not healthy,"" he admitted. Khalid Safi was stabbed to death in December 2016 The trial heard how 18-year-old Khalid was stabbed to death on 1 December 2016. The teenager had been the on/off boyfriend of Fatima for several years. However, 19-year-old Raza had also had a previous relationship with her. She would Snapchat Raza on a daily basis as part of a group chat. The two rivals - Raza and Khalid - had previously had a fight over Fatima, during which Khalid was stabbed. Later, Fatima complained to her friends about Khalid being ""too clingy"" and in the days leading up to his murder the court heard how things ""were clearly coming to a head"". He had bought Fatima a watch as a present, but when he visited her she threw it out of a window because she was angry he had come to her house. Fatima had ""willingly and knowingly"" agreed with Raza to kill Khalid, the court heard. She told Raza where to find him and made sure Khalid was in the right place when he arrived by minicab in North Acton on the night of his death. CCTV showed Raza walking over to Fatima with witnesses describing him as carrying a large knife. Fatima was also said to be unsurprised by his sudden arrival. After a brief fight, Raza stabbed the victim in the heart and ran off. His whereabouts are still unknown and he remains a wanted man. ""Fatima Khan did not call the emergency services, she did not ask anyone else to do so and she did not try to assist Khalid Safi at all herself,"" Prosecutor Kate Bex QC told the trial. ""Instead she returned to the scene after Raza Khan had inflicted the fatal wounds and videoed Khalid Safi as he lay dying in a pool of blood."" Raza Khan is wanted for the murder of Khalid Safi On the day of Khalid's death, the images Fatima posted on Snapchat amounted to a digital diary of a murder. She told police she had argued with her boyfriend - on the way to the scene she had filmed part of the row on her mobile and posted it online. Fatima had claimed she was terrified and had posted the video as a ""plea for help"", the prosecutor said. But there was nothing to suggest such fear, the prosecutor added, and Fatima made ""no request for help"". Fatima told police she hadn't been able to call the emergency services after the attack as she could not get her fingers to use the keypad of her phone. But she had been able to post several further messages to Snapchat after the killing. One showed her taking an Uber taxi home after the killing. The post was captioned: ""Uber long life."" Another showed a video of the carpet of her home when she arrived, when she could be heard talking with her parents. ""If she had ever been, she was no longer shocked and acting impulsively by that time,"" argued the prosecution. Fatima never reported the incident - it was a relative of the victim who contacted police days later and gave them her address. In her defence, she told the court she had wanted to leave the scene before anything happened. But the prosecution argued this was contradicted by the fact she returned to film Khalid as he lay dying on the pavement. Fatima's barrister said she was ""hugely callous - crass even - in taking that image of Khalid on the pavement and posting it with those words. ""If there was a charge for being callous and crass in the aftermath of this shocking incident she would plead guilty to that charge."" Fatima Khan was instead charged with joint enterprise murder, with an alternative of manslaughter or conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. At the end of her four-week trial, the jury cleared her of murder, but found her guilty of manslaughter by a majority verdict.

Teen mums respond to 'generation sensible',"Young people in the UK arehaving less sex than they used toand the rate of teenage pregnancy has dropped sharply since 2007. This has led some to dub them""generation sensible"". A survey carried out by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service also stated that teenagers appear to be more focused on their family, education and careers. While many are applauding the risk-averse behaviour of young people, how would this attitude affect teenagers who get pregnant? We spoke to two teen mums about their experiences, and their opinions on ""generation sensible"". Jade-Marie, from Portsmouth, was 16 when she gave birth to her daughter Dawn-Louise. She says that ""it hurts to read that younger people are now apparently 'sensible'; it implies that I was stupid and was messing around."" ""There is definitely still a stigma attached to being a teen mum, but it is wrong to say that we are all reckless and careless,"" Jade-Marie told the BBC. She says that people have shouted at her in the street because she is a young mum: ""It is horrible that my daughter has to see that."" Jade-Marie and Dawn-Louise in 2010, when Dawn-Louise was three months old. Jade-Marie says that she has been ""patronised"" and ""put down"" as a mother. ""When I had my daughter I felt like I really needed to prove myself as a parent. It is frustrating that my credibility as a parent is taken away just because of my age. ""All new mums don't know what they are doing, but because I was 16 people judged me more.""

First woman wins world yacht race,"This video can not be played Wendy Tuck: ""It's a great day for sailing"" Australian Wendy Tuck has become the first female skipper to win the Clipper round-the-world yacht race. Thousands watched her team return to Liverpool,nearly a year after 12 yachts set out from the city. The 53-year-old told theAustralian Daily Telegraph,external: ""I hate banging on about women. I just do what I do but I am very proud."" British skipper Nikki Henderson, 25, came second with her team in the 40,000-mile race. Allow Twitter content?

The event, which was first held in 1996, involved 712 sailors travelling in difficult conditions to destinations including Uruguay, South Africa, China andNorthern Ireland. Professional sailors captain teams of amateurs. Nearly half of the crews, who come from 41 countries, had no previous sailing experience before signing up. The yachts returned to Liverpool after 11 months Race co-founder Sir Robin Knox-Johnston, who was the first person to sail solo nonstop around the world, said: ""If you realise that more people have climbed Mount Everest than have sailed around the world, you realise just what these people have done. ""There has never been a round-the-world sailing race where the leading skippers are women,"" he added. ""To have men and women competing together in sport on a level playing field is very special."" He said the success of Tuck and Henderson ""cannot be overestimated"". Sailors with Sir Robin Knox-Johnston (centre front) before leaving for Liverpool Tuck said she was experiencing ""a bit of shock, disbelief, joy, sadness,external- you name that emotion, I'm probably feeling it right now."" Henderson said: ""We didn't get the win but I am so proud of how my team dug deep and kept fighting right until the end."" Nottinghamshire firefighter Rebecca Sims, who sailed in Henderson's team during one leg of the race, said: ""To have a female one-two is probably the best outcome, really, so it's fantastic for women in sport. ""The women have dominated, they've done fantastic and I'm really pleased."" Londonderry hosted a maritime festival when the yachts reached the city Sports Minister Tracey Crouch said she had been ""watching it quite obsessively"", especially as Henderson is the daughter of her Conservative colleague, Guildford MP Anne Milton. ""It is really nice to be here at the end and to celebrate some remarkable achievements for two amazing female skippers.""

"Midwife school attacked in AfghanistanSome students and midwives have escaped, but others are still thought to be trapped inside.Asia","Black smoke could be seen rising from the scene of the attack Militants have attacked a midwife training centre in Afghanistan, killing two guards and a driver and injuring at least eight other people. The attackers set off explosives and fired gunshots at the centre in Jalalabad, Nangarhar province. Afghan security forces regained control after a gunfight lasting six hours. No group has yet said it was behind the attack, although Islamic State militants have claimed several recent attacks in the eastern province. The Taliban have denied any involvement. The attack began at around 11:30 local time (07:00 GMT) and ended around 18:00. The attackers placed explosive devices in the street near the complex, an eyewitness told AFP. Attaullah Khogyani, Nangarhar spokesman for the provincial governor, told the BBC one of the assailants died when he detonated an explosive vest, while the other was killed by security forces. Afghan police inspect the damaged centre In total, 61 midwives and two children were rescue from the compound, Mr Khogyani added. However, two guards and one driver were killed in the attack, while three members of the security forces, three civilians and two centre employees were hurt. The centre offers two-year midwifery training courses for women from the province. It is not clear why the midwife training centre was targeted. However, militants often choose official buildings and medical facilities for their attacks, and many Afghans are opposed to unmarried women working outside their homes. More than 50% of births in Afghanistan take place without a trained midwife. The country has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in the world -396 deaths per 100,000 live births,external- well above the global average of 216 deaths.

Eurostar and SWR workers begin strike,"Rail workers at South Western Railway and Eurostar have begun a 24 hour strike over separate disputes. RMT union members at Eurostar say they face ""dangerous"" overcrowding at London's St Pancras station, while the SWR strike is over the long-running dispute about the role of train guards. SWR said half of its services - in south-west London and southern counties of England - will be cancelled. Eurostar said a normal service will run as other workers will cover the shifts. Following the start of the walkouts at 00:01 on Saturday morning, theRMT said,externalworkers were ""standing rock solid"". The union said it was available for ""genuine talks"" in both disputes. Both strikes are set to last until 23:59 BST. Further SWR strikes are planned for the coming weeks, as part of a total of eight days of strike action in July and August. The first walkout was last Thursday and the next will be on Tuesday 31 July. The RMT has said changing the role of guards and extending driver-only services would compromise staff and passenger safety. The union has accused the company of putting ""private profits before public safety"". SWR said it will provide longer trains on Saturday, but passengers were advised to check their journey before travelling. Workers to strike over rail guards row Rail users suffered ""unacceptable"" delays Under-fire Grayling announces rail inquiry A company statement said it was ""frustrating and disappointing"" that the RMT strike was going ahead and apologised to passengers. ""This is despite proposals we have put forward which are similar to that of another train operator, Greater Anglia, which the RMT has recently agreed to. ""We are urging the RMT to return to talks and end this damaging disruption to passengers."" About 140 staff are involved in the Eurostar dispute, with the union saying the international terminal at St Pancras had been reduced to ""chaos"". Staff were bearing the brunt of public anger over delays to services, it said. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""The conditions at St Pancras have been simply appalling in recent weeks, with dangerous levels of overcrowding on the concourse as services plunge into meltdown on the cusp of the busiest part of the year. ""RMT will not tolerate a position where our members are left to pick up the pieces due to corporate failures."" The union said it was going to ballot train managers for industrial action over the same issue. A Eurostar spokesman said: ""If the strike action goes ahead, our plan is to run a normal service so that all passengers booked to travel with Eurostar will be able to do so.""

Arrest over murder of 13-year-old girl,"Lucy McHugh's body was found near Southampton's Sports Centre on Thursday morning A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering a 13-year-old girl whose body was found in woodland in Southampton. Lucy McHugh's body was found by a member of the public near Southampton Sports Centre at 07:45 BST on Thursday. Police said post-mortem tests were carried out earlier and some of Lucy's injuries were ""unexplained"". The arrested man, who is 24 and from Southampton, is also being held on suspicion of having sexual activity with a child. He remains in custody. Det Supt Paul Barton said Lucy had left her home in Mansel Road East at 09:30 BST on Wednesday 25 July and did not return home that evening as expected. He said she was reported missing to police that night. Mr Barton added: ""We're really keen to know what she did after leaving her house and would ask that anyone who saw her, had contact with her or knows of her movements on Wednesday contacts the incident room."" Police say Lucy was last seen wearing a black jacket with white sleeves, with the logo for the band Falling in Reverse on the front and RADKE 01 in red on the back. ""This is a tragic incident and our thoughts go out to Lucy's family and friends at this terrible time,"" said Mr Barton.

On one of its busiest weeks of the year, cross-Channel operator Eurotunnel said it was taking time to bring back carriages after they were removed from service during hot weather on Friday because of air-conditioning issues. Lightning strikes cause rail chaos Third day of Channel Tunnel disruption Eurostar and SWR workers begin strike Storms cause 'chaos' at Stansted The company says the situation had improved and it had restored a full service of four departures per hour from Folkestone. It said delays were likely to continue for the rest of the day but it would be running additional trains overnight to clear waiting times. Eurotunnel said the problems were due to ""unprecedented"" weather conditions and not a lack of investment in the stock. Passengers were advised to take drinking water and find toilet facilities before arriving at the Folkestone terminal. Trying to reach the terminal on Saturday morning Sarah Dodwell said: ""Queuing on the M20 for Eurotunnel - how to ruin a one-week big family holiday. ""Huge delays to check-in and departure, followed by a six-hour drive to come, with young children, means nine very tired people."" She said traffic on the M20 was very slow-moving and some cars were driving down the hard shoulder to beat the queues. It took Rebecca Kelly several hours to reach the terminal building Rebecca Kelly from Lewes said she had left at 07:00 BST for Folkestone - a journey that should have been one-and-a-half hours - however by 11:00 she had still not yet reached the terminal building car park. She described the situation as ""annoying"" but praised the check-in staff for their helpfulness. However Dom Hughes, who was delayed by three hours, said: ""I can accept delays but the total lack of communication is adding to the stress... Not a soul around to ask."" BBC environment correspondent Claire Marshall was caught up in the delays as she and her family headed on their summer holidays. She described the mood among would-be travellers as ""stoic"" with many accepting they were going to be stuck for hours. National Air Traffic Services (Nats) put temporary restrictions in place during the thundery weather on Friday, affecting flights from Edinburgh, Birmingham, Luton and Stansted. The UK air traffic control service said: ""Thunderstorms are particularly disruptive as they effectively block large swathes of airspace because aircraft cannot fly through them."" On Friday 30 flights were cancelled at Stansted airport with delays and further cancellations continuing into Saturday. A Stansted Airport spokesman said long queues shown in social media posts were caused by passengers who stayed overnight in the airport trying to re-book cancelled flights with airlines. Ryanair was forced to cancel a number of flights from the airport on Saturday and apologised for the ""weather and ATC [air traffic control] disruptions which are entirely beyond our control"". The company said affected passengers would be offered a refund or a place on the next available flight. Passengers wait following flight disruption at London Stansted Airport Joe Allen was trying to get to Berlin from Stansted said: ""It's midnight, Ryanair have just cancelled my flight after waiting roughly six hours. ""The queue is just unending. It's just incredible how unaccountable they are, there's no one here to deal with it."" Gatwick and Luton airports tweeted that they are experiencing delays and possible cancellations because of adverse weather across Europe, and Heathrow said it had minor delays. 2018 and 1976 - a tale of two heatwaves UK heatwave: The winners and losers Human actions boosted heatwave odds Traffic struggled through floodwater in Belfast The weather has had an impact across the country: In Clacton, Essex the body of a teenage boy who went missing after going into the seahas been found.

Fake news 'harms children',"A few weeks ago, Chloe, 13, shared a hoax story about the alleged death of a favourite actor, Sylvester Stallone. ""I thought it was real and shared it with family members. A lot of people were quite upset,"" she says. When the truth emerged that Sylvester Stallone was alive and well,Chloe says she felt stupid. ""I should have looked into it a bit more before posting,"" she adds. Chloe is not alone, according to a report from a group of MPs which says that falling for fake news can harm children's ""wellbeing, trust in journalism and democracy itself"". The all-party parliamentary group on literacy heard evidence that fake news could make children more anxious, damage their self-esteem and skew their world view. The actor has confirmed he is still alive In research for the report, the National Literacy Trust showed more than 2,000 UK eight to 16-year-olds six news stories, two of which were fake, and asked them to identify which were real and which were not. Only 2% got all six right. When he was 13, Mitch spotted what he thought was a good news story on Twitter. A missing airliner had been found and everyone on board was safe. There were pictures, he liked it and retweeted it and several of his friends did the same. But within hours it became clear the story was fake, the picture was an old one which had been reposted and Mitch and his friends had been conned. Now 16, he says he still remembers how upset he was ""to find it wasn't true and the families hadn't found their loved ones"". He says he felt shocked, foolish and embarrassed. Of the children questioned in the survey: almost half were worried about their inability to tell which stories in their social media feeds were false and which were real almost two-thirds said fake stories made them trust the news less TV is still the most popular source of news according to the survey. three quarters watch TV news and 80% say they trust it almost half listen to radio news and 75% say they trust it However, almost half of the secondary age pupils said they got news from social media, particularly Snapchat, and only about a quarter trusted what they read there. All of this contributes to a culture of fear and uncertainty among young people, says the report. The report found that children with the poorest literacy skills, often boys and those from disadvantaged backgrounds, were least likely to be able to spot fake news. Lucy Powell MP, who chairs the group, said the findings highlighted ""a dangerous lack in the literacy skills that children and young people require to navigate our digital world and identify fake news"". ""This is causing them to mistake false news for fact, become anxious as they believe misleading stories, and risk exposure to malign agendas,"" she added. The report includes a children's charter on fake news, developed with input from children and young people, which demands the right to accurate news from trustworthy media companies. It also urges greater efforts: to boost children's critical literacy skills by discussing stories from a range of sources in lessons to boost children's understanding of how news is made Presenter Mariella Frostrup said the report was ""an important reminder of the need to equip young people with confidence and skills to chart their own cautious course through the acres of fake news and propaganda"". Head teachers' leaders warned against putting additional demands on schools. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said schools once again found themselves ""on the front line of trying to provide a solution to a society-wide issue"". He said critical literacy was already taught through subjects including English and history and online safety in personal, social and health education. ""We would like to see more action from online platforms to prevent the proliferation of fake news stories in the first place."" And Nick Brooke, deputy general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, called for protected time on the curriculum for non-exam subjects. ""Yes, we need to teach grammar and spelling, but we also need to instil a thirst for knowledge, a love of reading and the critical literacy skills that enable young people to make informed decisions as to what to believe and what to ignore."" Mitch and his fellow sixth formers at St Michael's Catholic School in High Wycombe are keen to see better regulation of social media companies and would like it to be easier for people to report fake news stories and have them taken down. WhileBBC School ReporterChloe, from Ysgol Maesteg near Bridgend,has helped her school develop advice for pupils on how to tell fake news from fact.

Third day of Channel Tunnel disruption,"This video can not be played Passengers queued for hours at the Eurotunnel terminal and the Port of Dover. Eurotunnel passengers faced a third day of disruption after the heat caused air conditioning problems on cross-Channel trains. The company warned oflong delays,externalat its terminal near Folkestone in Kent. Eurotunnel said one train had been taken out of service overnight. On Thursday customers faced similar delays, and on Friday passengers were not allowed to travel if returning that day or on Saturday. Extreme weather leads to travel delays The company said all trains were running between Folkestone and Calais with up to five services an hour, although some ""capacity restrictions"" remained in place. Eurotunnel said delays were likely to continue for the rest of Saturday and possibly into Sunday as it was ""taking time"" to bring carriages back into service that were affected by the air conditioning failures. The company said traffic was no longer queuing on to the M20 from the terminal. Customers who wish to cancel their journeys on Saturday or Sunday have been told by Eurotunnel they can have a refund.

Passengers were asked not to travel unless it is ""absolutely necessary"". Sarah Dodwell told the BBC: ""We've just got off the M20 but are in very slow-moving traffic. ""The M20 is hopeless as there is no traffic management, so you either queue in the left lane for miles or join the hordes of cars and lorries going down the middle and outside lanes trying to beat the worst of the queue. ""Cars and lorries started driving down the hard shoulder, too, whilst we were stationary."" Elliot Smither told the BBC: ""We're not going anywhere"" Elliot Smither, who was travelling with his wife and two children, aged five and three, to Belgium told the BBC he expected to have to wait for an hour to clear passport control and then another five hours before boarding. He said his children were ""hot and bothered"", but ""things could be worse"". Dom Hughes said he and his family were facing an eight-hour drive from Calais to a campsite on the west coast of France. ""We hope to arrive before dark and that we can find our tent. ""It looks like it will be at least 14 hours, door to door, as we left London at 5am."" He said there was a lack of communication from Eurotunnel with passengers waiting at the terminal. ""Passenger tweets about Eurotunnel are the best way to get the latest information. Eurotunnel definitely need to up their communications on social media and on the ground."" He added: ""Cars with roof racks have an extra delay as they can't get on double-decker carriages, so go with the high vehicles."" Allow Twitter content?

Air travellers warned of drink risks,"Holidaymakers have been warned their getaways could be ruined if they drink too much at airports or on flights. The travel industry unveiled its One Too Many campaign on social media and displays at 10 UK airports, including Gatwick and Manchester, ahead of what is often their busiest weekend. Passengers are being reminded they could be denied boarding, and face fines or jail for serious incidents. A recent BBC investigation found a50% increase in arrests of drunken flyers. Thegovernment has also indicated that restrictions on the sale of alcohol at airports could be introducedamid reports that disruptive incidents on flights ""more often than not"" involved passengers who had had alcohol before boarding. The social media campaign is being run on Facebook and Instagram The new campaign from the UK Travel Retail Forum, the Airports Operators Association, the International Air Transport Association and Airlines UK tells travellers to ""Fly responsibly or you could pay the price"". Aberdeen, Birmingham, Bristol, East Midlands, Glasgow, Newcastle Southampton and Stansted are the other airports taking part. Passengers arrested for disrupting a flight can be jailed for up to two years and fined Â£5,000. They could also face an airline ban and be liable for a fee of up to Â£80,000 if they cause a flight to be diverted. Rafael Schvartzman from the IATA, said: ""While we should remember that disruptive passenger incidents are still relatively rare... ""Airlines have a zero-tolerance approach to unruly behaviour and cabin crew and passengers have a right to a flight free from disturbance and harassment."" Aviation Minister Baroness Sugg, said: ""Disruptive passengers have the potential to ruin other people's flights, and this campaign is an important new step to ensure all passengers are aware of the consequences they face if they behave disruptively after drinking before or on board a flight.""

Police chief admits force has 'poor service',"This video can not be played West Midlands Police chief Dave Thompson says he is ""sorry"" about poor service The chief constable of England's second largest police force has admitted it sometimes provides a poor service that fails to meet public expectations. Dave Thompson apologised and said budget cuts and fewer officers policing a ""wider spread of crime"" had left West Midlands Police at a point where it was not sustainable to tackle everything. He said he was ""drawing the bar higher"" as to what would be investigated. But the Home Office said every crime and allegation should be investigated. Speaking to BBC News, Mr Thompson said it was very challenging to balance ""all things at once"". ""The level of calls we're receiving this summer are very challenging [and] sometimes that service that we're providing [at] those peak times doesn't meet what the public expect. ""I get that. Sometimes that service will be a poor service, sometimes actually the service is what we can and say we will offer, and sometimes that might not always be what the public want to see."" Taxi driver Talal Hassan said he did not hear from police for six days after he was assaulted by passengers He said cuts across all public services had seen more vulnerable people coming into contact with police while ""the list"" of crimes, such as modern-day slavery and gun and gang crime, that must be investigated had grown. ""We may be dealing with it over the phone where they would like to see us and I'm sorry about that but that is the reality of where policing is now,"" he said. ""And on some occasions yes, you are right, the service will not meet what I want it to do and it will not meet the response that the public absolutely will want when they're at a time of vulnerability. ""We are drawing the bar higher than we used to as to what we will investigate."" Mr Thompson said he accepted ""drawing the bar higher"" - and perhaps no longer investigating offences such as criminal damage, car thefts and shoplifting - could undermine public confidence, but it was ""simply because of the resource available."" He stressed he was not talking about offences such as serious assaults. Taxi driver Talal Hassan was attacked by passengers in Kingstanding, Birmingham, in May. He said they threw ""a pile of bricks"" on him, hit his elbow and repeatedly hit his side causing severe bruising. He informed police after the incident but said he was not visited by officers for six days. ""I don't feel safe because if I work and someone attacks me - this is the police response? ""The funny thing is the guys who attack people always say that they're not scared of the police because they feel they will not get caught. ""That's what they tell you... they don't have any respect of law."" Mr Hassan said he was attacked with bricks and left badly bruised In November, leaked documents revealedWest Midlands Police was smaller than it had ever been in its historyafter losing almost 2,300 officers since 2010. Overall, forces in England and Wales have hada 20% funding cut over seven years. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said the force had been ""inundated by violent crime"" and that the homicide team was at ""breaking point"". ""It's extremely difficult to see how we can sustain what the public would call an acceptable level of policing,"" he said, adding that the pressures on the force meant ""things that frankly the public expect from the police are just not being done in the quality that people would expect"". ""It's a deadly equation,"" he said. Such is the pressure on officers, Mr Thompson went out on the front line himselfto help deal with a ""very high call demand"" across the force. The force had deployed many staff to help clear a ""backlog"" and he followed up three calls. Reality Check: Is crime up or down? What's happened to police numbers? West Midlands Police force 'smallest in its history' But Birmingham Edgbaston MP Preet Gill said Mr Thompson's comments overall meant ""basic policing"" was being overlooked. ""What the police ought to be doing is making sure they are absolutely taking the concerns of victims very, very seriously and responding to crime and clearly it's not happening."" A spokesperson for the Home Office said: ""Police have the resources they need to carry out this vital work and we have provided a strong and comprehensive settlement that is increasing total investment in the police system by over Â£460m in 2018-19. ""West Midlands Police will receive Â£534.3m in direct resource funding in 2018-19, including council tax precept - a cash increase of Â£9.9m compared with 2017-18."" Because the nature of crime is changing, the spokesman added, the policing minister had spoken to all forces to understand the demands they were facing. He said the home secretary had committed to prioritising police funding in next year's Spending Review.

Vote Leave boss asked to give evidence,"Dominic Cummings has answered MPs' questions before - in April 2016 MPs have backed a motion demanding Vote Leave director Dominic Cummings appears before a select committee by 20 June. Damian Collins, who chairs the committee, said efforts to invite Mr Cummings to appear had been ""unable to reach a satisfactory conclusion"". And there was now ""no alternative"" but to ask all MPs to support a motion ordering him to appear, he said. Mr Cummings has said he cannot appear while other inquiries continue and has accused the committee of grandstanding. The Commons unanimously approved a motion demanding Mr Cummings agree to appear before the Digital, Culture Media and Sport Committee on or before 20 June, as part of its inquiry into ""fake news"". Cambridge Analytica boss spars with MPs Vote Leave director reported to Commons Could Dominic Cummings really be forced to appear? Mr Cummings has argued that there are ""legal issues"" about him answering questions, because of a separate inquiry by the Electoral Commission. But Mr Collins said there was ""a certain irony"" that someone who had run a successful campaign to restore powers to Parliament ""seems to hold that institution in such contempt"". He said there were ""important questions"" for Mr Cummings to answer about the EU referendum campaign and, in reference to Mr Cummings's complaints about other investigations by the Electoral Commission and Information Commissioner, said the matter was not ""sub judice"" and Mr Cummings was not before the courts. The committee questioned Cambridge Analytica's Alexander Nix on Wednesday ""His decision not to come, whatever he says, is one of his own making. It's a deliberate attempt to deny Parliament its right to question witnesses on matters of importance,"" Mr Collins said. He added it was ""the first time since 1920 that a motion of this kind has been put before this House"". Hilary Benn, who chairs another select committee said if potential witnesses began to think ""'I don't have to turn up,' then how can we continue to do our job .... in holding the powerful to account?"" and suggested legislation be drafted to deal with people who refused to attend. The motion was backed by Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom. And Conservative MP Dr Sarah Wollaston, who also chairs a select committee, called Mr Cummings's actions ""a disgrace"" and agreed with Mr Benn that it was time to consider introducing a penalty for witnesses refusing to appear. It had been reported that Mr Cummings had intended to come to the Commons while the issue was being debated, but he was not in the public gallery for the debate. Allow Twitter content?

He has accused the DCMS committee of ""grandstanding"" and wrote in response to a letter from Mr Collins: ""I'm calling your bluff. Your threats are as empty as those from [Prime Minister Theresa May, Chancellor Philip Hammond and Brexit Secretary David Davis] to the EU. Say what you like, I will not come to your committee regardless of how many letters you send or whether you send characters in fancy dress to hand me papers. ""If another committee behaves reasonably and I can give evidence without compromising various legal actions, then I will consider it. Once these legal actions have finished, presumably this year, it will be easy to arrange if someone else wants to do it."" BBC parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy saysit could become an interesting test case for the Commons- about Parliament's ability to summon witnesses. The MPs are looking at how consulting company Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of millions of Facebook users worldwide. The London-based company - which announced it was closing in May - is accused of acquiring data from up to 87 million Facebook profiles for use in political campaigns. Cambridge Analytica has denied any wrongdoing. There have also been questions about links between Cambridge Analytica and the Vote Leave campaign. Vote Leave spent Â£2.7m on the services of Canadian digital agency AIQ in the run-up to the June 2016 EU referendum and AIQ has admitted it also conducted work for Cambridge Analytica's parent company, SCL. The leaders of the other main Leave campaign, Leave.EU, are due to give evidence to the committee on 12 June. Former Cambridge Analytica chief Alexander Nix appeared before it on Wednesday.

Fake news 'travels faster',"A study of 126,000 rumours and false news stories spread on Twitter over a period of 11 years found that they travelled faster and reached more people than the truth. Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology also found that fake news was more commonly re-tweeted by humans than bots. They said it could be because fake news tends to be ""more novel"". The most common subject matter was false political news. Other popular topics included urban legends, business, terrorism, science, entertainment and natural disasters. Twitter provided its data for the research. The firm told the BBC that it isalready engaged with trying to devise a ""health check"" to measure its contribution to public conversation. ""False news is more novel, and people are more likely to share novel information,"" said Professor Sinan Aral, one of the study's co-authors. While the team did not conclude that novelty on its own caused the re-tweets, they said false news tended to be more surprising than real news, which may make it more likely to be shared. This video can not be played Texas shooting: How to spot a hoax Prof Aral, Soroush Vosoughi and associate professor Deb Roy began their research in the aftermath of theBoston marathon bombing in 2013. ""Twitter became our main source of news,"" said Dr Vosoughi. ""I realized that â¦ a good chunk of what I was reading on social media was rumours; it was false news."" The team used six independent fact-checking sources, including Snopes and Urbanlegend, to identify whether the stories in the study were genuine. Their findings,published in the journal Science,external, included: false news stories were 70% more likely to be re-tweeted than true stories It took true stories around six times longer to reach 1,500 people True stories were rarely shared beyond 1,000 people, but the most popular false news could reach up to 100,000 Psychology Prof Geoffrey Beattie from Edge Hill University in Lancashire, told the BBC there is a position of power associated with being someone who shares information that others have not heard before - regardless of whether or not it is true. ""People want to share information that is newsworthy - in some sense the truth value is less of a concern,"" he said. He compared the spread of fake news with the sharing of gossip. ""The point about gossip is, the best gossip is juicy gossip - the last thing people are worried about is whether it is true or not,"" he said. ""It's whether it is plausible or not. ""We are saturated with news, so things have to be more and more surprising, or disgusting, to get attention.""

Review: Spamilton - An American Parody,"Let's get straight down to it and deal with the two fundamental questions about Spamilton, the 90-minute spoof of the trans-Atlantic musical mega-hit Hamilton. One: is it any good? Yes. Two: do you need to have seen Hamilton first? Not necessarily. This article contains language that some readers may find offensive. But you should be across it, having either trawled YouTube for clips (there are loads) or at least gained some knowledge of the musical numbers. That'd probably do the job. The show's premise is straightforward. While Hamilton tells the story of the 18th Century American statesman Alexander Hamilton, the founding father whose face appears on the $10 bill, Spamilton is a spoof of the blockbuster stage show itself and its precociously talented creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda. Lin-Manuel Miranda and the US cast of Hamilton perform during the 2016 Tony Awards And so, the opening song in Hamilton, which starts like this: How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a/Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten/Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor/Grow up to be a hero and a scholar? ...is mimicked in Spamilton but with different lyrics and subject: How does a whipper-snapper student of rap and a/Latin trapped in the middle of a Manhattan flat/Win Broadway accolades/While other writers kiss the corporate dollar/Grow up to be a hip-hop opera scholar? And so it goes. Lol. Miranda is gently teased throughout for being an over-eager nerd with a streak of pomposity. ""I'm not gonna let Broadway rot!"" he proclaims in a reworking of the Hamilton number My Shot. Damian Humbley getting the laughs as King George It would be ridiculous to say Spamilton is as good as Miranda's modern masterpiece from which it draws, but it is very neat and tidy with a bubbly cast who romp through the show with a twinkle in their eyes and a mocking skip in their step. That's their job - to put the ham into Hamilton. There are two standout performances. Damian Humbley as the King/Queen (you'll see) is every bit as good as any of the three King George's I've seen play the role in the original. And Julie Yammanee is excellent in her multiple guises and also brings something fresh to the party that Hamilton does not have, which is a leading lady who has parity with the main male protagonists. Julie Yammanee helps give Spamilton a better gender balance than the show it's based on Like all spoofs, Spamilton, which is at the Menier Chocolate Factory in London, is both given life and held back by the subject it is parodying. There are times when you can feel the new lyrics being forced into the original songs like a middle-aged man trying to get into a pair of swimming trunks from his glory days. It can be wince inducing. But that is part of the fun. And rest assured, you are in capable hands. Spamilton comes from the mischievous mind of Gerard Alessandrini, a serial spoof merchant, who first entered the Broadway musical parody scene in 1982 when Lin-Manuel Miranda was still in nappies (although, being so darn smart, he probably wasn't). That first revue show was called Forbidden Broadway, which has kept going in various guises for decades, and traces of it are to be found in Spamilton. Liam Tamne as Lin-Manuel Miranda To be blunt, the diversion into hit musicals of yore feels like padding, but Alessandrini has used an appropriately satirical device to introduce the likes of Elaine Page. She enters stage right covered by a large hooded cape and bent double like a wicked old lady. She is desperately seeking tickets to see Hamilton, which are too expensive and too rare for her to obtain, but alasâ¦ She leaves disappointed. Which I don't think you will. Spamilton is shorter, funnier, and cheaper (tickets and staging) than the show from which it openly and gleefully admits it parasites. It's a hoot. Even Lin-Manuel Miranda thinks so. But then, he is getting royalties.

Probe over donations to terror-linked groupA group linked to a banned terrorist organisation in Northern Ireland received money from a trust.,"An Irish National Liberation Army memorial in Derry City cemetery The Charity Commission is investigating claims the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust gave Â£275,000 to a group linked to a banned terrorist organisation in Northern Ireland. The Times says,externalthe trust gave the funds to Teach Na Failte, which supports ex-prisoners but has links to the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). The watchdog said the charity needs to ""explain and justify"" its decision. The trust says it has ""no relationship with any proscribed organisations"". Critics argue that Teach na Failte is too closely linked with the INLA, a republican paramilitary group believed to have been responsible for more than 120 murders from its formation in 1975 until its ceasefire in 1998. Who are the INLA? Michelle Russell, director of investigations and enforcement at the Charity Commission, said: ""Our guidance makes clear that charities need to take steps to carry out appropriate due diligence on organisations applying for grants, must ensure grants are only for activities and outcomes that further the charity's purposes and decisions made are in charity's best interests. ""Charities should be able to explain and justify their funding decisions. We have asked the charity to do this. ""If we need to take action in either case we will not hesitate to do so."" The Joseph Rowntree Trust said it has worked to end violence in Northern Ireland for more than 40 years and funds groups ""transitioning from violence in loyalist and republican communities"". It said Teach na Failte was awarded a grant of Â£149,915 in 2014, and a further Â£125,000 in March 2017. ""Teach na Failte is recognised by HMRC as a charitable body,"" the trust said. ""It provides a range of peace-building community initiatives including support for INLA ex-prisoners and their families. ""Teach na Failte has been a key player in the INLA ceasefire and decommissioning process."" Earlier this year,police carried out a series of searches across Northern Ireland,specifically targeting the INLA. The operation targeted extortion, paramilitary-style assaults and prostitution, police said. The headquarters of the IRSP (Irish Republican Socialist Party), which is aligned to the INLA, on the Falls Road in west Belfast and Teach na Failte's offices were searched. A senior party member dismissed this as ""a publicity stunt"". 200 police officers were involved in the operation targeting the INLA in April More than eight years ago, the INLA said it was ending its campaign of violence and would pursue its objectives with exclusively peaceful means. But the police have said the organisation remains structurally intact and now operates as an organised crime gang. Formed in 1975, many of the INLA's early recruits were thought to have come from the Official IRA which had called a ceasefire three years earlier. It came to world prominence in 1979 with the murder of Conservative Northern Ireland spokesman Airey Neave. A bomb was left under his car in the House of Commons car park.

Rail workers at two operators to strike,"Rail workers at South Western Railway and Eurostar have begun a 24 hour strike over separate disputes.

SWR said half of its services - in south-west London and southern counties of England - will be cancelled. Eurostar said a normal service will run as other workers will cover the shifts. Following the start of the walkouts at 00:01 on Saturday morning, theRMT said,externalworkers were ""standing rock solid"". The union said it was available for ""genuine talks"" in both disputes. Both strikes are set to last until 23:59 BST. Further SWR strikes are planned for the coming weeks, as part of a total of eight days of strike action in July and August. The first walkout was last Thursday and the next will be on Tuesday 31 July. The RMT has said changing the role of guards and extending driver-only services would compromise staff and passenger safety. The union has accused the company of putting ""private profits before public safety"". SWR said it will provide longer trains on Saturday, but passengers were advised to check their journey before travelling. Workers to strike over rail guards row Rail users suffered ""unacceptable"" delays Under-fire Grayling announces rail inquiry A company statement said it was ""frustrating and disappointing"" that the RMT strike was going ahead and apologised to passengers. ""This is despite proposals we have put forward which are similar to that of another train operator, Greater Anglia, which the RMT has recently agreed to. ""We are urging the RMT to return to talks and end this damaging disruption to passengers."" About 140 staff are involved in the Eurostar dispute, with the union saying the international terminal at St Pancras had been reduced to ""chaos"". Staff were bearing the brunt of public anger over delays to services, it said. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: ""The conditions at St Pancras have been simply appalling in recent weeks, with dangerous levels of overcrowding on the concourse as services plunge into meltdown on the cusp of the busiest part of the year. ""RMT will not tolerate a position where our members are left to pick up the pieces due to corporate failures."" The union said it was going to ballot train managers for industrial action over the same issue. A Eurostar spokesman said: ""If the strike action goes ahead, our plan is to run a normal service so that all passengers booked to travel with Eurostar will be able to do so.""

Probe over donations to terror-linked group,"An Irish National Liberation Army memorial in Derry City cemetery The Charity Commission is investigating claims the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust gave Â£275,000 to a group linked to a banned terrorist organisation in Northern Ireland. The Times says,externalthe trust gave the funds to Teach Na Failte, which supports ex-prisoners but has links to the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). The watchdog said the charity needs to ""explain and justify"" its decision. The trust says it has ""no relationship with any proscribed organisations"". Critics argue that Teach na Failte is too closely linked with the INLA, a republican paramilitary group believed to have been responsible for more than 120 murders from its formation in 1975 until its ceasefire in 1998. Who are the INLA? Michelle Russell, director of investigations and enforcement at the Charity Commission, said: ""Our guidance makes clear that charities need to take steps to carry out appropriate due diligence on organisations applying for grants, must ensure grants are only for activities and outcomes that further the charity's purposes and decisions made are in charity's best interests. ""Charities should be able to explain and justify their funding decisions. We have asked the charity to do this. ""If we need to take action in either case we will not hesitate to do so."" The Joseph Rowntree Trust said it has worked to end violence in Northern Ireland for more than 40 years and funds groups ""transitioning from violence in loyalist and republican communities"". It said Teach na Failte was awarded a grant of Â£149,915 in 2014, and a further Â£125,000 in March 2017. ""Teach na Failte is recognised by HMRC as a charitable body,"" the trust said. ""It provides a range of peace-building community initiatives including support for INLA ex-prisoners and their families. ""Teach na Failte has been a key player in the INLA ceasefire and decommissioning process."" Earlier this year,police carried out a series of searches across Northern Ireland,specifically targeting the INLA. The operation targeted extortion, paramilitary-style assaults and prostitution, police said. The headquarters of the IRSP (Irish Republican Socialist Party), which is aligned to the INLA, on the Falls Road in west Belfast and Teach na Failte's offices were searched. A senior party member dismissed this as ""a publicity stunt"". 200 police officers were involved in the operation targeting the INLA in April More than eight years ago, the INLA said it was ending its campaign of violence and would pursue its objectives with exclusively peaceful means. But the police have said the organisation remains structurally intact and now operates as an organised crime gang. Formed in 1975, many of the INLA's early recruits were thought to have come from the Official IRA which had called a ceasefire three years earlier. It came to world prominence in 1979 with the murder of Conservative Northern Ireland spokesman Airey Neave. A bomb was left under his car in the House of Commons car park.

Storms and rain roll in as heatwave ends,"Traffic queued up on the approach to the Eurotunnel terminal in Kent Storms and flooding have disrupted road travel and caused flights to be cancelled as the UK heatwave came to an end. In Northern Ireland, up to 88.2mm of rainfall was recorded in a few hours. Homes were flooded in County Antrim and traffic brought to a standstill. Travellers have facedlong delays at Eurotunnel, after air-conditioning failed on trains, and there were two-hour waits for ferries in Dover. Storms in Europe affected airlines. Flights from Edinburgh, Birmingham, Luton and Stansted have been delayed and some cancelled after temporary restrictions were put in place during thunderstorms on Friday. Yellow warnings are in place for south-west Scotland and also Northern Ireland,where heavy rain and thunderstorms have led to flooding. Allow Twitter content?

On one of its busiest weeks of the year, cross-Channel operator Eurotunnel said it was taking time to bring back carriages after they were removed from service during hot weather on Friday because of air-conditioning issues. Lightning strikes cause rail chaos Third day of Channel Tunnel disruption Eurostar and SWR workers begin strike Storms cause 'chaos' at Stansted The company says the situation had improved and it had restored a full service of four departures per hour from Folkestone. It said delays were likely to continue for the rest of the day but it would be running additional trains overnight to clear waiting times. Eurotunnel said the problems were due to ""unprecedented"" weather conditions and not a lack of investment in the stock. Passengers were advised to take drinking water and find toilet facilities before arriving at the Folkestone terminal. Trying to reach the terminal on Saturday morning Sarah Dodwell said: ""Queuing on the M20 for Eurotunnel - how to ruin a one-week big family holiday. ""Huge delays to check-in and departure, followed by a six-hour drive to come, with young children, means nine very tired people."" She said traffic on the M20 was very slow-moving and some cars were driving down the hard shoulder to beat the queues. It took Rebecca Kelly several hours to reach the terminal building Rebecca Kelly from Lewes said she had left at 07:00 BST for Folkestone - a journey that should have been one-and-a-half hours - however by 11:00 she had still not yet reached the terminal building car park. She described the situation as ""annoying"" but praised the check-in staff for their helpfulness. However Dom Hughes, who was delayed by three hours, said: ""I can accept delays but the total lack of communication is adding to the stress... Not a soul around to ask."" BBC environment correspondent Claire Marshall was caught up in the delays as she and her family headed on their summer holidays. She described the mood among would-be travellers as ""stoic"" with many accepting they were going to be stuck for hours. National Air Traffic Services (Nats) put temporary restrictions in place during the thundery weather on Friday, affecting flights from Edinburgh, Birmingham, Luton and Stansted. The UK air traffic control service said: ""Thunderstorms are particularly disruptive as they effectively block large swathes of airspace because aircraft cannot fly through them."" On Friday 30 flights were cancelled at Stansted airport with delays and further cancellations continuing into Saturday. A Stansted Airport spokesman said long queues shown in social media posts were caused by passengers who stayed overnight in the airport trying to re-book cancelled flights with airlines. Ryanair was forced to cancel a number of flights from the airport on Saturday and apologised for the ""weather and ATC [air traffic control] disruptions which are entirely beyond our control"". The company said affected passengers would be offered a refund or a place on the next available flight. Passengers wait following flight disruption at London Stansted Airport Joe Allen was trying to get to Berlin from Stansted said: ""It's midnight, Ryanair have just cancelled my flight after waiting roughly six hours. ""The queue is just unending. It's just incredible how unaccountable they are, there's no one here to deal with it."" Gatwick and Luton airports tweeted that they are experiencing delays and possible cancellations because of adverse weather across Europe, and Heathrow said it had minor delays. 2018 and 1976 - a tale of two heatwaves UK heatwave: The winners and losers Human actions boosted heatwave odds Traffic struggled through floodwater in Belfast The weather has had an impact across the country: In Clacton, Essex the body of a teenage boy who went missing after going into the seahas been found.

Obituary: Mary Ellis the air pioneerDog reunited with owners after two yearsTeen mums respond to 'generation sensible'The 'Snapchat Queen' who filmed her boyfriend's death'I was given HIV at eight â and couldnât tell a soul',"Mary Ellis was a pioneering woman pilot of the Air Transport Auxiliary Mary Ellis blazed a trail for female aviators, as one of the first women to fly Spitfires, heavy bombers and jet aircraft. She was a member of the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA), which employed civilians to deliver planes from factories to airfields during the Second World War. However, her contribution to the war effort was not always appreciated. At one RAF base, the ground crew refused to believe she was the pilot of the Wellington bomber she had just landed. ""They actually went inside the aeroplane and searched it,"" she recalled. ""Everybody was flabbergasted that a little girl like me could fly these big aeroplanes all by oneself."" Mary Ellis died on Tuesday at the age of 101. Born Mary Wilkins to a farming family in Leafield, Oxfordshire, she grew up close to RAF bases at Bicester and Port Meadow. ""I was interested in aeroplanes from almost the year dot,"" she said. As a child, her father paid a flying circus to take her on a pleasure flight in a de Havilland 60 Moth. ""I think that sealed my fate forever,"" she later recalled. Her teenage ""passion for the skies"" led to flying lessons at Witney airfield. When war broke out, a flying licence and that experience made her a suitable candidate for the ATA, which allowed qualified women to join as pilots from 1940. Mary Ellis joined the ATA in 1941 after hearing an advertisement on BBC radio This video can not be played Mary Ellis said she had flown ""about 1,000 aeroplanes"" during the war The idea had a mixed reception. The Aeroplane magazine fumed in a 1940 editorial: ""Women anxious to serve their country should take on work more befitting their sex instead of encroaching on a man's occupation."" Another editor wrote: ""The menace is the woman who thinks that she ought to be flying in a high-speed bomber when she really has not the intelligence to scrub the floor of a hospital properly."" ""Girls flying aeroplanes was almost a sin at that time,"" Mary Ellis later recalled. Against this background and despite her mother's misgivings, she applied to the ATA after hearing an advertisement on BBC radio and was ""readily accepted"" in 1941. The first ATA women had a mixed reception in the media She was soon flying ""fast and furious aeroplanes and bombers all over the country"", as aircraft production and casualties rose. The work was ""exhilarating and sometimes very dangerous"", she recalled. Pilots often flew unfamiliar aircraft, guided by the ""Ferry Pilots notes"", which gave landing instructions. ""We'd say to each other, 'Oh look what I've got, look what I've got'. And that was terribly exciting. Sometimes frightening as well because the aeroplanes were all different. You'd get out of a Tiger Moth into a Wellington bomber and then into a Spitfire."" Based at an all-women's ATA pool in Hamble, Hampshire, she recalled that she flew ""about 1,000"" aircraft during the war including 76 different types. Mary Ellis said the women ""proved that we could handle aeroplanes and do the job that we were supposed to do."" Mary Ellis came close to death on several occasions. She was shot at over Bournemouth, possibly by friendly fire, and had a near-miss as she landed in fog at the same time as another Spitfire coming in the opposite direction. She also survived a crash-landing when the undercarriage on her Spitfire jammed, causing the engine to overheat. ""I just knew that I had to do something before the engine blew up. One didn't get excited or anything else. It's just a part of the job of coping with an aeroplane."" Nearly one in 10 of the ATA's 168 female members were killed during the war, including aviation pioneer Amy Johnson. Mary's friend Dora Lang died in a crash in 1944. ""I missed her terribly"", she recalled. ""And for two days I was not allowed to fly - I didn't want to. But after that one realised, well, there is a war on, we must get on with our jobs. And we did."" Mrs Ellis recalled flying ""about 1,000 aeroplanes"" during the war The ATA's founder, Pauline Gower, had joked the organisation's acronym could stand for ""Always Terrified Airwomen"". But Mary said the women ""proved that we could handle aeroplanes and do the job that we were supposed to do."" They were also able to enjoy an active social life. ""We had lots of boyfriends. Because at that time we were called the 'glamour girls' - I don't know why. But there were always plenty of escorts around."" Mary Ellis said the Spitfire was ""everybody's favourite"" aircraft When the ATA was disbanded in 1945, Mary Wilkins was seconded to the RAF, where she became one of the first women to fly Britain's first jet fighter, the Gloster Meteor. She went on to become manager of Sandown Airport on the Isle of Wight in the 1950s and 1960s, hiring a former ATA colleague, Vera Strodl, as chief flying instructor. A correspondent for Flight Magazine, visiting the airport in 1951, described it as a ""woman pilots' Utopia"", whose ""extra quota of feminine charm... has had no disturbing effect on the enthusiasm of club members."" Away from the airport, she indulged a love of fast cars, entering and winning sports car rallies, and ran a fashion boutique. ""She is the most glamorous person I know,"" her niece Rosemarie Martin recalled before Mary's death. ""She enjoys fashion and always wears nail polish. Very strong on etiquette - the right china, the right cutlery, your manners, she could write a book on that."" At the age of 101, Mary Ellis was still driving daily to local shops Mary married Don Ellis, a fellow pilot, in 1961, and began to host ""legendary parties"", Ms Martin said. She continued to live in the marital home beside the runway at Sandown after his death in 2009. At the age of 101, she was still driving daily to local shops. In November 2016, she and fellowATA pilot Joy Lofthousewere honoured in front of members of the Royal Family at the annual Festival of Remembrance at the Royal Albert Hall in London. ""Being an ATA pilot was fantastic,"" Mary Ellis recalled. ""Up in the air on your own. And you can do whatever you like. I flew 400 Spitfires. And occasionally I would take one up and go and play with the clouds. ""I would like to do it all over again. There was a war on but otherwise it was absolutely wonderful.""

Minnie the shih tzu was in Oliver Clough's parked vehicle while the farrier was working in Hatfield, South Yorkshire in June 2016. A thief jumped in the truck and drove off. It was found two weeks later on an estate, but Minnie had gone. Mr Clough's partner Carrie Ryan said she was in ""floods of tears"" when told Minnie had been found alive.

Teen mums respond to 'generation sensible'The 'Snapchat Queen' who filmed her boyfriend's death'I was given HIV at eight â and couldnât tell a soul',"Young people in the UK arehaving less sex than they used toand the rate of teenage pregnancy has dropped sharply since 2007. This has led some to dub them""generation sensible"". A survey carried out by the British Pregnancy Advisory Service also stated that teenagers appear to be more focused on their family, education and careers. While many are applauding the risk-averse behaviour of young people, how would this attitude affect teenagers who get pregnant? We spoke to two teen mums about their experiences, and their opinions on ""generation sensible"". Jade-Marie, from Portsmouth, was 16 when she gave birth to her daughter Dawn-Louise. She says that ""it hurts to read that younger people are now apparently 'sensible'; it implies that I was stupid and was messing around."" ""There is definitely still a stigma attached to being a teen mum, but it is wrong to say that we are all reckless and careless,"" Jade-Marie told the BBC. She says that people have shouted at her in the street because she is a young mum: ""It is horrible that my daughter has to see that."" Jade-Marie and Dawn-Louise in 2010, when Dawn-Louise was three months old. Jade-Marie says that she has been ""patronised"" and ""put down"" as a mother. ""When I had my daughter I felt like I really needed to prove myself as a parent. It is frustrating that my credibility as a parent is taken away just because of my age.

The 'Snapchat Queen' who filmed her boyfriend's death'I was given HIV at eight â and couldnât tell a soul',"Fatima Khan helped to orchestrate the murder of her boyfriend Khalid Safi. On a December night in west London, Fatima Khan approached her boyfriend as he lay dying from multiple stab wounds on the pavement. But instead of helping him, or even calling emergency services, she took out her mobile phone and videoed him. Witnesses who were trying to help the fatally injured man, Khalid Safi, challenged her, asking what she was planning to do - put the video on social media? That is exactly what Fatima did. She posted the image of her dying boyfriend on Snapchat with a warning that that was what happened when people messed with her. She used an expletive instead of the word ""mess"". The 21-year-old self-confessed ""Snapchat addict"" orchestrated the killing of Khalid. She arranged for a rival for her affections, a man called Raza Khan, to kill him, her trial at the Old Bailey heard. CCTV images showed her calmly filming the scene of the attack as she talked on another phone to her accomplice while he was making his escape. As with all Snapchat videos, the pictures would have been automatically deleted within 24 hours. However, one of the group of friends who followed her online posts filmed the message and two years later it re-emerged as the key evidence in her trial. Fatima's own defence barrister told the jury how she seemed to live her entire life on social media. ""She may be Ilford's Snapchat queen,"" Kerim Fuad QC said. ""I don't say that to make light of it,"" he told the court. ""She's another example of youngsters who seem to live their life through the prism of Snapchat. ""It's a product of a mobile telephone driven obsession. It's not healthy,"" he admitted. Khalid Safi was stabbed to death in December 2016 The trial heard how 18-year-old Khalid was stabbed to death on 1 December 2016. The teenager had been the on/off boyfriend of Fatima for several years. However, 19-year-old Raza had also had a previous relationship with her. She would Snapchat Raza on a daily basis as part of a group chat. The two rivals - Raza and Khalid - had previously had a fight over Fatima, during which Khalid was stabbed. Later, Fatima complained to her friends about Khalid being ""too clingy"" and in the days leading up to his murder the court heard how things ""were clearly coming to a head"". He had bought Fatima a watch as a present, but when he visited her she threw it out of a window because she was angry he had come to her house. Fatima had ""willingly and knowingly"" agreed with Raza to kill Khalid, the court heard. She told Raza where to find him and made sure Khalid was in the right place when he arrived by minicab in North Acton on the night of his death. CCTV showed Raza walking over to Fatima with witnesses describing him as carrying a large knife. Fatima was also said to be unsurprised by his sudden arrival. After a brief fight, Raza stabbed the victim in the heart and ran off. His whereabouts are still unknown and he remains a wanted man. ""Fatima Khan did not call the emergency services, she did not ask anyone else to do so and she did not try to assist Khalid Safi at all herself,"" Prosecutor Kate Bex QC told the trial. ""Instead she returned to the scene after Raza Khan had inflicted the fatal wounds and videoed Khalid Safi as he lay dying in a pool of blood."" Raza Khan is wanted for the murder of Khalid Safi On the day of Khalid's death, the images Fatima posted on Snapchat amounted to a digital diary of a murder. She told police she had argued with her boyfriend - on the way to the scene she had filmed part of the row on her mobile and posted it online. Fatima had claimed she was terrified and had posted the video as a ""plea for help"", the prosecutor said. But there was nothing to suggest such fear, the prosecutor added, and Fatima made ""no request for help"". Fatima told police she hadn't been able to call the emergency services after the attack as she could not get her fingers to use the keypad of her phone. But she had been able to post several further messages to Snapchat after the killing. One showed her taking an Uber taxi home after the killing. The post was captioned: ""Uber long life."" Another showed a video of the carpet of her home when she arrived, when she could be heard talking with her parents. ""If she had ever been, she was no longer shocked and acting impulsively by that time,"" argued the prosecution. Fatima never reported the incident - it was a relative of the victim who contacted police days later and gave them her address. In her defence, she told the court she had wanted to leave the scene before anything happened. But the prosecution argued this was contradicted by the fact she returned to film Khalid as he lay dying on the pavement. Fatima's barrister said she was ""hugely callous - crass even - in taking that image of Khalid on the pavement and posting it with those words. ""If there was a charge for being callous and crass in the aftermath of this shocking incident she would plead guilty to that charge."" Fatima Khan was instead charged with joint enterprise murder, with an alternative of manslaughter or conspiracy to cause grievous bodily harm. At the end of her four-week trial, the jury cleared her of murder, but found her guilty of manslaughter by a majority verdict.

"Boys jailed for teen's torture murderThe gang members, all aged 15, are handed life sentences for killing Jacob Abraham in December.Beds, Herts & Bucks","Kai Fisher-Dixon, Shuayb Mahomud, Tremayne Gray, Omarion Stephens and Abdulqaliq Mohamed were jailed for murder Five teenagers who ""tortured"" a 15-year-old boy to death have been sentenced to life in prison. Kai Fisher-Dixon, Shuayb Mahomud, Tremayne Gray, Omarion Stephens and Abdulqaliq Mohamed attacked Jacob Abraham in Waltham Cross in December. The boys, all aged 15 and from Enfield, north London, denied murder but were found guilty by a jury after a five-week trial at St Albans Crown Court. They can be named after the judge Mr Justice Edis lifted anonymity orders. Gray and Stephens were sentenced to serve at least 14 years, Mohamed was sentenced to at least 13 years, and Fisher-Dixon and Mahomud handed 12-year terms. The judge said: ""The purpose was to punish him [Jacob] by the deliberate infliction of serious pain and humiliation, but to leave him alive. ""That was what I meant when I used the word torture in the course of the hearing and I do not shrink from it."" Jacob Abraham died 10 days before his 16th birthday Jurors heard how Stephens and Gray wielded the knives but the prosecution said all of the boys were responsible for Jacob's death, having lured him to the scene to suffer ""at least really serious harm"". During the trial, the court heard that Jacob had been involved in a number of fights and got into an argument with the AP gang. After posting an online challenge, he was stabbed eight times in an alleyway behind his home on 7 December. Three of the teenagers, who were just 14 at the time, had to change out of their school uniforms before carrying out the ""punishment mission"". The court heard they wanted to teach Jacob a lesson because he was a rival to their ""county lines"" drug operation. The boys were caught on CCTV at Waltham Cross bus station on the night of the murder In a victim impact statement, Jacob's mother said his death had left ""a large hole"". Det Ch Insp Jerome Kent said: ""This was a tragic and upsetting case due to the young age of both the victim and the offenders, who are just children. ""If those boys had chosen not to carry knives that night, I truly believe Jacob would still be alive today.""

Police chief admits force offers 'poor service',"This video can not be played West Midlands Police chief Dave Thompson says he is ""sorry"" about poor service The chief constable of England's second largest police force has admitted it sometimes provides a poor service that fails to meet public expectations. Dave Thompson apologised and said budget cuts and fewer officers policing a ""wider spread of crime"" had left West Midlands Police at a point where it was not sustainable to tackle everything. He said he was ""drawing the bar higher"" as to what would be investigated. But the Home Office said every crime and allegation should be investigated. Speaking to BBC News, Mr Thompson said it was very challenging to balance ""all things at once"". ""The level of calls we're receiving this summer are very challenging [and] sometimes that service that we're providing [at] those peak times doesn't meet what the public expect. ""I get that. Sometimes that service will be a poor service, sometimes actually the service is what we can and say we will offer, and sometimes that might not always be what the public want to see."" Taxi driver Talal Hassan said he did not hear from police for six days after he was assaulted by passengers He said cuts across all public services had seen more vulnerable people coming into contact with police while ""the list"" of crimes, such as modern-day slavery and gun and gang crime, that must be investigated had grown. ""We may be dealing with it over the phone where they would like to see us and I'm sorry about that but that is the reality of where policing is now,"" he said. ""And on some occasions yes, you are right, the service will not meet what I want it to do and it will not meet the response that the public absolutely will want when they're at a time of vulnerability. ""We are drawing the bar higher than we used to as to what we will investigate."" Mr Thompson said he accepted ""drawing the bar higher"" - and perhaps no longer investigating offences such as criminal damage, car thefts and shoplifting - could undermine public confidence, but it was ""simply because of the resource available."" He stressed he was not talking about offences such as serious assaults. Taxi driver Talal Hassan was attacked by passengers in Kingstanding, Birmingham, in May. He said they threw ""a pile of bricks"" on him, hit his elbow and repeatedly hit his side causing severe bruising. He informed police after the incident but said he was not visited by officers for six days. ""I don't feel safe because if I work and someone attacks me - this is the police response? ""The funny thing is the guys who attack people always say that they're not scared of the police because they feel they will not get caught. ""That's what they tell you... they don't have any respect of law."" Mr Hassan said he was attacked with bricks and left badly bruised In November, leaked documents revealedWest Midlands Police was smaller than it had ever been in its historyafter losing almost 2,300 officers since 2010. Overall, forces in England and Wales have hada 20% funding cut over seven years. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the West Midlands police and crime commissioner David Jamieson said the force had been ""inundated by violent crime"" and that the homicide team was at ""breaking point"". ""It's extremely difficult to see how we can sustain what the public would call an acceptable level of policing,"" he said, adding that the pressures on the force meant ""things that frankly the public expect from the police are just not being done in the quality that people would expect"". ""It's a deadly equation,"" he said. Such is the pressure on officers, Mr Thompson went out on the front line himselfto help deal with a ""very high call demand"" across the force. The force had deployed many staff to help clear a ""backlog"" and he followed up three calls. Reality Check: Is crime up or down? What's happened to police numbers? West Midlands Police force 'smallest in its history' But Birmingham Edgbaston MP Preet Gill said Mr Thompson's comments overall meant ""basic policing"" was being overlooked. ""What the police ought to be doing is making sure they are absolutely taking the concerns of victims very, very seriously and responding to crime and clearly it's not happening."" A spokesperson for the Home Office said: ""Police have the resources they need to carry out this vital work and we have provided a strong and comprehensive settlement that is increasing total investment in the police system by over Â£460m in 2018-19. ""West Midlands Police will receive Â£534.3m in direct resource funding in 2018-19, including council tax precept - a cash increase of Â£9.9m compared with 2017-18."" Because the nature of crime is changing, the spokesman added, the policing minister had spoken to all forces to understand the demands they were facing. He said the home secretary had committed to prioritising police funding in next year's Spending Review.
