Charities call aid cut a tragic blow,"Charities said countries ""ravaged"" by disease, war and poverty were among those losing aid Cuts to humanitarian aid by the UK are a ""tragic blow for many of the world's most marginalised people"", 200 charities said in a joint statement. Organisations including Save the Children and Oxfam said humanitarian assistance was being reduced by more than Â£500m. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the changes reflected a ""strategic shift"" in UK aid spending. He also said the Â£18m aid budget given to China will be reduced to Â£900,000. Following the economic shock of the coronavirus crisis,the chancellor cut the foreign aid budgetfrom 0.7% to 0.5% of total national income - a reduction of around Â£4bn. The Foreign Office controls 80% of aid spending - Â£8bn - and the priorities were set out by Mr Raab in a written statement. More than Â£1bn will be spent on Covid and global health, Â£500m towards tackling climate change and Â£400m on getting girls into education. Charity warns UK aid to see 63% cut in funding UK's foreign aid spending cut by Â£2.9bn Aid cut likely to last for 'foreseeable future' Mr Raab said it was a ""challenging financial climate"" due to Covid-19, but said the government had sought ""maximum strategic coherence, impact and value for taxpayers' money"". But aid charities said even the priority areas were receiving less than before, and Â£500m less was being spent on humanitarian aid. The 200 charities, which also include Christian Aid and Care International, said: ""Today's announcement is a tragic blow for many of the world's most marginalised people the UK once supported, and for the UK's reputation as a trusted development partner. ""The government has not even spared countries ravaged by humanitarian crisis, disease, war and poverty."" Kevin Watkins, chief executive of Save the Children, accused the government of ""making cuts with no consideration for the human harm they will cause"" after reducing aid in Yemen, ""the world's biggest humanitarian crisis"". The government announced it was cutting foreign aid last November but it has still to say precisely where the axe will fall. Charities are waiting anxiously to see which programmes will lose funding, and which will survive. But we are getting some indications from government now about its priorities: climate change, Covid and global health, girls' education, supporting open societies, trade and economic development and so on. The numbers announced by the Foreign Office allow charities to calculate how much less will be spent on each area than before. That will help them plan. What these numbers will not do is diminish the controversy. Ministers argue the decision to cut aid has been made, it is time to decide how best to make it happen. But aid charities and many MPs - including a goodly number of Conservatives - still oppose the cuts and are working to stop them. Plans for a legal challenge are being considered. Critics say the government can't ignore a legally binding targetto spend 0.7 per cent of national income on aid. The FCDO reckons it can make the cuts without holding a vote to change the law. Campaigners might want a judge to decide who is right. For now, the government is pressing ahead with cuts it says are needed to keep the Treasury in funds for other priorities. Of the Â£8bn, the Foreign Office will give more than Â£3bn to multilateral organisations, such as the World Bank. Half of all UK bilateral aid will be spent in Africa, a third in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia. The remaining humanitarian aid budget, focused on countries most at risk of famine such as Yemen, Syria, Somalia and South Sudan, is Â£906m. Mr Raab also announced he would cut Foreign Office aid to China by 95%, to Â£900,000. But other parts of government, such as the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, give more aid to China and have yet to say if they will cut their payments too.

UK records hottest day of the year - again,"It has been the hottest day of the year in the UK for the third day in a row. Temperatures reached 28.3C (83F) in Northolt, west London, on Wednesday afternoon. It beat the previous day's high of 26.1C in Cardiff on the first day of meteorological summer. But there have been showers and even thunderstorms in some areas, with these spreading north as the day progressed. More warm weather is expecting for many parts of the UK this week but it will then start to cool, forecasters say. The golden laburnum arch at the National Trust's Bodnant Garden, near Tal-y-Cafn, Conwy, was bathed in sunlight on Wednesday There was some - but not much - shade to be found at Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, where this interactive sculpture by Ai Weiwei is going on long-term view Some chose to take to the water to cool down, like these people enjoying boats on the Thames near Windsor Castle BBC Weather forecaster Billy Payne said it was also the warmest day of the year for Scotland, with Prestwick hitting 25.6C, as well as Wales, where temperatures reached 26.5C in Hawarden. Parts of south-west England saw cooler temperatures however, with showers and thunder in some areas. The forecaster said Thursday would be very warm again, especially in south-east England, with temperatures around 27C. The weather will then be slightly more unsettled but will not be a return to the cold wet weather of last month. The average for June is usually 21C, with the earlier days of the month around 20C. It was another day ripe for picnics, including here (above and below) in Greenwich Park, London After a rainy few days, an umbrella was used to protect from the sun instead, here at Bournemouth beach in Dorset After a rainy May, the good weather of recent days has come as a relief to many. The UK has seen its fourth highest amount of rainfall on record for the month, with an average of 120mm (4.7in). And Wales had the wettest May since records began in 1862, with 245mm (9.6in) of rainfall, topping the previous record of 184mm (7.2in) set in 1967, according to the Met Office.

Amazon beefs up Covid testing capabilities,"Amazon has set up its own Covid testing facilities in Greater Manchester Amazon is to expand its Covid testing lab facilities in the UK as the pandemic continues. The online giant said this was to benefit employees and UK public health. However, analysts said it could also provide business opportunities in the health sector and buff up Amazon's reputation after questions over working conditions. Amazon recently moved into the online pharmacy business in the US for subscribers to its Prime service. In 2020, the online retailing giant set up laboratories in Kentucky and in Greater Manchester to process employees' PCR tests. The lab in Manchester has processed 900,000 test samples to date. The test results are anonymous and will be shared with Public Health England once the lab is approved for sequencing. Its coronavirus response efforts have so far cost the company $11.5bn (Â£8.1bn). Tom Forte, managing director and senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson, said Amazon could convert staff Covid-19 testing and healthcare clinics for consumer use. ""We believe Covid-19 inspired Amazon to accelerate its healthcare-related efforts, by necessity. ""That said, we had long believed healthcare was an attractive opportunity for Amazon given its large market size and chances for the company to both improve the customer experience and lower the costs."" There are very few companies in the world who could have decided to build a state of the art diagnostics lab and have it functioning within months, but Amazon is one of them. While the company insists that at the moment this site is purely to help keep their staff safer at work, they are sending out a very clear message. They are able to process medical diagnostics and feed that information into public health agencies. Right now this multimillion-pound site in Salford is only testing for Covid-19, but it's unlikely to be left idle after the pandemic. Amazon's most valuable product is the information they already hold about their customers, and medical data is a very rich pool indeed to be dipping their toes into. Covid-19: Nearly 4,000 Amazon staff given wrong test results Amazon plots a course into the healthcare industry Lab director Luke Meredith joined Amazon from the World Health Organization and works alongside 70 Amazon lab technicians at the site in Wardley, Manchester. ""What we decided during the Covid outbreak is that we really needed to maximise protection for safe working in the fulfilment centres,"" he told the BBC. Luke Meredith said the lab will help increase protection in Amazon's warehouses At the moment, the two sites are processing samples from staff across Europe and the Americas, tapping into the company's logistics network. Neil Travis, North West regional director for Amazon UK, said: ""For now, we are focused on the safety of our colleagues."" James Moar, lead analyst for Juniper Research, thinks that Amazon's expansion of its testing laboratories is ""intended to enhance Amazon's reputation"", although he said Amazon would be unlikely to pass up a business opportunity. There have been a number of controversies about how Amazon treats its staff. On Wednesday, a report found that staff at its warehouses in the US are injured at a higher rate than those doing similar jobs at other companies' warehouses. Earlier this year, the company apologised for falsely denying that its drivers were having to urinate in plastic bottles. And during the first wave of the pandemic, the company was accused of ""cutting corners"" on Covid safety,which it denied. However, Mr Moar thinks that having the laboratories could be useful to Amazon in the future. ""Amazon has tried to get into healthcare in a number of ways,"" he said. ""This is basically Amazon saying that as well as providing the facilities for its employees' healthcare, it's a demonstration that they can work to provide healthcare services. ""This means they've already got some groundwork to show any potential partners.""

Trump's communications platform taken offline,"Donald Trump's communications platform has been permanently shut down, his spokesperson told CNBC. ""It was just auxiliary to the broader efforts we have and are working on,"" senior aide Jason Miller said. The platform, titled From the Desk of Donald J Trump, launched last month and served as a way for the former president to publish his own content including press releases and videos. Mr Trump was banned from Facebook and Twitter after the Capitol Hill Riots. From the Desk of Donald J Trump had a section on the former president's official website, but it has now been removed. Mr Miller confirmed via Twitter that it is a precursor to Mr Trump's return to social media, although it is unclear when or how. Allow Twitter content?

In March, Mr Miller toldFox News,externalhe thinks ""we're going to see President Trump returning to social media in probably about two or three months"" and ""with his own platform"".

The former president was an avid user of social media as a way to communicate directly to his followers. Since his removal from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube, the former president has not been heard from in the same capacity, although this website was the closest he has been to directly communicating with his followers since January. Mr Trump was an enthusiastic tweeter, often posting throughout the day - and sometimes at night - about an array of topics, including the 2020 election, coronavirus and what he called ""fake news"" to his nearly 90 million followers. He has been permanently banned from Twitter. Facebook'sOversight Board recently upheldthe platform's decision but ordered Facebook to review it again within six months.

Call to ban out-of-hours emails from bosses,"Claire Mullaly says the level of electronic contact for many home workers is unsustainable ""Work has got more stressful over the last year,"" says Claire Mullaly. ""There's a pressure to check emails, jump on video calls and to be on hand at all hours of the day, and it's become harder to draw a line between work and home life."" Claire, an IT consultant from Northern Ireland, argues the situation facing her and millions of others working from home during the pandemic ""isn't sustainable"". And, with many of its members warning that their mental health is being compromised, the trade union Prospect is calling for the government to give employees a legally binding ""right to disconnect"". This would ban bosses from ""routinely emailing or calling"" outside set working hours. Any emails sent at these times could also be automatically deleted to deter off-duty staff from continually checking their inbox. ""While digital technology has kept us safe during the pandemic, for millions of people, working from home has felt more like sleeping in the office, making it harder to fully switch off,"" says Prospect's deputy general secretary, Andrew Pakes. Your stories: Out-of-hours work emails Can I ask to keep working from home? No full-time return to the office for over a million How to be happier while working from home The Office for National Statistics has found that35.9% of the UK's employed population,externaldid at least some of their work from home last year. This group - while saving time on commuting - did an average of six hours' unpaid overtime each week, it adds. The right to disconnect has been law for four years in France, where companies are asked to set agreed ""specific hours"" for ""teleworkers"". Ireland also brought in acode of practice,externallast month, under which employers should add ""footers and pop-up messages to remind employees... that there is no requirement to reply to emails out of hours"". Prospect, whose members include managers, civil servants, engineers and scientists, wants the UK government to set out similar protections in its Employment Bill, expected to be published later this year. ""Burning people out isn't good for workers or employers,"" says Claire. ""We've got to give people time to switch off and recharge."" Bank worker Omar says no-one he knows believes they can be as productive working from home as they can in the office, where they have access to big screens, technology and interacting with colleagues. And at home, he found, work takes over your life. ""You're on your laptop before breakfast,"" he says. ""When you're in the office there's the journey in, buying a coffee, chatting to a colleague and sitting down at your desk at 8.30 or 9am."" Read more But companies and lawyers haveraised doubtsover whether the right to disconnect is feasible at a time when many employees are themselves asking for flexible working. Peter Cheese, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, says it would be ""very challenging"" to make Prospect's proposal work. ""The big question is how do we create good ways of working that are good for people's wellbeing and how you improve people's work-life balance,"" he adds. The official advice across the UK currently is for people to work at home wherever possible. To preserve wellbeing, the Mental Health Foundation recommends that bossesstay in daily contact,externalwith employees. However, it says they must ""respect the boundaries people have between work and home life"". ""We recognise this has been an exceptionally difficult year, and that the pandemic has had an impact on mental health,"" a Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson says. ""We are wholeheartedly committed to improving and upholding workers' rights and this is why we will fulfil a [Conservative Party] manifesto commitment to consult on making flexible work the default."" The government's Flexible Working Taskforce is investigating how ""hybrid"" work - split between home and the office/formal workplace - will operate after the pandemic. This includes looking at the right to disconnect.

"Petrol prices at highest in two years, says RAC","Petrol prices have climbed to their highest level in two years, according to the RAC. Retailers may be charging more to make up for lower fuel sales during the pandemic, it said. Pump prices fell in May 2020 to a low of 106p as oil prices plummeted, but motorists had to abide by travel restrictions. The average cost of a litre has since soared to 129.27p, the highest level since August 2019. The cost of a litre of unleaded is now more than 22p more expensive than a year ago - the biggest 12-month increase seen for 11 years. ""After seven consecutive months of rising prices drivers will be wondering if the increases are ever going to end,"" said RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams. Higher petrol prices drive up cost of living in March He said motorists have faced the biggest petrol price rise in any 12-month period since May 2010 when unleaded rocketed from 99p a year earlier to 121p. Unleaded petrol has climbed 2p in the last month and 15p since November, since when prices have climbed every month. That has left motorists paying Â£8 more for a full tank of petrol than seven months ago. Diesel prices are climbing slightly less rapidly, up just less than 20p a litre over the last 12 months. ""Looking at the wholesale price of both fuels, in normal circumstances unleaded definitely shouldn't be continuing to rise with the numbers actually pointing to the potential for a 2p reduction,"" said Mr Williams. He added that diesel is currently 4p too expensive ""which suggests retailers are using the saving in the wholesale price to help make up for lower fuel sales over the last year"". The future of fuel prices is hard to predict more than a few weeks in advance and even more so now as the pandemic appears to have altered the dynamics of fuel retailing, he said. Supermarkets have an even greater share of the market, according to the RAC. Buying fuel at a forecourt run by one of the four major supermarket chains will currently save drivers around 4p a litre with the average price of petrol standing at 124.83p and diesel 127.36p. ""We urge retailers not to take advantage of drivers and fairly reflect what's happening with wholesale prices on the country's forecourts,"" he said. Luke Bosdet, the AA's fuel price spokesman, said: ""Oil prices rising back above 70 US dollars a barrel casts a shadow over staycation travel, with petrol prices at their highest for 20 months. ""The speed of the price rises at a time when drivers are beginning to travel much longer distances is a post-lockdown shock for many.""

School catch-up tsar resigns over lack of funding,"Sir Kevan Collins said the funding for school recovery ""does not come close"" to what was needed The education recovery commissioner for England, Sir Kevan Collins, has resigned in a row over the lack of ""credible"" Covid catch-up funding. Sir Kevan took on the role as catch-up tsar in February to develop a long-term plan to help pupils make up for lost learning during the pandemic. But on Wednesday he stepped down saying the government's funding for the plan ""falls far short of what is needed"". Head teachers labelled the Â£1.4bn cash over three years as a ""damp squib"". The Education Policy Institute had calculated that a catch-up funding recovery would need Â£13.5bn - and Sir Kevan was reported as having put forward plans costing Â£15bn. The government's proposal represents Â£50 per pupil per year - and Sir Kevan wrote to the prime minister saying: ""I do not believe it is credible that a successful recovery can be achieved with a programme of support of this size."" A Downing Street spokesman said: ""The prime minister is hugely grateful to Sir Kevan for his work in helping pupils catch up and recover from the effects of the pandemic. ""The government will continue to focus on education recovery and making sure no child is left behind with their learning, with over Â£3bn committed for catch up so far."" Earlier on Wednesday, the government announced an extra Â£1.4bn over three years for education recovery, in addition to the Â£1.7bn already announced. This included Â£1bn for 100 million hours of tutoring, aimed at disadvantaged pupils, and Â£250m for teacher training and development. PM vows more school catch-up cash amid funding row What students want from catch-up plans Sport and music 'should be part of pupil catch-up' The resignation statement from Sir Kevan,reported by The TES,external, said: ""A half-hearted approach risks failing hundreds of thousands of pupils. ""The support announced by government so far does not come close to meeting the scale of the challenge and is why I have no option but to resign from my post."" His resignation letter to Boris Johnson said: ""When we met last week, I told you that I do not believe it will be possible to deliver a successful recovery without significantly greater support than the government has to date indicated it intends to provide."" This video can not be played PM Boris Johnson says there will be more funding coming ""down the track"" This was a chaotic end to what should have been a showcase of the catch-up plan for England's schools. The widely-respected adviser brought in to deliver the plans walked out in protest - turning a story that should have been about extra money into an awkward debate about the lack of it. The resignation letter from Sir Kevan Collins to the prime minister makes plain that this should not have come as a surprise. ""When we met last week, I told you that I do not believe it will be possible to deliver a successful recovery without significantly greater support,"" wrote Sir Kevan. Boris Johnson and Education Secretary Gavin Williamson had spent the day trying to keep the plans afloat, presenting them as a ""next step"" with more to follow - after strong criticism that the funding was only a tenth of what was required. But Sir Kevan's resignation has fired a torpedo at the government's contention that school recovery is one of its top priorities. Earlier, head teachers had said they were ""hugely disappointed"" by the announcement after expectations of a much bigger set of proposals. Paul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, described it as a ""damp squib"" and said ""education recovery cannot be done on the cheap"". As such, he said: ""It is completely understandable that Sir Kevan chose not to become a pawn in whatever game the government is playing."" Mr Johnson then reassured schools and parents thatmore funding would be ""coming down the track"". Sir Kevan had been responsible for overseeing efforts to help schools in England recover from the disruption of the pandemic and lockdowns, which has seen pupils studying from home and exams cancelled over two academic years. He had reportedly called for funding for 100 extra hours of teaching per pupil - including for sports, music and the arts. But any extra teaching time, or longer school days, will now depend on getting further funding from the spending review. In a statement, Sir Kevan said a ""sustained and comprehensive programme of support"" would be needed and that ""more will be needed to meet the scale of the challenge"". Geoff Barton, head of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""We are sad but not surprised that Sir Kevan Collins is standing down. ""We know that Sir Kevan had much bolder and broader plans but that these required substantially more investment than the government was willing to provide. ""He's tried his hardest on behalf of children and young people, but, in the final analysis, the political will just wasn't there to support him."" Labour's shadow education secretary Kate Green said the resignation was a ""damning indictment of the Conservatives' education catch-up plan"". ""He was brought in by Boris Johnson because of his experience and expertise in education, but the government have thrown out his ideas as soon as it came to stumping up the money needed to deliver them."" Before taking up his post as tsar, Sir Kevan was head of the Education Endowment Foundation (EEF), which examines evidence for what works in education. As EEF chief executive, he ran an organisation that examined ideas for raising achievement, with the aim of breaking the link between deprivation and poor outcomes in school. Sir Kevan has had a long career in education, as a former teacher who went on to be the director of children's services and chief executive of Tower Hamlets, east London.

Israel opposition parties agree to form government,"The right-wing Yamina party's Naftali Bennett and Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, after reaching an agreement Israeli opposition parties have reached an agreement to form a new government that would end Benjamin Netanyahu's 12-year tenure as prime minister. Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, announced an eight-faction coalition had been formed. Under a rotation arrangement, the head of the right-wing Yamina party, Naftali Bennett, would serve as prime minister first before handing over to Mr Lapid. Mr Netanyahu, however, attacked the new ""left-wing"" government as ""dangerous"". In his first comments since the agreement was reached, Mr Netanyahu urged Knesset (parliament) members ""elected by votes from the right"" to oppose the coalition, which still needs to be approved by a parliamentary vote before being sworn in. The vote is not expected to take place for some days, and there is still a chance this newly formed coalition could be upended by defections. Who is Naftali Bennett, Israel's likely PM? Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM In a statement, Mr Lapid said he had informed President Reuven Rivlin of the agreement, adding: ""I pledge that this government will work in the service of all Israeli citizens, those who voted for it and those who did not. ""It will respect its opponents and do everything in its power to unite and connect all parts of Israeli society."" An image carried on Israeli media showed Mr Lapid, Mr Bennett and Mansour Abbas, leader of the Arab Islamist Raam party, signing the agreement, a deal many thought impossible. Allow Twitter content?

This is the first time in decades an Israeli Arab party has joined a governing coalition. Other parties representing Israeli Arabs - who make up 20% of the population - have said they will oppose a government led by Mr Bennett, who rejects the concept of a Palestinian state, AFP news agency reports. Mr Abbas told reporters: ""The decision was hard and there were several disputes but it was important to reach agreements."" He said that there were ""many things in this agreement for the benefit of Arab society"". No rational political enemy of Benjamin Netanyahu can underestimate his tenacity, ruthlessness and absolute determination to hold on to office. Until a new government with a new prime minister is sworn in, he will do all he can to stop it. If he found himself leader of the opposition, he would do all he could to destabilise a coalition with a wafer-thin majority that would be trying to span the entire Israeli spectrum, from the nationalist right to the liberal left. All that unites them is their desire to remove him from office. Mr Netanyahu has already called the proposed new government the ""fraud of the century"". He says it endangers the state of Israel, the people of Israel, and the soldiers of Israel. However loudly he complains, the likelihood is that he is leaving office. In the end his defeat was sealed not by left-wing opponents but by fellow right-wingers he has made into enemies by his ruthless, high-handed tactics. No-one should expect big, new initiatives from a new government. Just surviving the onslaught Mr Netanyahu is undoubtedly planning will be a full-time job. His opponents will be hoping that his fall will continue in the Jerusalem courthouse where he is already on trial on serious corruption charges. In his note to the president, Mr Lapid said he would head the government alongside Mr Bennett, who he would replace as prime minister on 27 August 2023. Mr Rivlin has called on parliament to convene as soon as possible to hold the confidence vote. If the coalition fails to win the support of a majority in the 120-seat Knesset, there is a risk of the country having to go to elections for the fifth time in two years. The coalition members span the full spectrum of Israeli politics. The parties have little in common apart from their plan to replace Mr Netanyahu. They are: Yesh Atid(centrist) - led by Yair Lapid (17 seats) Kahol Lavan (Blue and White)(centrist) - led by Benny Gantz (eight) Israel Beiteinu(centre-right to right-wing nationalist) - led by Avigdor Lieberman (seven) Labor(social-democratic) - led by Merav Michaeli (seven) Yamina(right-wing) - led by Naftali Bennett (seven) New Hope(centre-right to right-wing)- led by Gideon Sa'ar (six) Meretz(left-wing, social-democratic) - led by Nitzan Horowitz (six) Raam(Arab Islamist) - led by Mansour Abbas (four) All eight factions were needed to pass the 61 majority figure. Wednesday's marathon talks took place in a hotel near Tel Aviv, with a large number of issues - from legalising cannabis to fines for illegal construction to the rotation of judicial selection committee posts - all on the agenda. Israeli media suggested that not all the elements were finalised, and this could still create doubts over whether the coalition will win its confidence vote. Allow Twitter content?

England cricketer apologises for racist tweets,"This video can not be played 'I deeply regret my actions' - Robinson apologises for offensive tweets England fast bowler Ollie Robinson has apologised after historical tweets of a racist and sexist nature were revealed during his Test debut against New Zealand at Lord's. The posts were made in 2012 and 2013, when Robinson, now 27, was aged 18 and 19. ""I am embarrassed by the racist and sexist tweets that I posted over eight years ago, which have today become public,"" said Robinson. ""I am sorry, and I have certainly learned my lesson today."" Conway's century on Test debut blunts England at Lord's Sussex's Robinson took 2-50 on the opening day of the first Test of the two-match series. However, during the day the tweets were shared online. Reading a prepared statement at the close of play, Robinson said: ""I want to make it clear that I'm not racist and I'm not sexist. ""I deeply regret my actions, and I am ashamed of making such remarks."" This video can not be played 'Did ECB do due diligence?' Michael Vaughan reacts to offensive Ollie Robinson tweets Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Sport: ""All the talk is going to be about his tweets. We should be talking about how well he bowled. ""It is a message to everyone that tweets come back to bite you."" England began the day by sharing a 'moment of unity' with New Zealand, the home players wearing T-shirts designed to show a collective stance against discrimination of all kinds. ""I would like to unreservedly apologise to anyone I have offended, my team-mates and the game as a whole in what has been a day of action and awareness in combatting discrimination from our sport,"" said Robinson. ""I don't want something that happened eight years ago to diminish the efforts of my team-mates and the ECB as they continue to build meaningful action with their comprehensive initiatives and efforts, which I fully endorse and support."" ""I will continue to educate myself, look for advice and work with the support network that is available to me to learn more about getting better in this area."" This video can not be played Robinson takes two wickets on England Test debut Originally from Kent, Robinson joined Yorkshire in 2013 but found it hard to adjust to life away from home. He was sacked by Yorkshire in 2014. On Wednesday he said: ""I was thoughtless and irresponsible and, regardless of my state of mind at the time, my actions were inexcusable. Since that period, I have matured as a person and fully regret the tweets. ""Today should be about my efforts on the field and the pride of making my Test debut for England, but my thoughtless behaviour in the past has tarnished this."" Vaughan said it was ""absolutely staggering"" that the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) did not know about the tweets before Robinson made his international debut. ""The ECB have to look at themselves as well,"" he said. ""Surely when you pick players or are employing people you check everything? I find it absolutely staggering that this hasn't been brought up before. ""The players lined up this morning and the slogan was very clear: cricket is for everyone. On day one of the campaign it is an awful look."" The ECB said it will begin a full investigation as part of the disciplinary process. ""I do not have the words to express how disappointed I am that an England men's player has chosen to write tweets of this nature, however long ago that might have been,"" said ECB chief executive Tom Harrison. ""Any person reading those words, particularly a woman or person of colour, would take away an image of cricket and cricketers that is completely unacceptable. We are better than this."" Vaughan, who captained England in 51 of his 82 Tests, said of Robinson: ""Full credit to him to come off that pitch, thinking he is going to be talking about how well he has bowled, and five minutes later he is having to read out a statement. ""That is a lesson to him. He said he has a long way to go and is trying to learn and improve and that is all he can do.""

School appeals 'can revise grades up or down',"Qualification results have been based on teacher judgement rather than traditional exams due to the Covid-19 pandemic Scottish school pupils will have the right to appeal their assessment grades - but could see them revised up or down, the education secretary has said. Shirley-Anne Somerville told MSPs that there would be a ""direct right of appeal"" for pupils when Higher and National 5 results come out in August. But she said a ""fair, consistent and credible"" system would have to be able to revise grades down as well as up. Opposition parties said this made appeals a ""perverse gamble"" for pupils. Grades are to be based on teacher judgements - without the use of any algorithms or the past performance of schools - after exams were cancelled for the second year running due to the Covid-19 pandemic. What's happening with this year's school 'exams'? Ms Somerville - who recently replaced John Swinney as education secretary - told MSPs that ensuring young people are able to achieve ""fair and credible grades"" despite the ongoing pandemic was the government's ""absolute priority"". She said she took ""very seriously"" the anxiety and concern of some young people, parents and teachers about the model being used, but insisted it was ""the fairest possible"" in a challenging set of circumstances. National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher exams have all been cancelled, with grades to be based on the ""professional judgements"" of teachers and what learners have demonstrated during the school year. However due to the second national lockdown from the start of the year, much of the assessment work done by teachers has come in the final weeks of term - leading to claims these are ""exams by another name"". Ms Somerville said parents and pupils have been listened to, adding: ""Awarding qualifications will always be challenging under these circumstances, but we believe that the model we have is the fairest solution in the interests of young people."" And she said there would be a ""direct right of appeal"" for all pupils for the first time, which would be free at the point of use. Shirley-Anne Somerville was recently appointed education secretary Grounds for appeal will include disagreement with the ""academic judgement"" behind grades, administrative or procedural errors or appeals related to the Equality Act, including assessment arrangements. Appeals will be assessed by subject specialists, but Ms Somerville said the system must be ""symmetrical"" - meaning they can move grades up, down or leave them unchanged. She said: ""Without symmetry, there would not be a full and fair review of the evidence. This could be perceived as unfair to other learners and raise questions over the credibility of qualifications awarded this year. ""In adopting a symmetrical approach to appeals, judgements at appeal will be made on individual learners' work only and not on an algorithm or on a school's past performance."" Opposition parties were critical of the plans, with Green MSP Ross Greer arguing for a ""no detriment"" approach to appeals where grade could not be revised down. He said lacking such a system made appeals a ""perverse gamble"", adding: ""Schools will support the strongest evidence they have in support of the initial grade - why would they have stronger evidence suitable for an appeal which they chose not to submit in the first place? ""It seems the risk of downgrading is increased by an appeals process reliant purely on limited and likely weaker evidence, rather than on the professional judgement of teachers."" Ms Somerville replied that it was ""exceptionally rare"" for pupils to have grades reduced on appeal, saying this happened in eight cases out of 13,000 in 2017 and one among 11,000 in 2019. The Children and Young People's Commissioner, Bruce Adamson, said it was disappointing that grades could be marked down on appeal, saying this was ""an unnecessary and disempowering barrier to young people"" and could exacerbate anxiety for pupils. Liam Fowley, vice chairman of the Scottish Youth Parliament, said the appeals process is ""simply not acceptable"" and fails to take into account the ""exceptional circumstances"" faced by young people during the pandemic. The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) teaching union meanwhile welcomed much of the statement, saying staff were doing ""a quite phenomenal amount of work"" to deliver grades amid the pandemic. However the NASUWT union - which opposed the current certification model - raised concerns that teachers might have to be available during the summer holidays to engage with the appeals process, despite already facing ""overwhelming and unacceptable levels of workload and anxiety"". Appeals are always part of the exams system in Scotland but arguably the role they play this year is much more important. Normally appeals are made through schools and for a limited number of reasons, usually a pupil has to have been given a worse grade in the final exam than their teacher predicted. Allowing pupils to appeal directly to the SQA and for a wider range of reasons will be welcomed by young people. What will not be as welcome is the fact that grades can be revised down as well as up. This is normal practice, but many argue that this year that option should be off the table to account for the disruption young people have faced and that this could be seen as downgrading teacher judgement. Meanwhile, BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme has found that more than 6,500 pupils have been using a website set up to cheat in this year's assessments. It comes after it was revealed last month that details of assessments were beingshared by pupils on TikTok. Each school has its own arrangements and set its own assessments, but the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) has provided question papers which they can use - and many have been shared on an ""anti SQA"" site online. In some cases, these papers - at Advanced Higher, Higher and National 5 - are being shared in their entirety, along with answers. Scottish Conservative education spokesman Oliver Mundell said assessment papers were available online ""on an industrial scale"". ""Nobody condones attempts to cheat, but SNP ministers were too busy trying to paint a rosy picture instead of tackling the reality for pupils,"" he said. A Scottish government spokesman said the SQA had taken action to contact schools ""to ensure that posts were removed as soon as possible and to reiterate the importance of security arrangements around assessment materials"". Labour education spokesman Michael Marra said he had been contacted be ""very many"" angry parents, saying the publication of the appeal process was ""well over a month late"" and came 20 days before teachers have to submit grades. And he said there had been reports of ""widespread variation"" in the way pupils have been assessed, with complaints that some had faced multiple assessments in a short period of time. Lib Dem MSP Beatrice Wishart said a constituent had told her the current system was the worst model possible, saying it had ""increased stress levels"" for pupils and that there were ""no excuses left"" for the SQA.

Scots Tory leader isolates after MP tests positiveDouglas Ross and David Duguid carried out a number of engagements together in Peterhead on Monday.Scotland politics,"David Duguid shared photos of his day with Douglas Ross on social media The leader of the Scottish Conservatives is isolating after Scotland Office minister David Duguid tested positive for Covid. Douglas Ross carried out a number of engagements with Mr Duguid in Peterhead on Monday. It is understood Mr Duguid, the MP for Banff and Buchan, was tested on Tuesday afternoon and received a positive result on Wednesday morning. Mr Ross was told on Wednesday morning a ""close contact"" had tested positive. He was informed by text message while in the Scottish Parliament building that a person he had seen on Monday had caught the virus. The party leader, who is MP for Moray and a Highland MSP, is now self-isolating in an Edinburgh hotel. He will get a test as soon as possible, the Scottish Conservatives said. Mr Ross will take part in FMQs on Thursday virtually. Four other Tory MSPs are also taking tests as a precaution, while two MSPs from another party have been advised they should do likewise. It is understood that Mr Duguid took a precautionary test after some work-related travel and a number of recent cases at his children's school. He is said to be asymptomatic and feeling well. A spokesperson for the UK government said: ""Minister Duguid is self-isolating after testing positive for coronavirus. ""He took a test as a precaution at a local UK government test centre. He has notified those he was in close contact with."" The politicians met with the Fishermen's Mission and Peterhead Port Authority on Monday Mr Duguid and Mr Ross shared pictures of their engagements in Peterhead on Monday on social media. They said they met with representatives of the Fishermen's Mission and Peterhead Port Authority, and had lunch in a local cafe. Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar also went into self-isolation last month after a member of his household tested positive for the virus. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Foreign aid: What is it used for?,"The UK's temporarily cutting back money it gives to other countries, in a move which some charities say will harm poor communities around the world. The government says the impact of the pandemic on the UK's finances means there has to be a temporary reduction in foreign aid. The target for foreign aid spend has usually been 0.7% of gross national income - but that will come down to 0.5% which will be around Â£4bn less. But what is the money actually used for? The UK provides aid to crisis hit areas In 2020, Britain spent Â£14.5bn on aid, meeting that 0.7% target,according to provisional data,external. There's always been debate over the UK's aid spend, with some people saying the UK shouldn't be helping people overseas while cutting services at home. They argue problems of poverty and inequality are being fuelled by conflict, corruption and political instability which makes foreign aid worthless. Others say it's a mark of the UK's generosity and helps address the difference in wealth between developed and developing countries - and helping to save lives. In its most basic definition, foreign aid is resources given from one country to another. It can involve a transfer of things like food or military equipment, or even people to provide training and medical help. Usually these are loaned by governments, organisations and individuals in richer countries to help people in poorer countries. An example would be the UK sendingÂ£200m to help developing nationsbattle coronavirus. The UK is among countries to send medical supplies to India to help its coronavirus efforts There are different types of aid, such as emergency or short-term aid which is needed after sudden disasters such as earthquakes, flooding or tsunamis. Conditional or tied aid is when one country donates money or resources to another but with conditions attached, for example a trade deal. There is also aid funded by donations from the public through charities such as Children in Need. Long-term or development aid involves providing local communities with education and skills. Money shared through international organisations such as the World Bank or UN, rather than by one specific country, is called multilateral aid. Overall, the top five countries receiving UK aid were Pakistan, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Yemen and Nigeria, with almost all the money going to countries in Africa and Asia. In 2019, the UK spent Â£1.5bn on humanitarian assistance - which is short-term help in immediate crises - mostly in Yemen, Syria and Bangladesh, statistics show. Around Â£1.4bn was spent on health projects including medical research, family planning and infectious disease control globally. There will be cuts across lots of different areas. ""The impact will be profound and very damaging, particularly for poor people,"" says Professor Guy Howard, an expert in international development from the University of Bristol. The UN Population Fund, which supports family planning, says an initial commitment by the UK to spend Â£154m on supplies this yearwill shrink to Â£23m- and there'll also be a drop in funding to the UN's children fund, Unicef. And funding for things like water, sanitation and hygiene projects will reportedly becut by more than 80%. The UK contributed Â£176m to water, sanitation and hygiene projects in 2019 - so an 80% cut would represent a budget of around Â£36m Prof Howard feels cutting back aid from a ""core public health area seems odd."" He wants to see a reverse to cuts in water and sanitation because ""that's the foundation of public health"" and vital in dealing with different diseases. ""We often forget a thousand children a day die of diarrhoea because of poor water sanitation."" It's an important goal in its own right, he says, ""but what Covid has shown us is just how important water supply is in combatting the disease. ""If you have to collect water from a shared water point, social distancing will be virtually impossible."" As the amount the UK donates is a percentage of national income, the amount of money it spends on foreign aid would have been less this year even before the cut was announced. That's because the economy'sgot smallerduring the pandemic. But Prof Howard says the decision to cut 0.2% makes it an even more difficult situation for the countries which receive the aid. Several countries have met the 0.7% UN aid target including Denmark, Luxembourg, Norway and Sweden, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. But many others don't hit the target. International organisations have schemes to provide food to poorer countries Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the changes reflected a ""strategic shift"" in UK aid spending. A spokeswoman from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development office told Newsbeat reducing spend was a ""tough but necessary decision"" and the government's ""committed to returning to 0.7%"" once the financial situation allows. More than Â£1bn will be spent on Covid and global health, Â£500m towards tackling climate change and Â£400m on getting girls into education. Much of the humanitarian aid budget will be focused on countries most at risk of famine such as Yemen, Syria, Somalia and South Sudan.

Plans to build world's deepest pool in CornwallThe Â£150m project to build a 50m deep pool would be used for deep sea and space research.Cornwall,"The planned project to build a 50m deep pool in Cornwall has been described a ""globally unique"" Plans to build the world's deepest pool for sea and space research in Cornwall have been announced. The Â£150 million project would see an aquatic centre, housing a 164ft (50m) deep pool built at the Aerohub Enterprise Zone at Cornwall Airport It is hoped the pool could be used to help advance subsea robotics and to train astronauts. Astronaut Major Tim Peake, who is backing the plans, said the Newquay site was the ""perfect home"" for it. He said: ""This project will join Goonhilly Earth Station and Spaceport Cornwall as significant national assets... helping to widen our knowledge of how humans and technology can function in extreme environments, for the benefit of people and the planet."" The pool could have sections built to mirror the International Space Station The privately-funded company, Blue Abyss, which is in the process of applying for planning permission, would occupy a 10-acre site. Its 40m by 50m pool holding enough water to fill 17 Olympic-size swimming pools, would be covered by a sliding roof and 30-tonne crane, allowing large objects to be lowered into the pool. These could include simulated sections of the International Space Station, underwater film sets and even cave systems to test remote operated vehicles or train deep sea divers, the company said. The project is the brainchild of ex-forces diving instructor John Vickers, who is chief executive of Blue Abyss. He said the pool would be ""globally unique"" and have a ""wide range"" of potential uses. ""Blue Abyss will be a huge research asset for aerospace, offshore energy, underwater robotics, human physiology, defence, leisure and marine industries, and a fantastic education centre for children and university students,"" he said. Blue Abyss is the brainchild of its CEO John Vickers, a former military diving instructor Mr Vickers added Â£5m for pre-construction costs had been secured and a range of infrastructure funds had been engaged for the 18-month build. The company estimates it will create 160 jobs and generate Â£8m annually for the local economy. MP Steve Double said he was ""delighted"" the project had chosen Newquay as its home and it would ""foster many of Cornwall's emerging industries, creating skilled, well-paid jobs and collaboration across industry, research and education"".

Plans to build world's deepest pool in CornwallThe Â£150m project to build a 50m deep pool would be used for deep sea and space research.,"The planned project to build a 50m deep pool in Cornwall has been described a ""globally unique"" Plans to build the world's deepest pool for sea and space research in Cornwall have been announced. The Â£150 million project would see an aquatic centre, housing a 164ft (50m) deep pool built at the Aerohub Enterprise Zone at Cornwall Airport It is hoped the pool could be used to help advance subsea robotics and to train astronauts. Astronaut Major Tim Peake, who is backing the plans, said the Newquay site was the ""perfect home"" for it. He said: ""This project will join Goonhilly Earth Station and Spaceport Cornwall as significant national assets... helping to widen our knowledge of how humans and technology can function in extreme environments, for the benefit of people and the planet."" The pool could have sections built to mirror the International Space Station The privately-funded company, Blue Abyss, which is in the process of applying for planning permission, would occupy a 10-acre site. Its 40m by 50m pool holding enough water to fill 17 Olympic-size swimming pools, would be covered by a sliding roof and 30-tonne crane, allowing large objects to be lowered into the pool. These could include simulated sections of the International Space Station, underwater film sets and even cave systems to test remote operated vehicles or train deep sea divers, the company said. The project is the brainchild of ex-forces diving instructor John Vickers, who is chief executive of Blue Abyss. He said the pool would be ""globally unique"" and have a ""wide range"" of potential uses. ""Blue Abyss will be a huge research asset for aerospace, offshore energy, underwater robotics, human physiology, defence, leisure and marine industries, and a fantastic education centre for children and university students,"" he said. Blue Abyss is the brainchild of its CEO John Vickers, a former military diving instructor Mr Vickers added Â£5m for pre-construction costs had been secured and a range of infrastructure funds had been engaged for the 18-month build. The company estimates it will create 160 jobs and generate Â£8m annually for the local economy. MP Steve Double said he was ""delighted"" the project had chosen Newquay as its home and it would ""foster many of Cornwall's emerging industries, creating skilled, well-paid jobs and collaboration across industry, research and education"".

UK records hottest day of the year - againTemperatures reached as high as 28.3C in London on Wednesday afternoon.UK,"It has been the hottest day of the year in the UK for the third day in a row. Temperatures reached 28.3C (83F) in Northolt, west London, on Wednesday afternoon. It beat the previous day's high of 26.1C in Cardiff on the first day of meteorological summer. But there have been showers and even thunderstorms in some areas, with these spreading north as the day progressed. More warm weather is expecting for many parts of the UK this week but it will then start to cool, forecasters say. The golden laburnum arch at the National Trust's Bodnant Garden, near Tal-y-Cafn, Conwy, was bathed in sunlight on Wednesday There was some - but not much - shade to be found at Blenheim Palace in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, where this interactive sculpture by Ai Weiwei is going on long-term view Some chose to take to the water to cool down, like these people enjoying boats on the Thames near Windsor Castle BBC Weather forecaster Billy Payne said it was also the warmest day of the year for Scotland, with Prestwick hitting 25.6C, as well as Wales, where temperatures reached 26.5C in Hawarden. Parts of south-west England saw cooler temperatures however, with showers and thunder in some areas. The forecaster said Thursday would be very warm again, especially in south-east England, with temperatures around 27C. The weather will then be slightly more unsettled but will not be a return to the cold wet weather of last month. The average for June is usually 21C, with the earlier days of the month around 20C. It was another day ripe for picnics, including here (above and below) in Greenwich Park, London After a rainy few days, an umbrella was used to protect from the sun instead, here at Bournemouth beach in Dorset After a rainy May, the good weather of recent days has come as a relief to many. The UK has seen its fourth highest amount of rainfall on record for the month, with an average of 120mm (4.7in). And Wales had the wettest May since records began in 1862, with 245mm (9.6in) of rainfall, topping the previous record of 184mm (7.2in) set in 1967, according to the Met Office. It was good weather for a selfie, as this man found at the Royal Observatory in Greenwich Park, London MCC members queued outside the ground ahead of day one of the first Test match at Lord's, London Picture research by Phil Coomes Bank Holiday Monday brings hottest day of the year Thunderstorms 'likely' across south-west Wales Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLive75% of UK adults have had first vaccine jab7 minutes ago,"More than 75% of UK adults have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, less than six months after the rollout started 115 of the 11,214 deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 21 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate The newly-released figure for virus-related deaths is the lowest since September and down by 49 on the week before There is nothing in the data at the moment to suggest the next lifting of lockdown restrictions cannot go ahead, PM Boris Johnson says Tutoring sessions for pupils are part of a Â£1.4bn programme to help children in England catch up from the pandemic Health Secretary Matt Hancock the support of celebrities helped encourage people in the UK to take up the offer of vaccinations The state of Victoria, Australia, extends its lockdown by another week as authorities battle a growing virus outbreak China's Sinovac Covid vaccine has been given approval for emergency use by the World Health Organization Edited by James Clarke That's all from us for now. Today's updates have been brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Francesca Gillett, Joshua Cheetham, John Hand and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow. And before we go here's a reminder of today's main coronavirus headlines in the UK. Matt Hancock has been reflecting on the UK's vaccine rollout at a conference in Oxford Thanks for joining our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. We'll be bringing things to a close soon but in case you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments of the day around the world: Carrie and Boris Johnson on their wedding day (left) and Boris Johnson in the Downing Street garden to be interviewed In the matter of a few days Boris Johnson has used the Downing Street garden for two very different purposes. On Saturday it was the venue for the celebration of his wedding to Carrie while on Wednesday he was meeting members of the media there to talk about the latest news on the coronavirus pandemic and funding for education.  This video can not be played PM on catch-up funding: 'There's more coming' Speaking in the Downing Street garden earlier, the prime minister said ""there's going to be more coming down the track"" in terms of money for education. Asked if more funds were being made available on top of the Â£1.4bnannounced earlierfor Covid catch-up plans Boris Johnson said ""of course"" but added that today's money was a ""huge amount"". The prime minister says England is engaged in the ""biggest tutoring programme anywhere in the world"". He says there is no doubt ""many kids are incredibly resilient... but a lot of them also need help to catch up"" and says the funding should ""give parents the confidence that their child is going to get particular attention"", as well as ""find potential in kids that may be missed in the back of the classroom"". There's some good news from Wales - the number of Covid-19 admissions into the nation's hospitals has hit record low levels. There were six confirmed or suspected Covid patients admitted on Tuesday - all in the Cardiff and Vale health board area - a record low during the pandemic. Most of Cardiff and Vale's admissions have been patients in the emergency unit who were tested after reporting a Covid symptom. They are then flagged as suspected until the majority are ruled out by a test. Covid admissions now make up just 1.3% of all hospital admissions in Wales. The Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) has said a lack of effective political leadership has hampered efforts to stop the spread of Covid in Latin America, reports Reuters news agency. The international health body says despite an overall reduction in cases across the US, Canada and Mexico, infections are still on the rise in the rest of the Americas. ""Sadly across our region we've seen misinformation about Covid-19 sow doubt on proven health measures, often in the context of political disputes,"" says PAHO head Carissa Etienne, according to Reuters. ""By stoking controversy where there is none, our leaders are sending mixed messages to the public and standing in the way of effective measures to control the virus."" The highest rate of infections has been flagged in Colombia, where new cases have tripled in some regions. Brazil is also seeing a fresh wave of infections and hospitalisations. Etienne warns Haiti is now of greatest concern in the continent. She says measures to stop the transmission are also being largely ignored by the population in Haiti, despite a sharp rise in cases and deaths. But Etienne says it is encouraging that Haiti's government has accepted the AstraZeneca vaccine. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Three quarters full
is still a quarter empty. Unfortunately, even
with three quarters of adults having received at least one dose, thereâs still
a way to go. The first dose of
the vaccine gives reduced protection against what will soon be the main type of
coronavirus in the UK. Thatâs the variant
first identified in India and now known as either B.1.617.2 or Delta. There may be a
small proportion of elderly and vulnerable people who are not vaccinated or who
donât get full protection. But this is a large
country and thatâs still a large number of elderly or vulnerable people. If this new strain
of the virus truly is as infectious as some estimates suggest, it will find
those people and we could see large numbers going into hospital. Every person fully
vaccinated makes it harder for the virus to spread and find them. But we donât know
exactly how infectious it is. Thatâs the key job of the next few weeks â
finding out whether the virus weâll be facing in the summer could cause a big
third wave or, hopefully, just a ripple. NHS vaccination cards remind people to have their second jab - but do not act as a passport Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked about vaccine passports, and the government's latest thinking on whether they could be used for mass gatherings such as concerts. The government is currently trialling different ways to run large events, to see how social distancing, ventilation and mass testing can be used. Using vaccine passports hasn't yet been trialled but the government hasn't ruled it out. Currently, the NHS app (different to the NHS Covid app) offers people proof of their NHS vaccine status, which could be useful for travel. Hancock says: ""One of the parts of step four is to set out four reviews, one of those is into certification. ""Being able to certify that you've had a vaccine is going to be necessary for international travel because some countries have already set out that they require proof that you've been vaccinated. And that means being able to prove with authority that you've had one of the jabs, and confidence in which jab, accepted for that proof - which is a matter for each individual country. ""We've provided the ability to show that through the NHS app, so we're putting that certification in place where we know it will be needed. ""When it comes to using certification for domestic purposes, that is the review that Michael Gove is leading, and we'll come forward with the conclusions of it soon."" You can read more about vaccine passports here. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been speaking about the vaccination programme in his country and around the world - but how is the rollout of vaccines going globally? According to the latest data, almost two billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 190 countries. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress. Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of residents - but some are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. China and the US have administered the highest number of doses, with about 664 million and 295 million respectively. But while nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns,a few countries in Africa have yet to get started. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme to pool the global vaccine effort and ensure fairer global distribution. It's being led by vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Read our explainer here. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade association for global airlines, has renewed its calls for government to ease travel restrictions, according to the Reuters news agency. The industry body points to an NHS study that shows a low incidence of Covid among incoming passengers to the UK. The data reveals a 2.2% positivity rate among 365,895 travellers between February and May of this year. When excluding passengers from Britain's high-risk ""red list,"" this fell to 1.46%. ""These data tell us that we can do better,"" says IATA's director general Willie Walsh. ""Universal restrictions on people are no longer needed."" A further six Scotland footballers willmiss Wednesday's friendly against the Netherlandsdue to Covid-19 fears following John Fleck's positive test. David Marshall, Stephen O'Donnell, Nathan Patterson, Grant Hanley, John McGinn and Che Adams are not travelling with the squad to Portugal. They have all tested negative but have been kept back as a precaution. Sheffield United midfielder Fleck is self-isolating at Scotland's training camp in Alicantehaving tested positiveon Tuesday. Damien SharkovBBC Monitoring The Omsk State Circus building is used for a variety of events, including circuses, concerts and a film festival A region of Russian Siberia is giving away 1,000
circus tickets to locals who agree to get vaccinated against Covid-19. In a bid to encourage more people to get
the jab, the health ministry in Russia's Omsk Region has announced residents may claim a free ticket to the Omsk State Circus in exchange for
getting their jab at a newly-set-up vaccination site on the circus premises. Those who attend a vaccination there will
be issued a certificate which can be exchanged at the circus box office for a
ticket to the next lion show performance, Interfax news agency reports. Tatyana Kazantseva, head doctor at
Omsk city clinic Number 10, suggested the move may be popular among Russians
who have been reluctant to book a vaccination in a medical setting, adding the new site is well stocked with Russia's Sputnik V and CoviVac vaccines. ""We are administering jabs in our
clinic as well, but not every person wants to go to a medical facility for
this, fearing a large congregation of people,"" she says, according to
Interfax. ""For this reason, organising a medical office such as this in
the building of the circus, directly in the centre of the city, will allow many
Omsk locals to have their jab done without queuing."" The facility is one of many vaccination
sites opened across Russia at non-medical sites such as shopping centres or
sporting venues. In recent months Russian government
officials have been hard-pressed to offset persistent signs of low public enthusiasm
for vaccines. Russia's Academy of Sciences suggested
last week the current speed of vaccination was ""insufficient"" - with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated. The UK'sdaily coronavirus figures have been published by the government,,externalshowing a further 4,330 new confirmed coronavirus cases - higher than yesterday's 3,165. And following yesterday's milestone - the first time the UK announced no new coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began - the figures today show a further 12 people have died. Because of reporting lags at weekends, the number of cases and deaths are often lower at the start of the week - and that may partly explain why there appears to be a jump in the numbers between yesterday and today. In terms of vaccinations, the figures show more than 26 million people are now fully vaccinated - that's nearly half of the adult population, at 49.5%. And more than 39.5 million people have had their first dose - more than 75% of all adults. Urban crime around the world fell by more than a third during Covid restrictions, with robberies and theft almost halving, according to new research. The study by researchers at the universities of Cambridge and Utrecht looked at crime statistics from 27 cities in 23 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Middle East. Although lockdown measures varied from city to city the researchers found most types of crime fell. The exception was homicide - where the average reduction was only 14%. Researchers say this might be down to a number of factors - in many societies a large number of homicides are domestic. For example, in England and Wales, 35% of female homicides are committed by a partner or ex-partner. The way criminal gangs operate, and their involvement in homicides, may also be less affected by the restrictions imposed on peopleâs daily lives in the pandemic. But overall, the trend was clear with stricter lockdowns seeing fewer crimes. âCity living has been dramatically curtailed by Covid-19, and crime is a big part of city life,â says Professor Manuel Eisner, director of the Violence Research Centre at the University of Cambridge. âNo drinkers spilling into the streets after nights out at bars and pubs. No days spent in shops and cafÃ©s or at the racetrack or football match. Some cities even introduced curfews. It choked the opportunism that fuels so much urban crime,â he adds. A new report has come out looking at how pupils in Northern Ireland are being taught modern languages such as French, German, Irish and Spanish. It found teaching modern languages at primary school ""has all but collapsed"" due to the pandemic - and NI pupils spend less time on compulsory languages than any other country in Europe. The British Council's Language Trends 2021 report is based on responses from more than 120 primary school principals and more than 1,500 year nine pupils. Meanwhile, the number of pupils studying French is dropping and Spanish may soon overtake it as the most popular language at both GCSE and A-level. Read more here. Matt Hancock says the government will look at the number of cases and  ""crucially the link from cases to hospitalisations and deaths"" when considering the 21 June roadmap date for further easing restrictions. ""What really matters and is hardest to judge right now is how much the vaccine has severed that link,"" he says. Asked if the government has considered waiting until the end of July to end restrictions, by which time all adults should have been offered a first dose, the health secretary says we do know the vaccines are effective against the Delta variant after two doses. ""The second doses now cover the vast majority of those who are likely to end up dying from Covid-19 and the vast majority of those who, without a vaccine, would end up in hospital,"" he says. As Health Secretary Matt Hancock reflects on the UK's high vaccine pickup, over in the Philippines the government there has revealed it's far behind its immunisation targets. In light of the new data, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has appealed to the public to get vaccinated, as the country grapples with one of Asia's most severe and long-running outbreaks. ""This is the most, if not the only... effective way, to defeat the coronavirus pandemic,"" Duterte says in a televised address. ""Let us all keep in mind that the vaccine will not only protect you from the virus, it will also protect your loved ones, especially the sick and elderly,"" he adds. John Wong, a data analyst with the government's Covid task force, says in the three months since inoculations began, only 14% of elderly citizens and 8% of people with health conditions have received a jab - short of the government's 21% target. In addition, only half of the 21.1 million people eligible for a second dose have come back to receive it. The slow roll-out has been attributed to limited supplies, accessibility problems and vaccine hesitancy. The Philippines has recorded 1.24 million Covid cases and more than 21,000 deaths since its national outbreak began. The government says it expects a steadier supply of vaccines from this month. Nearly 10 million doses of various vaccine brands are due for delivery in June. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says over half a billion doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have been released across the world, ""mostly to low and middle income countries"". He describes the UK helping the vaccine to be available at cost with no charge for the intellectual property as ""the greatest gift this country can give the world"". Hancock says the global debate is increasingly turning to how to vaccinate the whole world, including among the G7 health ministers. He says the UK has started commercial negotiations with AstraZeneca for a vaccine targeted at variants of concerns - including the variant first identified in South Africa, known as Beta. An anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine protest was held in London at the weekend Matt Hancock has been sharing the UK's experience of dealing with fake news about vaccines. He's at the Global Vaccine Confidence Summit, which the UK is hosting and sees countries discuss and compare tips on vaccine rollouts. Hancock says the UK has had ""some of our best people on the case"" to counter myths and lies and ensure people being treated with respect when responding to vaccine hesitancy. He says openness and honesty is a ""crucial component"". ""Because it's not just been about getting all those positive facts to people but being honest and transparent about the difficult ones too - being upfront and completely transparent, for instance, about side effects, levelling with people that our supply will be lumpy and changing from week to week. ""And being open, when we haven't known the answer, like for instance we took time to find out the impact of new variants. So we didn't jump on the answers people wanted to hear."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"School appeals 'can revise grades up or down'Scottish school pupils will have a ""direct right to appeal"" over their grades - but could see them revised down.","Qualification results have been based on teacher judgement rather than traditional exams due to the Covid-19 pandemic Scottish school pupils will have the right to appeal their assessment grades - but could see them revised up or down, the education secretary has said. Shirley-Anne Somerville told MSPs that there would be a ""direct right of appeal"" for pupils when Higher and National 5 results come out in August. But she said a ""fair, consistent and credible"" system would have to be able to revise grades down as well as up. Opposition parties said this made appeals a ""perverse gamble"" for pupils. Grades are to be based on teacher judgements - without the use of any algorithms or the past performance of schools - after exams were cancelled for the second year running due to the Covid-19 pandemic. What's happening with this year's school 'exams'? Ms Somerville - who recently replaced John Swinney as education secretary - told MSPs that ensuring young people are able to achieve ""fair and credible grades"" despite the ongoing pandemic was the government's ""absolute priority"". She said she took ""very seriously"" the anxiety and concern of some young people, parents and teachers about the model being used, but insisted it was ""the fairest possible"" in a challenging set of circumstances. National 5, Higher and Advanced Higher exams have all been cancelled, with grades to be based on the ""professional judgements"" of teachers and what learners have demonstrated during the school year. However due to the second national lockdown from the start of the year, much of the assessment work done by teachers has come in the final weeks of term - leading to claims these are ""exams by another name"". Ms Somerville said parents and pupils have been listened to, adding: ""Awarding qualifications will always be challenging under these circumstances, but we believe that the model we have is the fairest solution in the interests of young people."" And she said there would be a ""direct right of appeal"" for all pupils for the first time, which would be free at the point of use. Shirley-Anne Somerville was recently appointed education secretary Grounds for appeal will include disagreement with the ""academic judgement"" behind grades, administrative or procedural errors or appeals related to the Equality Act, including assessment arrangements. Appeals will be assessed by subject specialists, but Ms Somerville said the system must be ""symmetrical"" - meaning they can move grades up, down or leave them unchanged. She said: ""Without symmetry, there would not be a full and fair review of the evidence. This could be perceived as unfair to other learners and raise questions over the credibility of qualifications awarded this year. ""In adopting a symmetrical approach to appeals, judgements at appeal will be made on individual learners' work only and not on an algorithm or on a school's past performance."" Opposition parties were critical of the plans, with Green MSP Ross Greer arguing for a ""no detriment"" approach to appeals where grade could not be revised down. He said lacking such a system made appeals a ""perverse gamble"", adding: ""Schools will support the strongest evidence they have in support of the initial grade - why would they have stronger evidence suitable for an appeal which they chose not to submit in the first place? ""It seems the risk of downgrading is increased by an appeals process reliant purely on limited and likely weaker evidence, rather than on the professional judgement of teachers."" Ms Somerville replied that it was ""exceptionally rare"" for pupils to have grades reduced on appeal, saying this happened in eight cases out of 13,000 in 2017 and one among 11,000 in 2019. The Children and Young People's Commissioner, Bruce Adamson, said it was disappointing that grades could be marked down on appeal, saying this was ""an unnecessary and disempowering barrier to young people"" and could exacerbate anxiety for pupils. Liam Fowley, vice chairman of the Scottish Youth Parliament, said the appeals process is ""simply not acceptable"" and fails to take into account the ""exceptional circumstances"" faced by young people during the pandemic. The Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS) teaching union meanwhile welcomed much of the statement, saying staff were doing ""a quite phenomenal amount of work"" to deliver grades amid the pandemic. However the NASUWT union - which opposed the current certification model - raised concerns that teachers might have to be available during the summer holidays to engage with the appeals process, despite already facing ""overwhelming and unacceptable levels of workload and anxiety"". Appeals are always part of the exams system in Scotland but arguably the role they play this year is much more important. Normally appeals are made through schools and for a limited number of reasons, usually a pupil has to have been given a worse grade in the final exam than their teacher predicted. Allowing pupils to appeal directly to the SQA and for a wider range of reasons will be welcomed by young people. What will not be as welcome is the fact that grades can be revised down as well as up. This is normal practice, but many argue that this year that option should be off the table to account for the disruption young people have faced and that this could be seen as downgrading teacher judgement. Meanwhile, BBC Radio Scotland's Lunchtime Live programme has found that more than 6,500 pupils have been using a website set up to cheat in this year's assessments. It comes after it was revealed last month that details of assessments were beingshared by pupils on TikTok. Each school has its own arrangements and set its own assessments, but the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) has provided question papers which they can use - and many have been shared on an ""anti SQA"" site online. In some cases, these papers - at Advanced Higher, Higher and National 5 - are being shared in their entirety, along with answers. Scottish Conservative education spokesman Oliver Mundell said assessment papers were available online ""on an industrial scale"". ""Nobody condones attempts to cheat, but SNP ministers were too busy trying to paint a rosy picture instead of tackling the reality for pupils,"" he said. A Scottish government spokesman said the SQA had taken action to contact schools ""to ensure that posts were removed as soon as possible and to reiterate the importance of security arrangements around assessment materials"". Labour education spokesman Michael Marra said he had been contacted be ""very many"" angry parents, saying the publication of the appeal process was ""well over a month late"" and came 20 days before teachers have to submit grades. And he said there had been reports of ""widespread variation"" in the way pupils have been assessed, with complaints that some had faced multiple assessments in a short period of time. Lib Dem MSP Beatrice Wishart said a constituent had told her the current system was the worst model possible, saying it had ""increased stress levels"" for pupils and that there were ""no excuses left"" for the SQA.

Scots Tory leader isolates after MP tests positive,"David Duguid shared photos of his day with Douglas Ross on social media The leader of the Scottish Conservatives is isolating after Scotland Office minister David Duguid tested positive for Covid. Douglas Ross carried out a number of engagements with Mr Duguid in Peterhead on Monday. It is understood Mr Duguid, the MP for Banff and Buchan, was tested on Tuesday afternoon and received a positive result on Wednesday morning. Mr Ross was told on Wednesday morning a ""close contact"" had tested positive. He was informed by text message while in the Scottish Parliament building that a person he had seen on Monday had caught the virus. The party leader, who is MP for Moray and a Highland MSP, is now self-isolating in an Edinburgh hotel. He will get a test as soon as possible, the Scottish Conservatives said. Mr Ross will take part in FMQs on Thursday virtually. Four other Tory MSPs are also taking tests as a precaution, while two MSPs from another party have been advised they should do likewise. It is understood that Mr Duguid took a precautionary test after some work-related travel and a number of recent cases at his children's school. He is said to be asymptomatic and feeling well. A spokesperson for the UK government said: ""Minister Duguid is self-isolating after testing positive for coronavirus. ""He took a test as a precaution at a local UK government test centre. He has notified those he was in close contact with."" The politicians met with the Fishermen's Mission and Peterhead Port Authority on Monday Mr Duguid and Mr Ross shared pictures of their engagements in Peterhead on Monday on social media. They said they met with representatives of the Fishermen's Mission and Peterhead Port Authority, and had lunch in a local cafe.

The city dwellers who want a more tribal way of living,"David Somervell, Jan Woolley and John Cant are part of a group who want to buy the farmhouse Stefanie Kaiser has been been living in Edinburgh for nine years - but says she is longing to be part of a community. The 41-year-old communications manager grew up in a small town in Austria. ""I'm from somewhere that everyone knows each other, and they accept me for who I am. ""Having someone on the spot who is rooting for you, who will help you is a big deal. ""A place where you don't have to make appointments to meet people because your friends are there in your community, gardening with you, chatting with you in shared indoor and outdoor space is what I want. ""I want to feel part of a community, that is what would give me happiness."" Stefanie Kaiser with her two young children The single mother-of-two is now part of a group who want to set up a cohousing project to create a more tribal way of living. They want to buy the 19th Century Comiston Farmhouse, which is set in an acre of land between Fairmilehead and Oxgangs in Edinburgh. Each household would have their own home - but share other resources, such as a laundry, garden space, tools and cars. The plan is for six small houses to be built in the grounds, with two flats in the top part of the mansion. The lower part of the building would be used by the whole group as a communal meeting area. Stefanie says the project needs people of all ages to work. ""It needs to be sustainable, like a forest. New and old growing together. ""We live in an overwhelming world, so we need people around us. We need strong community bonds."" The group behind the plans, Cohousing in Southern Scotland (Choiss), was formed in 2016 and has grown to include 20 people. They plan to sell their current properties and put their finances together to bid for the 19th Century mansion. David Somervell, a retired university sustainability advisor, is the secretary of the group. He stressed that the community would not be transient, so relationships could build over many years. The 67-year-old said he and his wife were looking to live a less private, more convivial existence. ""We want to live somewhere where we can draw on each other's support when we want it,"" he said. ""Everyone would have a quiet space and a key for their own front door, but then they could also go to the communal areas to draw on the care and affections of others. ""It would give us a sense of belonging to have this support from others and for others."" The father-of-two said he saw people living in a ""harmonious"" way while studying architecture in Copenhagen in the 1980s. ""I have a sense that individuals in our society suffer great anomie, they feel abandoned and bereft of social contact and are lonely. ""It is unsatisfactory values which have been forced upon us which has lead to us living separately. ""This makes us more competitive when instead we should be showing more compassion to each other. Humans are social animals."" Jan Woolley, 71, is another member of the group. The single retired civil servant said she had a ""fantastic childhood"" living in a compound in Kenya. ""There was no structured play dates and we grew up as a group, which is how Comiston Farmhouse would work too. ""In a community like this you can see your friends whenever you want and you all help each other. ""You don't have to make arrangements to meet up, you just knock on each other's doors."" The grandmother-of-two lives on her own, and says: ""Currently I have a slight worry that if something was to happen to me, nobody would know for days. ""In this way of life we are proposing everyone would have an awareness of how people are and would help and check on each other."" Dr John Cant, 67, who lives alone in Edinburgh, spent 30 years living in France in a shared building. The computer software engineer said: ""I became tired of the transient relationships between all the volunteers who came and went. ""I want to live in a community where strong relationships develop over time. ""I think humans are tribal, but the way most of us live now means we are becoming more polarised. ""We now have a lot of knowledge that there are benefits to being tribal, to living in an extended group rather than in nuclear families without support, and this is how I want to live."" They hope to mirror the feeling of wellbeing that Frances McDormand's character Fern finds when she becomes part of the tribe of nomads in the film Nomadland. Each household would have their own home but share other resources Comiston Farmhouse was laterly a residential support unit for teenagers until it closed in January 2015. There had been plans for it to be sold to developers to be turned into housing, but the sale fell through following local opposition to the plans. The property has been put back on the market by City of Edinburgh Council for offers over Â£1m. If Choiss is successful, it would become the location for one of the first cohousing projects to get off the ground in Scotland. An estimated 906,000 people live on their own in Scotland with more than a third of households being occupied by one person. Prof Lynn Jamieson, professor of sociology at Edinburgh University, said: ""Creating such a community through cohousing is a good idea. ""There have been times when communities were more stable and interconnected, such as in mining villages. ""I think because they plan to be intergenerational they have a good chance.""

"Holby City to end next year, BBC confirmsThe BBC show, which began life as a Casualty spin-off, has been running since 1999.Entertainment & ArtsComments","Ramin Karimloo as Kian Madani in Holby City earlier this year Holby City, the long-running BBC medical drama, is to end after 23 years, producers have confirmed. The series, created by Tony McHale and Mal Young, first aired in 1999 as a spin-off from another show, Casualty. The BBC announced on Wednesday that the drama will broadcast its final series in March 2022. The corporation said it was ""incredibly proud"" of the show but said it ""had to make difficult decisions to make room for new opportunities"". Around 250 people who work on the show - including actors, camera operators, engineers and hair and make-up professionals - will be affected by the decision. Holby City won a Bafta for best continuing drama in 2008 and still regularly attracts more than 3 million viewers. ""We are incredibly proud of Holby City but it's with great sadness that we are announcing that after 23 years, the show will end on screen in March of next year,"" the BBC said in a statement. ""We sometimes have to make difficult decisions to make room for new opportunities and as part of the BBC's commitment to make more programmes across the UK, we have taken the difficult decision to bring the show to a close in order to reshape the BBC's drama slate to better reflect, represent and serve all parts of the country."" This video can not be played How do TV soaps react to big news events? It added: ""We would like to take this opportunity to thank the amazing team at BBC Studios and all the cast and crew who have been involved in the show since 1999. ""Holby has been a stalwart with audiences, delighting millions of viewers each week and winning hundreds of awards with a compelling mix of cutting edge medical stories and explosive personal stories. ""We look forward to working with the team over the coming months to ensure that when it ends, Holby goes out on a high."" Both Holby City, and Casualty are based in the fictional county of Wyvern, South West England. But the bulk of the on-set filming for Holby City takes place at the BBC's Elstree Centre in Hertfordshire, as well as shots from around Bristol. In March, the BBC announced its plan to move some of its key departments and staff around the country in order to make the corporation more reflective of the UK as a whole. BBC to move key jobs and programmes out of London ""Our mission must be to deliver for the whole of the UK and ensure every household gets value from the BBC,"" said director general Tim Davie. ""These plans will get us closer to audiences, create jobs and investment, and develop and nurture new talent."" Racking up more than 1,000 episodes over 23 series, Holby City has also proved to be a fertile breeding ground for some top acting talent down the years. Killing Eve star Jodie Comer received one of her first acting jobs on the programme, as did fellow Bafta-winner and Black Panther actress Letitia Wright, Peaky Blinders actor Joe Cole and Lee Ryan from the boyband Blue. The stars who acted in Holby City Already-established stars such as Adrian Edmondson and Patsy Kensit were also given parts, while the likes of Maureen Lipman, chat show host Paul O'Grady and comedian Romesh Ranganathan have also appeared as guests. The show has held its place in the BBC One schedule on a Tuesday night for many years, tackling many topical issues along the way. Jodie Comer (left), Tina Hobley and Joseph May in series 12 in 2010 Letitia Wright and Edward MacLiam in series 13 in 2011 Another guest star, Olivia Colman, went on to win best actress at the Oscars for her performance in The Favourite One of its most memorable storylines involved the separation of the conjoined Tan twins, in 2008. The surgery was completed by the show's longest-serving character Dr Ric Griffin, played by Hugh Quarshie. Two years earlier, it showed Professor Elliot Hope's wife Gina travelling to Switzerland to end her life after struggling with motor neurone disease. Some of the hospital's fictional staff have themselves also faced health issues. In 2014 young junior doctor Zosia March was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, after suffering a breakdown following her mother's death. Dr Arthur Digby was diagnosed with melanoma two years later. The hospital came under siege during a shooting spree in a 2017 episode.

Wetherspoons denies Brexit causing staff shortage,"The boss of Wetherspoons has denied claims his pubs are facing a staff shortage caused by Brexit. It comes after Tim Martin was quoted by the Daily Telegraph as saying he favoured a more ""liberal"" visa scheme for EU workers to tackle shortfalls. Mr Martin, a vocal Brexit supporter, told the BBC he had always favoured an Australian style system which treated near neighbours preferentially. There was ""no recruitment issue"" other than in small coastal towns, he added. Many hospitality businesses have struggled during the pandemic despite extensive government support, and firms are reportedly now struggling to recruit as they reopen. According to trade group UK Hospitality, Brexit has added to the problem, as more EU workers return to their home countries. Why are hospitality workers leaving the industry? Hospitality 'struggling to fill thousands of jobs' According to the Telegraph,external, Mr Martin said a more flexible visa system for EU workers could help ease the pressure on firms. ""The UK has a low birth rate. A reasonably liberal immigration system controlled by those we have elected, as distinct from the EU system, would be a plus for the economy and the country,"" he told the paper. ""America, Australia and Singapore have benefited for many decades from this approach. Immigration combined with democracy works."" However, Mr Martin later told the BBC the comment has been taken out of context. He added that Wetherspoons was not struggling to recruit, and in some towns, such as Northallerton, jobs at its pubs were oversubscribed. Figures from the Office for National Statistics in April suggest that more than one in 10 UK hospitality workers left the industry in the last year. James Reed, chief executive of the Reed employment agency, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the firm was advertising 275,000 new jobs in the sector in May. ""When we added them up we had more jobs in May than in any month since February 2008,"" he said. Hotel chain Best Western said it could not open some of its venues at full capacity due to staffing shortages. Boss Rob Paterson told the BBC: ""One hotel didn't have the cleaning staff to be able to sell all of their rooms. ""It's becoming restrictive on trade, at a time when we're investing so much on meeting safety precautions and needing more staff to do that."" He said uncertainty and a fear of being repeatedly furloughed had driven some employees away. ""They don't want to be in a hospitality industry that's shutting down and opening up and their jobs are always at risk. It's not just about pay conditions,"" said Mr Paterson. UK Hospitality has urged the government to encourage UK-based workers to join the sector. It is also asking the government to renew its list of shortage occupations and consider a visa scheme for workers who would not qualify under the points-based system. Over the past 12 months Wetherspoons, which has 871 pubs, has reduced the number of staff by about 6,000 to almost 38,000.

Etsy buys 'Gen-Z' shopping app Depop for $1.6bn,"DJ Siobhan Bell attends a Depop pop-up store in London Etsy is buying Depop, a UK-based second-hand fashion app, in a bid to target younger Gen-Z shoppers. The $1.62bn (Â£1.14bn) deal was announced on Wednesday and is expected to go through later this year. Etsy boss Josh Silverman described Depop as ""the resale home for Gen-Z consumers"". About 90% of Depop's users are under the age of 26, with younger shoppers placing importance on shopping in a more sustainable way. The app, which was founded in London in 2011, lets users buy and sell used clothes through its online marketplace. Depop combines its shopping element with Instagram-style direct messages, so buyers and sellers can negotiate on prices and postage. It now counts about 30 million registered users in total across 150 countries. Etsy, however, tends to skew towards older customers, with craft goods and vintage items on offer from sellers. Depop says train seat crop top violates its terms âI felt so violated when my Depop was hackedâ Etsy's chief executive Mr Silverman added in a statement: ""Depop is a vibrant, two-sided marketplace with a passionate community, a highly-differentiated offering of unique items, and we believe significant potential to further scale."" It added that the deal would allow Depop to expand further, although it will still be based in London and run by its existing team. Depop chief executive Maria Raga said: ""We're on an incredible journey building Depop into a place where the next generation comes to explore unique fashion and be part of a community that's changing the way we shop. ""They come to Depop for the clothes, but stay for the culture."" This video can not be played CEO of second-hand clothing app Depop, told the BBC previously that users of the platform are âentrepreneursâ. After the deal is completed, Etsy will be home to three brands - Etsy, Depop, and also Reverb, an online marketplace for new and used musical instruments. Resale firms such as Depop, Ebay and Vinted have benefitted from consumers being stuck at home during lockdown, with sales and listings of items spiking. According to analytics firm GlobalData, that trend is set to continue with the resale clothing market set to reach $64bn in the next five years. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData, said: ""Over the next ten years it will become larger still, fuelled by an interest in sustainability, a desire for uniqueness, and the rise of the participatory consumer who wants to trade as well as buy."" He pointed out that the market is, however, becoming more crowded with apps forced to fight for customers' attention. Depop has also faced questions in the pastover the security of its app, as well as the sale of stolen goods, such asone crop top made out of a Chiltern Railways seat cover. âUK users of Depop are entrepreneursâ Video, 00:02:27âUK users of Depop are entrepreneursâ âI felt so violated when my Depop was hackedâ Fierce winds threaten more fire destruction as LA struggles to contain blazes Powerful images of loss and heroism from LA Donald Trump faces sentencing in New York hush-money case What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

What students want from catch-up,"Catherine, Katelan, Thomas, Louie and Pavni are not convinced about longer school days If schools in England are going to be given catch-up funding, what do students think would help them recover from the pandemic? It's a thumbs down for proposals such as a longer school day or a shorter summer holiday, in the firm opinion of a group of sixth formers in Crawley, West Sussex. And having spent too much time on laptop learning during the lockdown, they're lukewarm-to-tepid about the prospect of more online tutoring. These articulate 16 to 18-year-old students at St Wilfrid's Catholic school want something perhaps unexpected - and it doesn't come with a price tag. ""Certainty. It would be so beneficial for students,"" says Katelan. They want to know what's happening next. ""It feels like the pandemic has been constant pressure and uncertainty,"" says the Year 12 student. They want a break from the long months of worrying, the confusion, the chopping and changing. They seem to want some calming continuity, not the thunderflashes of big ideas and extra initiatives. Crawley has suffered a serious ""economic shock"" from the pandemic's impact on nearby Gatwick airport Apart from the wider stresses of the pandemic on their families, in school they've faced a constant drip-feed of uncertainty about exams, they've been in and out of school, masks on, masks off, they've been cut off from friends and seen big milestones like proms cancelled. Rather than cramming in more catch-up hours, these students want to plan with more confidence. For instance, how will next year's A-levels be run when so much time has already been lost? ""The most important thing the government could give us as students is clarity. And clarity early on and not just a few months before we're due to take the exams,"" says Catherine, expecting to take her A-levels next summer. She wants to know that exams will be fair to their disrupted year group, with different amounts of missed time, and that there won't be any last-minute changes. They were really glad to return to school in March after the winter lockdown - and you get the impression that they really crave some normality. Head teacher Michael Ferry says the impact on learning has been very different for different pupils ""Every student wanted to be back in the classroom. When it's in-person it's just so more enjoyable,"" says Katelan. It's their own teachers they want to see in front of them, not sessions with online tutors. ""If you're learning off a PowerPoint, it's just very 2-D and not interesting,"" says Katelan. ""It's also the social side,"" says Pavni. ""The teachers say something and you've cracked a joke about it and you remember it."" ""I don't think online catch-up will be very good,"" says Louie. Although the extra tutoring being proposed could also be face-to-face. The idea of longer school days has been widely trailed as a way of helping pupils who have fallen behind, with suggestions it could be part of a multi-billion, multi-year deal, along with tutoring and more training and development for teachers. But Thomas, in Year 13, says the priority should be quality rather than quantity and stretching the day would be counter-productive if it leaves pupils ""fatigued and lethargic"". Â£13.5bn needed to help schools catch up, says study Parents worry about lost learning Students disappointed at cancelled exams While the catch-up plans will focus on lost learning, for young people there were more than exams cancelled last year. There was the abrupt end of school, the unsaid goodbyes, the loss of proms and parties, the post-exam festivals and holidays. ""Everything was either cancelled or rushed,"" says Katelan. And there's trepidation about what lies ahead. Thomas has made his top choice for a university place in the autumn - but says the lack of any visit there has left him uncertain. ""It's daunting that I had to apply to university without every having a feel of the town or the environment. The best I got was an hour taster course on Zoom with 400 other people,"" he says. Crawley in leafy Sussex might not fit any stereotypes of deprivation, but the local economy has taken a hammering in the pandemic from the disruption to nearby Gatwick airport, the biggest local employer. According to the think tank Centre for Cities, Crawley has faced one of the worst ""economic shocks"" in England, going from relative prosperity to having the highest share of people on furlough and one of the biggest increases in unemployment. Crawley has seen a sharp rise in unemployment and the school had to introduce a food bank ""There were a lot of low-paid jobs lost, people who were just about managing,"" says St Wilfrid's head teacher, Michael Ferry, whose school had to open a food bank for struggling families. Free school meal numbers rose sharply, he says, and the school provided computer equipment, internet access and food vouchers in addition to what was supplied by the government. The head teacher says the role of the school has become much wider - it's not just about teaching but ""putting food on the table for families"". The debate about catch-up needs to recognise how uneven the impact of the pandemic has been, says Mr Ferry. There is no one-size-fits-all for how much pupils have fallen behind. ""It's widened the gap between the educational haves and have-nots,"" he says. High-achieving, well-supported students, with all the right computer equipment at home, will be making better progress than ever, says the head teacher. While in another class there could be a low-achieving student with multiple disadvantages at home who will fallen even further behind. Mr Ferry argues that a recovery plan needs to address the root causes of this divide, which he says are ""child poverty, lack of opportunity, lack of parental skills"". Last year pupils faced the confusion over results for cancelled GCSEs and A-levels ""It's not just about money for education. It needs to be a co-ordinated plan that brings in health, mental health, police, social care and education."" Mr Ferry has his own very practical checklist of what is needed from any recovery funding. ""I want a fully staffed maths department,"" he says, wanting catch-up funding to be invested in getting the right staff for schools. ""I want students to come into school having had a breakfast,"" he says, addressing child poverty. And when it comes to mental health, he wants support to be available much more quickly. The sixth formers want to have ""clarity"" about what will happen with next year's exams ""There's a significant minority who haven't coped very well,"" he says, but getting to see mental health services can be a wait of ""six months if you're lucky"". ""They're overwhelmed, so is social care,"" he says. Mr Ferry remains unconvinced by the impact of tutoring - and doesn't want any of the catch-up plans to be ""chuck money at it and hope it works"". He questions whether a longer school day would disrupt what's already on offer. ""We have a large number of pupils who stay back every night anyway,"" he says, with sports, drama and arts clubs and extra catch-up lessons. Exam revision classes already take place over holidays and half terms. That's not to mention the extra pressure on school staff, the risk of burn-out and the financial cost of longer hours, he says. After two academic years of major disruption, it's not difficult to see the pressure to fill the gaps in learning. The current generation in school shouldn't be disadvantaged by the pandemic. They shouldn't miss out on a fair chance to get qualifications. But since the first lockdown in March 2020, Mr Ferry says he has not had a break, working almost every day, including weekends and holidays. He's not expecting any sympathy, and the pressure of the pandemic has affected many sectors, but this has been a marathon effort for many people and families. Recovery, for students and staff, will have to be measured in many different ways.

LiveLiveUK's weekly Covid deaths lowest since September2 minutes ago,"More than 75% of UK adults have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, less than six months after the rollout started 115 of the 11,214 deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 21 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate The newly-released figure for virus-related deaths is the lowest since September and down by 49 on the week before There is nothing in the data at the moment to suggest the next lifting of lockdown restrictions cannot go ahead, PM Boris Johnson says Tutoring sessions for pupils are part of a Â£1.4bn programme to help children in England catch up from the pandemic Health Secretary Matt Hancock the support of celebrities helped encourage people in the UK to take up the offer of vaccinations The state of Victoria, Australia, extends its lockdown by another week as authorities battle a growing virus outbreak China's Sinovac Covid vaccine has been given approval for emergency use by the World Health Organization Edited by James Clarke That's all from us for now. Today's updates have been brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Francesca Gillett, Joshua Cheetham, John Hand and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow. And before we go here's a reminder of today's main coronavirus headlines in the UK. Matt Hancock has been reflecting on the UK's vaccine rollout at a conference in Oxford Thanks for joining our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. We'll be bringing things to a close soon but in case you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments of the day around the world: Carrie and Boris Johnson on their wedding day (left) and Boris Johnson in the Downing Street garden to be interviewed In the matter of a few days Boris Johnson has used the Downing Street garden for two very different purposes. On Saturday it was the venue for the celebration of his wedding to Carrie while on Wednesday he was meeting members of the media there to talk about the latest news on the coronavirus pandemic and funding for education.  This video can not be played PM on catch-up funding: 'There's more coming' Speaking in the Downing Street garden earlier, the prime minister said ""there's going to be more coming down the track"" in terms of money for education. Asked if more funds were being made available on top of the Â£1.4bnannounced earlierfor Covid catch-up plans Boris Johnson said ""of course"" but added that today's money was a ""huge amount"". The prime minister says England is engaged in the ""biggest tutoring programme anywhere in the world"". He says there is no doubt ""many kids are incredibly resilient... but a lot of them also need help to catch up"" and says the funding should ""give parents the confidence that their child is going to get particular attention"", as well as ""find potential in kids that may be missed in the back of the classroom"". There's some good news from Wales - the number of Covid-19 admissions into the nation's hospitals has hit record low levels. There were six confirmed or suspected Covid patients admitted on Tuesday - all in the Cardiff and Vale health board area - a record low during the pandemic. Most of Cardiff and Vale's admissions have been patients in the emergency unit who were tested after reporting a Covid symptom. They are then flagged as suspected until the majority are ruled out by a test. Covid admissions now make up just 1.3% of all hospital admissions in Wales. The Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) has said a lack of effective political leadership has hampered efforts to stop the spread of Covid in Latin America, reports Reuters news agency. The international health body says despite an overall reduction in cases across the US, Canada and Mexico, infections are still on the rise in the rest of the Americas. ""Sadly across our region we've seen misinformation about Covid-19 sow doubt on proven health measures, often in the context of political disputes,"" says PAHO head Carissa Etienne, according to Reuters. ""By stoking controversy where there is none, our leaders are sending mixed messages to the public and standing in the way of effective measures to control the virus."" The highest rate of infections has been flagged in Colombia, where new cases have tripled in some regions. Brazil is also seeing a fresh wave of infections and hospitalisations. Etienne warns Haiti is now of greatest concern in the continent. She says measures to stop the transmission are also being largely ignored by the population in Haiti, despite a sharp rise in cases and deaths. But Etienne says it is encouraging that Haiti's government has accepted the AstraZeneca vaccine. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Three quarters full
is still a quarter empty. Unfortunately, even
with three quarters of adults having received at least one dose, thereâs still
a way to go. The first dose of
the vaccine gives reduced protection against what will soon be the main type of
coronavirus in the UK. Thatâs the variant
first identified in India and now known as either B.1.617.2 or Delta. There may be a
small proportion of elderly and vulnerable people who are not vaccinated or who
donât get full protection. But this is a large
country and thatâs still a large number of elderly or vulnerable people. If this new strain
of the virus truly is as infectious as some estimates suggest, it will find
those people and we could see large numbers going into hospital. Every person fully
vaccinated makes it harder for the virus to spread and find them. But we donât know
exactly how infectious it is. Thatâs the key job of the next few weeks â
finding out whether the virus weâll be facing in the summer could cause a big
third wave or, hopefully, just a ripple. NHS vaccination cards remind people to have their second jab - but do not act as a passport Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked about vaccine passports, and the government's latest thinking on whether they could be used for mass gatherings such as concerts. The government is currently trialling different ways to run large events, to see how social distancing, ventilation and mass testing can be used. Using vaccine passports hasn't yet been trialled but the government hasn't ruled it out. Currently, the NHS app (different to the NHS Covid app) offers people proof of their NHS vaccine status, which could be useful for travel. Hancock says: ""One of the parts of step four is to set out four reviews, one of those is into certification. ""Being able to certify that you've had a vaccine is going to be necessary for international travel because some countries have already set out that they require proof that you've been vaccinated. And that means being able to prove with authority that you've had one of the jabs, and confidence in which jab, accepted for that proof - which is a matter for each individual country. ""We've provided the ability to show that through the NHS app, so we're putting that certification in place where we know it will be needed. ""When it comes to using certification for domestic purposes, that is the review that Michael Gove is leading, and we'll come forward with the conclusions of it soon."" You can read more about vaccine passports here. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been speaking about the vaccination programme in his country and around the world - but how is the rollout of vaccines going globally? According to the latest data, almost two billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 190 countries. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress. Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of residents - but some are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. China and the US have administered the highest number of doses, with about 664 million and 295 million respectively. But while nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns,a few countries in Africa have yet to get started. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme to pool the global vaccine effort and ensure fairer global distribution. It's being led by vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Read our explainer here. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade association for global airlines, has renewed its calls for government to ease travel restrictions, according to the Reuters news agency. The industry body points to an NHS study that shows a low incidence of Covid among incoming passengers to the UK. The data reveals a 2.2% positivity rate among 365,895 travellers between February and May of this year. When excluding passengers from Britain's high-risk ""red list,"" this fell to 1.46%. ""These data tell us that we can do better,"" says IATA's director general Willie Walsh. ""Universal restrictions on people are no longer needed."" A further six Scotland footballers willmiss Wednesday's friendly against the Netherlandsdue to Covid-19 fears following John Fleck's positive test. David Marshall, Stephen O'Donnell, Nathan Patterson, Grant Hanley, John McGinn and Che Adams are not travelling with the squad to Portugal. They have all tested negative but have been kept back as a precaution. Sheffield United midfielder Fleck is self-isolating at Scotland's training camp in Alicantehaving tested positiveon Tuesday. Damien SharkovBBC Monitoring The Omsk State Circus building is used for a variety of events, including circuses, concerts and a film festival A region of Russian Siberia is giving away 1,000
circus tickets to locals who agree to get vaccinated against Covid-19. In a bid to encourage more people to get
the jab, the health ministry in Russia's Omsk Region has announced residents may claim a free ticket to the Omsk State Circus in exchange for
getting their jab at a newly-set-up vaccination site on the circus premises. Those who attend a vaccination there will
be issued a certificate which can be exchanged at the circus box office for a
ticket to the next lion show performance, Interfax news agency reports. Tatyana Kazantseva, head doctor at
Omsk city clinic Number 10, suggested the move may be popular among Russians
who have been reluctant to book a vaccination in a medical setting, adding the new site is well stocked with Russia's Sputnik V and CoviVac vaccines. ""We are administering jabs in our
clinic as well, but not every person wants to go to a medical facility for
this, fearing a large congregation of people,"" she says, according to
Interfax. ""For this reason, organising a medical office such as this in
the building of the circus, directly in the centre of the city, will allow many
Omsk locals to have their jab done without queuing."" The facility is one of many vaccination
sites opened across Russia at non-medical sites such as shopping centres or
sporting venues. In recent months Russian government
officials have been hard-pressed to offset persistent signs of low public enthusiasm
for vaccines. Russia's Academy of Sciences suggested
last week the current speed of vaccination was ""insufficient"" - with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated. The UK'sdaily coronavirus figures have been published by the government,,externalshowing a further 4,330 new confirmed coronavirus cases - higher than yesterday's 3,165. And following yesterday's milestone - the first time the UK announced no new coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began - the figures today show a further 12 people have died. Because of reporting lags at weekends, the number of cases and deaths are often lower at the start of the week - and that may partly explain why there appears to be a jump in the numbers between yesterday and today. In terms of vaccinations, the figures show more than 26 million people are now fully vaccinated - that's nearly half of the adult population, at 49.5%. And more than 39.5 million people have had their first dose - more than 75% of all adults. Urban crime around the world fell by more than a third during Covid restrictions, with robberies and theft almost halving, according to new research. The study by researchers at the universities of Cambridge and Utrecht looked at crime statistics from 27 cities in 23 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Middle East. Although lockdown measures varied from city to city the researchers found most types of crime fell. The exception was homicide - where the average reduction was only 14%. Researchers say this might be down to a number of factors - in many societies a large number of homicides are domestic. For example, in England and Wales, 35% of female homicides are committed by a partner or ex-partner. The way criminal gangs operate, and their involvement in homicides, may also be less affected by the restrictions imposed on peopleâs daily lives in the pandemic. But overall, the trend was clear with stricter lockdowns seeing fewer crimes. âCity living has been dramatically curtailed by Covid-19, and crime is a big part of city life,â says Professor Manuel Eisner, director of the Violence Research Centre at the University of Cambridge. âNo drinkers spilling into the streets after nights out at bars and pubs. No days spent in shops and cafÃ©s or at the racetrack or football match. Some cities even introduced curfews. It choked the opportunism that fuels so much urban crime,â he adds. A new report has come out looking at how pupils in Northern Ireland are being taught modern languages such as French, German, Irish and Spanish. It found teaching modern languages at primary school ""has all but collapsed"" due to the pandemic - and NI pupils spend less time on compulsory languages than any other country in Europe. The British Council's Language Trends 2021 report is based on responses from more than 120 primary school principals and more than 1,500 year nine pupils. Meanwhile, the number of pupils studying French is dropping and Spanish may soon overtake it as the most popular language at both GCSE and A-level. Read more here. Matt Hancock says the government will look at the number of cases and  ""crucially the link from cases to hospitalisations and deaths"" when considering the 21 June roadmap date for further easing restrictions. ""What really matters and is hardest to judge right now is how much the vaccine has severed that link,"" he says. Asked if the government has considered waiting until the end of July to end restrictions, by which time all adults should have been offered a first dose, the health secretary says we do know the vaccines are effective against the Delta variant after two doses. ""The second doses now cover the vast majority of those who are likely to end up dying from Covid-19 and the vast majority of those who, without a vaccine, would end up in hospital,"" he says. As Health Secretary Matt Hancock reflects on the UK's high vaccine pickup, over in the Philippines the government there has revealed it's far behind its immunisation targets. In light of the new data, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has appealed to the public to get vaccinated, as the country grapples with one of Asia's most severe and long-running outbreaks. ""This is the most, if not the only... effective way, to defeat the coronavirus pandemic,"" Duterte says in a televised address. ""Let us all keep in mind that the vaccine will not only protect you from the virus, it will also protect your loved ones, especially the sick and elderly,"" he adds. John Wong, a data analyst with the government's Covid task force, says in the three months since inoculations began, only 14% of elderly citizens and 8% of people with health conditions have received a jab - short of the government's 21% target. In addition, only half of the 21.1 million people eligible for a second dose have come back to receive it. The slow roll-out has been attributed to limited supplies, accessibility problems and vaccine hesitancy. The Philippines has recorded 1.24 million Covid cases and more than 21,000 deaths since its national outbreak began. The government says it expects a steadier supply of vaccines from this month. Nearly 10 million doses of various vaccine brands are due for delivery in June. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says over half a billion doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have been released across the world, ""mostly to low and middle income countries"". He describes the UK helping the vaccine to be available at cost with no charge for the intellectual property as ""the greatest gift this country can give the world"". Hancock says the global debate is increasingly turning to how to vaccinate the whole world, including among the G7 health ministers. He says the UK has started commercial negotiations with AstraZeneca for a vaccine targeted at variants of concerns - including the variant first identified in South Africa, known as Beta. An anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine protest was held in London at the weekend Matt Hancock has been sharing the UK's experience of dealing with fake news about vaccines. He's at the Global Vaccine Confidence Summit, which the UK is hosting and sees countries discuss and compare tips on vaccine rollouts. Hancock says the UK has had ""some of our best people on the case"" to counter myths and lies and ensure people being treated with respect when responding to vaccine hesitancy. He says openness and honesty is a ""crucial component"". ""Because it's not just been about getting all those positive facts to people but being honest and transparent about the difficult ones too - being upfront and completely transparent, for instance, about side effects, levelling with people that our supply will be lumpy and changing from week to week. ""And being open, when we haven't known the answer, like for instance we took time to find out the impact of new variants. So we didn't jump on the answers people wanted to hear."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Delay removing dangerous cladding âsoul destroyingâThe government will miss a June deadline to complete applications for Â£5bn of funding to remove cladding.Business,"The government will miss a June deadline to complete applications for Â£5bn of funding to remove flammable cladding in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. The BBC understands most managing agents who administer tower blocks with the cladding are refusing to sign contracts with the government. Agents say the contracts only cover cladding problems. This would make them liable for other fire safety defects, they say. Nigel Glen, head of the Association of Residential Managing Agents (ARMA), which represents hundreds of blocks, said making them responsible for other fire safety faults would ""render companies insolvent"". The ongoing dispute is delaying work to make dangerous buildings safe. ""We represents hundreds of blocks in this scheme and none of them have signed. This has major implications and affects hundreds of thousands of people,"" said Mr Glen. ""We want to start the projects, but by signing that contract the managing agent becomes liable for those costs not covered by funding, and as a director you can't sign anything that as it would put your company technically insolvent,"" he said. ARMA represents 325 managing agents, who act for freeholders across the UK. Stephen Squires, and others in his block, has been issued with Â£20,000 bills. The deadline for applications to the government's Â£5.1bn Building Safety Fund is 30 June. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) has now said it will allow applications to be processed beyond that deadline on a case by case basis. A spokesperson for MHCLG said the managing agents' interpretation of the contract is ""fundamentally flawed"". Meanwhile leaseholders across the UK said they are stuck in limbo facing life changing bills. ""It's nearly four years since Grenfell, and this building is nowhere near having any works done to make it safe,"" said Stephen Squires, 42, who lives in a flat with flammable cladding in Manchester's Green Quarter. This video can not be played ""I didn't choose any cladding and now I'm going to be skint forever"" It will cost an estimated Â£2.7m to make Stephen's flat and the hundreds of others at Britton House safe. The block is eligible for funding but the managing agents HomeGround are disputing the terms. ""The fact that we are so close to funding, and it is being held up, it's soul destroying. We want to get on with our lives. It doesn't matter how much money the government make available unless the agreement is signed we are stuck and trapped. We are stuck in the dark."" ""We've all been issued with bills of Â£20,000 to cover fire alarms and remediation. Until the government funding is in place we have to pay for that,"" added Mr Squires. A spokesperson for HomeGround said: ""We have been working alongside ARMA, managing agents, other freeholders, as well as engaging with various leaseholder cladding groups who all share our concerns, to explain to MHCLG why these agreements are not workable and cannot be signed in their current form, but the government is yet to address the remaining issues. This video can not be played 'Cost of removing cladding is ripping our lives apart' ""The changes we have proposed are crucial to ensuring that funding can be released to enable remediation work to start and that residents are sufficiently protected from the costs."" Nearly four years since the Grenfell Tower fire which killed 72 people, an estimated 700,000 people are still living in high-rise blocks with flammable cladding. Aside from the financial strain, the cladding crisis is taking its toll on the mental health of those trapped in dangerous buildings. Alison Hills, 40, bought a one bed flat in St Albans, Hertfordshire, in March 2018 for Â£300,000. It was financed by the sale of the family home when her mother died. A range of fire safety faults were discovered months later. ""I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. My mental health has been in bits. Everything that my father and I ever worked for has been taken away in an instance, and it's not our fault,"" said Ms Hills. Alison Hills says: ""I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat."" Opus House, which consists of 44 flats, has problems with cladding, insulation, missing fire breaks and balconies. The estimated remediation bill is Â£7m but only Â£1m of that is related to the removal and replacement of the cladding. The government's Building Safety Fund will only cover a fraction of the work needed, but the managing agents, FirstPort, are yet to sign the funding contract. Ms Hills, who works as a solicitor, warns that if the contract doesn't get signed leaseholders could be liable for Â£150,000 each. ""It's an absolute disgrace. People are going to become bankrupt. I've had to move out because of the impact on my mental health. You have to sit here in a flammable flat 24 hours a day, especially in lockdown, knowing that you aren't safe,"" said Ms Hills. FirstPort said it is doing all it can to support homeowners and residents at Opus House. ""The current Building Safety Fund agreement exposes signatories to potential open-ended liabilities they do not otherwise hold, and this is the case for resident management companies, freeholders and managing agents across the country,"" a FirstPort spokesperson said. An MHCLG spokesperson said: ""This interpretation (of the contract) is fundamentally wrong - the clause relating to other remediation work ensures that the removal of dangerous cladding is not delayed by funding shortfalls."" ""It concerns only non-cladding works which applicants choose to carry out, as part of the same project as cladding work covered by Government funding. ""Building safety remains the responsibility of the building owner, and we expect them to cooperate with their contractors to ensure any necessary work is carried out safely, effectively and promptly."" Privately owned tower blocks: 786 deemed eligible for the fund 366 approved for financial help with their tender or full funding Â£460m committed.

ARMA represents 325 managing agents, who act for freeholders across the UK. Stephen Squires, and others in his block, has been issued with Â£20,000 bills. The deadline for applications to the government's Â£5.1bn Building Safety Fund is 30 June. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) has now said it will allow applications to be processed beyond that deadline on a case by case basis. A spokesperson for MHCLG said the managing agents' interpretation of the contract is ""fundamentally flawed"". Meanwhile leaseholders across the UK said they are stuck in limbo facing life changing bills.

""We've all been issued with bills of Â£20,000 to cover fire alarms and remediation. Until the government funding is in place we have to pay for that,"" added Mr Squires. A spokesperson for HomeGround said: ""We have been working alongside ARMA, managing agents, other freeholders, as well as engaging with various leaseholder cladding groups who all share our concerns, to explain to MHCLG why these agreements are not workable and cannot be signed in their current form, but the government is yet to address the remaining issues.

Nearly four years since the Grenfell Tower fire which killed 72 people, an estimated 700,000 people are still living in high-rise blocks with flammable cladding. Aside from the financial strain, the cladding crisis is taking its toll on the mental health of those trapped in dangerous buildings. Alison Hills, 40, bought a one bed flat in St Albans, Hertfordshire, in March 2018 for Â£300,000. It was financed by the sale of the family home when her mother died. A range of fire safety faults were discovered months later. ""I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat. My mental health has been in bits. Everything that my father and I ever worked for has been taken away in an instance, and it's not our fault,"" said Ms Hills. Alison Hills says: ""I couldn't sleep. I couldn't eat."" Opus House, which consists of 44 flats, has problems with cladding, insulation, missing fire breaks and balconies. The estimated remediation bill is Â£7m but only Â£1m of that is related to the removal and replacement of the cladding. The government's Building Safety Fund will only cover a fraction of the work needed, but the managing agents, FirstPort, are yet to sign the funding contract. Ms Hills, who works as a solicitor, warns that if the contract doesn't get signed leaseholders could be liable for Â£150,000 each. ""It's an absolute disgrace. People are going to become bankrupt. I've had to move out because of the impact on my mental health. You have to sit here in a flammable flat 24 hours a day, especially in lockdown, knowing that you aren't safe,"" said Ms Hills. FirstPort said it is doing all it can to support homeowners and residents at Opus House. ""The current Building Safety Fund agreement exposes signatories to potential open-ended liabilities they do not otherwise hold, and this is the case for resident management companies, freeholders and managing agents across the country,"" a FirstPort spokesperson said. An MHCLG spokesperson said: ""This interpretation (of the contract) is fundamentally wrong - the clause relating to other remediation work ensures that the removal of dangerous cladding is not delayed by funding shortfalls."" ""It concerns only non-cladding works which applicants choose to carry out, as part of the same project as cladding work covered by Government funding. ""Building safety remains the responsibility of the building owner, and we expect them to cooperate with their contractors to ensure any necessary work is carried out safely, effectively and promptly.""

Australia's second-largest state extends lockdown,"Victoria has recorded 60 cases since an outbreak emerged a week ago The Australian state of Victoria will extend its lockdown by another week as authorities battle to control a growing virus outbreak. Officials say people have been catching the virus from ""fleeting"" encounters in a Melbourne outbreak of the B.1.617.1 strain, now named the Kappa variant by the World Health Organization. Australia's second most-populous state will now be locked down until 10 June. It's the fourth shutdown endured by residents so far in the pandemic. Six new local cases were reported on Wednesday, taking the cluster to 60. ""I know this is not the news that everybody wants to hear but given the cases we have... the government had no choice,"" said Acting Premier James Merlino. ""If we don't do this [lockdown], this thing will get away. This variant of concern will become uncontrollable and people will die."" Nearly seven million people have been in lockdown since 27 May, after the state recorded its first cases in the community in nearly three months. For another seven days, people in the state capital Melbourne will be required to stay at home except for essential work, shopping, exercise, caregiving or to get a Covid vaccine. No gatherings are allowed. Some measures have been eased including the expansion of travel limits to within 10km (6.1 miles) of the home, and senior school students will be allowed to return to the classroom. The battle to open up 'Fortress Australia' Why hotel quarantine keeps leading to lockdowns Outside the state capital, restrictions will be relaxed for regional towns with limited outdoor gatherings and the re-opening of restaurants. But Mr Merlino warned people to remain cautious. He said there are more than 350 places where people may have been exposed to the virus, including camping spots in the neighbouring state of New South Wales after a Melbourne resident travelled there. Victorian authorities said the highly contagious outbreak necessitated another week of lockdown ""No one - no one - wants to repeat last winter,"" he said, referencing Melbourne's second wave last year which caused over 90% of deaths nationwide. The state endured a 112-day lockdown to bring the case rate back to zero. Victoria's new outbreak has highlighted the low level of vaccination among Australians - a task that has been the responsibility of the federal government. Less than 2% of the population has been vaccinated. Cases reported in aged care homes in Melbourne this week have also fuelled criticism of the flawed rollout. The government had pledged it would prioritise vaccines for vulnerable groups like the elderly, but was forced to admit yesterday it did not know how many vaccinations had occurred in aged care homes amid reports of widespread delays. The Victorian outbreak marks the biggest case increase in Australia since October. The nation has largely avoided the level of Covid deaths seen in many other developed nations due to a stringent system of snap lockdowns, border controls and movement restrictions. Officials say this outbreak has been traced to a traveller who tested positive days after finishing quarantine in South Australia. It's believed he contracted the virus through airborne transmission from an infected traveller in another room- throwing up questions over the safety of hotel quarantine.

Delay removing dangerous cladding âsoul destroyingâ,"The government will miss a June deadline to complete applications for Â£5bn of funding to remove flammable cladding in the wake of the Grenfell Tower tragedy. The BBC understands most managing agents who administer tower blocks with the cladding are refusing to sign contracts with the government. Agents say the contracts only cover cladding problems. This would make them liable for other fire safety defects, they say. Nigel Glen, head of the Association of Residential Managing Agents (ARMA), which represents hundreds of blocks, said making them responsible for other fire safety faults would ""render companies insolvent"". The ongoing dispute is delaying work to make dangerous buildings safe. ""We represents hundreds of blocks in this scheme and none of them have signed. This has major implications and affects hundreds of thousands of people,"" said Mr Glen. ""We want to start the projects, but by signing that contract the managing agent becomes liable for those costs not covered by funding, and as a director you can't sign anything that as it would put your company technically insolvent,"" he said.

"LPS apologises over wrongly-issued rates billsThe bills were issued to 4,000 firms despite a Covid-19 rates exemption being in place.Northern Ireland","Land and Property Services (LPS) has apologised after 4,000 businesses were wrongly issued rates bills in spite of an exemption. The firms had been granted a break in paying rates to ease the financial pressure caused by Covid-19 lockdowns. In March, Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the measure would help 29,000 businesses at a cost of Â£230m. Rates are the property taxes paid by businesses and are a significant expense in retail and hospitality. The businesses that are eligible for the exemption include airports, childcare, hospitality, manufacturing and retail, excluding larger food stores and off-licences. NI businesses to receive Â£70m in new Covid support What support is there for my NI business? When will business support grants stop in NI? A spokesperson for the Department of Finance told BBC News NI that a total of 592,000 bills were issued this week for the 2021-22 year. ""Approximately 4,000 of these (0.68%) were issued to businesses without having the 2021-22 rate holiday applied,"" it said. ""Land and Property Services is in the process of contacting those affected to advise them that no payment will be collected and a revised bill will be issued.""

"Holby City to end next year, BBC confirmsThe BBC show, which began life as a Casualty spin-off, has been running since 1999.","Ramin Karimloo as Kian Madani in Holby City earlier this year Holby City, the long-running BBC medical drama, is to end after 23 years, producers have confirmed. The series, created by Tony McHale and Mal Young, first aired in 1999 as a spin-off from another show, Casualty. The BBC announced on Wednesday that the drama will broadcast its final series in March 2022. The corporation said it was ""incredibly proud"" of the show but said it ""had to make difficult decisions to make room for new opportunities"". Around 250 people who work on the show - including actors, camera operators, engineers and hair and make-up professionals - will be affected by the decision. Holby City won a Bafta for best continuing drama in 2008 and still regularly attracts more than 3 million viewers. ""We are incredibly proud of Holby City but it's with great sadness that we are announcing that after 23 years, the show will end on screen in March of next year,"" the BBC said in a statement. ""We sometimes have to make difficult decisions to make room for new opportunities and as part of the BBC's commitment to make more programmes across the UK, we have taken the difficult decision to bring the show to a close in order to reshape the BBC's drama slate to better reflect, represent and serve all parts of the country."" This video can not be played How do TV soaps react to big news events? It added: ""We would like to take this opportunity to thank the amazing team at BBC Studios and all the cast and crew who have been involved in the show since 1999. ""Holby has been a stalwart with audiences, delighting millions of viewers each week and winning hundreds of awards with a compelling mix of cutting edge medical stories and explosive personal stories. ""We look forward to working with the team over the coming months to ensure that when it ends, Holby goes out on a high."" Both Holby City, and Casualty are based in the fictional county of Wyvern, South West England. But the bulk of the on-set filming for Holby City takes place at the BBC's Elstree Centre in Hertfordshire, as well as shots from around Bristol. In March, the BBC announced its plan to move some of its key departments and staff around the country in order to make the corporation more reflective of the UK as a whole. BBC to move key jobs and programmes out of London ""Our mission must be to deliver for the whole of the UK and ensure every household gets value from the BBC,"" said director general Tim Davie. ""These plans will get us closer to audiences, create jobs and investment, and develop and nurture new talent."" Racking up more than 1,000 episodes over 23 series, Holby City has also proved to be a fertile breeding ground for some top acting talent down the years. Killing Eve star Jodie Comer received one of her first acting jobs on the programme, as did fellow Bafta-winner and Black Panther actress Letitia Wright, Peaky Blinders actor Joe Cole and Lee Ryan from the boyband Blue. The stars who acted in Holby City Already-established stars such as Adrian Edmondson and Patsy Kensit were also given parts, while the likes of Maureen Lipman, chat show host Paul O'Grady and comedian Romesh Ranganathan have also appeared as guests. The show has held its place in the BBC One schedule on a Tuesday night for many years, tackling many topical issues along the way. Jodie Comer (left), Tina Hobley and Joseph May in series 12 in 2010 Letitia Wright and Edward MacLiam in series 13 in 2011 Another guest star, Olivia Colman, went on to win best actress at the Oscars for her performance in The Favourite One of its most memorable storylines involved the separation of the conjoined Tan twins, in 2008. The surgery was completed by the show's longest-serving character Dr Ric Griffin, played by Hugh Quarshie. Two years earlier, it showed Professor Elliot Hope's wife Gina travelling to Switzerland to end her life after struggling with motor neurone disease. Some of the hospital's fictional staff have themselves also faced health issues. In 2014 young junior doctor Zosia March was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, after suffering a breakdown following her mother's death. Dr Arthur Digby was diagnosed with melanoma two years later. The hospital came under siege during a shooting spree in a 2017 episode. The following year, a special show entitled The Anniversary Waltz helped to mark the 70th anniversary of the National Health Service.

Bodycams for ambulance staff after rise in attacksParamedic Gary Watson was assaulted by a drunk patient and received serious injuries to his face.Health,"Paramedic Gary Watson says bodycams might have helped identify a drunk patient who attacked him in 2018 Ambulance workers in England will be given body-worn cameras, after assaults against them went up by almost a third in five years. More than 3,500 attacks on emergency care staff were recorded last year. The move was welcomed by staff trialling the cameras, some of whom had experienced violence on the job. The NHS is expecting to make the equipment available to all 10 of England's ambulance trusts by the end of the month. Gary Watson, who took part in the trial in the London Ambulance Service, was assaulted by a drunk patient in 2018, along with three of his colleagues. He tore ligaments, damaged his shoulder and received serious injuries to his face and neck. 'We don't come to work to have abuse thrown at us' Ambulance staff trial body-worn cameras Mr Watson believes the cameras could act as a deterrent. And, he said, if he'd had one when he was attacked three years ago, it would have saved him the stress of testifying against his attacker in court. ""Every time a job comes on the radio you think, 'Is it going to be another one of those jobs?' You just never know. ""All four members of staff got up for work that morning to help people -  come in, do their job, care for people and then go home to their families. They didn't come in to... be hospitalised and end up with the after-effects of such violence,"" he said. ""When you see someone in uniform, you see the uniform, but obviously there's a person who is wearing it."" The bodycams can start recording at the touch of a button and then be shared with police Chief people officer for NHS England Prerana Isaar said: ""Every member of our dedicated and hardworking NHS staff has the fundamental right to be safe at work and it is our priority to eliminate violence and abuse, which we will not tolerate."" A law passed in 2018 gave judges the power to hand down more severe sentences to people who assault emergency workers on duty. NHS England said the camera would start recording at the touch of a button, if members of the public became aggressive or abusive. Recordings can then be shared with the police, and used in court as evidence. NHS England medical director Steve Powis, said: ""Initial trial findings show the cameras make staff feel safer, and can assist in de-escalating situations where staff are faced with someone being aggressive towards them."" This video can not be played Edward Elsden-Smith was caught on a bodycam attacking a policeman But in the North East Ambulance Service - one of the pilot areas along with the London Ambulance Service - assaults actually increased. The cameras were only trialled with small numbers of people, though. Health minister Nadine Dorries said the trial of the cameras helped to reduce incidents. She added: ""We have already doubled the maximum sentence for assaulting an emergency worker and continue to take action to protect staff against violence, aggression and discrimination."" Ambulance services in Wales and Northern Ireland both said they were considering introducing body cameras for staff. The Scottish ambulance service declined to comment.

Probe urged into Tory donations from defunct firms,"Labour is calling for an investigation into two donations allegedly made to the Conservative Party from companies which had ceased to exist. Labour's chairwoman has asked political donations watchdog Electoral Commission to look into the Â£16,000. It follows a story reported by the website Business Insider. The Conservative Party said: ""Donations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission and are published by them."" The Electoral Commission advises political parties to check whether companies are in liquidation, dormant or about to be struck off. Under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, parties may only accept donations from a UK-registered company if it ""carries on business in the United Kingdom"". Tories way ahead in donations over past decade What are the rules governing political donations?

World's largest meat supplier hit by cyber-attack,"The world's largest meat processing company has been targeted by a sophisticated cyber-attack. Computer networks at JBS were hacked, temporarily shutting down some operations in Australia, Canada and the US, with thousands of workers affected. The company believes the ransomware attack originated from a criminal group likely based in Russia, the White House said. The attack could lead to shortages of meat or raise prices for consumers. The ransomware surge ruining lives Colonial Pipeline boss confirms $4.4m ransom paid In a ransomware attack, hackers get into a computer network and threaten to cause disruption or delete files unless a ransom is paid. The White House says the FBI is investigating the attack. ""JBS notified [the White House] that the ransom demand came from a criminal organisation likely based in Russia,"" White House spokeswoman Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday. ""The White House is engaging directly with the Russian government on this matter and delivering the message that responsible states do not harbour ransomware criminals,"" she added. On Wednesday Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov told local media the Biden administration had been in contact with Moscow to discuss the cyber-attack. JBS is the world's largest meat supplier with more than 150 plants in 15 countries It was founded in Brazil in 1953 as a slaughtering business by rancher JosÃ© Batista Sobrinho The company now has more than 150,000 employees worldwide Its customers include supermarkets and fast food outlet McDonald's In the US, JBS processes nearly one-quarter of the country's beef and one-fifth of its pork JBS saidit had made ""significant progress"" in resolving the cyber-attack,externaland hoped the vast majority of its plants would be operational on Wednesday. The company said on Monday that it suspended all affected IT systems as soon as the attack was detected, and that its backup servers were not hacked. The United Food and Commercial Workers' Union, which represents JBS plant employees, has urged the company to ensure workers still receive their pay. IT systems are essential in modern meat processing plants, with computers used at multiple stages including billing and shipping. According to the trade groupBeef Central,external, ""supermarkets and other large end-users like the McDonald's burger patty supply network will be some of the most immediately impacted customers, due to their need for consistent supply"". JBS's five biggest beef plants are in the US, and the shutdowns have halted a fifth of meat production there, according to Bloomberg. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? Plants in Australia and Canada have also been affected but the company's South American operations have not been disrupted. Last month, fuel delivery in the south east of the US was crippled for several days aftera ransomware attack targeted the Colonial Pipeline. Investigators say that attack was also linked to a group with ties to Russia. Colonial Pipeline has confirmed it paid a $4.4m (Â£3.1m) ransom to the cyber-criminal gang responsible. The US government has recommended in the past that companies do not pay criminals over ransomware attacks, in case they invite further hacks in the future.

Labour urges probe into two donations to Tories,"Labour is calling for an investigation into two donations allegedly made to the Conservative Party from companies which had ceased to exist. Labour's chairwoman has asked political donations watchdog Electoral Commission to look into the Â£16,000. It follows a story reported by the website Business Insider. The Conservative Party said: ""Donations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission and are published by them."" The Electoral Commission advises political parties to check whether companies are in liquidation, dormant or about to be struck off. Under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, parties may only accept donations from a UK-registered company if it ""carries on business in the United Kingdom"".

LiveLiveUK to reach vaccine milestone after zero deaths7 minutes ago,"More than 75% of UK adults have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, less than six months after the rollout started 115 of the 11,214 deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 21 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate The newly-released figure for virus-related deaths is the lowest since September and down by 49 on the week before There is nothing in the data at the moment to suggest the next lifting of lockdown restrictions cannot go ahead, PM Boris Johnson says Tutoring sessions for pupils are part of a Â£1.4bn programme to help children in England catch up from the pandemic Health Secretary Matt Hancock the support of celebrities helped encourage people in the UK to take up the offer of vaccinations The state of Victoria, Australia, extends its lockdown by another week as authorities battle a growing virus outbreak China's Sinovac Covid vaccine has been given approval for emergency use by the World Health Organization Edited by James Clarke That's all from us for now. Today's updates have been brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Francesca Gillett, Joshua Cheetham, John Hand and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow. And before we go here's a reminder of today's main coronavirus headlines in the UK. Matt Hancock has been reflecting on the UK's vaccine rollout at a conference in Oxford Thanks for joining our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. We'll be bringing things to a close soon but in case you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments of the day around the world: Carrie and Boris Johnson on their wedding day (left) and Boris Johnson in the Downing Street garden to be interviewed In the matter of a few days Boris Johnson has used the Downing Street garden for two very different purposes. On Saturday it was the venue for the celebration of his wedding to Carrie while on Wednesday he was meeting members of the media there to talk about the latest news on the coronavirus pandemic and funding for education.  This video can not be played PM on catch-up funding: 'There's more coming' Speaking in the Downing Street garden earlier, the prime minister said ""there's going to be more coming down the track"" in terms of money for education. Asked if more funds were being made available on top of the Â£1.4bnannounced earlierfor Covid catch-up plans Boris Johnson said ""of course"" but added that today's money was a ""huge amount"". The prime minister says England is engaged in the ""biggest tutoring programme anywhere in the world"". He says there is no doubt ""many kids are incredibly resilient... but a lot of them also need help to catch up"" and says the funding should ""give parents the confidence that their child is going to get particular attention"", as well as ""find potential in kids that may be missed in the back of the classroom"". There's some good news from Wales - the number of Covid-19 admissions into the nation's hospitals has hit record low levels. There were six confirmed or suspected Covid patients admitted on Tuesday - all in the Cardiff and Vale health board area - a record low during the pandemic. Most of Cardiff and Vale's admissions have been patients in the emergency unit who were tested after reporting a Covid symptom. They are then flagged as suspected until the majority are ruled out by a test. Covid admissions now make up just 1.3% of all hospital admissions in Wales. The Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) has said a lack of effective political leadership has hampered efforts to stop the spread of Covid in Latin America, reports Reuters news agency. The international health body says despite an overall reduction in cases across the US, Canada and Mexico, infections are still on the rise in the rest of the Americas. ""Sadly across our region we've seen misinformation about Covid-19 sow doubt on proven health measures, often in the context of political disputes,"" says PAHO head Carissa Etienne, according to Reuters. ""By stoking controversy where there is none, our leaders are sending mixed messages to the public and standing in the way of effective measures to control the virus."" The highest rate of infections has been flagged in Colombia, where new cases have tripled in some regions. Brazil is also seeing a fresh wave of infections and hospitalisations. Etienne warns Haiti is now of greatest concern in the continent. She says measures to stop the transmission are also being largely ignored by the population in Haiti, despite a sharp rise in cases and deaths. But Etienne says it is encouraging that Haiti's government has accepted the AstraZeneca vaccine. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Three quarters full
is still a quarter empty. Unfortunately, even
with three quarters of adults having received at least one dose, thereâs still
a way to go. The first dose of
the vaccine gives reduced protection against what will soon be the main type of
coronavirus in the UK. Thatâs the variant
first identified in India and now known as either B.1.617.2 or Delta. There may be a
small proportion of elderly and vulnerable people who are not vaccinated or who
donât get full protection. But this is a large
country and thatâs still a large number of elderly or vulnerable people. If this new strain
of the virus truly is as infectious as some estimates suggest, it will find
those people and we could see large numbers going into hospital. Every person fully
vaccinated makes it harder for the virus to spread and find them. But we donât know
exactly how infectious it is. Thatâs the key job of the next few weeks â
finding out whether the virus weâll be facing in the summer could cause a big
third wave or, hopefully, just a ripple. NHS vaccination cards remind people to have their second jab - but do not act as a passport Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked about vaccine passports, and the government's latest thinking on whether they could be used for mass gatherings such as concerts. The government is currently trialling different ways to run large events, to see how social distancing, ventilation and mass testing can be used. Using vaccine passports hasn't yet been trialled but the government hasn't ruled it out. Currently, the NHS app (different to the NHS Covid app) offers people proof of their NHS vaccine status, which could be useful for travel. Hancock says: ""One of the parts of step four is to set out four reviews, one of those is into certification. ""Being able to certify that you've had a vaccine is going to be necessary for international travel because some countries have already set out that they require proof that you've been vaccinated. And that means being able to prove with authority that you've had one of the jabs, and confidence in which jab, accepted for that proof - which is a matter for each individual country. ""We've provided the ability to show that through the NHS app, so we're putting that certification in place where we know it will be needed. ""When it comes to using certification for domestic purposes, that is the review that Michael Gove is leading, and we'll come forward with the conclusions of it soon."" You can read more about vaccine passports here. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been speaking about the vaccination programme in his country and around the world - but how is the rollout of vaccines going globally? According to the latest data, almost two billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 190 countries. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress. Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of residents - but some are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. China and the US have administered the highest number of doses, with about 664 million and 295 million respectively. But while nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns,a few countries in Africa have yet to get started. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme to pool the global vaccine effort and ensure fairer global distribution. It's being led by vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Read our explainer here. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade association for global airlines, has renewed its calls for government to ease travel restrictions, according to the Reuters news agency. The industry body points to an NHS study that shows a low incidence of Covid among incoming passengers to the UK. The data reveals a 2.2% positivity rate among 365,895 travellers between February and May of this year. When excluding passengers from Britain's high-risk ""red list,"" this fell to 1.46%. ""These data tell us that we can do better,"" says IATA's director general Willie Walsh. ""Universal restrictions on people are no longer needed."" A further six Scotland footballers willmiss Wednesday's friendly against the Netherlandsdue to Covid-19 fears following John Fleck's positive test. David Marshall, Stephen O'Donnell, Nathan Patterson, Grant Hanley, John McGinn and Che Adams are not travelling with the squad to Portugal. They have all tested negative but have been kept back as a precaution. Sheffield United midfielder Fleck is self-isolating at Scotland's training camp in Alicantehaving tested positiveon Tuesday. Damien SharkovBBC Monitoring The Omsk State Circus building is used for a variety of events, including circuses, concerts and a film festival A region of Russian Siberia is giving away 1,000
circus tickets to locals who agree to get vaccinated against Covid-19. In a bid to encourage more people to get
the jab, the health ministry in Russia's Omsk Region has announced residents may claim a free ticket to the Omsk State Circus in exchange for
getting their jab at a newly-set-up vaccination site on the circus premises. Those who attend a vaccination there will
be issued a certificate which can be exchanged at the circus box office for a
ticket to the next lion show performance, Interfax news agency reports. Tatyana Kazantseva, head doctor at
Omsk city clinic Number 10, suggested the move may be popular among Russians
who have been reluctant to book a vaccination in a medical setting, adding the new site is well stocked with Russia's Sputnik V and CoviVac vaccines. ""We are administering jabs in our
clinic as well, but not every person wants to go to a medical facility for
this, fearing a large congregation of people,"" she says, according to
Interfax. ""For this reason, organising a medical office such as this in
the building of the circus, directly in the centre of the city, will allow many
Omsk locals to have their jab done without queuing."" The facility is one of many vaccination
sites opened across Russia at non-medical sites such as shopping centres or
sporting venues. In recent months Russian government
officials have been hard-pressed to offset persistent signs of low public enthusiasm
for vaccines. Russia's Academy of Sciences suggested
last week the current speed of vaccination was ""insufficient"" - with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated. The UK'sdaily coronavirus figures have been published by the government,,externalshowing a further 4,330 new confirmed coronavirus cases - higher than yesterday's 3,165. And following yesterday's milestone - the first time the UK announced no new coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began - the figures today show a further 12 people have died. Because of reporting lags at weekends, the number of cases and deaths are often lower at the start of the week - and that may partly explain why there appears to be a jump in the numbers between yesterday and today. In terms of vaccinations, the figures show more than 26 million people are now fully vaccinated - that's nearly half of the adult population, at 49.5%. And more than 39.5 million people have had their first dose - more than 75% of all adults. Urban crime around the world fell by more than a third during Covid restrictions, with robberies and theft almost halving, according to new research. The study by researchers at the universities of Cambridge and Utrecht looked at crime statistics from 27 cities in 23 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Middle East. Although lockdown measures varied from city to city the researchers found most types of crime fell. The exception was homicide - where the average reduction was only 14%. Researchers say this might be down to a number of factors - in many societies a large number of homicides are domestic. For example, in England and Wales, 35% of female homicides are committed by a partner or ex-partner. The way criminal gangs operate, and their involvement in homicides, may also be less affected by the restrictions imposed on peopleâs daily lives in the pandemic. But overall, the trend was clear with stricter lockdowns seeing fewer crimes. âCity living has been dramatically curtailed by Covid-19, and crime is a big part of city life,â says Professor Manuel Eisner, director of the Violence Research Centre at the University of Cambridge. âNo drinkers spilling into the streets after nights out at bars and pubs. No days spent in shops and cafÃ©s or at the racetrack or football match. Some cities even introduced curfews. It choked the opportunism that fuels so much urban crime,â he adds. A new report has come out looking at how pupils in Northern Ireland are being taught modern languages such as French, German, Irish and Spanish. It found teaching modern languages at primary school ""has all but collapsed"" due to the pandemic - and NI pupils spend less time on compulsory languages than any other country in Europe. The British Council's Language Trends 2021 report is based on responses from more than 120 primary school principals and more than 1,500 year nine pupils. Meanwhile, the number of pupils studying French is dropping and Spanish may soon overtake it as the most popular language at both GCSE and A-level. Read more here. Matt Hancock says the government will look at the number of cases and  ""crucially the link from cases to hospitalisations and deaths"" when considering the 21 June roadmap date for further easing restrictions. ""What really matters and is hardest to judge right now is how much the vaccine has severed that link,"" he says. Asked if the government has considered waiting until the end of July to end restrictions, by which time all adults should have been offered a first dose, the health secretary says we do know the vaccines are effective against the Delta variant after two doses. ""The second doses now cover the vast majority of those who are likely to end up dying from Covid-19 and the vast majority of those who, without a vaccine, would end up in hospital,"" he says. As Health Secretary Matt Hancock reflects on the UK's high vaccine pickup, over in the Philippines the government there has revealed it's far behind its immunisation targets. In light of the new data, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has appealed to the public to get vaccinated, as the country grapples with one of Asia's most severe and long-running outbreaks. ""This is the most, if not the only... effective way, to defeat the coronavirus pandemic,"" Duterte says in a televised address. ""Let us all keep in mind that the vaccine will not only protect you from the virus, it will also protect your loved ones, especially the sick and elderly,"" he adds. John Wong, a data analyst with the government's Covid task force, says in the three months since inoculations began, only 14% of elderly citizens and 8% of people with health conditions have received a jab - short of the government's 21% target. In addition, only half of the 21.1 million people eligible for a second dose have come back to receive it. The slow roll-out has been attributed to limited supplies, accessibility problems and vaccine hesitancy. The Philippines has recorded 1.24 million Covid cases and more than 21,000 deaths since its national outbreak began. The government says it expects a steadier supply of vaccines from this month. Nearly 10 million doses of various vaccine brands are due for delivery in June. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says over half a billion doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have been released across the world, ""mostly to low and middle income countries"". He describes the UK helping the vaccine to be available at cost with no charge for the intellectual property as ""the greatest gift this country can give the world"". Hancock says the global debate is increasingly turning to how to vaccinate the whole world, including among the G7 health ministers. He says the UK has started commercial negotiations with AstraZeneca for a vaccine targeted at variants of concerns - including the variant first identified in South Africa, known as Beta. An anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine protest was held in London at the weekend Matt Hancock has been sharing the UK's experience of dealing with fake news about vaccines. He's at the Global Vaccine Confidence Summit, which the UK is hosting and sees countries discuss and compare tips on vaccine rollouts. Hancock says the UK has had ""some of our best people on the case"" to counter myths and lies and ensure people being treated with respect when responding to vaccine hesitancy. He says openness and honesty is a ""crucial component"". ""Because it's not just been about getting all those positive facts to people but being honest and transparent about the difficult ones too - being upfront and completely transparent, for instance, about side effects, levelling with people that our supply will be lumpy and changing from week to week. ""And being open, when we haven't known the answer, like for instance we took time to find out the impact of new variants. So we didn't jump on the answers people wanted to hear."" Â© 2025 BBC.

"Shopping bills set to rise this autumn, says BRC","Consumers could face more expensive shopping bills in the autumn as costs climb and Brexit red tape increases. Shops prices will be under pressure from high food, shipping, and commodity costs, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned. However, in May retail prices declined as clothing and footwear prices fell, it said. The government said it was supporting businesses and the lowest paid. Cost pressures are building for retailers, the BRC said, as global food prices hit their highest for seven years. Meanwhile shipping costs have risen threefold since 2019, and commodity prices are climbing. ""Retailers may be forced to pass on some costs onto their customers,"" said BRC chief Helen Dickinson. ""We will likely see the costs filter through in the second half of this year,"" she said. She called on the government to help to ease the burden on consumers by finding ways to minimise the impact of new checks and documentation required at EU borders from October. In May consumers had another month of falling shop prices, according to the BRC-NielsenIQ Shop Price Index. But while clothing and footwear prices continued to fall, the pick-up in demand once lockdown restrictions were lifted meant the drop was smaller than in previous months. Shopper numbers down a third on pre-Covid levels Clothes sales fuel retail boom as shops reopen Warnings inflation could breach 2% as prices rise Meanwhile, furniture and electricals saw prices rise as retailers felt the lingering impact of disruption to global supply chains earlier this year. Shop prices fell 0.6% year-on-year, but the decline was at the slowest rate since February 2020, and below the 12 and six-month average price decreases of 1.7% and 1.8% respectively. Supermarkets battling to maintain market share by keeping prices low, left food prices to fall for a second consecutive month in May, but only by 0.3% compared 0.6% deflation in April. Fresh food prices fell for the sixth consecutive month in May, although deflation slowed to 1% in May from 1.5% in April. ""With high street retailers continuing to offer price reductions and supermarkets promoting seasonal food and drink, this is helping to offset cost-of-living increases,"" said Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at NielsenIQ. ""Consumers will be seeing the impact of higher energy and fuel costs in household bills and while some cost price increases are coming through the supply chain, this is not yet enough for shop price inflation to return."" The government said it was ""absolutely committed to price stability"". The spokesperson added: ""We continue to take action to support living standards and the lowest paid. ""The furlough and self employed support schemes have protected jobs and incomes throughout the pandemic and the increase to the National Living Wage in April this year is providing an annual pay rise of almost Â£350 for a full-time worker earning the National Living Wage. ""We're supporting businesses as they adjust to our new trading relationship, and engaging regularly to ensure businesses can trade effectively with Europe and seize new opportunities.""

They are then flagged as suspected until the majority are ruled out by a test. Covid admissions now make up just 1.3% of all hospital admissions in Wales. The Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) has said a lack of effective political leadership has hampered efforts to stop the spread of Covid in Latin America, reports Reuters news agency. The international health body says despite an overall reduction in cases across the US, Canada and Mexico, infections are still on the rise in the rest of the Americas. ""Sadly across our region we've seen misinformation about Covid-19 sow doubt on proven health measures, often in the context of political disputes,"" says PAHO head Carissa Etienne, according to Reuters. ""By stoking controversy where there is none, our leaders are sending mixed messages to the public and standing in the way of effective measures to control the virus."" The highest rate of infections has been flagged in Colombia, where new cases have tripled in some regions. Brazil is also seeing a fresh wave of infections and hospitalisations. Etienne warns Haiti is now of greatest concern in the continent. She says measures to stop the transmission are also being largely ignored by the population in Haiti, despite a sharp rise in cases and deaths. But Etienne says it is encouraging that Haiti's government has accepted the AstraZeneca vaccine. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Three quarters full
is still a quarter empty. Unfortunately, even
with three quarters of adults having received at least one dose, thereâs still
a way to go. The first dose of
the vaccine gives reduced protection against what will soon be the main type of
coronavirus in the UK. Thatâs the variant
first identified in India and now known as either B.1.617.2 or Delta. There may be a
small proportion of elderly and vulnerable people who are not vaccinated or who
donât get full protection. But this is a large
country and thatâs still a large number of elderly or vulnerable people. If this new strain
of the virus truly is as infectious as some estimates suggest, it will find
those people and we could see large numbers going into hospital. Every person fully
vaccinated makes it harder for the virus to spread and find them. But we donât know
exactly how infectious it is. Thatâs the key job of the next few weeks â
finding out whether the virus weâll be facing in the summer could cause a big
third wave or, hopefully, just a ripple. NHS vaccination cards remind people to have their second jab - but do not act as a passport Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked about vaccine passports, and the government's latest thinking on whether they could be used for mass gatherings such as concerts. The government is currently trialling different ways to run large events, to see how social distancing, ventilation and mass testing can be used. Using vaccine passports hasn't yet been trialled but the government hasn't ruled it out. Currently, the NHS app (different to the NHS Covid app) offers people proof of their NHS vaccine status, which could be useful for travel. Hancock says: ""One of the parts of step four is to set out four reviews, one of those is into certification. ""Being able to certify that you've had a vaccine is going to be necessary for international travel because some countries have already set out that they require proof that you've been vaccinated. And that means being able to prove with authority that you've had one of the jabs, and confidence in which jab, accepted for that proof - which is a matter for each individual country. ""We've provided the ability to show that through the NHS app, so we're putting that certification in place where we know it will be needed. ""When it comes to using certification for domestic purposes, that is the review that Michael Gove is leading, and we'll come forward with the conclusions of it soon.""

UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been speaking about the vaccination programme in his country and around the world - but how is the rollout of vaccines going globally? According to the latest data, almost two billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 190 countries. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress. Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of residents - but some are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. China and the US have administered the highest number of doses, with about 664 million and 295 million respectively. But while nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns,a few countries in Africa have yet to get started. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme to pool the global vaccine effort and ensure fairer global distribution. It's being led by vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Read our explainer here. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade association for global airlines, has renewed its calls for government to ease travel restrictions, according to the Reuters news agency. The industry body points to an NHS study that shows a low incidence of Covid among incoming passengers to the UK. The data reveals a 2.2% positivity rate among 365,895 travellers between February and May of this year. When excluding passengers from Britain's high-risk ""red list,"" this fell to 1.46%. ""These data tell us that we can do better,"" says IATA's director general Willie Walsh. ""Universal restrictions on people are no longer needed."" A further six Scotland footballers willmiss Wednesday's friendly against the Netherlandsdue to Covid-19 fears following John Fleck's positive test. David Marshall, Stephen O'Donnell, Nathan Patterson, Grant Hanley, John McGinn and Che Adams are not travelling with the squad to Portugal.

Damien SharkovBBC Monitoring The Omsk State Circus building is used for a variety of events, including circuses, concerts and a film festival A region of Russian Siberia is giving away 1,000
circus tickets to locals who agree to get vaccinated against Covid-19. In a bid to encourage more people to get
the jab, the health ministry in Russia's Omsk Region has announced residents may claim a free ticket to the Omsk State Circus in exchange for
getting their jab at a newly-set-up vaccination site on the circus premises. Those who attend a vaccination there will
be issued a certificate which can be exchanged at the circus box office for a
ticket to the next lion show performance, Interfax news agency reports. Tatyana Kazantseva, head doctor at
Omsk city clinic Number 10, suggested the move may be popular among Russians
who have been reluctant to book a vaccination in a medical setting, adding the new site is well stocked with Russia's Sputnik V and CoviVac vaccines. ""We are administering jabs in our
clinic as well, but not every person wants to go to a medical facility for
this, fearing a large congregation of people,"" she says, according to
Interfax. ""For this reason, organising a medical office such as this in
the building of the circus, directly in the centre of the city, will allow many
Omsk locals to have their jab done without queuing."" The facility is one of many vaccination
sites opened across Russia at non-medical sites such as shopping centres or
sporting venues. In recent months Russian government
officials have been hard-pressed to offset persistent signs of low public enthusiasm
for vaccines. Russia's Academy of Sciences suggested
last week the current speed of vaccination was ""insufficient"" - with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated. The UK'sdaily coronavirus figures have been published by the government,,externalshowing a further 4,330 new confirmed coronavirus cases - higher than yesterday's 3,165. And following yesterday's milestone - the first time the UK announced no new coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began - the figures today show a further 12 people have died. Because of reporting lags at weekends, the number of cases and deaths are often lower at the start of the week - and that may partly explain why there appears to be a jump in the numbers between yesterday and today. In terms of vaccinations, the figures show more than 26 million people are now fully vaccinated - that's nearly half of the adult population, at 49.5%. And more than 39.5 million people have had their first dose - more than 75% of all adults. Urban crime around the world fell by more than a third during Covid restrictions, with robberies and theft almost halving, according to new research. The study by researchers at the universities of Cambridge and Utrecht looked at crime statistics from 27 cities in 23 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Middle East. Although lockdown measures varied from city to city the researchers found most types of crime fell. The exception was homicide - where the average reduction was only 14%. Researchers say this might be down to a number of factors - in many societies a large number of homicides are domestic. For example, in England and Wales, 35% of female homicides are committed by a partner or ex-partner. The way criminal gangs operate, and their involvement in homicides, may also be less affected by the restrictions imposed on peopleâs daily lives in the pandemic. But overall, the trend was clear with stricter lockdowns seeing fewer crimes. âCity living has been dramatically curtailed by Covid-19, and crime is a big part of city life,â says Professor Manuel Eisner, director of the Violence Research Centre at the University of Cambridge. âNo drinkers spilling into the streets after nights out at bars and pubs. No days spent in shops and cafÃ©s or at the racetrack or football match. Some cities even introduced curfews. It choked the opportunism that fuels so much urban crime,â he adds. A new report has come out looking at how pupils in Northern Ireland are being taught modern languages such as French, German, Irish and Spanish. It found teaching modern languages at primary school ""has all but collapsed"" due to the pandemic - and NI pupils spend less time on compulsory languages than any other country in Europe. The British Council's Language Trends 2021 report is based on responses from more than 120 primary school principals and more than 1,500 year nine pupils. Meanwhile, the number of pupils studying French is dropping and Spanish may soon overtake it as the most popular language at both GCSE and A-level. Read more here. Matt Hancock says the government will look at the number of cases and  ""crucially the link from cases to hospitalisations and deaths"" when considering the 21 June roadmap date for further easing restrictions. ""What really matters and is hardest to judge right now is how much the vaccine has severed that link,"" he says. Asked if the government has considered waiting until the end of July to end restrictions, by which time all adults should have been offered a first dose, the health secretary says we do know the vaccines are effective against the Delta variant after two doses. ""The second doses now cover the vast majority of those who are likely to end up dying from Covid-19 and the vast majority of those who, without a vaccine, would end up in hospital,"" he says. As Health Secretary Matt Hancock reflects on the UK's high vaccine pickup, over in the Philippines the government there has revealed it's far behind its immunisation targets. In light of the new data, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has appealed to the public to get vaccinated, as the country grapples with one of Asia's most severe and long-running outbreaks. ""This is the most, if not the only... effective way, to defeat the coronavirus pandemic,"" Duterte says in a televised address. ""Let us all keep in mind that the vaccine will not only protect you from the virus, it will also protect your loved ones, especially the sick and elderly,"" he adds. John Wong, a data analyst with the government's Covid task force, says in the three months since inoculations began, only 14% of elderly citizens and 8% of people with health conditions have received a jab - short of the government's 21% target. In addition, only half of the 21.1 million people eligible for a second dose have come back to receive it. The slow roll-out has been attributed to limited supplies, accessibility problems and vaccine hesitancy. The Philippines has recorded 1.24 million Covid cases and more than 21,000 deaths since its national outbreak began. The government says it expects a steadier supply of vaccines from this month. Nearly 10 million doses of various vaccine brands are due for delivery in June. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says over half a billion doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have been released across the world, ""mostly to low and middle income countries"". He describes the UK helping the vaccine to be available at cost with no charge for the intellectual property as ""the greatest gift this country can give the world"". Hancock says the global debate is increasingly turning to how to vaccinate the whole world, including among the G7 health ministers. He says the UK has started commercial negotiations with AstraZeneca for a vaccine targeted at variants of concerns - including the variant first identified in South Africa, known as Beta. An anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine protest was held in London at the weekend Matt Hancock has been sharing the UK's experience of dealing with fake news about vaccines. He's at the Global Vaccine Confidence Summit, which the UK is hosting and sees countries discuss and compare tips on vaccine rollouts. Hancock says the UK has had ""some of our best people on the case"" to counter myths and lies and ensure people being treated with respect when responding to vaccine hesitancy. He says openness and honesty is a ""crucial component"". ""Because it's not just been about getting all those positive facts to people but being honest and transparent about the difficult ones too - being upfront and completely transparent, for instance, about side effects, levelling with people that our supply will be lumpy and changing from week to week. ""And being open, when we haven't known the answer, like for instance we took time to find out the impact of new variants. So we didn't jump on the answers people wanted to hear."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Today's updates have been brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Francesca Gillett, Joshua Cheetham, John Hand and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow. And before we go here's a reminder of today's main coronavirus headlines in the UK. Matt Hancock has been reflecting on the UK's vaccine rollout at a conference in Oxford Thanks for joining our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. We'll be bringing things to a close soon but in case you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments of the day around the world: Carrie and Boris Johnson on their wedding day (left) and Boris Johnson in the Downing Street garden to be interviewed In the matter of a few days Boris Johnson has used the Downing Street garden for two very different purposes. On Saturday it was the venue for the celebration of his wedding to Carrie while on Wednesday he was meeting members of the media there to talk about the latest news on the coronavirus pandemic and funding for education.  This video can not be played PM on catch-up funding: 'There's more coming' Speaking in the Downing Street garden earlier, the prime minister said ""there's going to be more coming down the track"" in terms of money for education. Asked if more funds were being made available on top of the Â£1.4bnannounced earlierfor Covid catch-up plans Boris Johnson said ""of course"" but added that today's money was a ""huge amount"". The prime minister says England is engaged in the ""biggest tutoring programme anywhere in the world"". He says there is no doubt ""many kids are incredibly resilient... but a lot of them also need help to catch up"" and says the funding should ""give parents the confidence that their child is going to get particular attention"", as well as ""find potential in kids that may be missed in the back of the classroom"". There's some good news from Wales - the number of Covid-19 admissions into the nation's hospitals has hit record low levels. There were six confirmed or suspected Covid patients admitted on Tuesday - all in the Cardiff and Vale health board area - a record low during the pandemic.

Bodycams for ambulance staff after rise in attacksAll 10 ambulance trusts in England will be offered the cameras.Health,"Paramedic Gary Watson says bodycams might have helped identify a drunk patient who attacked him in 2018 Ambulance workers in England will be given body-worn cameras, after assaults against them went up by almost a third in five years. More than 3,500 attacks on emergency care staff were recorded last year. The move was welcomed by staff trialling the cameras, some of whom had experienced violence on the job. The NHS is expecting to make the equipment available to all 10 of England's ambulance trusts by the end of the month. Gary Watson, who took part in the trial in the London Ambulance Service, was assaulted by a drunk patient in 2018, along with three of his colleagues. He tore ligaments, damaged his shoulder and received serious injuries to his face and neck. 'We don't come to work to have abuse thrown at us' Ambulance staff trial body-worn cameras Mr Watson believes the cameras could act as a deterrent. And, he said, if he'd had one when he was attacked three years ago, it would have saved him the stress of testifying against his attacker in court. ""Every time a job comes on the radio you think, 'Is it going to be another one of those jobs?' You just never know. ""All four members of staff got up for work that morning to help people -  come in, do their job, care for people and then go home to their families. They didn't come in to... be hospitalised and end up with the after-effects of such violence,"" he said. ""When you see someone in uniform, you see the uniform, but obviously there's a person who is wearing it."" The bodycams can start recording at the touch of a button and then be shared with police Chief people officer for NHS England Prerana Isaar said: ""Every member of our dedicated and hardworking NHS staff has the fundamental right to be safe at work and it is our priority to eliminate violence and abuse, which we will not tolerate."" A law passed in 2018 gave judges the power to hand down more severe sentences to people who assault emergency workers on duty. NHS England said the camera would start recording at the touch of a button, if members of the public became aggressive or abusive. Recordings can then be shared with the police, and used in court as evidence. NHS England medical director Steve Powis, said: ""Initial trial findings show the cameras make staff feel safer, and can assist in de-escalating situations where staff are faced with someone being aggressive towards them."" This video can not be played Edward Elsden-Smith was caught on a bodycam attacking a policeman But in the North East Ambulance Service - one of the pilot areas along with the London Ambulance Service - assaults actually increased. The cameras were only trialled with small numbers of people, though. Health minister Nadine Dorries said the trial of the cameras helped to reduce incidents. She added: ""We have already doubled the maximum sentence for assaulting an emergency worker and continue to take action to protect staff against violence, aggression and discrimination.""

Today's updates have been brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Francesca Gillett, Joshua Cheetham, John Hand and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow. And before we go here's a reminder of today's main coronavirus headlines in the UK. Matt Hancock has been reflecting on the UK's vaccine rollout at a conference in Oxford Thanks for joining our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. We'll be bringing things to a close soon but in case you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments of the day around the world: Carrie and Boris Johnson on their wedding day (left) and Boris Johnson in the Downing Street garden to be interviewed In the matter of a few days Boris Johnson has used the Downing Street garden for two very different purposes. On Saturday it was the venue for the celebration of his wedding to Carrie while on Wednesday he was meeting members of the media there to talk about the latest news on the coronavirus pandemic and funding for education.  This video can not be played PM on catch-up funding: 'There's more coming' Speaking in the Downing Street garden earlier, the prime minister said ""there's going to be more coming down the track"" in terms of money for education. Asked if more funds were being made available on top of the Â£1.4bnannounced earlierfor Covid catch-up plans Boris Johnson said ""of course"" but added that today's money was a ""huge amount"". The prime minister says England is engaged in the ""biggest tutoring programme anywhere in the world"". He says there is no doubt ""many kids are incredibly resilient... but a lot of them also need help to catch up"" and says the funding should ""give parents the confidence that their child is going to get particular attention"", as well as ""find potential in kids that may be missed in the back of the classroom"". There's some good news from Wales - the number of Covid-19 admissions into the nation's hospitals has hit record low levels. There were six confirmed or suspected Covid patients admitted on Tuesday - all in the Cardiff and Vale health board area - a record low during the pandemic. Most of Cardiff and Vale's admissions have been patients in the emergency unit who were tested after reporting a Covid symptom. They are then flagged as suspected until the majority are ruled out by a test. Covid admissions now make up just 1.3% of all hospital admissions in Wales. The Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) has said a lack of effective political leadership has hampered efforts to stop the spread of Covid in Latin America, reports Reuters news agency. The international health body says despite an overall reduction in cases across the US, Canada and Mexico, infections are still on the rise in the rest of the Americas. ""Sadly across our region we've seen misinformation about Covid-19 sow doubt on proven health measures, often in the context of political disputes,"" says PAHO head Carissa Etienne, according to Reuters. ""By stoking controversy where there is none, our leaders are sending mixed messages to the public and standing in the way of effective measures to control the virus."" The highest rate of infections has been flagged in Colombia, where new cases have tripled in some regions. Brazil is also seeing a fresh wave of infections and hospitalisations. Etienne warns Haiti is now of greatest concern in the continent. She says measures to stop the transmission are also being largely ignored by the population in Haiti, despite a sharp rise in cases and deaths. But Etienne says it is encouraging that Haiti's government has accepted the AstraZeneca vaccine. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Three quarters full
is still a quarter empty. Unfortunately, even
with three quarters of adults having received at least one dose, thereâs still
a way to go. The first dose of
the vaccine gives reduced protection against what will soon be the main type of
coronavirus in the UK. Thatâs the variant
first identified in India and now known as either B.1.617.2 or Delta. There may be a
small proportion of elderly and vulnerable people who are not vaccinated or who
donât get full protection. But this is a large
country and thatâs still a large number of elderly or vulnerable people. If this new strain
of the virus truly is as infectious as some estimates suggest, it will find
those people and we could see large numbers going into hospital. Every person fully
vaccinated makes it harder for the virus to spread and find them. But we donât know
exactly how infectious it is. Thatâs the key job of the next few weeks â
finding out whether the virus weâll be facing in the summer could cause a big
third wave or, hopefully, just a ripple. NHS vaccination cards remind people to have their second jab - but do not act as a passport Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked about vaccine passports, and the government's latest thinking on whether they could be used for mass gatherings such as concerts. The government is currently trialling different ways to run large events, to see how social distancing, ventilation and mass testing can be used. Using vaccine passports hasn't yet been trialled but the government hasn't ruled it out. Currently, the NHS app (different to the NHS Covid app) offers people proof of their NHS vaccine status, which could be useful for travel. Hancock says: ""One of the parts of step four is to set out four reviews, one of those is into certification. ""Being able to certify that you've had a vaccine is going to be necessary for international travel because some countries have already set out that they require proof that you've been vaccinated. And that means being able to prove with authority that you've had one of the jabs, and confidence in which jab, accepted for that proof - which is a matter for each individual country. ""We've provided the ability to show that through the NHS app, so we're putting that certification in place where we know it will be needed. ""When it comes to using certification for domestic purposes, that is the review that Michael Gove is leading, and we'll come forward with the conclusions of it soon."" You can read more about vaccine passports here. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been speaking about the vaccination programme in his country and around the world - but how is the rollout of vaccines going globally? According to the latest data, almost two billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 190 countries. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress. Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of residents - but some are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. China and the US have administered the highest number of doses, with about 664 million and 295 million respectively. But while nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns,a few countries in Africa have yet to get started. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme to pool the global vaccine effort and ensure fairer global distribution. It's being led by vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Read our explainer here. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade association for global airlines, has renewed its calls for government to ease travel restrictions, according to the Reuters news agency. The industry body points to an NHS study that shows a low incidence of Covid among incoming passengers to the UK. The data reveals a 2.2% positivity rate among 365,895 travellers between February and May of this year. When excluding passengers from Britain's high-risk ""red list,"" this fell to 1.46%. ""These data tell us that we can do better,"" says IATA's director general Willie Walsh. ""Universal restrictions on people are no longer needed."" A further six Scotland footballers willmiss Wednesday's friendly against the Netherlandsdue to Covid-19 fears following John Fleck's positive test. David Marshall, Stephen O'Donnell, Nathan Patterson, Grant Hanley, John McGinn and Che Adams are not travelling with the squad to Portugal. They have all tested negative but have been kept back as a precaution. Sheffield United midfielder Fleck is self-isolating at Scotland's training camp in Alicantehaving tested positiveon Tuesday. Damien SharkovBBC Monitoring The Omsk State Circus building is used for a variety of events, including circuses, concerts and a film festival A region of Russian Siberia is giving away 1,000
circus tickets to locals who agree to get vaccinated against Covid-19. In a bid to encourage more people to get
the jab, the health ministry in Russia's Omsk Region has announced residents may claim a free ticket to the Omsk State Circus in exchange for
getting their jab at a newly-set-up vaccination site on the circus premises. Those who attend a vaccination there will
be issued a certificate which can be exchanged at the circus box office for a
ticket to the next lion show performance, Interfax news agency reports. Tatyana Kazantseva, head doctor at
Omsk city clinic Number 10, suggested the move may be popular among Russians
who have been reluctant to book a vaccination in a medical setting, adding the new site is well stocked with Russia's Sputnik V and CoviVac vaccines. ""We are administering jabs in our
clinic as well, but not every person wants to go to a medical facility for
this, fearing a large congregation of people,"" she says, according to
Interfax. ""For this reason, organising a medical office such as this in
the building of the circus, directly in the centre of the city, will allow many
Omsk locals to have their jab done without queuing."" The facility is one of many vaccination
sites opened across Russia at non-medical sites such as shopping centres or
sporting venues. In recent months Russian government
officials have been hard-pressed to offset persistent signs of low public enthusiasm
for vaccines. Russia's Academy of Sciences suggested
last week the current speed of vaccination was ""insufficient"" - with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated. The UK'sdaily coronavirus figures have been published by the government,,externalshowing a further 4,330 new confirmed coronavirus cases - higher than yesterday's 3,165. And following yesterday's milestone - the first time the UK announced no new coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began - the figures today show a further 12 people have died. Because of reporting lags at weekends, the number of cases and deaths are often lower at the start of the week - and that may partly explain why there appears to be a jump in the numbers between yesterday and today. In terms of vaccinations, the figures show more than 26 million people are now fully vaccinated - that's nearly half of the adult population, at 49.5%. And more than 39.5 million people have had their first dose - more than 75% of all adults. Urban crime around the world fell by more than a third during Covid restrictions, with robberies and theft almost halving, according to new research. The study by researchers at the universities of Cambridge and Utrecht looked at crime statistics from 27 cities in 23 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Middle East. Although lockdown measures varied from city to city the researchers found most types of crime fell. The exception was homicide - where the average reduction was only 14%. Researchers say this might be down to a number of factors - in many societies a large number of homicides are domestic. For example, in England and Wales, 35% of female homicides are committed by a partner or ex-partner. The way criminal gangs operate, and their involvement in homicides, may also be less affected by the restrictions imposed on peopleâs daily lives in the pandemic. But overall, the trend was clear with stricter lockdowns seeing fewer crimes. âCity living has been dramatically curtailed by Covid-19, and crime is a big part of city life,â says Professor Manuel Eisner, director of the Violence Research Centre at the University of Cambridge. âNo drinkers spilling into the streets after nights out at bars and pubs. No days spent in shops and cafÃ©s or at the racetrack or football match. Some cities even introduced curfews. It choked the opportunism that fuels so much urban crime,â he adds. A new report has come out looking at how pupils in Northern Ireland are being taught modern languages such as French, German, Irish and Spanish. It found teaching modern languages at primary school ""has all but collapsed"" due to the pandemic - and NI pupils spend less time on compulsory languages than any other country in Europe. The British Council's Language Trends 2021 report is based on responses from more than 120 primary school principals and more than 1,500 year nine pupils. Meanwhile, the number of pupils studying French is dropping and Spanish may soon overtake it as the most popular language at both GCSE and A-level. Read more here. Matt Hancock says the government will look at the number of cases and  ""crucially the link from cases to hospitalisations and deaths"" when considering the 21 June roadmap date for further easing restrictions. ""What really matters and is hardest to judge right now is how much the vaccine has severed that link,"" he says. Asked if the government has considered waiting until the end of July to end restrictions, by which time all adults should have been offered a first dose, the health secretary says we do know the vaccines are effective against the Delta variant after two doses. ""The second doses now cover the vast majority of those who are likely to end up dying from Covid-19 and the vast majority of those who, without a vaccine, would end up in hospital,"" he says. As Health Secretary Matt Hancock reflects on the UK's high vaccine pickup, over in the Philippines the government there has revealed it's far behind its immunisation targets. In light of the new data, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has appealed to the public to get vaccinated, as the country grapples with one of Asia's most severe and long-running outbreaks. ""This is the most, if not the only... effective way, to defeat the coronavirus pandemic,"" Duterte says in a televised address. ""Let us all keep in mind that the vaccine will not only protect you from the virus, it will also protect your loved ones, especially the sick and elderly,"" he adds. John Wong, a data analyst with the government's Covid task force, says in the three months since inoculations began, only 14% of elderly citizens and 8% of people with health conditions have received a jab - short of the government's 21% target. In addition, only half of the 21.1 million people eligible for a second dose have come back to receive it. The slow roll-out has been attributed to limited supplies, accessibility problems and vaccine hesitancy. The Philippines has recorded 1.24 million Covid cases and more than 21,000 deaths since its national outbreak began. The government says it expects a steadier supply of vaccines from this month. Nearly 10 million doses of various vaccine brands are due for delivery in June. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says over half a billion doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have been released across the world, ""mostly to low and middle income countries"". He describes the UK helping the vaccine to be available at cost with no charge for the intellectual property as ""the greatest gift this country can give the world"". Hancock says the global debate is increasingly turning to how to vaccinate the whole world, including among the G7 health ministers. He says the UK has started commercial negotiations with AstraZeneca for a vaccine targeted at variants of concerns - including the variant first identified in South Africa, known as Beta. An anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine protest was held in London at the weekend Matt Hancock has been sharing the UK's experience of dealing with fake news about vaccines. He's at the Global Vaccine Confidence Summit, which the UK is hosting and sees countries discuss and compare tips on vaccine rollouts. Hancock says the UK has had ""some of our best people on the case"" to counter myths and lies and ensure people being treated with respect when responding to vaccine hesitancy. He says openness and honesty is a ""crucial component"". ""Because it's not just been about getting all those positive facts to people but being honest and transparent about the difficult ones too - being upfront and completely transparent, for instance, about side effects, levelling with people that our supply will be lumpy and changing from week to week. ""And being open, when we haven't known the answer, like for instance we took time to find out the impact of new variants. So we didn't jump on the answers people wanted to hear."" Â© 2025 BBC.

Nearly 10 million doses of various vaccine brands are due for delivery in June. Health Secretary Matt Hancock says over half a billion doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine have been released across the world, ""mostly to low and middle income countries"". He describes the UK helping the vaccine to be available at cost with no charge for the intellectual property as ""the greatest gift this country can give the world"". Hancock says the global debate is increasingly turning to how to vaccinate the whole world, including among the G7 health ministers. He says the UK has started commercial negotiations with AstraZeneca for a vaccine targeted at variants of concerns - including the variant first identified in South Africa, known as Beta. An anti-lockdown and anti-vaccine protest was held in London at the weekend Matt Hancock has been sharing the UK's experience of dealing with fake news about vaccines. He's at the Global Vaccine Confidence Summit, which the UK is hosting and sees countries discuss and compare tips on vaccine rollouts. Hancock says the UK has had ""some of our best people on the case"" to counter myths and lies and ensure people being treated with respect when responding to vaccine hesitancy. He says openness and honesty is a ""crucial component"". ""Because it's not just been about getting all those positive facts to people but being honest and transparent about the difficult ones too - being upfront and completely transparent, for instance, about side effects, levelling with people that our supply will be lumpy and changing from week to week. ""And being open, when we haven't known the answer, like for instance we took time to find out the impact of new variants. So we didn't jump on the answers people wanted to hear."" Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveUK to reach vaccine milestone after zero deaths1 minute ago,"More than 75% of UK adults have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine, less than six months after the rollout started 115 of the 11,214 deaths registered in the UK in the week ending 21 May mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate The newly-released figure for virus-related deaths is the lowest since September and down by 49 on the week before There is nothing in the data at the moment to suggest the next lifting of lockdown restrictions cannot go ahead, PM Boris Johnson says Tutoring sessions for pupils are part of a Â£1.4bn programme to help children in England catch up from the pandemic Health Secretary Matt Hancock the support of celebrities helped encourage people in the UK to take up the offer of vaccinations The state of Victoria, Australia, extends its lockdown by another week as authorities battle a growing virus outbreak China's Sinovac Covid vaccine has been given approval for emergency use by the World Health Organization Edited by James Clarke That's all from us for now. Today's updates have been brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Francesca Gillett, Joshua Cheetham, John Hand and James Clarke. We'll be back with more coronavirus news tomorrow. And before we go here's a reminder of today's main coronavirus headlines in the UK. Matt Hancock has been reflecting on the UK's vaccine rollout at a conference in Oxford Thanks for joining our rolling coverage of the coronavirus pandemic. We'll be bringing things to a close soon but in case you're just joining us, here are some of the biggest developments of the day around the world: Carrie and Boris Johnson on their wedding day (left) and Boris Johnson in the Downing Street garden to be interviewed In the matter of a few days Boris Johnson has used the Downing Street garden for two very different purposes. On Saturday it was the venue for the celebration of his wedding to Carrie while on Wednesday he was meeting members of the media there to talk about the latest news on the coronavirus pandemic and funding for education.  This video can not be played PM on catch-up funding: 'There's more coming' Speaking in the Downing Street garden earlier, the prime minister said ""there's going to be more coming down the track"" in terms of money for education. Asked if more funds were being made available on top of the Â£1.4bnannounced earlierfor Covid catch-up plans Boris Johnson said ""of course"" but added that today's money was a ""huge amount"". The prime minister says England is engaged in the ""biggest tutoring programme anywhere in the world"". He says there is no doubt ""many kids are incredibly resilient... but a lot of them also need help to catch up"" and says the funding should ""give parents the confidence that their child is going to get particular attention"", as well as ""find potential in kids that may be missed in the back of the classroom"". There's some good news from Wales - the number of Covid-19 admissions into the nation's hospitals has hit record low levels. There were six confirmed or suspected Covid patients admitted on Tuesday - all in the Cardiff and Vale health board area - a record low during the pandemic. Most of Cardiff and Vale's admissions have been patients in the emergency unit who were tested after reporting a Covid symptom. They are then flagged as suspected until the majority are ruled out by a test. Covid admissions now make up just 1.3% of all hospital admissions in Wales. The Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) has said a lack of effective political leadership has hampered efforts to stop the spread of Covid in Latin America, reports Reuters news agency. The international health body says despite an overall reduction in cases across the US, Canada and Mexico, infections are still on the rise in the rest of the Americas. ""Sadly across our region we've seen misinformation about Covid-19 sow doubt on proven health measures, often in the context of political disputes,"" says PAHO head Carissa Etienne, according to Reuters. ""By stoking controversy where there is none, our leaders are sending mixed messages to the public and standing in the way of effective measures to control the virus."" The highest rate of infections has been flagged in Colombia, where new cases have tripled in some regions. Brazil is also seeing a fresh wave of infections and hospitalisations. Etienne warns Haiti is now of greatest concern in the continent. She says measures to stop the transmission are also being largely ignored by the population in Haiti, despite a sharp rise in cases and deaths. But Etienne says it is encouraging that Haiti's government has accepted the AstraZeneca vaccine. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics Three quarters full
is still a quarter empty. Unfortunately, even
with three quarters of adults having received at least one dose, thereâs still
a way to go. The first dose of
the vaccine gives reduced protection against what will soon be the main type of
coronavirus in the UK. Thatâs the variant
first identified in India and now known as either B.1.617.2 or Delta. There may be a
small proportion of elderly and vulnerable people who are not vaccinated or who
donât get full protection. But this is a large
country and thatâs still a large number of elderly or vulnerable people. If this new strain
of the virus truly is as infectious as some estimates suggest, it will find
those people and we could see large numbers going into hospital. Every person fully
vaccinated makes it harder for the virus to spread and find them. But we donât know
exactly how infectious it is. Thatâs the key job of the next few weeks â
finding out whether the virus weâll be facing in the summer could cause a big
third wave or, hopefully, just a ripple. NHS vaccination cards remind people to have their second jab - but do not act as a passport Earlier, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked about vaccine passports, and the government's latest thinking on whether they could be used for mass gatherings such as concerts. The government is currently trialling different ways to run large events, to see how social distancing, ventilation and mass testing can be used. Using vaccine passports hasn't yet been trialled but the government hasn't ruled it out. Currently, the NHS app (different to the NHS Covid app) offers people proof of their NHS vaccine status, which could be useful for travel. Hancock says: ""One of the parts of step four is to set out four reviews, one of those is into certification. ""Being able to certify that you've had a vaccine is going to be necessary for international travel because some countries have already set out that they require proof that you've been vaccinated. And that means being able to prove with authority that you've had one of the jabs, and confidence in which jab, accepted for that proof - which is a matter for each individual country. ""We've provided the ability to show that through the NHS app, so we're putting that certification in place where we know it will be needed. ""When it comes to using certification for domestic purposes, that is the review that Michael Gove is leading, and we'll come forward with the conclusions of it soon."" You can read more about vaccine passports here. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been speaking about the vaccination programme in his country and around the world - but how is the rollout of vaccines going globally? According to the latest data, almost two billion doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered, in at least 190 countries. But there are vast differences in the pace of progress. Some countries have secured and delivered doses to a large proportion of residents - but some are still waiting for their first shipments to arrive. China and the US have administered the highest number of doses, with about 664 million and 295 million respectively. But while nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns,a few countries in Africa have yet to get started. Many poorer countries are relying on deliveries from Covax, a scheme to pool the global vaccine effort and ensure fairer global distribution. It's being led by vaccine alliance Gavi, the World Health Organization, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Read our explainer here. The International Air Transport Association (IATA), a trade association for global airlines, has renewed its calls for government to ease travel restrictions, according to the Reuters news agency. The industry body points to an NHS study that shows a low incidence of Covid among incoming passengers to the UK. The data reveals a 2.2% positivity rate among 365,895 travellers between February and May of this year. When excluding passengers from Britain's high-risk ""red list,"" this fell to 1.46%. ""These data tell us that we can do better,"" says IATA's director general Willie Walsh. ""Universal restrictions on people are no longer needed."" A further six Scotland footballers willmiss Wednesday's friendly against the Netherlandsdue to Covid-19 fears following John Fleck's positive test. David Marshall, Stephen O'Donnell, Nathan Patterson, Grant Hanley, John McGinn and Che Adams are not travelling with the squad to Portugal. They have all tested negative but have been kept back as a precaution. Sheffield United midfielder Fleck is self-isolating at Scotland's training camp in Alicantehaving tested positiveon Tuesday. Damien SharkovBBC Monitoring The Omsk State Circus building is used for a variety of events, including circuses, concerts and a film festival A region of Russian Siberia is giving away 1,000
circus tickets to locals who agree to get vaccinated against Covid-19. In a bid to encourage more people to get
the jab, the health ministry in Russia's Omsk Region has announced residents may claim a free ticket to the Omsk State Circus in exchange for
getting their jab at a newly-set-up vaccination site on the circus premises. Those who attend a vaccination there will
be issued a certificate which can be exchanged at the circus box office for a
ticket to the next lion show performance, Interfax news agency reports. Tatyana Kazantseva, head doctor at
Omsk city clinic Number 10, suggested the move may be popular among Russians
who have been reluctant to book a vaccination in a medical setting, adding the new site is well stocked with Russia's Sputnik V and CoviVac vaccines. ""We are administering jabs in our
clinic as well, but not every person wants to go to a medical facility for
this, fearing a large congregation of people,"" she says, according to
Interfax. ""For this reason, organising a medical office such as this in
the building of the circus, directly in the centre of the city, will allow many
Omsk locals to have their jab done without queuing."" The facility is one of many vaccination
sites opened across Russia at non-medical sites such as shopping centres or
sporting venues. In recent months Russian government
officials have been hard-pressed to offset persistent signs of low public enthusiasm
for vaccines. Russia's Academy of Sciences suggested
last week the current speed of vaccination was ""insufficient"" - with only 8% of the population fully vaccinated. The UK'sdaily coronavirus figures have been published by the government,,externalshowing a further 4,330 new confirmed coronavirus cases - higher than yesterday's 3,165. And following yesterday's milestone - the first time the UK announced no new coronavirus deaths since the pandemic began - the figures today show a further 12 people have died. Because of reporting lags at weekends, the number of cases and deaths are often lower at the start of the week - and that may partly explain why there appears to be a jump in the numbers between yesterday and today. In terms of vaccinations, the figures show more than 26 million people are now fully vaccinated - that's nearly half of the adult population, at 49.5%. And more than 39.5 million people have had their first dose - more than 75% of all adults. Urban crime around the world fell by more than a third during Covid restrictions, with robberies and theft almost halving, according to new research. The study by researchers at the universities of Cambridge and Utrecht looked at crime statistics from 27 cities in 23 countries across Europe, the Americas, Asia and the Middle East. Although lockdown measures varied from city to city the researchers found most types of crime fell. The exception was homicide - where the average reduction was only 14%. Researchers say this might be down to a number of factors - in many societies a large number of homicides are domestic. For example, in England and Wales, 35% of female homicides are committed by a partner or ex-partner. The way criminal gangs operate, and their involvement in homicides, may also be less affected by the restrictions imposed on peopleâs daily lives in the pandemic. But overall, the trend was clear with stricter lockdowns seeing fewer crimes. âCity living has been dramatically curtailed by Covid-19, and crime is a big part of city life,â says Professor Manuel Eisner, director of the Violence Research Centre at the University of Cambridge. âNo drinkers spilling into the streets after nights out at bars and pubs. No days spent in shops and cafÃ©s or at the racetrack or football match. Some cities even introduced curfews. It choked the opportunism that fuels so much urban crime,â he adds. A new report has come out looking at how pupils in Northern Ireland are being taught modern languages such as French, German, Irish and Spanish. It found teaching modern languages at primary school ""has all but collapsed"" due to the pandemic - and NI pupils spend less time on compulsory languages than any other country in Europe. The British Council's Language Trends 2021 report is based on responses from more than 120 primary school principals and more than 1,500 year nine pupils. Meanwhile, the number of pupils studying French is dropping and Spanish may soon overtake it as the most popular language at both GCSE and A-level. Read more here. Matt Hancock says the government will look at the number of cases and  ""crucially the link from cases to hospitalisations and deaths"" when considering the 21 June roadmap date for further easing restrictions. ""What really matters and is hardest to judge right now is how much the vaccine has severed that link,"" he says. Asked if the government has considered waiting until the end of July to end restrictions, by which time all adults should have been offered a first dose, the health secretary says we do know the vaccines are effective against the Delta variant after two doses. ""The second doses now cover the vast majority of those who are likely to end up dying from Covid-19 and the vast majority of those who, without a vaccine, would end up in hospital,"" he says. As Health Secretary Matt Hancock reflects on the UK's high vaccine pickup, over in the Philippines the government there has revealed it's far behind its immunisation targets. In light of the new data, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has appealed to the public to get vaccinated, as the country grapples with one of Asia's most severe and long-running outbreaks. ""This is the most, if not the only... effective way, to defeat the coronavirus pandemic,"" Duterte says in a televised address. ""Let us all keep in mind that the vaccine will not only protect you from the virus, it will also protect your loved ones, especially the sick and elderly,"" he adds. John Wong, a data analyst with the government's Covid task force, says in the three months since inoculations began, only 14% of elderly citizens and 8% of people with health conditions have received a jab - short of the government's 21% target. In addition, only half of the 21.1 million people eligible for a second dose have come back to receive it. The slow roll-out has been attributed to limited supplies, accessibility problems and vaccine hesitancy. The Philippines has recorded 1.24 million Covid cases and more than 21,000 deaths since its national outbreak began. The government says it expects a steadier supply of vaccines from this month. Nearly 10 million doses of various vaccine brands are due for delivery in June.

Biden to suspend Trump Arctic drilling leasesThe president will suspend oil and gas leases in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.,"The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is often described as America's last great wilderness US President Joe Biden's administration will suspend oil and gas leases in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge pending an environmental review. The move reverses former President Donald Trump's decision to sell oil leases in the refuge to expand fossil fuel and mineral development. The giant Alaskan wilderness is home to many important species, including polar bears, caribou and wolves. Arctic tribal leaders have welcomed the move but Republicans are opposed. Why 2021 could be turning point for tackling climate change The wildlife at risk from drilling plan in Arctic refuge Trump opens wilderness up for oil drilling Covering some 19 million acres (78,000 sq km), the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is often described as America's last great wilderness. The push for exploration in the park has been the subject of a decades-long dispute. The oil-rich region is a critically important location for many species and is considered sacred by the indigenous Gwich'in people. One side argues that drilling for oil could bring in significant amounts of money and provide jobs for people in Alaska, while the other has raised concerns over environmental and climate threats. Days before his presidential term ended in January, Mr Trump went ahead withthe first sale of oil leases in the region's coastal plainas part of his push to develop more domestic fossil fuel production. Butthe sale received little interest from the oil and gas industry.Companies said they were focusing their spending on renewable energy, amid a huge slump in oil prices. Several large US banks said they would not fund exploration in the area. In total, 11 tracts were auctioned off, covering just over 550,000 acres, according to the Washington Post newspaper. The sale raised less than $15m (Â£11m) - far less than the government had hoped. Most went to the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state agency. While estimates suggest around 11 billion barrels of oil lie under the refuge, it has no roads or other infrastructure, making it a very expensive place to drill. During his campaign Mr Biden pledged to protect the habitat. Once in office, he directed the Interior Department to review the leases. In a statement on Tuesday,the department said it had ""identified defects in the underlying record,externalof decision supporting the leases, including the lack of analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives"", required under environmental law. White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy said Mr Biden ""believes America's national treasures are cultural and economic cornerstones of our country"". ""He is grateful for the prompt action by the Department of the Interior to suspend all leasing pending a review of decisions made in the last administration's final days that could have changed the character of this special place forever,"" she added. Since taking office, Mr Biden has signed executive ordersaimed at freezing new oil and gas leases on public land, and has pledged todrastically cut carbon emissions. But his administration disappointed environmental groups last week when the Justice Department defended a Trump-era decision to approve a major oil project on Alaska's North Slope in the former Naval Petroleum Reserve. Arctic tribal leaders praised the decision. ""I want to thank President Biden and the Interior Department for recognising the wrongs committed against our people by the last Administration, and for putting us on the right path forward,"" Tonya Garnett, special projects coordinator for the Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government, said in a statement. ""This goes to show that, no matter the odds, the voices of our Tribes matter."" Kristen Miller, acting executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said suspending the leases was ""a step in the right direction"". Arctic tribal leaders and environmental groups have welcomed the move But the Biden administration's move was criticised in a joint statement by Republican senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski along with representative Don Young and Governor Mike Dunleavy. ""This action serves no purpose other than to obstruct Alaska's economy and put our energy security at risk,"" said Ms Murkowski, who has represented Alaska in the Senate since 2002. Mr Dunleavy added that the leases sold by the Trump administration ""are valid and cannot be taken away by the federal government"". Oil revenues are critical for Alaska, with every resident getting a cheque for around $1,600 every year from the state's permanent fund. Mr Dunleavy has previously said that opening the refuge for ""responsible resource development"" could ""put more oil in our pipeline, put Alaskans to work, bring billions of dollars of investment to our state, support American energy independence, and provide critical revenues to our state and local communities"". The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority said it was disappointed by the decision, and had no reason to believe that the environmental analysis was inadequate.

LPS apologises over wrongly-issued rates bills,"Land and Property Services (LPS) has apologised after 4,000 businesses were wrongly issued rates bills in spite of an exemption. The firms had been granted a break in paying rates to ease the financial pressure caused by Covid-19 lockdowns. In March, Finance Minister Conor Murphy said the measure would help 29,000 businesses at a cost of Â£230m. Rates are the property taxes paid by businesses and are a significant expense in retail and hospitality. The businesses that are eligible for the exemption include airports, childcare, hospitality, manufacturing and retail, excluding larger food stores and off-licences. NI businesses to receive Â£70m in new Covid support What support is there for my NI business? When will business support grants stop in NI? A spokesperson for the Department of Finance told BBC News NI that a total of 592,000 bills were issued this week for the 2021-22 year. ""Approximately 4,000 of these (0.68%) were issued to businesses without having the 2021-22 rate holiday applied,"" it said. ""Land and Property Services is in the process of contacting those affected to advise them that no payment will be collected and a revised bill will be issued."" ""Land and Property Services apologise for any inconvenience caused."" The annual rates bills for householders in Northern Ireland are currently being issued by LPS.

Call for pre-school children to attend full-time,"The newly-published research was a commitment in the New Decade New Approach agreement The Department of Education needs to spend more than Â£180m on widespread measures to tackle educational underachievement over the next five years. All children should also go to pre-school for at least four and a half hours a day. There needs to be significantly more investment in early years education. Those are some of the actions recommended in a wide-ranging report, calledA Fair Start,external. The report, from an expert panelset up by the Education Minister Peter Weir in 2020, looks into the links between persistent educational underachievement and socio-economic background. The research had been a commitment in the New Decade New Approach (NDNA) agreement. Mr Weir described it as ""one of the most important reports I have overseen in my time as education minister"". Spending on disadvantaged pupils is 'ineffective' NI education divided and splintered, says report The panel was expected to look particularly at the ""long-standing issues facing working class Protestant boys"" and come up with an action plan to tackle underachievement. However, the Fair Start report said underachievement affected all communities and ""the most significant differences are between the GCSE attainment of free school meal-entitled (FMSE) and non-FSME pupils, irrespective of religion, gender or ethnicity"". The report said schools in disadvantaged areas should be funded to run more extra-curricular activities But it recommended a number of actions to help boys, who it said could face alienation from school, a lack of role models and lack a sense of belonging. It called, for instance, for more investment in youth work in Protestant working class areas and said schools in disadvantaged areas should to be funded to run more extra-curricular activities. The report also said more male teachers were needed, especially in primary schools. ""For a number of years, the issue of educational underachievement has been an area that I have been personally committed to addressing so this is a very significant day for me,"" said the education minister. ""I concur with the panel that the actions set out in the Action Plan are capable of making a real and significant impact on children's learning. Education Minister Peter Weir said the panel's work provided a ""road map"" for making an impact on education ""We need to give our young people confidence, instil within them self-belief that they can succeed and provide the support they need to thrive in school."" Mr Weir added that the ""crucial work"" of the panel provides a ""road map"" for how we can achieve all these things. Setting up the panel in 2020, Mr Weir said underachievement by some pupils remained ""entrenched"" in Northern Ireland despite significant funding and policies to tackle it. The Northern Ireland Audit Office, however, previously saidthe Department of Education (DE) could not demonstrate that almost Â£1bn funding to help disadvantaged children had made a difference. A previous large-scale report for the Executive Office examining the effects of deprivation on educational achievement published in 2017 wascritical of academic selection. The expert panel said there was evidence preparation for the transfer test ""skews"" teaching in the later years of primary school. ""Transfer outcomes for free school meal-entitled (FSME) pupils are significantly lower than for non-FSME pupils, leading to significantly lower percentages of FSME pupils attending grammar schools,"" the report said. The panel said the arrangements for transfer between primary and post-primary schools should be reviewed by DE. The panel called for more investment in children's emotional and mental wellbeing They also said there needed to be much more focus on children's education from birth. ""There is a substantial body of research evidence which highlights that children's early experiences have a profound and lasting impact on their future learning and development,"" the report said, ""which confirms that investing in quality early childhood education for disadvantaged children has significant and long-term benefits for individuals and society."" One of their recommendations is that all children attend full-time pre-school for at least four and a half hours a day. They said research suggested children who attended pre-school full-time had better ""literacy, language, maths, socio-emotional development and physical health, had increased school readiness skills"". The report said, though, staff in pre-school and early years ""were struggling to cope with the number of children who had special educational needs or, more commonly, were awaiting assessment to confirm special educational needs"". The panel also called for more investment in children's emotional and mental wellbeing to reflect the level of need. They also said the Covid-19 pandemic and children being out of school for prolonged periods was likely to have ""exacerbated the existing challenges faced by many children and young people"". BBC News NI has previously reported onsignificant waiting times for Children and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS), for example. Other areas covered by the panel's extensive report included the need for more links between schools and local communities and more professional development for school staff. The panel recommended 47 actions needed to address educational underachievement at all levels at a cumulative cost of over Â£180m over the next five years, though the report also recommends many of the actions continue beyond that. The expert panel was chaired by Dr Noel Purdy from Stranmillis University College. Other members were former principal Kathleen O'Hare, the chief executive of the Greater Shankill Partnership Jackie Redpath, the head of Belfast Boys' Model Mary Montgomery and the head of Long Tower Primary School Joyce Logue. Their final report is based on evidence from almost 350 school leaders, parents, officials from government departments, community organisations, assembly members, teaching unions and others.

"Retail prices set to rise this autumn, says BRC","Consumers could face more expensive shopping bills in the autumn as costs climb and Brexit red tape increases. Shops prices will be under pressure from high food, shipping, and commodity costs, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) warned. However, in May retail prices declined as clothing and footwear prices fell, it said. The government said it was supporting businesses and the lowest paid. Cost pressures are building for retailers, the BRC said, as global food prices hit their highest for seven years. Meanwhile shipping costs have risen threefold since 2019, and commodity prices are climbing. ""Retailers may be forced to pass on some costs onto their customers,"" said BRC chief Helen Dickinson. ""We will likely see the costs filter through in the second half of this year,"" she said. She called on the government to help to ease the burden on consumers by finding ways to minimise the impact of new checks and documentation required at EU borders from October. In May consumers had another month of falling shop prices, according to the BRC-NielsenIQ Shop Price Index. But while clothing and footwear prices continued to fall, the pick-up in demand once lockdown restrictions were lifted meant the drop was smaller than in previous months. Shopper numbers down a third on pre-Covid levels Clothes sales fuel retail boom as shops reopen Warnings inflation could breach 2% as prices rise Meanwhile, furniture and electricals saw prices rise as retailers felt the lingering impact of disruption to global supply chains earlier this year. Shop prices fell 0.6% year-on-year, but the decline was at the slowest rate since February 2020, and below the 12 and six-month average price decreases of 1.7% and 1.8% respectively. Supermarkets battling to maintain market share by keeping prices low, left food prices to fall for a second consecutive month in May, but only by 0.3% compared 0.6% deflation in April. Fresh food prices fell for the sixth consecutive month in May, although deflation slowed to 1% in May from 1.5% in April. ""With high street retailers continuing to offer price reductions and supermarkets promoting seasonal food and drink, this is helping to offset cost-of-living increases,"" said Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at NielsenIQ. ""Consumers will be seeing the impact of higher energy and fuel costs in household bills and while some cost price increases are coming through the supply chain, this is not yet enough for shop price inflation to return."" The government said it was ""absolutely committed to price stability"". The spokesperson added: ""We continue to take action to support living standards and the lowest paid. ""The furlough and self employed support schemes have protected jobs and incomes throughout the pandemic and the increase to the National Living Wage in April this year is providing an annual pay rise of almost Â£350 for a full-time worker earning the National Living Wage. ""We're supporting businesses as they adjust to our new trading relationship, and engaging regularly to ensure businesses can trade effectively with Europe and seize new opportunities.""

The village with more holiday homes than residents,"This video can not be played In recent times, Cwm-yr-Eglwys has become hugely popular as a holiday destination Residents of a small village fear their community will be lost forever as most of the homes are being used for holiday lets. Only two out of the 50 properties in Cwm-yr-Eglwys, Pembrokeshire, have permanent residents. A third is for sale for more than Â£1m and locals say they are being priced out of the market. They want to see urgent action to protect coastal communities from the rise in second home ownership. Cwm-yr-Eglwys is one of the most picturesque villages in Pembrokeshire - a sheltered cove with a ruined church on the foreshore, echoing a sea-faring past and a time when sea captains and their families, fishermen and farmers all lived in the village and surrounding area. Second-home council tax to fund affordable housing Second-home owners 'use loophole' to claim grants In recent times, it has become hugely popular as a holiday destination, with the Pembrokeshire coastal path running directly through the village. There is a small caravan park and about 50 properties, which by now are nearly all holiday homes. There is not much else here - no shop, no pub - only an ice cream kiosk in high season. In winter, the place is deserted but in summer, it is bustling with tourists. But locals say the community has been lost as each house in turn has become a holiday home. Keith Battrick is a councillor with Dinas Cross community council. He lives nearby and has seen the area change in the 50 years or so since he moved here from Bridgend. ""It's a summer village - winter time it's completely dead. No-one here, just the odd walker - that's it,"" he said. ""So it's a sad village really and probably will never change. It makes me sad that the local indigenous community can't afford to live here. ""Local children - my son included - who want to move back here, find it hard. Within 10 years there probably won't be anyone local living here - the future of Cwm-yr-Eglwys is as a holiday place."" Of the three properties still lived in all year, one is on the market for Â£1.3m and the other two are home to people in their 80s. Norman Thomas's house sits on the water's edge, overlooking the beach. It was the home he shared with his wife and four children. He is 88 years old and also the only remaining Welsh speaker in the village and said the language would disappear entirely after his time. ""All those houses through the valley have been sold to English people,"" he said. ""I'm not against them - they bring work here. I get on with them all. But it's sad that the Welsh can't afford these houses. ""That house over there is on the market for Â£1.3m. It's ridiculous. The government should have stepped in and stopped these high prices. ""We've got to accept this is what it's coming to - there are lots of little places like Cwm-yr-Eglwys - nothing left - there isn't even a pub here."" The only other permanent residents are the Broughtons - Elizabeth and Harry who are 80 and 85. Originally from Lancashire, they came on holiday to Cwm-yr-Eglwys in the 1960s and fell in love with the place. When the opportunity came to buy a house in the village, they jumped at the chance. Twenty years ago, they moved here permanently and said they did not mind the village being full of holiday homes - it means there are usually people around and they have seen their investment grow beyond all expectation. ""We get notes through the door, asking can they rent it or are we selling,"" explained Elizabeth. ""Our family would like to keep it but it comes down to pounds, shillings and pence. We are sitting on a goldmine here, no question about it. Very few houses come for sale here so they're pretty sought after."" House prices in Pembrokeshire have risen more than 5% in the past year, with the average home in the county costing Â£225,000, well above the Welsh average. Estate agents are reporting a surge in demand for rural and coastal properties as people emerge from the pandemic, looking for a new way of life. Pembrokeshire also has the second highest number of second homes in Wales - about 9% of the county's housing stock. People say all this is not only creating an impossible challenge for those trying to get on to the property market, but also that whole communities are now under threat. Mr Battrick said more villages and communities like Cwm-yr-Eglwys would be lost unless action is taken to tackle the issue. ""It all goes back to Welsh government - really they should sit down and think really hard about what is happening to villages in Pembrokeshire and all through Wales. ""We will end up eventually with villages like Cwm-yr-Eglwys where there are no local people left living in them and that time is coming quickly I think."" A Welsh government spokesman, said: ""A large number of second homes in a local community can have a real impact on that community. ""Wales is the only UK nation to give local authorities powers to charge higher levels of council tax on both long-term empty properties and second homes. The decision to apply and increase council tax premiums rests with local authorities. ""We've also increased the higher rate of land transaction tax, which applies when people buy an additional property. We are looking at what further interventions are available and how our partners can use existing powers."" Bob Kilmister, Pembrokeshire council cabinet member for finance said the second homes council tax premium - introduced on 1 April 2017 - meant such owners were charged an extra 50% on top of their usual rates. ""The funds are used to increase the supply of affordable housing and enhance the sustainability of local communities.""

"Labour urges probe into two donations to ToriesThe Â£16,000 was allegedly given to the Conservative Party from firms which had ceased to exist.UK Politics","Labour is calling for an investigation into two donations allegedly made to the Conservative Party from companies which had ceased to exist. Labour's chairwoman has asked political donations watchdog Electoral Commission to look into the Â£16,000. It follows a story reported by the website Business Insider. The Conservative Party said: ""Donations are properly and transparently declared to the Electoral Commission and are published by them."" The Electoral Commission advises political parties to check whether companies are in liquidation, dormant or about to be struck off. Under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000, parties may only accept donations from a UK-registered company if it ""carries on business in the United Kingdom"". Tories way ahead in donations over past decade What are the rules governing political donations? Labour's Anneliese Dodds has written to the commission, asking it to ""investigate two potential breaches of electoral law governing financial donations to a political party"". Anneliese Dodds is the Labour Party's chairwoman The two donations were made to the Conservatives over the last four years. One was for a sum of Â£10,000 made in November 2019 by a company called Stridewell Estates. Government records indicate that the firm had been dissolved three years previously. Business Insider reported that a spokesman for the company had previously suggested it could be a mistake. The second donation was made in June 2017 by a company called Unionist Buildings Limited which had apparently been dissolved in January of that year. The Electoral Commission confirmed it had received Ms Dodds' letter and says it will ""respond shortly"".

Biden to suspend Trump Arctic drilling leasesThe president will suspend oil and gas leases in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.US & Canada,"The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is often described as America's last great wilderness US President Joe Biden's administration will suspend oil and gas leases in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge pending an environmental review. The move reverses former President Donald Trump's decision to sell oil leases in the refuge to expand fossil fuel and mineral development. The giant Alaskan wilderness is home to many important species, including polar bears, caribou and wolves. Arctic tribal leaders have welcomed the move but Republicans are opposed. Why 2021 could be turning point for tackling climate change The wildlife at risk from drilling plan in Arctic refuge Trump opens wilderness up for oil drilling Covering some 19 million acres (78,000 sq km), the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is often described as America's last great wilderness. The push for exploration in the park has been the subject of a decades-long dispute. The oil-rich region is a critically important location for many species and is considered sacred by the indigenous Gwich'in people. One side argues that drilling for oil could bring in significant amounts of money and provide jobs for people in Alaska, while the other has raised concerns over environmental and climate threats. Days before his presidential term ended in January, Mr Trump went ahead withthe first sale of oil leases in the region's coastal plainas part of his push to develop more domestic fossil fuel production. Butthe sale received little interest from the oil and gas industry.Companies said they were focusing their spending on renewable energy, amid a huge slump in oil prices. Several large US banks said they would not fund exploration in the area. In total, 11 tracts were auctioned off, covering just over 550,000 acres, according to the Washington Post newspaper. The sale raised less than $15m (Â£11m) - far less than the government had hoped. Most went to the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state agency. While estimates suggest around 11 billion barrels of oil lie under the refuge, it has no roads or other infrastructure, making it a very expensive place to drill. During his campaign Mr Biden pledged to protect the habitat. Once in office, he directed the Interior Department to review the leases. In a statement on Tuesday,the department said it had ""identified defects in the underlying record,externalof decision supporting the leases, including the lack of analysis of a reasonable range of alternatives"", required under environmental law. White House National Climate Advisor Gina McCarthy said Mr Biden ""believes America's national treasures are cultural and economic cornerstones of our country"". ""He is grateful for the prompt action by the Department of the Interior to suspend all leasing pending a review of decisions made in the last administration's final days that could have changed the character of this special place forever,"" she added. Since taking office, Mr Biden has signed executive ordersaimed at freezing new oil and gas leases on public land, and has pledged todrastically cut carbon emissions. But his administration disappointed environmental groups last week when the Justice Department defended a Trump-era decision to approve a major oil project on Alaska's North Slope in the former Naval Petroleum Reserve. Arctic tribal leaders praised the decision. ""I want to thank President Biden and the Interior Department for recognising the wrongs committed against our people by the last Administration, and for putting us on the right path forward,"" Tonya Garnett, special projects coordinator for the Native Village of Venetie Tribal Government, said in a statement. ""This goes to show that, no matter the odds, the voices of our Tribes matter."" Kristen Miller, acting executive director of the Alaska Wilderness League, said suspending the leases was ""a step in the right direction"". Arctic tribal leaders and environmental groups have welcomed the move But the Biden administration's move was criticised in a joint statement by Republican senators Dan Sullivan and Lisa Murkowski along with representative Don Young and Governor Mike Dunleavy. ""This action serves no purpose other than to obstruct Alaska's economy and put our energy security at risk,"" said Ms Murkowski, who has represented Alaska in the Senate since 2002. Mr Dunleavy added that the leases sold by the Trump administration ""are valid and cannot be taken away by the federal government"". Oil revenues are critical for Alaska, with every resident getting a cheque for around $1,600 every year from the state's permanent fund. Mr Dunleavy has previously said that opening the refuge for ""responsible resource development"" could ""put more oil in our pipeline, put Alaskans to work, bring billions of dollars of investment to our state, support American energy independence, and provide critical revenues to our state and local communities"". The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority said it was disappointed by the decision, and had no reason to believe that the environmental analysis was inadequate.
