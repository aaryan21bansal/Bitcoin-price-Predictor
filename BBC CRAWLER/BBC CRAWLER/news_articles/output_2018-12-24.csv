Draw chaos denies jackpot winner million,"The jackpot winner was pulled out in front of a TV audience of hundreds of thousands (file pic) A Swiss man won a million and then lost it on Saturday, when a televised Swiss lotto draw went chaotically wrong. For Andreas BÃ¼rkli it would have been a lottery dream come true, when his name was pulled out of a drum and announced by German singer Herbert GrÃ¶nemeyer. Swiss public TV channel SRF apologised after declaring him the winner, explaining that a mistake had been made due to technical problems. A new draw will be made and the winner will find out after Christmas. Swiss website Blick tweeted the moment that Mr BÃ¼rkli's win was declared on Swiss German TV show Happy Day, complete with ticker-tape fanfare and a briefcase loaded with cash. Allow Twitter content?

Potential winners paid 10 Swiss francs (Â£8; â¬9; $10) to enter and sent their tickets back to lottery operator Swisslos in the hope of winning the CHF1m jackpot. Ten lots were entered into the final draw As Herbert GrÃ¶nemeyer and TV host RÃ¶bi Koller prepared for the draw, the names of potential winners rolled on a screen behind them All 10 in the draw had to be ready by their phones. More names were held in reserve to be added if someone was not contactable One of the 10 was not contactable and another had a phone number missing, so the organisers moved on to lots 11 and 12. As lot 12 was not contactable they passed on to lot 13 At this point there was confusion as only nine names appeared on the screen With time running short, a lotto official rushed in and mistakenly put 11 lots into a drum manually Mr BÃ¼rkli's name came up and Herbert GrÃ¶nemeyer rang the phone number. There was no answer The show came to an end As reported by Blick In a later statement, a Swisslos official apologised and said the draw had to be carried out manually because of technical problems. ""In the hectic rush"", it said 11 names were loaded into the drum rather than 10, and the extra one had been drawn. Builder revealed as Â£76m EuroMillions winner US lottery jackpot hits record $1.6bn The official stressed that according to the rules the man declared the winner was not eligible because he had not picked up his phone. Asked how Mr BÃ¼rkli had accepted his moment of lottery misfortune, the Swisslos official said he had taken it very well: ""You could even say he was a good sport.""

Saudis 'helped car death suspect flee US',"Abdulrahman Sameer Noorah was allegedly involved in a fatal hit-and-run in Portland in 2016 A Saudi student accused of killing a teenager in a hit-and-run escaped justice with help from Saudi Arabia, US officials reportedly suspect. Abdulrahman Sameer Noorah, 21, fled the US last year, and Saudi officials may have helped him obtain an illegal passport,the Oregonian reported,external. He is accused of killing Fallon Smart, 15, in Portland, Oregon, in 2016. The Saudi government only recently informed US officials of his return home, according to the Oregonian. Mr Noorah faces first-degree manslaughter - with a minimum sentence of 10 years - as well as hit-and-run, reckless endangerment and reckless driving charges in the US. On 10 June 2017, with two weeks until his trial, Mr Noorah removed his tracking device and disappeared, police say. Federal officials told the Oregonian they believe he was probably taken out of the country on a private plane. ""We're doing everything we can to get him back,"" Eric Wahlstrom, a supervisory deputy US Marshal in Oregon, said. After Mr Noorah's disappearance, US investigators searched domestic and international flights, but found no clues to his whereabouts. This summer, Saudi officials informed the US that Mr Noorah had returned to the kingdom over a year ago, on 17 June, according to the Oregonian. They did not provide additional details to US officials. The two countries do not have an extradition treaty, so the chances of Mr Noorah facing US justice are low. Fallon Smart was a sophomore in high school when she was killed in the accident In August 2016, Mr Noorah was allegedly driving a gold Lexus that fatally struck Ms Smart, the newspaper reported. He was speeding through a crossing at up to 60mph (96km/h), police said. The teenager died at the scene. Mr Noorah was arrested by Multnomah County officers after he returned to the scene of the accident. He had been living in Portland as a student on a scholarship since 2014, with the Saudi government paying him a $1,800 (Â£1,400) stipend each month, the Oregonian reported. The Saudi consulate also gave Mr Noorah the $100,000 he needed to post bail after his arrest in September 2016, according to records viewed by the paper. The Saudi government has previously posted bail -even as high as $2m,external- for its nationals charged with crimes in the US. Mr Noorah had turned in his passport and worn an ankle monitoring cuff after his release, but he was allowed to continue attending his classes at Portland Community College. The day he vanished, he was reportedly picked up from campus by a black car. The US Marshals Service and US Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. The case follows an international uproar overthe killing of US-based Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The US Senate blamed the Saudi crown prince for ordering Mr Khashoggi's killing and criticised President Donald Trump's pro-Riyadh stance. What happened to Jamal Khashoggi?

Market slide worsens as Trump savages Fed,"The president reportedly wanted to fire Fed chairman Jerome Powell, but it is unclear whether he has the authority to do so President Donald Trump has lashed out at America's central bank as a stock market whose gains he once took credit for continued a historic plunge. Mr Trump said the Federal Reserve was ""the only problem"" of the US economy. Mr Trump's treasury secretary meanwhile scrambled to calm investors. The Dow Jones fell more than 650 points on Monday, and is on track for its worst December since 1931 during the Great Depression. On Tuesday morning, Japan's Nikkei was down about 5%. The turmoil comes amid a partial government shutdown, US-China trade tensions and reports the president has discussed firing Fed chairman Jerome Powell. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump continually boasted about Wall Street's steep climb during the first year of his presidency, but has sought to deflect blame since markets hit a rough patch in 2018. On Sunday US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin took the unusual step of calling the chief executives of America's six largest banks in a bid to soothe market jitters. On Monday, he called top market regulators and officials from the US central bank to allay fears about the economy. Mr Mnuchin hosted the call with the President's Working Group on Financial Markets to ""discuss co-ordination efforts to assure normal market operations"", according a treasury statement. The board of governors of the US Federal Reserve System, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission are on the working group. US shutdown could stretch into new year Analysis by Samira Hussain, business reporter, BBC News, New York It is rare for a US treasury secretary to make public his discussions with American financial institutions. But that is exactly what Mr Mnuchin did. He was attempting to ease financial markets but Monday's swoon showed he did the opposite. So then President Trump weighed in by tweet and renewed his criticism of the Federal Reserve. That also did not have the desired effect. Instead of the typical Santa Rally, we saw US investors flee stocks for safety. Not exactly the Christmas cheer the White House was hoping for. What does this mean for 2019? A lot will depend on what happens in Washington: government shutdown, simmering trade tensions and the president's tweets. One thing has been made very clear: if the White House wants to calm nervous investors, it's going to need to get much better at its messaging. Monday saw the worst day of Christmas Eve trading ever for US stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 653 points, falling below 22,000. The S&P 500 entered so-called ""bear market"" territory. US investors are fretful about a range of factors including slowing economic growth at home and internationally, though US economic data is still strong. Mr Trump's ongoing trade war with China as well as Defence Secretary Jim Mattis's surprise resignation have also unsettled investors. In addition, a partial US government shutdown began at midnight on Friday after Congress refused to fund President Trump's planned US-Mexico border wall. The shutdown could continue until the opening of the next Congress on 3 January. A Sunday statement from the treasury took the rare step of divulging details about Mr Mnuchin's discussions with the top US banks. ""The [bank's chief executives] confirmed that they have ample liquidity available for lending to consumer, business markets, and all other market operations,"" the statement said.

Kevin Spacey charged with sexual assault,"Mr Spacey posted a cryptic video in the style of his House of Cards character on Monday US actor Kevin Spacey has been charged with sexually assaulting a teenager at a bar in Massachusetts. He will appear in court on 7 January over the incident, which allegedly occurred in Nantucket in July 2016. On Monday, Mr Spacey posted a video in which he appears to deny any wrongdoing while in character as Frank Underwood from House of Cards. ""I'm certainly not going to pay the price for the things I didn't do,"" he says in the clip. ""You wouldn't believe the worst without evidence, would you?"" he asks. ""You wouldn't rush to judgements without facts."" How the Kevin Spacey story unfolded What has #MeToo actually changed? The alleged victim is the son of former television news presenter Heather Unruh, who spoke publicly about the incident last year. She accused Mr Spacey of buying her then 18-year-old son alcohol - the drinking age in Massachusetts is 21 - and then groping him. This video can not be played Heather Unruh speaks last year about the allegation In the video, Mr Spacey speaks in Frank Underwood's accent,externaland addresses the viewer directly, much like he did throughout his five seasons on House of Cards. ""Of course some believed everything,"" he says. ""They're just waiting with bated breath to hear me confess it all."" ""They're going to say I'm being disrespectful, not playing by the rules,"" he adds. ""Like I ever played by anyone's rules before. I never did. And you loved it."" Frank Underwood was the power-hungry and conniving protagonist of the Netflix series, and murdered a journalist and a politician before he was killed off ahead of season six. Kevin Spacey played Frank Underwood for five seasons and won numerous awards The three-minute clip, which is titled Let Me Be Frank, marks Mr Spacey's first public appearance since the first allegation of sexual assault was made against him last November. He was accused by actor Anthony Rapp of making a sexual advance in 1986 and a number of other allegations have since emerged. Mr Spacey said he had no memory of the event but publicly apologised before issuing an ""absolute"" denial of the other allegations. Separately, in September,the Los Angeles County District Attorney's office said Mr Spacey would not be prosecutedover an accusation of sexual assault that allegedly took place in 1992. It said it fell outside of California's statute of limitations. UK police are also investigating several allegations that centre around his time serving as artistic director at London's Old Vic theatre. The controversy has led to Mr Spacey being axed from a number of roles, including from House of Cards and the 2017 film All the Money in the World, which was re-shot without him. A film in which he appears, Billionaire Boys Club, also took a record-breaking low of $126 (Â£98) on its first night in US cinemas in August.

Thousands evacuated after Sydney tower 'crack',"A loud cracking noise was heard by residents As many as 3,000 people have been evacuated after residents of a newly completed tower block in Australia reported hearing ""cracking noises"". Police confirmed they had found a crack in the 33-storey Opal Tower, in Sydney Olympic Park, following reports of the noise on the 10th floor. Engineers said the high-rise tower has moved up to 2mm, local media reported. A 1km (0.6 mile) evacuation zone, which also affected other buildings, was put in place amid safety fears. An email to residents of a nearby apartment block,externalsaid the evacuation had been ordered because ""there is a potential for the tower to collapse"", according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Specialists were due to enter the 10th floor to inspect the crack and assess whether the building was safe, Greg White, a spokesman for New South Wales Fire And Rescue, told reporters. He said police had been called at about 14:35 local time (03:45 GMT) about a ""loud crack"". The tower has been evacuated until it has been checked ""They attended, identified there was a crack in the building and they called for Fire And Rescue assistance,"" he said. ""We've attended and police and Fire And Rescue evacuated up to 3,000 people from the building and the surrounding areas."" The Opal Tower, which was completed earlier this year, was described by developer Ecove when the design was first unveiled as ""a curvaceous, triangular-shaped building with green walls of living plants embedded into the faÃ§ade, and elevated communal courtyards every five levels"". It boasts 392 flats. An Ecove spokesman said it was aware of the ""concerns"" and had ""notified"" the builder, the Morning Herald said.

Bigger Boxing Day discounts expected,"Bigger discounts than normal are expected in the traditional Boxing Day sales, as shops try to make up for weak trading in the lead-up to Christmas. On top of widespread deductions already offered by retailers, they will be forced to cut prices further to get rid of unwanted stock, say analysts. Average discounts of ""at least 52% off from Boxing Day"" have been predicted by management consultancy Deloitte. Market researchers including Mintel and Springboard also expect big discounts. ""Yes, there will be further deeper discounts on Boxing Day, that's when it's all got to go,"" said Richard Perks, director of retail research at Mintel. However, he cautioned that the sales would be ""pretty selective"" and largely focused on winter items that have not sold already. ""It'll be things like overcoats, party wear and shoes,"" he says. Boxing Day sales are traditionally a way for shops to get rid of unwanted products, so they can bring in new stock but also, crucially, cash to pay for the new stock. ""Post-Christmas sales are incredibly important for a retailer just to keep their houses in order,"" says Mr Perks. The latest figures for Christmas Eve show that by midday, the number of shoppers overall visiting High Street shops, shopping centres and retail parks was up 6.8% on last year. Springboard - which produces the figures - said shoppers were likely to have been tempted by the ""opportunity to take advantage of the additional discounts introduced by retailers."" Why are there so many pre-Christmas sales? When is a sale actually a sale? 'Super Saturday' fails to boost retailers Independent retail analyst Richard Hyman said the high level of pre-Christmas discounting showed the industry was ""very distressed"". ""Discounts have come earlier, because retailers have far too much stock and not enough cash,"" he said. He says the number of retailers on sale, the discounts being offered and the proportion of stock involved are all higher than he has seen in his 35 years working in the retail sector. Many of the shops are now offering money off most of the time, meaning traditional sales like Boxing Day have become ""rather meaningless"", he says. This eternal discounting also means customers are now encouraged to put off purchases, because they know if they wait, the price will come down. Marks & Spencer- Its sale will launch at 17:00 online on Christmas Eve and in stores as soon as they open after Christmas on either 26 December or 27 December. John Lewis- Its clearance sale will begin online on Christmas Eve and in shops from 27 December. Next- Its online sale will kick off on Christmas Eve at 17:00 while the in-store sale starts at 06:00 on 26 December. Debenhams- Its sale has already started online and will begin in shops from Boxing Day AO World- Its sale has already started online The currently level of discounting means that it's a pretty tough environment for retailers, many of which already operate on thin profit margins. Online fashion retailer Asos recently blamed ""unprecedented"" discounting for hurting November trading, which it said would lead to weak profit for the full year. Leading brands including Primark, Ted Baker and John Lewis have also all warned of a slump in sales. Meanwhile, Sports Direct tycoon Mike Ashley said last month had been the ""worst November in living memory"" and predicted some retailers would be ""smashed to pieces"". Analysts say some shops are now always on sale The problem is that customers have become immune to sales, says Diane Wehrle, marketing and insights director at Springboard. She said most shops went into their ""last [final] discounts"" after Saturday and the already large discounts on offer mean shops will be cutting prices from a lower-than-normal starting point. Ms Wehrle also predicts that the traditional Boxing Day period of sales will last much longer than normal. ""There will always be a proportion of retailers continually on sale, there will always be discounting going on,"" she said. ""That's the problem for retailers. Because we're expecting a discount, we hold off waiting for the bottom to reappear, so retailers are not selling what they need to sell quickly enough."" For consumers, that means holding off could pay off, says Jason Gordon, lead consumer analytics partner at Deloitte. He says that given the current business uncertainty, many shops are likely to extend their Christmas sales ""deep into January, with some having little option but to run through early February and even beyond"". How that affects retailers will become clear in the new year with some retailers likely to be forced to close stores and renegotiate debts to survive. Mr Hyman predicts many will have difficult talks with their banks. ""The big question is to what extent do the banks want to increase their exposure to an industry having a really difficult time,"" he asks. Why are there so many pre-Christmas sales?

Actor recalls Christmas in care without mum,"This video can not be played Aged 10, Lennie James spent Christmas in care - but an act of generosity made it a day to remember Actor Lennie James has written and recorded his memory of the first Christmas he spent in care aged 10. The Walking Dead star reflected on the ""dread"" he and his brother felt at facing the day without their mother, who had died a few months earlier. In his story, ""That First Without Her Christmas Day"", he described himself as being ""all but silenced by grief"". Justin Webb, a presenter on BBC Radio 4 Today, admitted to being moved to tears after hearing James' story. His memories are included in ""Home For Christmas"" - a book produced for the homeless charity The Passage. The book also includes stories by authors Michael Morpurgo and A.S. Byatt with a foreword by broadcaster Sue Lawley. In his story, James, now 53, remembered being in bed on Christmas morning ""trying to be brave enough"" to start the day without his mother's ""life and soul"". He added that, if it hadn't have been for his 12-year-old brother's help, he would have stayed in bed. He was told the council only gave Â£5 per child for presents - but, to his surprise, he unwrapped books, a cassette, and a new blue and red skateboard. He said the care home staff topped up the presents fund with their own money. James said he will never forget that day ""not for how it started... but for the kindness, care, consideration and generosity shown to us by people unknown and unrelated to us"". Speaking on the Today programme, James said it was a ""tragedy"" that so many children in care went on to become homeless. He said the problem of homelessness was seen ""in a sharper context over the Christmas period, because that is traditionally when we all go home"". James praised his care home for providing ""an environment we could come back to"" after he and his brother had left care.

Fake Catholic priest unmasked in Spain,"The Colombian man was found to be an impostor after someone complained that he had forged his documents A man who pretended to be a priest for more than 18 years has been dismissed by the Catholic Church in Spain. Miguel Angel Ibarra carried out weddings and baptisms, first in Colombia and then in southern Spain, despite having never been ordained. Those ceremonies will still be recognised, the Church says, but not his communions or the confessions he heard. He was found to be an impostor after a complaint was filed in Colombia. The complainant alleged Mr Ibarra had forged his documents. After a ""thorough investigation"", it was found that he had never been ordained and he has now been ordered to return to Colombia, Church officials say. Horse found in harness at Pompeii Bulgaria rocked by Christmas hog roast row Anger as wrestler told to cut dreadlocks Mr Ibarra moved to Spain last October, settling in the town of Medina-Sidonia, which is home to more than 11,000 people. ""Events like this could overshadow the work of parishioners and ordained priests, who serve the Church every day in an exemplary way,"" the local diocese said in a statement. This is not the first time someone has been caught in the act of pretending to be a Catholic priest. In 2008, a man who had not been ordained was found to be hearing confessions in St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. He was wearing clerical robes, but was later unmasked as a fake after his documents were checked by the Italian authorities.

Pope urges people to live simpler lives,"It is the 82-year-old's pontiff's sixth Christmas as head of the Church Pope Francis has called on people in developed countries to live a simpler and less materialistic life. He also condemned the huge divide between the world's rich and poor, saying Jesus's birth in poverty in a stable should make everyone reflect on the meaning of life. He spoke out while leading a service in St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican for the traditional Christmas Eve Mass. It is the 82-year-old's sixth Christmas as head of the Roman Catholic Church. In his homily, Pope Francis said the birth of Christ pointed to a new way to live ""not by devouring and hoarding, but by sharing and giving"". He continued: ""Let us ask ourselves: Do I really need all these material objects and complicated recipes for living? Can I manage without all these unnecessary extras and live a life of greater simplicity? ""For many people, life's meaning is found in possessing, in having an excess of material objects. An insatiable greed marks all human history, even today, when, paradoxically, a few dine luxuriantly while all too many go without the daily bread needed to survive."" On Christmas Day on Tuesday, the Pope will deliver his ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message from the balcony of St Peter's. Francis, the first Pope from Latin America, has made highlighting the plight of the poor a key theme of his papacy. DuringChristmas Day Mass in 2016he warned that the true meaning of Christmas was being drowned out by materialism. His predecessorPope Benedict made a similar point in 2011.

Miscommunication blamed for drone confusion,"Flights were suspended for more than 36 hours when a drone was first spotted The suggestion there may not have been any drones at Gatwick Airport was a ""miscommunication by police"", a government source has told the BBC. During a conference call between ministers, chaired by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, it was agreed the 67 drone sightings were legitimate. But over the weekend, a senior police officer said it was a ""possibility"" there had never been a drone. About 1,000 flights were affected during the airport's 36 hours of chaos. The airport has spent Â£5m since Wednesday on new equipment and technology to prevent copycat attacks. Sussex Police has insisted it was not ""back to square one"" after releasing an arrested man, 47, and woman, 54, without charge on Sunday. Labour calls for inquiry into Gatwick drones How can a drone cause so much chaos? Australia plans drone-identifying system The hour-long call included David Lidington for the Cabinet Office, the Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Security Minister Ben Wallace, Aviation Minister Baroness Sugg, a defence minister, the airport and police. A government source said the force accepted that there had been ""poor communications"". Det Ch Supt Jason Tingley had cast doubt over possible drone sightings as police had not been able to acquire any footage. Asked about this, he said: ""We are working with human beings saying they have seen something."" He later clarified the force was ""actively investigating"" 67 reports of sightings and there were some ""persons of interest"" but would not reveal if officers were close to making any further arrests. Flights resumed from Gatwick Airport on Friday About 140,000 passengers were affected During the conference call, it is understood the Cabinet Office ""pushed"" the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office to update their rapid deployment protocol. They also discussed defence systems across the UK's airports, after discussions were had with all airport CEOs on Friday. The airport was forced to shut its runway for spells on Wednesday and Friday and for all of Thursday The airport has offered a Â£50,000 reward, through Crimestoppers, and another Â£10,000 has been put up by the charity's chairman Lord Ashcroft to catch the culprits responsible for the drama, which affected some 140,000 passengers. A damaged drone found near the perimeter of the airport near Horley, close to the last reported sighting, is also being examined. A spokesman said: ""We are clear that there were multiple confirmed sightings of drone activity at the airport. ""Therefore we took the necessary actions to ensure the safety of passengers using our airport. Safety will always be our number one priority. ""We continue to support the police with their investigations into this illegal and deliberate act to disrupt the airport's operations."" Authorities regained control over the airfield early on Friday after the Army deployed unidentified military technology. It is believed that the Israeli-developed Drone Dome system, which can jam communications between the drone and its operator, was used. However, experts have said it does not enable the person responsible to be tracked down and captured. John Murray, professor of robotics and autonomous systems at the University of Hull, said it could only ""take the drone out of the sky"".

Toddler dies in circumcision in Italy,"Circumcision demonstration on a doll. Illegal procedures are a concern in Italy A two-year-old boy has died from blood loss following a failed circumcision at a migrant centre in Italy. The boy's twin brother also underwent the procedure in Rome's north-western suburb of Monterondo and is recovering in hospital. A 66-year-old man has been charged with murder, according to Italian media. Some 5,000 circumcisions are performed in Italy each year but more than a third are carried out illegally, according to health charity Amsi. Cultural non-profit group Arci said the procedures had taken place at a refugee centre it runs with the local council in Monterondo. ""It is a tragedy that leaves us speechless,"" Arci said in a statement on Facebook, adding that it would take civil action once those responsible for the child's death had been determined by police. The two boys, who have not been named, were born in Italy in 2017 to a Nigerian mother who has five other children in Nigeria. Local media say the mother had asked for the operations in respect for Nigeria's Islamic traditions, despite being Catholic herself. The medical credentials of the doctor are reportedly being questioned by police. Ansa said the man arrested was an American citizen of Libyan origin. ""It is an absurd tragedy,"" said Antonino Lupi, mayor of Monterondo, in an interview with the Corriere Della Sera. Circumcision is currently unavailable in public health institutions in Italy. Having the procedure at a private clinic can cost between â¬2,000 (Â£1,798) and â¬4,000 (Â£3,596), according to Foad Aodi, president of Amsi. As a result, those from poorer backgrounds can ""end up in the hands of unscrupulous and unskilled people, who for â¬50 or â¬20 practise circumcision,"" Mr Aodi said in a statement. By Michelle Roberts, BBC News Online health editor Although it is a relatively simple medical procedure, circumcision is not entirely risk free. Doctors may recommend that a man or boy is circumcised if he has an unusually tight foreskin, known as phimosis, or suffers from recurrent infections of the foreskin and penis, known as balanitis. There is also some evidence that men who are circumcised have a lower risk of contracting HIV from HIV-positive female partners. It is not clear if circumcision reduces the risk of other sexually transmitted infections too, but studies suggest it may lower the chance of catching genital warts caused by a family of viruses called HPV. The main risks of the surgery are bleeding and infection. In the UK, the chance of these occurring is between one in 10 and one in 50,according to the NHS website,external, although that is a figure for older boys and men, not newborns. Circumcision is legal throughout Europe, although the practice is becoming more controversial. A court in Germany passed a local ban in 2012 after the circumcision of a four-year-old Muslim boy led to complications, with the judge saying it ""permanently and irreparably changed"" the body. However, the German government later that year clarified that the procedure is legal provided it is performed by trained practitioners. The following year, the Council of Europe recommended countries take steps to ensure good medical and sanitary practices when performing a circumcision. And in the UK in 2016, a court ruled that a Muslim father could not have his sons circumcised after their mother disagreed.

UK now has anti-drone systems - minister,"Ministers say those who use drones ""for criminal purposes"" can expect ""the most severe sentence"". Detection systems are now able to be deployed throughout the UK to combat the threat of drones, ministers say. It follows three days of disruption at Gatwick airport last week, when drones were sighted near the runway. Security minister Ben Wallace said those who use drones ""either recklessly or for criminal purposes"" could expect ""the most severe sentence"". It comes after the couple arrested and released without charge over the chaos at Gatwick said they felt ""violated"". About 1,000 flights were affected during 36 hours of chaos at Gatwick airport last week. The airport has spent Â£5m since Wednesday on new equipment and technology to prevent copycat attacks. Drone arrest couple 'feel violated' Miscommunication blamed for drone confusion Gatwick drones pair 'no longer suspects' Mr Wallace said: ""The huge proliferation of such devices, coupled with the challenges of deploying military counter measures into a civilian environment, means there are no easy solutions. ""However, I can say that we are able to now deploy detection systems throughout the UK to combat this threat."" Mr Wallace did not specify what systems could be used to address the threat of drones, nor how quickly or on what scale they could be deployed. Australia's civil aviation authorities said on Monday thatdrone-detecting sensors would be installedat airports from next month, saying the Gatwick chaos highlighted the need for the technology. In the UK, Labour hascalled for an independent inquiryinto the disruption, claiming the government ""failed to act"" despite repeated warnings about the risks to aviation from drones. Ministersannounced measuresto protect aircraft in May. From next November, pilots of drones weighing more than 250g will have to register with the Civil Aviation Authority and take an online safety test. However,the government is not expected to respond to a consultation,externalcovering counter-drone technology and enforcement powers - undertaken in the summer - until early next year. The Department for Transport has dismissed claims that legislation has been delayed, and that this contributed to the Gatwick disruption, pointing out that existing laws barred flying drones over airports. How countries counter the drone threat What punishment could a drone operator face? In his statement, Mr Wallace said he was ""confident"" that Sussex Police, the force leading the investigation, ""will bring to justice those responsible for what are serious criminal acts that have caused disruption and misery to thousands of passengers"". ""Those people who chose to use drones either recklessly or for criminal purposes can expect the most severe sentence and jail time when caught,"" he said. Speaking outside their home in Crawley, West Sussex, Paul Gait and Elaine Kirktold Sky News,externaltheir ""privacy and identity"" had been ""completely exposed"" after they were named in the media and their home searched. ""We are deeply distressed, as are our family and friends, and we are currently receiving medical care. ""The way we were initially perceived was disgusting,"" they said. This video can not be played Elaine Kirk and Paul Gait were released without charge The couple, whose names were not revealed by the BBC until their statement, added: ""Those that knew us didn't doubt us for a second."" Mr Gait, 47, and Ms Kirk, 54, said they had been ""totally overwhelmed"" by the support they had received from people around the world. ""We would ask that the press please respect our privacy and leave us to try and get through Christmas as best we can,"" they said. The airport has offered a Â£50,000 reward, through Crimestoppers, and another Â£10,000 has been put up by the charity's chairman Lord Ashcroft to catch the culprits responsible for the drama, which affected some 140,000 passengers.

WW2 mince pies found under hotel floor,"The mince pies were found during the renovation of a hotel that once housed soldiers and sailors A tin of mince pies baked during World War Two has been put on display after being discovered immaculately preserved under the floorboards of a hotel. The festive treats, which were a wartime gift from a mother to her sailor son, were uncovered at the Loch Hotel in Douglas on the Isle of Man. They were found during the hotel's 1998 renovation but later left forgotten in storage at the Manx Museum. The pies have now been placed on display for the first time. It is thought that air-tight conditions under the hotel floor may have helped preserve the treats for almost 80 years. They were addressed to Able Seaman Phil Davis and accompanied by a letter signed ""best, love from mum"". A letter accompanying the pies was sent to Able Seaman Davis at HMS Valkyrie from an address in Birmingham Matthew Richardson, curator of social history for Manx National Heritage, said they were a ""unique"" reflection of the ""human"" stories behind the war. Christmas was ""the right time for them to shine"", he added. Hotels and boarding houses along Douglas promenade were used to house soldiers and sailors during the war. Mr Richardson said the pies may have been concealed under the floorboards to prevent them from being stolen by other soldiers. ""If you're in a shared room with five or six other men you don't know, the only way you could be sure of protecting what was yours was to find a place to hide it,"" he said. An image of the Loch Hotel taken from a holiday brochure thought to be from the late 1960s They emerged when the hotel was developed into apartments. A builder handed the items to the museum, where they were again hidden away in storage. The letter found with the tin indicates Able Seaman Davis was attending a naval radar training school on the island. The letter has news of happenings at the sailor's home in Birmingham, including details of family and friends playing a card game ""for money"", and making up a spare room for guests. It also reads: ""We shall be glad to see you when you do get leave."" Mr Richardson said: ""This tin of mince pies illustrates the point that wars might be international events, but they impact at a very human level. ""Here was a young man, possibly away from home for the first time in his life, training to go to a war zone. ""We can only imagine what his mother was feeling as she posted this tin on to him. ""We can't say for sure why Able Seaman Davis never ate his mince pies. Perhaps he was posted away at short notice and didn't have time to retrieve them.""

"Market slide worsens as Trump savages FedThe president says the Fed is ""the only problem"", as stocks mark their worst ever Christmas Eve.US & Canada","The president reportedly wanted to fire Fed chairman Jerome Powell, but it is unclear whether he has the authority to do so President Donald Trump has lashed out at America's central bank as a stock market whose gains he once took credit for continued a historic plunge. Mr Trump said the Federal Reserve was ""the only problem"" of the US economy. Mr Trump's treasury secretary meanwhile scrambled to calm investors. The Dow Jones fell more than 650 points on Monday, and is on track for its worst December since 1931 during the Great Depression. On Tuesday morning, Japan's Nikkei was down about 5%. The turmoil comes amid a partial government shutdown, US-China trade tensions and reports the president has discussed firing Fed chairman Jerome Powell. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump continually boasted about Wall Street's steep climb during the first year of his presidency, but has sought to deflect blame since markets hit a rough patch in 2018. On Sunday US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin took the unusual step of calling the chief executives of America's six largest banks in a bid to soothe market jitters. On Monday, he called top market regulators and officials from the US central bank to allay fears about the economy. Mr Mnuchin hosted the call with the President's Working Group on Financial Markets to ""discuss co-ordination efforts to assure normal market operations"", according a treasury statement. The board of governors of the US Federal Reserve System, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission are on the working group. US shutdown could stretch into new year Analysis by Samira Hussain, business reporter, BBC News, New York It is rare for a US treasury secretary to make public his discussions with American financial institutions. But that is exactly what Mr Mnuchin did. He was attempting to ease financial markets but Monday's swoon showed he did the opposite. So then President Trump weighed in by tweet and renewed his criticism of the Federal Reserve. That also did not have the desired effect. Instead of the typical Santa Rally, we saw US investors flee stocks for safety. Not exactly the Christmas cheer the White House was hoping for. What does this mean for 2019? A lot will depend on what happens in Washington: government shutdown, simmering trade tensions and the president's tweets. One thing has been made very clear: if the White House wants to calm nervous investors, it's going to need to get much better at its messaging. Monday saw the worst day of Christmas Eve trading ever for US stocks. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped by 653 points, falling below 22,000. The S&P 500 entered so-called ""bear market"" territory. US investors are fretful about a range of factors including slowing economic growth at home and internationally, though US economic data is still strong. Mr Trump's ongoing trade war with China as well as Defence Secretary Jim Mattis's surprise resignation have also unsettled investors.

Acid attack victim to sue police,"Daniel Rotariu was attacked with highly concentrated sulphuric acid as he slept in his bed A man who was blinded when his former partner poured acid over him while he slept is suing the police force he claims could have prevented the attack. Daniel Rotariu was attacked by Katie Leong in Leicester in 2016. Sheis serving a life termafter being found guilty of attempted murder. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) saidLeicestershire Police was warned about her plans. The force said it ""cannot comment at this stage"" on the legal proceedings. Mr Rotariu is seeking Â£12,000 to support his legal bid. This video can not be played Acid attack victim speaks out The 33-year-old was in a medically induced coma for six weeks after Leong poured 96% pure sulphuric acid over him. As well as leaving him blind, the attack left him with severe scars to his arms, head, legs and torso and needing several operations. Leong's trial at Leicester Crown Court in March 2017 heard how she had become fixated with carrying out an acid attack. Katie Leong had ""a fascination with attacking someone using acid"", her trial heard Her ex-partner Mark Cummings, who was on trial alongside her, said he raised concerns to his probation officer about why she wanted to buy the acid. Leong was sentenced to serve a minimum of 17 years, while Mr Cummings was cleared of attempted murder by a jury. Acid attacker must pay victim Â£19,000 Watchdog probe police over acid attack Latest news and stories from the East Midlands An investigation by the IOPC, found police had received reports months before the attack that Leong ""was acquiring acid to carry out a premeditated attack on an unnamed third party"", and that her former partner Mr Cummings had been in contact with her in breach of a restraining order. Officers failed to contact Leong over the allegations, the watchdog said in its report; with two call logs ""closed down inappropriately"". A police constable and a member of police staff were subject to management action over their ""unsatisfactory"" handling of a claim regarding the breach of Mr Cummings's restraining order. Mr Rotariu said he would ""never recover"" from his injuries and needed financial help from the public to continue his legal action against Leicestershire Police.

Spokesman Pete Williams said the busiest time for traffic had passed, but the roads in and around London, the M4 and the M6 were particularly busy. He said traffic levels had been ""pretty steady"" over the past few days. Meanwhile, many rail passengers across the country are facing disruption because of planned engineering work. Network Rail said vital upgrades would be carried out over the festive period. According tothe AA's live traffic reports,external, vehicle accidents and a burst water main caused problems for people trying to leave central London by car. Mr Williams said there had earlier been congestion in the north, around Leeds and Bradford, because of cold weather. He advised travellers to check their oil, coolant level, tyre pressure and tread depth, and to buy some good screen wash before setting off.

Fewer commuters than usual were expected to travel on Christmas Eve - many having booked the day off work. But far more leisure journeys than usual were expected - as many as 2.5 million - with the AA predicting half of all motorists would take to the UK's main roads. The RAC says the number of leisure journeys over the festive season is likely to peak on Boxing Day with an estimated 6.8 million individual trips.

"Thousands evacuated after Sydney tower 'crack'Residents reported a loud ""cracking noise"" in the new building at Sydney Olympic Park.Australia","A loud cracking noise was heard by residents As many as 3,000 people have been evacuated after residents of a newly completed tower block in Australia reported hearing ""cracking noises"". Police confirmed they had found a crack in the 33-storey Opal Tower, in Sydney Olympic Park, following reports of the noise on the 10th floor. Engineers said the high-rise tower has moved up to 2mm, local media reported. A 1km (0.6 mile) evacuation zone, which also affected other buildings, was put in place amid safety fears. An email to residents of a nearby apartment block,externalsaid the evacuation had been ordered because ""there is a potential for the tower to collapse"", according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Specialists were due to enter the 10th floor to inspect the crack and assess whether the building was safe, Greg White, a spokesman for New South Wales Fire And Rescue, told reporters. He said police had been called at about 14:35 local time (03:45 GMT) about a ""loud crack"". The tower has been evacuated until it has been checked ""They attended, identified there was a crack in the building and they called for Fire And Rescue assistance,"" he said. ""We've attended and police and Fire And Rescue evacuated up to 3,000 people from the building and the surrounding areas."" The Opal Tower, which was completed earlier this year, was described by developer Ecove when the design was first unveiled as ""a curvaceous, triangular-shaped building with green walls of living plants embedded into the faÃ§ade, and elevated communal courtyards every five levels"". It boasts 392 flats. An Ecove spokesman said it was aware of the ""concerns"" and had ""notified"" the builder, the Morning Herald said.

Toddler dies in circumcision in ItalyThe two-year old's brother is recovering in hospital after also undergoing the procedure near Rome.Europe,"Circumcision demonstration on a doll. Illegal procedures are a concern in Italy A two-year-old boy has died from blood loss following a failed circumcision at a migrant centre in Italy. The boy's twin brother also underwent the procedure in Rome's north-western suburb of Monterondo and is recovering in hospital. A 66-year-old man has been charged with murder, according to Italian media. Some 5,000 circumcisions are performed in Italy each year but more than a third are carried out illegally, according to health charity Amsi. Cultural non-profit group Arci said the procedures had taken place at a refugee centre it runs with the local council in Monterondo. ""It is a tragedy that leaves us speechless,"" Arci said in a statement on Facebook, adding that it would take civil action once those responsible for the child's death had been determined by police. The two boys, who have not been named, were born in Italy in 2017 to a Nigerian mother who has five other children in Nigeria. Local media say the mother had asked for the operations in respect for Nigeria's Islamic traditions, despite being Catholic herself. The medical credentials of the doctor are reportedly being questioned by police. Ansa said the man arrested was an American citizen of Libyan origin. ""It is an absurd tragedy,"" said Antonino Lupi, mayor of Monterondo, in an interview with the Corriere Della Sera. Circumcision is currently unavailable in public health institutions in Italy. Having the procedure at a private clinic can cost between â¬2,000 (Â£1,798) and â¬4,000 (Â£3,596), according to Foad Aodi, president of Amsi. As a result, those from poorer backgrounds can ""end up in the hands of unscrupulous and unskilled people, who for â¬50 or â¬20 practise circumcision,"" Mr Aodi said in a statement. By Michelle Roberts, BBC News Online health editor Although it is a relatively simple medical procedure, circumcision is not entirely risk free. Doctors may recommend that a man or boy is circumcised if he has an unusually tight foreskin, known as phimosis, or suffers from recurrent infections of the foreskin and penis, known as balanitis. There is also some evidence that men who are circumcised have a lower risk of contracting HIV from HIV-positive female partners. It is not clear if circumcision reduces the risk of other sexually transmitted infections too, but studies suggest it may lower the chance of catching genital warts caused by a family of viruses called HPV. The main risks of the surgery are bleeding and infection. In the UK, the chance of these occurring is between one in 10 and one in 50,according to the NHS website,external, although that is a figure for older boys and men, not newborns. Circumcision is legal throughout Europe, although the practice is becoming more controversial. A court in Germany passed a local ban in 2012 after the circumcision of a four-year-old Muslim boy led to complications, with the judge saying it ""permanently and irreparably changed"" the body. However, the German government later that year clarified that the procedure is legal provided it is performed by trained practitioners. The following year, the Council of Europe recommended countries take steps to ensure good medical and sanitary practices when performing a circumcision. And in the UK in 2016, a court ruled that a Muslim father could not have his sons circumcised after their mother disagreed.

LeBron apologises for 'Jewish money' post,"LeBron James posted the lyric in an Instagram story Basketball star LeBron James has apologised after sharing a lyric about ""Jewish money"" on social media - saying he thought it was a compliment.

US journalist Darren Rovell was among those drawing attention to the post, saying it was ""offensive"". But James said it was not his intent ""to hurt anyone"" with Saturday's post. LeBron James: Racism is hidden but alive ""Apologies, for sure, if I offended anyone,"" he told sports channel ESPN,externalon Sunday. ""That's not why I chose to share that lyric. I always [post lyrics]. That's what I do. I ride in my car, I listen to great music, and that was the byproduct of it. ""So I actually thought it was a compliment, and obviously it wasn't through the lens of a lot of people."" Many of his fans had come out in support of James, who joined the Los Angeles Lakers in July on a four-year deal worth $154m (Â£116m).

Australia plans drone-identifying system,"Drone hotspots such as Sydney Harbour will also get the monitoring equipment Drone ""hot spots"" in Australia are getting sensors to automatically identify the aircraft and their pilots. Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority (Casa) said it would install the equipment at the nation's airports starting next month. The monitors have been planned for some time, but come in the wake of 72 hours of drone-related disruption at the UK's Gatwick airport last week. In 2019, Australia will also start a scheme to register drone owners. The UK is also due to introduce a scheme in November that will require recreational drones weighing  250g (0.55lb) or more to be registered. Almost 140,000 air travellers were delayed last week after reports of drone sightings caused huge delays at Gatwick Airport. UK police are still searching for the culprits, although they have also raised the possibility that witness reports of the aircraft were mistaken. The incident ""highlights"" the need for a drone-spotting capability, Casa spokesman Peter Gibsontold the news agency Agence France-Presse,external. The surveillance system would be able to spot the types of drone being flown, read their serial numbers and work out where the pilot was located, he said. Efforts to identify pilots would be aided by the introduction of the registration scheme for commercial and casual drone owners, he added. ""2019 will be a drone safety crackdown,"" said Mr Gibson. As well as airports and other sensitive locations, the drone-spotting systems will be installed in other places known to be popular with drone owners such as the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Authorities in Australia have expressed worries about the number of drones being flown in restricted areas in recent months. Anyone breaking rules could face fines of up to 10,000 Australian dollars ($7,058; Â£5,600) as well as checks on the safety of their craft. ""In 2019 it could be very expensive doing the wrong thing with your drone,"" said Mr Gibson. Events at Gatwick were discussed by ministers in a Christmas Eve phone conference. It is understood the Cabinet Office ""pushed"" the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office to update their rapid deployment protocol. They also discussed defence systems across the UK's airports.

'No drone' confusion due to miscommunication,"Flights were suspended for more than 36 hours when a drone was first spotted The suggestion there may not have been any drones at Gatwick Airport was a ""miscommunication by police"", a government source has told the BBC. During a conference call between ministers, chaired by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, it was agreed the 67 drone sightings were legitimate. But over the weekend, a senior police officer said it was a ""possibility"" there had never been a drone. About 1,000 flights were affected during the airport's 36 hours of chaos. The airport has spent Â£5m since Wednesday on new equipment and technology to prevent copycat attacks. Sussex Police has insisted it was not ""back to square one"" after releasing an arrested man, 47, and woman, 54, without charge on Sunday. Labour calls for inquiry into Gatwick drones How can a drone cause so much chaos? Australia plans drone-identifying system The hour-long call included David Lidington for the Cabinet Office, the Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Security Minister Ben Wallace, Aviation Minister Baroness Sugg, a defence minister, the airport and police. A government source said the force accepted that there had been ""poor communications"". Det Ch Supt Jason Tingley had cast doubt over possible drone sightings as police had not been able to acquire any footage. Asked about this, he said: ""We are working with human beings saying they have seen something."" He later clarified the force was ""actively investigating"" 67 reports of sightings and there were some ""persons of interest"" but would not reveal if officers were close to making any further arrests. Flights resumed from Gatwick Airport on Friday About 140,000 passengers were affected During the conference call, it is understood the Cabinet Office ""pushed"" the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office to update their rapid deployment protocol. They also discussed defence systems across the UK's airports, after discussions were had with all airport CEOs on Friday. The airport was forced to shut its runway for spells on Wednesday and Friday and for all of Thursday The airport has offered a Â£50,000 reward, through Crimestoppers, and another Â£10,000 has been put up by the charity's chairman Lord Ashcroft to catch the culprits responsible for the drama, which affected some 140,000 passengers. A damaged drone found near the perimeter of the airport near Horley, close to the last reported sighting, is also being examined. A spokesman said: ""We are clear that there were multiple confirmed sightings of drone activity at the airport. ""Therefore we took the necessary actions to ensure the safety of passengers using our airport. Safety will always be our number one priority. ""We continue to support the police with their investigations into this illegal and deliberate act to disrupt the airport's operations."" Authorities regained control over the airfield early on Friday after the Army deployed unidentified military technology. It is believed that the Israeli-developed Drone Dome system, which can jam communications between the drone and its operator, was used. However, experts have said it does not enable the person responsible to be tracked down and captured. John Murray, professor of robotics and autonomous systems at the University of Hull, said it could only ""take the drone out of the sky"".

Drone arrest couple 'feel violated',"This video can not be played Elaine Kirk and Paul Gait were released without charge The couple arrested over the drone chaos at Gatwick Airport have said they feel ""completely violated"". Paul Gait and Elaine Kirk, who were released without charge,told Sky News,externaltheir ""privacy and identity"" had been ""completely exposed"" after being named in the media and their home searched. ""We are deeply distressed, as are our family and friends, and we are currently receiving medical care. ""The way we were initially perceived was disgusting,"" they said. The couple, from Crawley, West Sussex, whose names have not been revealed by the BBC until now, added: ""Those that knew us didn't doubt us for a second."" Speaking outside their home, Mr Gait, 47, and Ms Kirk, 54, said they had been ""totally overwhelmed"" by the support they had received from people around the world. ""We would ask that the press please respect our privacy and leave us to try and get through Christmas as best we can,"" they said. UK now has anti-drone systems - minister Miscommunication blamed for drone confusion Gatwick drones pair 'no longer suspects' Labour calls for inquiry into Gatwick drones Passengers faced three days of disruption last week when about 1,000 flights were affected during 36 hours of chaos when drones were sighted near the runway. The airport has spent Â£5m since Wednesday on new equipment and technology to prevent copycat attacks. Security minister Ben Wallace said the government was ""able to now deploy detection systems throughout the UK"" to combat the threat. ""The huge proliferation of such devices, coupled with the challenges of deploying military counter measures into a civilian environment, means there are no easy solutions,"" he said. ""Those people who chose to use drones either recklessly or for criminal purposes can expect the most severe sentence and jail time when caught,"" he added. The airport was forced to shut its runway for spells on Wednesday and Friday and for all of Thursday The airport has offered a Â£50,000 reward, through Crimestoppers, and another Â£10,000 has been put up by the charity's chairman Lord Ashcroft to catch the culprits responsible for the drama, which affected some 140,000 passengers. Sussex Police said a damaged drone found near the perimeter of the airport near Horley on Saturday morning, close to the last reported sighting, was being forensically examined. The force acknowledged that its suggestion, made on Sunday, that there may never have been a drone at Gatwick was down to ""poor communications"". Earlier, Deputy Chief Constable Jo Shiner stated there were numerous illegal drone sightings at the airport over three days from 19 to 21 December, discounting any doubt over possible sightings. There were more than 200 sightings since the first drone was spotted, with police taking 67 statements, including from fellow officers and airport staff. ""The impact of this criminal and reckless behaviour has been enormous and we are determined to locate those responsible to bring them to justice,"" she said. Gatwick said it had taken the necessary actions to ensure the safety of passengers, and it was clear there were ""multiple confirmed sightings of drone activity"".

Horse found in harness at Pompeii,"The horse was found with remnants of a saddle and a harness with bronze trimmings The remains of a horse still in its harness have been discovered at a villa outside the walls of Pompeii, in what archaeologists are hailing as a find of ""rare importance"". The horse was saddled up and ready to go, possibly to help rescue Pompeians fleeing the AD79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius that buried the town in ashes. It was found with the remains of other horses at the Villa of the Mysteries. The villa belonged to a Roman general or high-ranking military magistrate. Mount Vesuvius buried Pompeii and other nearby towns under millions of tonnes of volcanic debris. Archaeologists at the luxurious Villa of Mysteries (Villa dei Misteri) overlooking the sea have already found wine presses, ovens and extraordinary frescoes. Erotic fresco unearthed in Pompeii Pompeii Art and Architecture Gallery Pompeii guard dog mosaic back on show The latest discovery came during an excavation of a stable at the villa to the north of Pompeii,external, according to Massimo Osanna, the director of Pompeii's archaeological park. The apparently well-groomed horse, along with a saddle and a harness with fragments of wooden and bronze trimmings, was found alongside two other horses. Archaeologists were able to create a cast of the horse The horses had all come to a ""fierce and terrible end"", Mr Osanna said, suffocated by ashes or by the boiling vapours from Vesuvius's ash cloud. The estate was originally dug up early in the 20th Century but much of it was reburied and has since been targeted by looters. ""The whole area will be excavated and returned to the public,"" said Mr Osanna.

Labour calls for inquiry into Gatwick drones,"About 1,000 aircraft were either cancelled or diverted during the disruption Labour has called for an independent inquiry into the disruption caused by the Gatwick Airport drone sightings. Flights were grounded and around 140,000 passengers affected during three days of chaos after drones were spotted close to the runway on Wednesday. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald claimed the government missed chances to prevent the incident. The government said the law already forbids flying drones near airports. A 47-year-old man and 54-year-old woman from Crawleyare being questioned by policeover the drone sightings. The pair were arrested on Friday and police searched a house in the West Sussex town the following day. Local pair quizzed over Gatwick drones How can a drone cause so much chaos? 'Desperately trying to get back' Mr McDonald said: ""The government was repeatedly warned about the risks posed by drones to aviation but failed to act. ""The delay in bringing forward legislation is indicative of this government's failure to concentrate on the day-to-day business in front of them. They have taken their eye off the ball. ""The scale of disruption is unacceptable and it demands that we find out how this was allowed to happen, which is why Labour are calling for an independent inquiry."" Thousands of people were stranded at the airport as police hunted for those flying the drones His comments come aftera report in the Times claimed,externalTransport Secretary Chris Grayling had delayed plans for further legislation regulating drone use. But a spokesman for the Department for Transport called the claims ""a combination of nonsense and gross misrepresentation"". He added: ""The drones at Gatwick have been flown illegally. The government changed the law this year to make it illegal to fly drones within 1,000 meters of an airport or above 400 feet. The law couldn't be any more clear.""

Evans bids emotional farewell to Radio 2,"This video can not be played Is Chris Evans sure he wants to leave BBC Radio 2? Chris Evans paid an emotional tribute to his wife as he broadcast his final BBC Radio 2 show. The DJ, who has hosted breakfast for nine years, said: ""I'd like to thank my wife Natasha, my gravity, my compass, my guiding light. ""I crave the uncertainty, but you can only do that against a backdrop of certainty and security."" He added it was a ""sad day"", but also ""an exciting day for everyone"" as he prepared to move to Virgin Radio. ""Thank you to the BBC for supporting me and entrusting me with one of their precious microphones for the last 13 years, for allowing me to grow for every minute of every day I've been on the air,"" he said. Chris Evans: Radio 2 host's tearful goodbye speech in full Through tears, he thanked a number of people, including his agent Michael and his station bosses past and present - Lesley Douglas, Bob Shennan and Lewis Carnie. Zoe Ball will take over from Evans in January, becoming the first woman to host the coveted Radio 2 breakfast slot. It's one of several schedule changes on the station, with Sara Cox set to take over Drivetime from Simon Mayo, Jo Whiley moving back to evenings and a new late night show for Trevor Nelson. This video can not be played DJ Chris Evans pays an emotional tribute to his wife Natasha. As he opened the show on Monday morning, Evans told his listeners not to ""shed too many tears"" during his final programme. Evans, who has spent 13 years with Radio 2, said: ""To read a book, you have to keep turning the pages, but to write a book in the first place you have to do exactly the same. ""The sight of a blank page strikes the fear of god into some, but for others there's nothing more exciting. ""So with your blessing, that's precisely what I'm going to do."" On Twitter, fellow broadcasters paid tribute to Evans - including Ball, BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker and Reverend Kate Bottley, the former Gogglebox star who presented on the Pause For Thought segment of Evans's show.

There were several memorable moments on his final breakfast show, with listeners getting in touch to tell the DJ how many life milestones they had achieved throughout his years as host. This included George, who - aged seven - voiced the ""How Do You Like Your Eggs In The Morning?"" jingle that often features on the show. George, now aged 15, called in live to the show recreate the ""I like mine with a kiss"" line (now with a much deeper voice). Chris Evans: A life in broadcasting Evans says yes to Strictly Come Dancing 2019 Nicole Kidman also phoned in from Australia to say she was ""so sad"" that Chris was leaving Radio 2. Evans was full of praise for his production staff over the years, and said his team had created a book of their favourite moments from his tenure. Looking through the book, he highlighted ""Glastonbury in the mud, the time we recorded from my house, the Pudsey cup, the Globe Theatre, the anniversary of the Normandy landings, Prince Harry, then the big anniversary of the Dambusters at Biggin Hill."" Zoe Ball will take over from Chris Evans in January Evans's wife - Natasha Shishmanian - also became emotional when he asked her to read out a message he had written from the perspective of their children. She said: ""Today's gobsmackers are chosen by Noah and Eli Evans for their mum Tash."" She began to cry, adding: ""Oh, for goodness sake. ""They say that while everybody is talking about our dad we wanted to pick two songs for mum. One is because she loves nothing more than to dance in the sunshine with a grapefruit G and T, laughing uncontrollably with the people she loves. The other is her mascara moment."" Evans then went on to play the two songs dedicated to her - Michael Jackson's Love Never Felt So Good [the mascara moment song] and America by Razorlight. As he left Radio 2 after the show, the DJ told the media: ""I feel sad and very happy and very excited. It's really strange."" Radio 2's breakfast show is Europe's most popular radio programme, although Evans' ratings fell to a six-year low of 8.9 million this summer. The presenter took over from Terry Wogan in 2010 and took listener figures to almost 10 million at their peak. Nicole Kidman, who called in live from Australia, was among the guests on Evans's final show Speaking onBBC One's The One Showlast week, he said he was ""excited"" about his move, but admitted it was ""a shame"" to be doing his last show at Radio 2. He said he started thinking about leaving after somebody pointed out how long he had been at the station. ""It is a shame, but Zoe is going to be on in January. Zoe's brilliant and I took over from Terry,"" he said. ""Terry was amazing, nobody could do that show like him so we had to do it a different way and Zoe can continue that. ""You're a steward of a show like this. The show isn't yours, you're the stewards of it and somebody else will come along, and I think that's a lovely thing."" It's not the end of his relationship with the BBC, though, because he also revealed he has said yes to taking part in Strictly Come Dancing next year. Rick Astley, George Ezra, Richard Ashcroft, Stacey Dooley, Olly Murs and Paloma Faithwere among his guestsfor his last full week. Evans will host the Virgin breakfast show from 21 January. His new programme is being billed as the first commercial radio breakfast show without conventional advert breaks. Instead, it will be sponsored by Sky, and Evans will promote Sky's programmes during his slot. Evans was paid Â£1.66m for hosting the Radio 2 breakfast show in 2017-18, and there have been reports that he will pocket Â£2m a year from Virgin. But he has denied his move was about the money. In September, BBC director general Tony Hallsaid the publication of star salaries was a factorin Evans and former Radio 4 presenter Eddie Mair choosing to leave the corporation.

Indonesia tsunami death toll rises,"This video can not be played Yuni was forced to run from the water The death toll following the tsunami caused by the Anak Krakatau volcano in Indonesia has risen to at least 429, the disaster mitigation agency says. On Saturday giant waves crashed into coastal towns on the islands of Sumatra and Java. It is thought that volcanic activity set off undersea landslides which in turn generated the killer waves. About 150 people are still missing, while more than 16,000 have been displaced, the agency says. Coastal residents near the volcano have been warned to keep away from beaches amid fears it could trigger a new tsunami. Anak Krakatau erupted again on Sunday, spewing ash and smoke. Video shot from a charter plane captured the magnitude of the volcanic event in the Sunda Strait, between Sumatra and Java. A volcanologist explains eruption images The rock band swept away by deadly waves How volcanoes can trigger tsunamis Disaster as it happened Rescue efforts are being hampered by blocked roads but heavy lifting equipment is being transported to badly hit areas to help search for victims. On Monday, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency told a news conference that another tsunami was a possibility because of the continued volcanic eruptions of Anak Krakatau. ""Recommendations from [the] Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysical Agency are that people should not carry out activities on the beach and stay away from the coast for a while,"" said spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho. A satellite image of Anak Krakatau erupting in August Anak Krakatau, which emerged in 1927 from the caldera that was formed during the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, has seen increased activity in recent months with people asked to avoid the area around its crater. On Monday Mr Sutopo put out a series of tweets explaining why there was no early warning for this tsunami. He said that Indonesia's early warning system is set up to monitor earthquakes but not undersea landslides and volcanic eruptions, which can also generate deadly waves. But, he added, with 13% of the world's volcanoes in Indonesia alone, it was crucial for the country to develop such system. He confirmed there was no tsunami advance warning system on the night of the disaster, adding that because of lack of funds, vandalism to the buoys and technical faults there had been no operational tsunami warning system since 2012. Geologist RaphaÃ«l Paris,whose 2012 study predicted the collapse of a flank of Anak Krakatau,externaland a subsequent tsunami, said: ""There is a big uncertainty on the stability of the volcanic cone now, and the probability for future collapses and tsunamis is perhaps non-negligible."" The tsunami struck at 21:30 local time (14:30 GMT) during a local holiday, with few of the warning signals that might have come had it been generated by an earthquake. The child who came back from the dead after tsunami How reliable are tsunami warning systems? Survivors' stories Seawater did not recede as it would with an earthquake tsunami. Experts say that even if there had been warning buoys near the volcano, there would have been minimal alert time. Band Seventeen were performing on stage when the tsunami hit The waves destroyed hundreds of buildings, sweeping away cars and uprooting trees in several popular tourist destinations, including the Tanjung Lesung beach resort, west Java. Footage shared on social media showed a large wave crashing into a tent in the resort, in which popular Indonesian rock band Seventeen were performing. Members of the band were seen being swept away as the wave destroyed the stage. By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent Everyone in the region will have been aware of Anak Krakatau, the volcano that emerged in the sea channel just less than 100 years ago. But its rumblings and eruptions have been described by local experts as relatively low-scale and semi-continuous. In other words, it's been part of the background. And yet it is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate big waves. The mechanism, as ever, is the displacement of a large volume of water. The first satellite imagery returned after the event on Saturday points strongly to a collapse in the west-southwest flank of the volcano. This would have sent millions of tonnes of rocky debris into the sea, pushing out waves in all directions. Read more from Jonathan Some residents in the Pandeglang region ran to a local mosque after the tsunami hit Indonesia is prone to tsunamis because it lies on the Ring of Fire - the line of frequent earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that circles virtually the entire Pacific Rim. In September, more than 2,000 people died when a powerful earthquake struck just off the central Indonesian island of Sulawesi, setting off a tsunami that engulfed the coastal city of Palu. A town smashed to pulp in minutes Indian Ocean tsunami: Then and now On 26 December 2004, a series of huge waves triggered by a powerful earthquake in the Indian Ocean killed about 228,000 people in 13 countries, mostly in Indonesia. However, tsunamis caused by volcanic activity like this are less frequent. In August 1883, Krakatoa underwent one of the most violent volcanic eruptions in recorded history: Massive tsunamis with waves of up to 41m killed more than 30,000 people Thousands more were killed by hot ash The eruptions were equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the nuclear yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945 The eruptions were heard thousands of kilometres away World temperatures dropped by more than 1C the following year The volcanic island virtually disappeared Are you in the affected area?

Huawei's kit removed from police network,"The 4G-based Emergency Services Network should be less costly to run than the existing system used by police BT has confirmed that equipment made by Huawei is being removed from the heart of a communication system being developed for the UK's police forces and other emergency services. It follows astatement from BT earlier this month that it was swapping out the Chinese firm's kitfrom the ""core"" of its 3G and 4G mobile networks. The Sunday Telegraphwas first to report the latest development,external. It said the move could extend work on the late-running Â£2.3bn project. BT is covering the cost of the switch. It does not believe the changeover will lead to a further delay. The Emergency Services Network (ESN) was originally due to be completed by the end of 2019. At that point it was meant to replace an existing Motorola-owned radio system called Airwave, which is used by the police, fire and rescue, and ambulance services. The ESN is intendedto give its users ""secure"" priority access to EE's 4G network,external, which is being extended via additional radio frequencies in rural areas and new mast sites. It should be cheaper to run than Airwave while also providing superior voice and data capabilities. But the effort is overrunning, and in September theHome Office announced that it would pay for use of Airwave until the end of 2022,externalwith scope for a further extension if required. EE won the contract to roll out the ESN in 2015, a year before the network provider was acquired by BT. Since then, it has become subject to a BT policy that Huawei's kit should not be used at the core of its mobile networks to push customers' data about. It has been claimed that Beijing could make Huawei disrupt services that use its kit in the event of an international dispute Instead, BT limits the equipment to periphery parts such as phone mast antennas. ""We have ongoing plans to swap to a new core network vendor for ESN, in line with BT's network architecture principles established in 2006,"" a spokesman for EE told the BBC. ""This will be managed with no disruption to the ESN service."" He added that it was still EE's intention to offer ""full capability"" of the system by 2020. BT has not been explicit about the reasons behind its policy. But security concerns have been raised about the use of Huawei's network infrastructure products, with the chief of MI6Alex Younger recently saying Britain needed to decide how comfortable it was""with Chinese ownership of these technologies"".

Rock band swept away by tsunami,"(From L-R) Andi, Riefian, Bani and Herman were performing as the tsunami struck One of the most shocking and heart-rending stories to emerge from the Indonesian tsunami is that of rock band Seventeen, who were performing in a marquee on the beach when waves came crashing through and swept them away. If a lot of the soul-searching and commentary in Indonesia right now is about how there was absolutely no warning for the killer waves, this is the starkest illustration of that. The footage of the event is startling for how quickly a scene of about 200 people gathered around tables listening rapt to the band, became one of surging waves as the singing turned into screams. Three members of the band - the bassist, road manager, guitarist - and a crew member have been killed. The band's drummer remains missing. The lead vocalist of the band is the only known survivor from the band so far and has been posting heartfelt updates on his Instagram account. ""We lost Bani [bassist] and Oki Wijaya [road manager],"" said Riefian Fajarsyah in an Instagram video as he held back tears. ""Please pray that my wife Dylan and Herman [guitarist], Andi [drummer] and Ujang [crew] will be found soon."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Fears of new tsunami as volcano seethes Others also posted about the ordeal with one crew member, named as Zack, reportedly describing his struggle underwater on Instagram Stories, saying he survived by clinging onto the stage that had been washed out by the wave. Seventeen were well known on the Indonesian rock scene with several popular songs. Tributes have been pouring for the band who are originally from Yogyakarta, including from other Indonesian music celebrities such as Tantri, vocalist of the band Kotak. The band had been performing on Tanjung Lesung beach in West Java on Saturday night. They were hired by state utility firm Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) to perform for 200 company employees and their loved ones for an end-of-year party. According to Mr Fajarsyah they were two songs into the set when the waves came. Some 29 PLN employees and their relatives were killed and 13 remain missing, PLN said in a news conference. ""The water washed away the stage which was located very close to the sea,"" the band said in a statement to news agency Reuters. How volcanoes can trigger tsunamis How reliable are tsunami warning systems? At least 281 people are dead and 1,106 injured after coastal towns on the islands of Sumatra and Java were hit by the tsunami on Saturday night. It is believed that undersea landslides from the Anak Krakatau volcano had triggered the tsunami. Anak Krakatau erupted again on Sunday - and there are fears that it could trigger a new tsunami.

How volcanoes trigger tsunamis,"Europe's Sentinel-1 satellite shows the western side of the volcano changed shape Nobody had any clue. There was certainly no warning. It's part of the picture that now suggests a sudden failure in the west-southwest flank of the Anak Krakatau volcano was a significant cause of Saturday's devastating tsunami in the Sunda Strait. Of course everyone in the region will have been aware of Anak Krakatau, the volcano that emerged in the sea channel just less than 100 years ago. But its rumblings and eruptions have been described by local experts as relatively low-scale and semi-continuous. In other words, it's been part of the background. And yet it is well known that volcanoes have the capacity to generate big waves. The mechanism as ever is the displacement of a large volume of water. The first satellite imagery returned after the event on Saturday points strongly to a collapse in a 64 hectare segment of the west-southwest flank of the volcano during an eruption. This would have sent millions of tonnes of rocky debris into the sea, pushing out waves in all directions. Indonesia 'volcano tsunami' kills hundreds Follow the latest updates Anak Krakatau has been rumbling for years Prof Andy Hooper from Leeds University, UK, is a specialist in the study of volcanoes from orbit. He had little doubt in the interpretation when examining the pictures from Europe's Sentinel-1 radar spacecraft. ""As well as an increase in the size of the crater, there are new dark features on the west side indicating steep-sided scarps in shadow, presumably due to collapse; as well as changes in the coastline.""Â The comparison between Saturday's imagery and Sentinel pictures acquired before the tsunami are telling. But the precise anatomy of this event - what happened above the sea surface and below - will not be known until teams can get into the area of the volcano to do a proper survey, and at the moment that is too dangerous. Further collapse could kick off more tsunamis. Scientists have had concerns for some time about Anak Krakatau, the edifice that has grown in place of the infamous Krakatau mountain that blew itself apart on the same spot in 1883. One group even modelled what would happen in a collapse of the southwest flank,external- the side of today's volcano considered to be the most unstable. Waves that were tens of metres high would hit the nearby islands of Sertung, Panjang and Rakata in less than a minute, the team found. As these waves spread out across the Sunda Strait, they would dissipate, though, coming ashore at one to three metres in height. The projected scenario is uncanny, particularly in the timing of the inundation. Tide gauges in the Sunda Strait recorded high water around half an hour after the onset of Anak Krakatau's latest eruptive activity, at roughly 21:00 local time (14:00 GMT) on Saturday evening. RaphaÃ«l Paris, one of the authors of the study, issued a statement through the European Geosciences Union. He said: ""The volume of collapse simulated is larger than what occurred Saturday (fortunately) and our scenario can thus be considered as a worst-case scenario. ""However, there is a big uncertainty on the stability of the volcanic cone now and the probability for future collapses and tsunamis is perhaps non negligible."" The tsunami wiped out buildings in Carita The area will inevitably become the subject of intense scrutiny in the weeks ahead. Landslide- or rockfall-driven tsunamis can be very big indeed. In the geological record, they have been responsible for gargantuan events. Just recently in Greenland in 2017, a 100m (330ft) wave was produced by a rockslide entering a fjord in the west of the country; and there is still some suspicion that September's damaging tsunami that affected Sulawesi Island in Indonesia was, in part at least, strengthened by the mass movement of sediment, either entering the water from shore or slipping down underwater slopes in Palu Bay. One of the most distressing things on occasions like this is to see video of people going about their lives completely unaware of what is about to hit them. If there had been a major earthquake tremor associated with the eruption on Anak Krakatau, this might have been enough to prompt many locals to take evasive action. But although there was seismicity reported by sensitive instruments, it was not large enough to register with people and change their behaviour. And people really have to rely on themselves for evacuation in cases like this because the distance from the source of the tsunami is so short. ""Tsunami warning buoys are positioned to warn of tsunamis originated by earthquakes at underwater tectonic plate boundaries. Even if there had been such a buoy right next to Anak Krakatau, this is so close to the affected shorelines that warning times would have been minimal given the high speeds at which tsunami waves travel,"" observed Prof Dave Rothery from the UK's Open University. What an event like this one (and the one at Palu City which also caught the population unawares) teaches us is that there needs to be far more investigation into the hazards that exist away from the more expected dangers in the region. Relatives are desperate to find their loved ones alive Enormous research effort has gone into understanding what are called subduction earthquakes and tsunamis, such as the 2004 disaster which originated on the Sunda Trench, where one tectonic plate dives under another. The science now needs to encompass more of the wider threats in the region. This recognition was voiced strongly at this month's American Geophysical Union Meeting - the world's largest annual gathering of Earth scientists. ""Focus is always where the light is,"" Prof Hermann Fritz, from the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, told the AGU conference. ""The focus has been on Sumatra and Java - on the big subduction trenches. The warning centres have also been focussing on that - because we've had big events such as Japan [2011], Chile in 2010 and Sumatra in 2004. These are all classic subduction zone events, so everything has been geared towards that - the science from the scientists and also the warnings from warning centres.""

RBS applies for German banking licenceIt will allow the bank to continue operating freely across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit.Business,"Royal Bank of Scotland has applied for a German banking licence to help it retain clients in the European Union in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The move applies to all its subsidiaries, but would only affect NatWest, which trades across the bloc. RBS, which already has a Dutch licence, said it would allow it to continue operating freely across the EU. The state-owned bank is the latest financial services company to set up an EU hub in response to Brexit. Bank urges Brexit 'contingency plans' Brexit prompts Credit Suisse to move jobs Lloyds Banking Group is to set up three subsidiaries in Berlin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg, while Barclays is expanding its Dublin office. Under the plan, RBS will upgrade its current branch in Frankfurt with a new licensed unit. It will be responsible for processing and settling euro-denominated payments and offering loans to large German companies. It would also allow RBS to maintain its ties to Germany's central bank and continue benefiting from passporting rights that give financial services firms cross-border access to EU clients. No jobs are expected to be moved through the plan, but 12 positions will be created in Frankfurt. Some 37 UK based financial institutions have applied to the European Central Bank for new licences, or to extend existing ones, ahead of Brexit. Of these, 30 have chosen Frankfurt as their European base, with about â¬800bn (Â£711bn) of assets expected to be moved to the city before Britain quits the bloc on 29 March 2019. Earlier in December, RBS announced it is to shift Â£13bn worth of business to the Netherlands in the event of a no-deal Brexit.

Astronaut: Human mission to Mars 'stupid',"Bill Anders on Apollo 8 in December 1968 One of the first men to orbit the Moon has toldBBC Radio 5 Livethat it's ""stupid"" to plan human missions to Mars. Bill Anders, lunar module pilot of Apollo 8, the first human spaceflight to leave Earth's orbit, said sending crews to Mars was ""almost ridiculous"". Nasa is currently planning new human missions to the Moon. It wants to learn the skills and develop the technology to enable a future human landing on Mars. Bill Anders today. He says Nasa shouldn't be aiming to send manned missions to Mars Anders, 85, said he's a ""big supporter"" of the ""remarkable"" unmanned programmes, ""mainly because they're much cheaper"". But he says the public support simply isn't there to fund vastly more expensive human missions. ""What's the imperative? What's pushing us to go to Mars?"" he said, adding ""I don't think the public is that interested"". Meanwhile, robotic probes are still exploring Mars.Last month, the InSight lander, which will sample the planet's interior, successfully touched down at Elysium Planitia. In a statement, Nasa said it was ""leading a sustainable return to the Moon, which will help prepare us to send astronauts to Mars"". ""That also includes commercial and international partners to expand human presence in space and bring back new knowledge and opportunities."" An artist's rendering of the Mars Ice Home concept. In December 1968, Anders, along with crewmates Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida atop a Saturn V, before completing 10 orbits around the Moon. The crew of Apollo 8 spent 20 hours in orbit, before returning to Earth. They splashed down in the Pacific on 27 December, landing just 5,000 yards (4,500 metres) from their target point. They were picked up by the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown. It was the furthest humans had ever been from their home planet at that point - and a vital stepping stone on the road to Apollo 11's historic moon landing just seven months later. But the former astronaut is scathing about how Nasa has evolved since the heady days of President John F Kennedy's pledge to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s. The famous Earthrise image taken from Apollo 8 ""Nasa couldn't get to the Moon today. They're so ossified... Nasa has turned into a jobs programme... many of the centres are mainly interested in keeping busy and you don't see the public support other than they get the workers their pay and their congressmen get re-elected."" Anders is also critical of the decision to focus on near-Earth orbit exploration after the completion of the Apollo programme in the 1970s. ""I think the space shuttle was a serious error. It hardly did anything except have an exciting launch, but it never lived up to its promise,"" he said. ""The space station is only there because you had a shuttle, and vice-versa. Nasa really mismanaged the manned programme since the late lunar landings."" It's a view that might seem surprising from a proud patriot and servant of the US military, who still remembers his own mission to space with great fondness. It's also a view that Anders accepts doesn't sit too well with some in the space community. ""I think Nasa's lucky to have what they've got - which is still hard, in my mind, to justify. I'm not a very popular guy at Nasa for saying that, but that's what I think,"" he explained. The Apollo 8 astronauts prepare for launch His former crewmate, Frank Borman, who commanded the Apollo 8 mission and also spent two weeks in Earth orbit during the Gemini programme, is slightly more enthusiastic. ""I'm not as critical of Nasa as Bill is,"" he told 5 Live. ""I firmly believe that we need robust exploration of our Solar System and I think man is part of that."" But asked about the the plans of Space X founder Elon Musk and Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - who have both talked of launching private missions to Mars, Borman is less complimentary. ""I do think there's a lot of hype about Mars that is nonsense. Musk and Bezos, they're talking about putting colonies on Mars, that's nonsense."" Reflecting on their own historic mission to the Moon, Borman described Apollo 8 as a ""great endeavour"" and agreed that it had won the space race. Anders said he felt that the lasting legacy of the mission would be ""Earthrise"" a photo taken by the crew showing humanity's home planet hanging in the blackness of space above the lunar horizon. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM, their crewmate Jim Lovell also reflected on the Earthrise moment: ""When I looked at the Earth itself... I started to wonder why I was here, what's my purpose hereâ¦ it sort of dawned me,"" he said. ""And my perspective is that God has given mankind a stage on which to perform. How the play turns out, is up to us."" Frank Borman and Bill Anders were speaking toBBC Radio 5 Liveas part of a special documentary on the 50th anniversary of their historic lunar mission. Apollo 8: Christmas On the Far Side of the Moon will be broadcast on 5 Live on 24 December 2018 at 20:00 GMT.

"Horse found in harness at PompeiiThe remains of a horse are revealed in what archaeologists say is a find of ""rare importance"".","The horse was found with remnants of a saddle and a harness with bronze trimmings The remains of a horse still in its harness have been discovered at a villa outside the walls of Pompeii, in what archaeologists are hailing as a find of ""rare importance"". The horse was saddled up and ready to go, possibly to help rescue Pompeians fleeing the AD79 eruption of Mount Vesuvius that buried the town in ashes. It was found with the remains of other horses at the Villa of the Mysteries. The villa belonged to a Roman general or high-ranking military magistrate. Mount Vesuvius buried Pompeii and other nearby towns under millions of tonnes of volcanic debris. Archaeologists at the luxurious Villa of Mysteries (Villa dei Misteri) overlooking the sea have already found wine presses, ovens and extraordinary frescoes. Erotic fresco unearthed in Pompeii Pompeii Art and Architecture Gallery Pompeii guard dog mosaic back on show The latest discovery came during an excavation of a stable at the villa to the north of Pompeii,external, according to Massimo Osanna, the director of Pompeii's archaeological park. The apparently well-groomed horse, along with a saddle and a harness with fragments of wooden and bronze trimmings, was found alongside two other horses. Archaeologists were able to create a cast of the horse The horses had all come to a ""fierce and terrible end"", Mr Osanna said, suffocated by ashes or by the boiling vapours from Vesuvius's ash cloud. The estate was originally dug up early in the 20th Century but much of it was reburied and has since been targeted by looters. ""The whole area will be excavated and returned to the public,"" said Mr Osanna.

Thousands evacuated after tower 'crack',"A loud cracking noise was heard by residents As many as 3,000 people have been evacuated after residents of a newly completed tower block in Australia reported hearing ""cracking noises"". Police confirmed they had found a crack in the 33-storey Opal Tower, in Sydney Olympic Park, following reports of the noise on the 10th floor. Engineers said the high-rise tower has moved up to 2mm, local media reported. A 1km (0.6 mile) evacuation zone, which also affected other buildings, was put in place amid safety fears. An email to residents of a nearby apartment block,externalsaid the evacuation had been ordered because ""there is a potential for the tower to collapse"", according to the Sydney Morning Herald. Specialists were due to enter the 10th floor to inspect the crack and assess whether the building was safe, Greg White, a spokesman for New South Wales Fire And Rescue, told reporters. He said police had been called at about 14:35 local time (03:45 GMT) about a ""loud crack"". The tower has been evacuated until it has been checked ""They attended, identified there was a crack in the building and they called for Fire And Rescue assistance,"" he said. ""We've attended and police and Fire And Rescue evacuated up to 3,000 people from the building and the surrounding areas."" The Opal Tower, which was completed earlier this year, was described by developer Ecove when the design was first unveiled as ""a curvaceous, triangular-shaped building with green walls of living plants embedded into the faÃ§ade, and elevated communal courtyards every five levels"". It boasts 392 flats. An Ecove spokesman said it was aware of the ""concerns"" and had ""notified"" the builder, the Morning Herald said.

Goodwill theme to Queen's Christmas address,"This video can not be played The Queen's Christmas message The Christian message of ""peace on earth and goodwill to all"" is ""needed as much as ever"", the Queen has said in her Christmas Day broadcast. She said the message is ""never out of date"" and can be ""heeded by everyone"". The Queen also joked that family events during a ""busy year"", including weddings and births, had kept ""a grandmother well occupied"". The monarch, 92, highlighted the importance of people with opposing views treating each other with respect. It comes as Parliament remains divided over the PM's Brexit deal, as the UK prepares to leave the EU in March. However, as head of state, the Queen is publicly neutral on political matters. Royal Family attend Christmas service In the broadcast, recorded in Buckingham Palace's white drawing room, the Queen referred to 2018 being a ""year of centenaries"" , recalling how her father served in the Royal Navy during World War One and ""like others, he lost friends in the war"". ""At Christmas, we become keenly aware of loved ones who have died, whatever the circumstances,"" she added. The photograph featured in the Queen's Christmas message The message, which was recorded on 12 December, includes highlights of 2018, from the Commonwealth Games and England reaching the World Cup semi-finals to the weddings of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank, and the 70th birthday of the Prince of Wales. And she looks ahead to the birth of first child of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex next spring. What's a royal Christmas like? Royal couples snapshot 'like lottery win' Prince Charles: 70 years in 70 pictures The Queen added: ""Some cultures believe a long life brings wisdom. I'd like to think so. ""Perhaps part of that wisdom is to recognise some of life's baffling paradoxes, such as the way human beings have a huge propensity for good, and yet a capacity for evil."" She went on to talk about the summit of Commonwealth leaders at Windsor in April, saying the Commonwealth's ""strength lies in the bonds of affection it promotes, and a common desire to live in a better, more peaceful world. ""Even with the most deeply held differences, treating the other person with respect and as a fellow human being is always a good first step towards greater understanding."" She emphasised her own strong Christian beliefs in the broadcast. She said: ""Through the many changes I have seen over the years, faith, family and friendship have been not only a constant for me but a source of personal comfort and reassurance."" The Queen attended the Royal Family's traditional Christmas Day service at Sandringham By BBC royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell Were the Queen's words in her Christmas broadcast an oblique, coded encouragement to the different sides in the Brexit debate to treat each other with greater respect? It really isn't clear. When she talked about ""deeply held differences"" she was actually talking about the unifying power of the Commonwealth. When she referred to the need for ""peace and goodwill"" she was referring to the story of the birth of Jesus. She never mentioned the word ""Brexit"" at all. It wouldn't have been difficult to have fashioned a speech which referred to the intense political debate in the UK and which urged people to keep in mind that there is ""much more that unites us than those things that divide us"". But Elizabeth II is an extremely cautious monarch, wary of saying anything which might be deemed politically contentious. It is a principle which has been exercised with some skill and which has served her throughout her long reign. Some might say that this was one moment when Britain's head of state might have used her immense authority to try to calm the Brexit debate and reassure the country that we can cope, whatever the outcome. She and her advisers chose not to be explicit. But notwithstanding the lack of clarity in the speech itself, it is clear that the Palace - by highlighting the passages about goodwill and treating each other with respect - is hoping that the wider world will interpret the broadcast as an attempt by the monarch to soothe the whole Brexit debate. The Queen wore an Angela Kelly ivory silk cocktail dress, with a gold Scarab brooch, with ruby and diamond embellishments, for the broadcast produced this year by Sky News. The brooch was a 1966 gift from the Duke of Edinburgh. She was sitting beside a framed black and white photograph of herself, Prince Philip and a baby Prince Charles, taken in 1948.

Spokesman Pete Williams said the busiest time for traffic had passed, but the roads in and around London, the M4 and the M6 were particularly busy. He said traffic levels had been ""pretty steady"" over the past few days. Meanwhile, many rail passengers across the country are facing disruption because of planned engineering work. Network Rail said vital upgrades would be carried out over the festive period.

'No drone' police comment 'miscommunicated',"Flights were suspended for more than 36 hours when a drone was first spotted The suggestion there may not have been any drones at Gatwick Airport was a ""miscommunication by police"", a government source has told the BBC. During a conference call between ministers, chaired by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, it was agreed the 67 drone sightings were legitimate. But over the weekend, a senior police officer said it was a ""possibility"" there had never been a drone. About 1,000 flights were affected during the airport's 36 hours of chaos. The airport has spent Â£5m since Wednesday on new equipment and technology to prevent copycat attacks. Sussex Police has insisted it was not ""back to square one"" after releasing an arrested man, 47, and woman, 54, without charge on Sunday. Labour calls for inquiry into Gatwick drones How can a drone cause so much chaos? Australia plans drone-identifying system The hour-long call included David Lidington for the Cabinet Office, the Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Security Minister Ben Wallace, Aviation Minister Baroness Sugg, a defence minister, the airport and police. A government source said the force accepted that there had been ""poor communications"". Det Ch Supt Jason Tingley had cast doubt over possible drone sightings as police had not been able to acquire any footage. Asked about this, he said: ""We are working with human beings saying they have seen something."" He later clarified the force was ""actively investigating"" 67 reports of sightings and there were some ""persons of interest"" but would not reveal if officers were close to making any further arrests. Flights resumed from Gatwick Airport on Friday About 140,000 passengers were affected During the conference call, it is understood the Cabinet Office ""pushed"" the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office to update their rapid deployment protocol. They also discussed defence systems across the UK's airports, after discussions were had with all airport CEOs on Friday. The airport was forced to shut its runway for spells on Wednesday and Friday and for all of Thursday The airport has offered a Â£50,000 reward, through Crimestoppers, and another Â£10,000 has been put up by the charity's chairman Lord Ashcroft to catch the culprits responsible for the drama, which affected some 140,000 passengers. A damaged drone found near the perimeter of the airport near Horley, close to the last reported sighting, is also being examined. A spokesman said: ""We are clear that there were multiple confirmed sightings of drone activity at the airport. ""Therefore we took the necessary actions to ensure the safety of passengers using our airport. Safety will always be our number one priority. ""We continue to support the police with their investigations into this illegal and deliberate act to disrupt the airport's operations."" Authorities regained control over the airfield early on Friday after the Army deployed unidentified military technology. It is believed that the Israeli-developed Drone Dome system, which can jam communications between the drone and its operator, was used. However, experts have said it does not enable the person responsible to be tracked down and captured. John Murray, professor of robotics and autonomous systems at the University of Hull, said it could only ""take the drone out of the sky"".

US moves to reassure jumpy investors,"Mr Mnuchin tweeted out details of his conversations, saying that the banks had ""ample liquidity"" US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has made calls to the heads of the country's six largest banks, in an unusual move aimed at reassuring investors after big falls in US stocks. Last week, US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade, as an interest rate rise and US-China trade tensions rattled markets. Mr Mnuchin said banks confirmed they had ""ample liquidity"" for operations. It also comes amid a partial government shutdown over spending plans. ""The [bank's chief executives] confirmed that they have ample liquidity available for lending to consumer, business markets, and all other market operations,"" the Treasury said in a statement attached to a tweet from Mr Mnuchin. ""[Mr Mnuchin] also confirmed that they have not experienced any clearance or margin issues, and that the markets continue to function properly,"" the Treasury's statement said. The BBC Today programme's business presenter, Dominic O'Connell, said the statement was ""very odd"" and could ""spook markets, not reassure them"". ""People are wondering whether this is really a role for the US Treasury secretary,"" he said. Analysts also warned the unexpected statement could make investors nervous. ""More than anything else right now, Washington and politics are absolutely driving investor sentiment and market direction and that can turn on a dime,"" said Oliver Pursche, a board member at Bruderman Asset Management. Mr Mnuchin also tried to dismiss reports that President Donald Trump had discussed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, after the US central bank raised interest rates last week. The US Treasury secretary tweeted that he had spoken to the president, who insisted he ""never suggested firing"" Mr Powell and did not believe he had the right to do so. Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, said the fact that Mr Mnuchin had said the White House did not have the power to remove Mr Powell, rather than saying it did not want to remove him, would be more comforting for investors. ""The administration hasn't been all that stable when it comes to changing their mind. Politically, these are very strange times,"" he said. All three US indexes closed lower last week, with the technology-focused Nasdaq down 20% since its peak, placing it in so-called ""bear market"" territory. US investors are worried about a range of factors including slowing economic growth at home and internationally. In addition, a partial US government shutdown began at midnight on Friday after opposition Democrats resisted President Donald Trump's demand for $5bn (Â£4bn) for his Mexico border wall. US shutdown could stretch into new year US stocks suffer worst week in a decade The shutdown over budget spending could continue right up to the opening of the next Congress on 3 January.

Astronaut: Human mission to Mars 'stupid'One of the first astronauts to orbit the Moon thinks there's no public support to send people to Mars.Science & Environment,"Bill Anders on Apollo 8 in December 1968 One of the first men to orbit the Moon has toldBBC Radio 5 Livethat it's ""stupid"" to plan human missions to Mars. Bill Anders, lunar module pilot of Apollo 8, the first human spaceflight to leave Earth's orbit, said sending crews to Mars was ""almost ridiculous"". Nasa is currently planning new human missions to the Moon. It wants to learn the skills and develop the technology to enable a future human landing on Mars. Bill Anders today. He says Nasa shouldn't be aiming to send manned missions to Mars Anders, 85, said he's a ""big supporter"" of the ""remarkable"" unmanned programmes, ""mainly because they're much cheaper"". But he says the public support simply isn't there to fund vastly more expensive human missions. ""What's the imperative? What's pushing us to go to Mars?"" he said, adding ""I don't think the public is that interested"". Meanwhile, robotic probes are still exploring Mars.Last month, the InSight lander, which will sample the planet's interior, successfully touched down at Elysium Planitia. In a statement, Nasa said it was ""leading a sustainable return to the Moon, which will help prepare us to send astronauts to Mars"". ""That also includes commercial and international partners to expand human presence in space and bring back new knowledge and opportunities."" An artist's rendering of the Mars Ice Home concept. In December 1968, Anders, along with crewmates Frank Borman and Jim Lovell, lifted off from Cape Canaveral in Florida atop a Saturn V, before completing 10 orbits around the Moon. The crew of Apollo 8 spent 20 hours in orbit, before returning to Earth. They splashed down in the Pacific on 27 December, landing just 5,000 yards (4,500 metres) from their target point. They were picked up by the aircraft carrier USS Yorktown. It was the furthest humans had ever been from their home planet at that point - and a vital stepping stone on the road to Apollo 11's historic moon landing just seven months later. But the former astronaut is scathing about how Nasa has evolved since the heady days of President John F Kennedy's pledge to land a man on the Moon by the end of the 1960s. The famous Earthrise image taken from Apollo 8 ""Nasa couldn't get to the Moon today. They're so ossified... Nasa has turned into a jobs programme... many of the centres are mainly interested in keeping busy and you don't see the public support other than they get the workers their pay and their congressmen get re-elected."" Anders is also critical of the decision to focus on near-Earth orbit exploration after the completion of the Apollo programme in the 1970s. ""I think the space shuttle was a serious error. It hardly did anything except have an exciting launch, but it never lived up to its promise,"" he said. ""The space station is only there because you had a shuttle, and vice-versa. Nasa really mismanaged the manned programme since the late lunar landings."" It's a view that might seem surprising from a proud patriot and servant of the US military, who still remembers his own mission to space with great fondness. It's also a view that Anders accepts doesn't sit too well with some in the space community. ""I think Nasa's lucky to have what they've got - which is still hard, in my mind, to justify. I'm not a very popular guy at Nasa for saying that, but that's what I think,"" he explained. The Apollo 8 astronauts prepare for launch His former crewmate, Frank Borman, who commanded the Apollo 8 mission and also spent two weeks in Earth orbit during the Gemini programme, is slightly more enthusiastic. ""I'm not as critical of Nasa as Bill is,"" he told 5 Live. ""I firmly believe that we need robust exploration of our Solar System and I think man is part of that."" But asked about the the plans of Space X founder Elon Musk and Amazon boss Jeff Bezos - who have both talked of launching private missions to Mars, Borman is less complimentary. ""I do think there's a lot of hype about Mars that is nonsense. Musk and Bezos, they're talking about putting colonies on Mars, that's nonsense."" Reflecting on their own historic mission to the Moon, Borman described Apollo 8 as a ""great endeavour"" and agreed that it had won the space race. Anders said he felt that the lasting legacy of the mission would be ""Earthrise"" a photo taken by the crew showing humanity's home planet hanging in the blackness of space above the lunar horizon. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM, their crewmate Jim Lovell also reflected on the Earthrise moment: ""When I looked at the Earth itself... I started to wonder why I was here, what's my purpose hereâ¦ it sort of dawned me,"" he said. ""And my perspective is that God has given mankind a stage on which to perform. How the play turns out, is up to us."" Frank Borman and Bill Anders were speaking toBBC Radio 5 Liveas part of a special documentary on the 50th anniversary of their historic lunar mission. Apollo 8: Christmas On the Far Side of the Moon will be broadcast on 5 Live on 24 December 2018 at 20:00 GMT.

WW2 mince pies found under hotel floorA tin of mince pies baked during World War Two goes on display after being discovered at a hotel.Isle Of Man / Ellan Vannin,"The mince pies were found during the renovation of a hotel that once housed soldiers and sailors A tin of mince pies baked during World War Two has been put on display after being discovered immaculately preserved under the floorboards of a hotel. The festive treats, which were a wartime gift from a mother to her sailor son, were uncovered at the Loch Hotel in Douglas on the Isle of Man. They were found during the hotel's 1998 renovation but later left forgotten in storage at the Manx Museum. The pies have now been placed on display for the first time. It is thought that air-tight conditions under the hotel floor may have helped preserve the treats for almost 80 years. They were addressed to Able Seaman Phil Davis and accompanied by a letter signed ""best, love from mum"". A letter accompanying the pies was sent to Able Seaman Davis at HMS Valkyrie from an address in Birmingham Matthew Richardson, curator of social history for Manx National Heritage, said they were a ""unique"" reflection of the ""human"" stories behind the war. Christmas was ""the right time for them to shine"", he added. Hotels and boarding houses along Douglas promenade were used to house soldiers and sailors during the war. Mr Richardson said the pies may have been concealed under the floorboards to prevent them from being stolen by other soldiers. ""If you're in a shared room with five or six other men you don't know, the only way you could be sure of protecting what was yours was to find a place to hide it,"" he said. An image of the Loch Hotel taken from a holiday brochure thought to be from the late 1960s They emerged when the hotel was developed into apartments. A builder handed the items to the museum, where they were again hidden away in storage. The letter found with the tin indicates Able Seaman Davis was attending a naval radar training school on the island. The letter has news of happenings at the sailor's home in Birmingham, including details of family and friends playing a card game ""for money"", and making up a spare room for guests. It also reads: ""We shall be glad to see you when you do get leave."" Mr Richardson said: ""This tin of mince pies illustrates the point that wars might be international events, but they impact at a very human level. ""Here was a young man, possibly away from home for the first time in his life, training to go to a war zone. ""We can only imagine what his mother was feeling as she posted this tin on to him. ""We can't say for sure why Able Seaman Davis never ate his mince pies. Perhaps he was posted away at short notice and didn't have time to retrieve them.""

Santa sleigh stone-throwers make amends,"Weston's Santa Sleigh raises money for local charities Three boys who threw stones at a charity Santa sleigh ride have made amends by helping the fundraisers they had targeted. The route through Weston-super-Mare was cut short after the youngsters persistently hit the sleigh. The attack was met with condemnationon the fundraisers' Facebook page,external. Youth workers who saw the publicity to catch the culprits came forward with names and arranged for the boys to help fundraisers by way of apology. The group's organiser Linda Sims said they chose not to name the boys as it would further ostracise them. She wrote: ""The three young men worked well with our scouts and from the enthusiastic offer of more help next year we believe they understood why we do what we do."" Others in the Facebook group backed the move to educate the children. Roxie Roche said: ""Brilliant. You directed them to do something good with their time instead of perhaps act up out of boredom. Hopefully they won't do anything so ridiculous again."" ""This is the most positive and uplifting post I've read all Christmas,"" Kaya May added. ""We can all thrive if we work together, and nothing feels quite so nice as helping people."" The sleigh ride has now raised Â£2,245 for local charities.

Princess Louise died leaving cigarettes debt,"Princess Louise, sixth child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in 1871 Queen Victoria's fourth daughter died owing 15 shillings to a London tobacconist, documents have revealed. Princess Louise died in 1939, aged 91, with an unpaid cigarettes bill at R Lewis Limited, located near Buckingham Palace and St James's Palace. The National Archives in Kew released details of Princess Louise's estate earlier this year. Historians say it's ""very unusual"" for such personal documents to be released, as they are usually sealed. The princess, a renowned artist, was the sixth child and fourth daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. She was known for her unconventional lifestyle. According to the death duties file, Princess Louise left Â£239,260, 18 shillings and sixpence, worth more than Â£70m today. However, the 15 shilling cigarette bill remained unpaid. The debt would have bought 300 Players or Woodbines, the popular cigarette brands of the time - however, the documents don't say which one the princess smoked. Louise's biographer, Lucinda Hawksley said the princess was an ""inveterate"" smoker. But she had to keep it hidden from her mother, who hated the habit. It was only when her brother - Edward VII - became king, in 1901, that she could have a cigarette in the smoking rooms of the royal palaces. Michael Nash, author of a book about royal wills, says the documents provide an extraordinary snapshot of the life of a royal princess in the 1930s. He said he was hoping to find a trace of athe famous Nga Mauk ruby- owned by the rulers of Burma - in the papers. The jewel was said to be the size of a duck egg and allegedly worth a ""kingdom"". It was, according to Mr Nash, turned into a bracelet for the princess. The documents include a detailed catalogue of her jewellery, which was worth more than Â£30,000. But there is no sign of a substantial ruby. Other mysteries also remain unsolved. Ms Hawksley believes Princess Louise had an illegitimate son who was adopted by the son of her mother's gynaecologist. There's no evidence in the files, but the names of many beneficiaries have been redacted. According to the will, Princess Louise also left a substantial debt of Â£525 to an Australian doctor, K Rodas Shaw, of London's Harley Street. He had been the Australian military doctor in World War One and during the 1920s became an enthusiast for soya beans. In a newspaper interview in the 1920s he said ""the possibilities of this new bean food are boundless"". However, the will does not reveal what medical treatment Dr Shaw gave the princess. She was known for ""health fads"" and her love of exercise. According to Mrs Hawksley, Princess Louise was determined to keep her slim figure, to avoid becoming a ""hausfrau"" - a woman regarded as being overly domesticated - like her mother. She added: ""Princess Alice, mother of Prince Philip, said she was once at a dinner with Princess Louise, where she ate the grand total of four Brussels sprouts."" In aid of sufferers by Princess Louise Princess Louise was also a talented artist. Her sculpture of Queen Victoria still stands at Kensington Palace and she was friendly with many of the leading artists of the time. The files show her collection included works by contemporaries, as well as great artists of the past, her own works and those of her mother. She occupied a grand apartment in Kensington Palace, now home to Prince William and his family. In her private sitting room were the most valuable pieces, among them a ""study of a lady with her back to the spectator"", by the 18th Century French artist Antoine Watteau.

Ministers to discuss Gatwick drone drama,"Flights were suspended for more than 36 hours when a drone was first spotted The suggestion there may not have been any drones at Gatwick Airport was a ""miscommunication by police"", a government source has told the BBC. During a conference call between ministers, chaired by Transport Secretary Chris Grayling, it was agreed the 67 drone sightings were legitimate. But over the weekend, a senior police officer said it was a ""possibility"" there had never been a drone. About 1,000 flights were affected during the airport's 36 hours of chaos. The airport has spent Â£5m since Wednesday on new equipment and technology to prevent copycat attacks. Sussex Police has insisted it was not ""back to square one"" after releasing an arrested man, 47, and woman, 54, without charge on Sunday. Labour calls for inquiry into Gatwick drones How can a drone cause so much chaos? Australia plans drone-identifying system The hour-long call included David Lidington for the Cabinet Office, the Home Secretary Sajid Javid, Security Minister Ben Wallace, Aviation Minister Baroness Sugg, a defence minister, the airport and police. A government source said the force accepted that there had been ""poor communications"". Det Ch Supt Jason Tingley had cast doubt over possible drone sightings as police had not been able to acquire any footage. Asked about this, he said: ""We are working with human beings saying they have seen something."" He later clarified the force was ""actively investigating"" 67 reports of sightings and there were some ""persons of interest"" but would not reveal if officers were close to making any further arrests. Flights resumed from Gatwick Airport on Friday About 140,000 passengers were affected During the conference call, it is understood the Cabinet Office ""pushed"" the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office to update their rapid deployment protocol. They also discussed defence systems across the UK's airports, after discussions were had with all airport CEOs on Friday. The airport was forced to shut its runway for spells on Wednesday and Friday and for all of Thursday The airport has offered a Â£50,000 reward, through Crimestoppers, and another Â£10,000 has been put up by the charity's chairman Lord Ashcroft to catch the culprits responsible for the drama, which affected some 140,000 passengers. A damaged drone found near the perimeter of the airport near Horley, close to the last reported sighting, is also being examined. A spokesman said: ""We are clear that there were multiple confirmed sightings of drone activity at the airport. ""Therefore we took the necessary actions to ensure the safety of passengers using our airport. Safety will always be our number one priority. ""We continue to support the police with their investigations into this illegal and deliberate act to disrupt the airport's operations."" Authorities regained control over the airfield early on Friday after the Army deployed unidentified military technology. It is believed that the Israeli-developed Drone Dome system, which can jam communications between the drone and its operator, was used. However, experts have said it does not enable the person responsible to be tracked down and captured. John Murray, professor of robotics and autonomous systems at the University of Hull, said it could only ""take the drone out of the sky"".

A guide to the most Googled show on Earth,"The Story of Yanxi Palace revolves around its female protagonist, Wei Yingluo It has love but also hatred, intrigue, revenge, poisoning rivals and even killing babies. The Chinese drama Story of Yanxi Palace is the most Googled TV show of 2018 globally, despite Google being largely blocked in the country. The search engine's analytics suggested that the top interest in the drama has come from Asian regions like Singapore, Malaysia, Brunei and Hong Kong, but its popularity in mainland China has been overwhelming as well. The series has been streamed more than 15 billion times on iQiyi, China's Netflix-like site where the show premiered in July before it reached domestic TV channels and more than 70 markets abroad. It was the most watched online drama in China for 39 consecutive days over the summer. The 70-episode Story of Yanxi Palace fictionalised the power struggles among the concubines of Emperor Qianlong in the 1700s. The protagonist, a smart girl with a humble background, manages to rise through the ranks among the harem and wins both love and respect from the emperor. The Chinese title of Yanxi Palace appears as the most Googled TV show of 2018 Its theme may be likened to a Cinderella tale or Netflix's The Crown that chronicles the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. But its own uniqueness has made it the undisputed entertainment sensation of the year. Here's how it took over China and its neighbouring regions. The heroine of the show, Wei Yingluo, is unlike most traditional Chinese female characters who are taught to be tolerant, submissive and fragile. Inspired by the actual real-life consort of Emperor Qianlong, the story follows Yingluo as a woman of Chinese Han ethnicity in the Qing dynasty - the last imperial dynasty in China ruled by the Manchurian ethnicity that suppressed the Han people. But her intelligence, determination and appropriate ferocity meant she was eventually granted her the title of imperial noble consort, the highest possible position for a Han person at that time. Yingluo's most famous line from the show goes like this : ""I, Wei Yingluo, am naturally hot-tempered and not to be pushed around. Whoever keeps talking [nonsense], I have all kinds of methods to go against her."" Wei Yingluo started off as a servant in the palace but slowly worked her way up The woman she is based on - Xiaoyichun - was posthumously given the title of empress, making her the only Han empress during the Manchu-reigned dynasty. The show comes as the latest example of how feminist-themed soap operas have captured Chinese audiences. Other shows like The Legend of Zhenhuan - another imperial rising-up-the-ranks story bought by Netflix - and The Empress of China, that tells the story of the only female emperor in Chinese history, have also taken off in China. Before the show aired on TV screens, it was shown online. The co-producer and initial distributor of the series, iQiyi, is one of China's most popular online video platforms - helping the show gain large traffic and, more importantly, easier regulatory scrutiny for its debut. In China, the National Radio and Television Administration oversees all content on radio and television. A TV project has to obtain the go-ahead from it even before shooting starts. Reality Check: Why is China censoring Eurovision? Peppa Pig blocked on popular Chinese app When video sites emerged a few years ago, they could publish anything as long as they thought it was within the regulator's rules. In 2016, an online series featuring gay love went viral but was taken off in the middle of the streaming season. A year later, a a ban on homosexual content was issued. Online video platforms can't broadcast shows at will but the censorship they go through is much lighter than TV channels, which are mostly owned by the government. No actor in the show is very famous, except for one Hong Kong actress, Charmaine Sheh, who was willing to play a supporting role. Gong Yu, founder and CEO of iQiyi, said the company had ""deliberately cast lesser known actors... rejecting recent trends in the Chinese industry that put too much emphasis of the celebrity appeal of actors in their productions"". It came at an essential time when Chinese celebrities' high income and ambiguous tax practices had caught the attention of the authorities. Vanished China star gets 0% 'goodness' rating Where film stars and police chiefs can simply vanish Total spending on the show's cast didn't even reach one tenth of the total production cost, according to Chinese magazine Portrait citing series producer Yu Zheng, who added that the rest of the money was mainly spent on things like costume and make-up. The detailed costumes and intricate sets won over audiences The well-built sets, elaborate costumes, make-up and attention to detail have won viewers' love. For example, concubines in the show wear three earrings on each side, as was the tradition of Manchu women at that time.

May and Corbyn deliver Christmas messages,"Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn are both giving Christmas messages Theresa May has used her Christmas message to praise the work of the Armed Forces, particularly in Syria and after the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. The PM said UK forces had ""continued to demonstrate why you are the finest in the world"". Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn paid tribute to those who emulate the Good Samaritan in his Christmas message. He drew on the Christian parable to applaud those who help others. In her message, Mrs May said the UK's Armed Forces had played a ""vital role"" in cleaning up after the Novichok attack, protecting the country's waters and skies from Russian intrusion, and also elsewhere in the fight against the Islamic State group and terrorism. They had also helped, alongside US and French allies, to send a message to the Assad regime in Syria ""that we will not stand by while chemical weapons are used, as they were in April on families, including young children"". Mrs May highlighted the military's role in cleaning up Salisbury after the nerve agent attack ""Time and again, you have stood up to aggression and those who flout the rules-based international order,"" she said. ""You should be incredibly proud of all that you do, just as the whole country is proud of you."" The military was called in to Salisbury after the nerve agent attack in March, to help remove vehicles and objects that might have been contaminated. Mrs May added: ""Now as we approach the new year, there will be new challenges ahead. ""But I know you will continue to meet them in the same way that you have always done. With courage, determination, resilience, ingenuity. ""Qualities that are as vital now as they have ever been."" Mr Corbyn praised those that give their time to help the homeless, such as at this Crisis centre in London In a video to run on social media, Mr Corbyn said that he saw ""the compassion of the Good Samaritan in people across our country every day but especially at Christmas"". ""Whether it's people helping in homeless shelters, offering comfort and meals for those looking to escape the freezing temperatures and dangers of sleeping rough. ""Those ensuring food banks are fully stocked for people who can't afford to eat properly this Christmas. ""Or volunteers raising money for refugees who've been forced to flee war, oppression and devastation. ""These are people who will not 'walk by on the other side'. ""They do what's become so necessary in a system that is failing to provide for people's basic needs."" He said these people ""embody what's best and most compassionate in all of us"". ""They make me certain that we can build a fairer society which works for everyone.""

Gatwick drones pair 'no longer suspects',"Flights were suspended for more than 36 hours when a drone was first spotted A man and woman arrested in connection with drone sightings that grounded flights at Gatwick Airport have been released without charge. The 47-year-old man and 54-year-old woman, from Crawley, West Sussex, had been arrested on Friday night. Sussex Police said there had been 67 reports of drone sightings - having earlier cast doubt on ""genuine drone activity"". Det Ch Supt Jason Tingley said no footage of a drone had been obtained. And he said there was ""always a possibility"" the reported sightings of drones were mistaken. Labour calls for inquiry into Gatwick drones How can a drone cause so much chaos? However, he later confirmed the reported sightings made by the public, police and airport staff from December 19 to 21 were being ""actively investigated"". ""We are interviewing those who have reported these sightings, are carrying out extensive house-to-house inquiries, and carrying out a forensic examination of a damaged drone found near the perimeter of the airport."" Det Ch Supt Tingley said it was ""a working assumption"" the device could be connected to their investigation, but officers were keeping ""an open mind"". The airport was forced to shut its runway for spells on Wednesday and Friday and for all of Thursday Flights were suspended for more than 36 hours when a device was first spotted close to the runway on Wednesday night. Det Ch Supt Tingley said the arrested man and woman had ""fully co-operated"" with inquiries after information was received from a member of the public. Talking about the disclosure of their personal details in the press, he said he was satisfied their arrest was lawful, and stressed that officers would never reveal such information. He added: ""We would not have chosen in any event to provide that information to anyone... and one might say that's probably hindered us in terms of how quickly we've been able to get to a resolution, in terms of them being released from custody."" Gatwick Airport Limited has now offered a Â£50,000 reward through Crimestoppers for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for disrupting flights. About 1,000 aircraft were either cancelled or diverted, affecting about 140,000 passengers, during three days of disruption. On Sunday the airport said it was operating as normal but there had been ""some knock-on effect"". Passengers have been urged to check with their airline for the latest information. Passengers have been able to board their flights as scheduled Authorities finally regained control over the airfield early on Friday after the Army deployed unidentified military technology. It is believed that the Israeli-developed Drone Dome system, which can jam communications between the drone and its operator, was used.

The charges against her are completely false. ""We - and indeed the whole country - know what a travesty of justice it is that Nazanin continues to be detained. ""With Christmas approaching, we are calling on the Iranian authorities to release her at once so she can return home and be reunited with her family."" What is Iran jail case about? Prisoner caught in Iran power struggle Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested at Tehran airport in April 2016 after visiting her family on holiday. She has always maintained the visit was to introduce her daughter Gabriella to her relatives. The mother-of-one from Hampstead, north London, was recently reunited with her four-year-old daughter during athree-day temporary release. But since returning to prison, after her application for an extended release was denied, she hassuffered several panic attacks.

"US moves to reassure jumpy investorsAfter a torrid week for US stocks, the treasury secretary was keen to get reassurances from big banks.Business","Mr Mnuchin tweeted out details of his conversations, saying that the banks had ""ample liquidity"" US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has made calls to the heads of the country's six largest banks, in an unusual move aimed at reassuring investors after big falls in US stocks. Last week, US stocks suffered one of the worst weekly falls in a decade, as an interest rate rise and US-China trade tensions rattled markets. Mr Mnuchin said banks confirmed they had ""ample liquidity"" for operations. It also comes amid a partial government shutdown over spending plans. ""The [bank's chief executives] confirmed that they have ample liquidity available for lending to consumer, business markets, and all other market operations,"" the Treasury said in a statement attached to a tweet from Mr Mnuchin. ""[Mr Mnuchin] also confirmed that they have not experienced any clearance or margin issues, and that the markets continue to function properly,"" the Treasury's statement said. The BBC Today programme's business presenter, Dominic O'Connell, said the statement was ""very odd"" and could ""spook markets, not reassure them"". ""People are wondering whether this is really a role for the US Treasury secretary,"" he said. Analysts also warned the unexpected statement could make investors nervous. ""More than anything else right now, Washington and politics are absolutely driving investor sentiment and market direction and that can turn on a dime,"" said Oliver Pursche, a board member at Bruderman Asset Management. Mr Mnuchin also tried to dismiss reports that President Donald Trump had discussed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, after the US central bank raised interest rates last week. The US Treasury secretary tweeted that he had spoken to the president, who insisted he ""never suggested firing"" Mr Powell and did not believe he had the right to do so. Rick Meckler, partner at Cherry Lane Investments, said the fact that Mr Mnuchin had said the White House did not have the power to remove Mr Powell, rather than saying it did not want to remove him, would be more comforting for investors. ""The administration hasn't been all that stable when it comes to changing their mind. Politically, these are very strange times,"" he said. All three US indexes closed lower last week, with the technology-focused Nasdaq down 20% since its peak, placing it in so-called ""bear market"" territory. US investors are worried about a range of factors including slowing economic growth at home and internationally. In addition, a partial US government shutdown began at midnight on Friday after opposition Democrats resisted President Donald Trump's demand for $5bn (Â£4bn) for his Mexico border wall. US shutdown could stretch into new year US stocks suffer worst week in a decade The shutdown over budget spending could continue right up to the opening of the next Congress on 3 January. Mr Mnuchin is now set to meet with the President's Working Group on Monday, the Treasury statement said. The group includes market regulators and Federal Reserve governors, among others.  They will discuss ""coordination efforts to assure normal market operations"", the statement said.

Chris Evans bids farewell to Radio 2,"This video can not be played Is Chris Evans sure he wants to leave BBC Radio 2? Chris Evans paid an emotional tribute to his wife as he broadcast his final BBC Radio 2 show. The DJ, who has hosted breakfast for nine years, said: ""I'd like to thank my wife Natasha, my gravity, my compass, my guiding light. ""I crave the uncertainty, but you can only do that against a backdrop of certainty and security."" He added it was a ""sad day"", but also ""an exciting day for everyone"" as he prepared to move to Virgin Radio. ""Thank you to the BBC for supporting me and entrusting me with one of their precious microphones for the last 13 years, for allowing me to grow for every minute of every day I've been on the air,"" he said. Chris Evans: Radio 2 host's tearful goodbye speech in full Through tears, he thanked a number of people, including his agent Michael and his station bosses past and present - Lesley Douglas, Bob Shennan and Lewis Carnie. Zoe Ball will take over from Evans in January, becoming the first woman to host the coveted Radio 2 breakfast slot. It's one of several schedule changes on the station, with Sara Cox set to take over Drivetime from Simon Mayo, Jo Whiley moving back to evenings and a new late night show for Trevor Nelson. This video can not be played DJ Chris Evans pays an emotional tribute to his wife Natasha. As he opened the show on Monday morning, Evans told his listeners not to ""shed too many tears"" during his final programme. Evans, who has spent 13 years with Radio 2, said: ""To read a book, you have to keep turning the pages, but to write a book in the first place you have to do exactly the same. ""The sight of a blank page strikes the fear of god into some, but for others there's nothing more exciting. ""So with your blessing, that's precisely what I'm going to do."" On Twitter, fellow broadcasters paid tribute to Evans - including Ball, BBC Breakfast's Dan Walker and Reverend Kate Bottley, the former Gogglebox star who presented on the Pause For Thought segment of Evans's show.

There were several memorable moments on his final breakfast show, with listeners getting in touch to tell the DJ how many life milestones they had achieved throughout his years as host. This included George, who - aged seven - voiced the ""How Do You Like Your Eggs In The Morning?"" jingle that often features on the show. George, now aged 15, called in live to the show recreate the ""I like mine with a kiss"" line (now with a much deeper voice). Chris Evans: A life in broadcasting Evans says yes to Strictly Come Dancing 2019 Nicole Kidman also phoned in from Australia to say she was ""so sad"" that Chris was leaving Radio 2. Evans was full of praise for his production staff over the years, and said his team had created a book of their favourite moments from his tenure. Looking through the book, he highlighted ""Glastonbury in the mud, the time we recorded from my house, the Pudsey cup, the Globe Theatre, the anniversary of the Normandy landings, Prince Harry, then the big anniversary of the Dambusters at Biggin Hill."" Zoe Ball will take over from Chris Evans in January Evans's wife - Natasha Shishmanian - also became emotional when he asked her to read out a message he had written from the perspective of their children. She said: ""Today's gobsmackers are chosen by Noah and Eli Evans for their mum Tash."" She began to cry, adding: ""Oh, for goodness sake. ""They say that while everybody is talking about our dad we wanted to pick two songs for mum. One is because she loves nothing more than to dance in the sunshine with a grapefruit G and T, laughing uncontrollably with the people she loves. The other is her mascara moment."" Evans then went on to play the two songs dedicated to her - Michael Jackson's Love Never Felt So Good [the mascara moment song] and America by Razorlight. As he left Radio 2 after the show, the DJ told the media: ""I feel sad and very happy and very excited. It's really strange."" Radio 2's breakfast show is Europe's most popular radio programme, although Evans' ratings fell to a six-year low of 8.9 million this summer. The presenter took over from Terry Wogan in 2010 and took listener figures to almost 10 million at their peak. Nicole Kidman, who called in live from Australia, was among the guests on Evans's final show Speaking onBBC One's The One Showlast week, he said he was ""excited"" about his move, but admitted it was ""a shame"" to be doing his last show at Radio 2. He said he started thinking about leaving after somebody pointed out how long he had been at the station. ""It is a shame, but Zoe is going to be on in January. Zoe's brilliant and I took over from Terry,"" he said. ""Terry was amazing, nobody could do that show like him so we had to do it a different way and Zoe can continue that. ""You're a steward of a show like this. The show isn't yours, you're the stewards of it and somebody else will come along, and I think that's a lovely thing."" It's not the end of his relationship with the BBC, though, because he also revealed he has said yes to taking part in Strictly Come Dancing next year. Rick Astley, George Ezra, Richard Ashcroft, Stacey Dooley, Olly Murs and Paloma Faithwere among his guestsfor his last full week. Evans will host the Virgin breakfast show from 21 January. His new programme is being billed as the first commercial radio breakfast show without conventional advert breaks. Instead, it will be sponsored by Sky, and Evans will promote Sky's programmes during his slot. Evans was paid Â£1.66m for hosting the Radio 2 breakfast show in 2017-18, and there have been reports that he will pocket Â£2m a year from Virgin. But he has denied his move was about the money.

A scandal Norway doesn't talk about," The UN rates Norway one of the best countries for a child to grow up in. And yet too many children, according to a large number of Norwegian experts, are taken into care without good reason. The conviction of a top psychiatrist in the child protection system for downloading child abuse images is now raising further serious questions. It was a winter’s day, some years ago, when two child welfare specialists – a female psychologist and a male psychiatrist  – knocked on the door of a small modern wooden house on the edge of the Norwegian capital, Oslo. A lively little girl opened the door and greeted the strangers warmly. But the girl’s mother, Cecilie – who understood the purpose of their visit – was much less pleased to see them. “I was very scared. I didn’t want them in my house in the first place,” she says, remembering that day. “I was really nervous that they will find something wrong.  I know this is how the Child Protection Services take away children.” The experts had been appointed to write a report for a family court hearing which would decide the little girl’s future. Their visit followed years of concern by the Child Protection Service that Cecilie - a single mother - wasn’t looking after her daughter properly, and had rejected offers of help. That day, she was right to be nervous. The experts were highly critical of what they observed at her home. They wrote in their report that “there was no natural flow to the interaction” between mother and daughter. They said Cecilie struggled to keep the house in order. And they commented on other details that Cecilie believes they misinterpreted. “Everything is twisted in a negative way,” she says. “This was not so long after Christmas, and in the local store I had found some gingerbread which they were selling really cheap, for one Norwegian krone. So I bought it just for fun, so that my daughter and I could make some gingerbread men together as an activity. “But apparently they thought my financial situation was very bad, because I had bought it after Christmas… How can you say a person is poor just because they buy cheap gingerbread? “When I saw the report, I was so devastated. It was just all this negativity - negative, negative, negative. There was nothing positive at all.” The experts’ report – based on information from many health and childcare professionals as well as their own observations – concluded that the little girl’s “development would be limited” if she remained with her mother. The report said: “This is because the mother does not recognise her daughter’s basic needs and does not perceive the mental harm she may have suffered” while in her mother’s care. Since then, Cecilie – a lean, anxious-looking, blonde woman now in her 50s - has only seen her daughter seven times. “I have not been able to follow her development,” she says. “I just lost my daughter’s childhood. I don’t expect really to see her until she’s an adult.” The recommendation to put the girl into long-term foster care was approved at Oslo District Court. The report’s co-authors attended as witnesses. Fast forward to April this year, and one of those two experts – the male psychiatrist - reappeared in the same courthouse. This time, though, he wasn’t in the witness stand. He was in the dock. He was sentenced to 22 months in jail - after admitting he had downloaded nearly 200,000 images, and more than 12,000 videos, showing the sexual abuse or sexualisation of children. The court heard that some appeared to show infants being raped. Norwegian police were initially tipped off that the man was downloading illegal child abuse images in 2015. But it wasn’t until early 2017 – a year and a half later – that they investigated and then arrested him. He confessed that he had been viewing such material for 20 years. The expert hasn’t been named in the Norwegian media – to protect the privacy of his own children. But until his arrest he played a key role at various levels in Norway’s child protection system - as an expert witness in individual cases such as Cecilie’s, and more recently as a member of the prestigious Child Expert Commission, which evaluates all independent protection reports. His conviction puts the spotlight back on a system which has been heavily criticised by some parents – and by leading Norwegian professionals in the childcare field –  for being too quick to put children into care, splitting families unnecessarily. The disgraced psychiatrist has had his professional licence revoked, meaning he cannot work in the same field again. But parents who’ve lost custody of children in cases he was involved in believe all his previous decisions should be reviewed. “What he was saying isn’t valid, because of what he has done. His judgement cannot be trusted,” Cecilie says. If he had told the judge (in earlier cases, when he was an expert witness) that he had been downloading child pornography for years, of course he would never have been appointed as an expert.” The local child protection agency which handled Cecilie’s case points out that he was only one of two specialists who wrote the report, that their recommendation was approved by a court, and that their observations were only part of the justification for putting her daughter into care. But Cecilie and other parents say his crime shows he was unable to empathise with children. The presiding judge in the case, Nini Ring, commented in her judgement that he appeared not to understand the suffering involved in the material he enjoyed viewing. She said: “The accused has taken exception to the most serious material, which he claims not to have downloaded consciously. The Court finds, however, that the accused to a certain extent trivialises his own actions.” The judge continued: “The defendant appears remorseful, but reflection seems to have come only after he was caught out. In court he has explained that he considered he was not harming children, since he did not take part in the production (of the images)… The Court finds it serious for somebody with his special expertise on children to express that only now has it struck him that he has subjected these children to grave violation. “The Court furthermore sees it as serious that a professional who is supposed to be the 'protector' of children and young people has placed his own satisfaction and desires first in this manner.” Among many other child protection cases the disgraced expert was involved in is one in the south of Norway, where a large family has now been split up for nearly five years. Inez - a warm, round-faced woman - is the mother of eight children. Four are grown-up. The younger four were suddenly taken away by the Child Protection Service, or Barnevernet, in September 2013. She was arrested and put into a police holding cell. “It was so strange to find myself in a cell and I just remember being so scared,” Inez says, trying hard not to cry as she recalls that day. “The walls were coming closer and closer and it was becoming so difficult to breathe. It was like the air was becoming less and less… I never ever thought that I would be accused of something illegal. “At one point I was thinking if I was mad, if I had in my madness been doing things I wasn’t supposed to do, had I harmed my family without really knowing it?” There had been an allegation that Inez had used physical force on her children, which is outlawed in Norway. She says she was obliged to act to protect one child from another, who refused to stop biting his sibling. “I gave him the smack in order for him to let go of his sibling. It wasn't right of me to give a smack like that. But I was just saying that there was a sibling in pain.” A criminal court acquitted Inez of the charges against her in 2016. Inez doesn’t criticise the authorities for following up the initial allegation of violence. But she says they didn’t then listen properly to what the children were saying. “The problem was that every question was a leading question,” says Inez’s lawyer, Victoria Holmen. “And when you analyse the reports of what the children actually said, if you count up how many times they said ‘My mother was violent against me,’ it’s zero. “An example is that they were not satisfied with the answer that the youngest daughter gave them when they asked: ‘Has your mother been violent to you?’ She said: ‘No, never. She never hit me.’ But they followed by saying, ‘How many times did your mother hit you?’ And that was when they went totally wrong. “They had already formed their opinion of what this case was about. And then they questioned the children so that they would have the answer that would match their opinions.” The child protection office that handled Inez’s case has been unavailable to comment on this. But the same point – that investigators put words into the children’s mouths – was made by the Appeal Court when it acquitted Inez. Soon after that verdict, two of Inez’s children were returned. But the youngest two are still in foster care more than two years later. This is despite an independent psychological report that praised Inez’s parenting skills and recommended that the family be reunited. It said: “The experts find it impossible to believe that so carefree, positive and undisruptive children can come from the home described in the accounts that form the basis of the child protection and police actions.” That report was disregarded, however, after it was sharply criticised by the supervisory body, the Child Expert Commission. The Commission said the report was “explicitly biased” in the parents’ favour. One of the two Commission members who made that comment was the now-disgraced psychiatrist who was also involved in Cecilie’s case. The positive report he and his colleague rubbished was co-authored by two very eminent psychologists – one of them Reidar Hjermann, a former Children’s Ombudsman, the independent official responsible for safeguarding children’s interests throughout the country. When I meet Hjermann, he tells me this accusation of bias made him very angry. But I discover he doesn’t know that the expert who made the accusation has been convicted – because he hasn’t been publicly named. When I tell him, he’s shocked.  “When bad things like this happen, it’s important to look at what kind of responsibilities a person has had - and see if his way of misbehaving has been having an influence on the important job he or she has had.” But there is no sign that the Norwegian authorities are planning any general review of cases the convicted expert was involved in – or that they believe his disgrace has any wider implications for the system. The Child Expert Commission told me they have looked into the reports he did for them – only part of his work – and could find no evidence that he had shown too little, or too much, empathy with children in his judgments. But the Board of Health Supervision, the body which has now withdrawn his licence, said it was not planning to investigate his professional practice. It says there is no information that the convicted expert had committed any crimes in his work, or any medical malpractice. Other agencies – local and national – that employed him have said the same. But for Inez, those reactions are just proof of the lack of accountability in a system that needs thorough reform. She says she’s now been assured by Child Protection that they now regard her as a “good enough” parent, and that her two youngest children will soon be returned to her. But losing them for five years has been a devastating experience for her and her husband, Knut. Initially, she was only allowed to see them four times a year. And each parent could speak to each child on the phone for just 15 minutes once a month. “The house was so quiet,” she says. “And you know how parents usually want the kids to be a bit quiet? It was so strange to be on the other side: I just want lots of noise, bickering.” She blames the negative comments co-authored by the disgraced psychiatrist for keeping her family divided until now – and, like Cecilie, she also says his past judgements should be reviewed. “It's like constructing a building which has a major flaw in their foundation. Do you let the building stand with a big flaw, knowing that at any moment it will collapse? Or do you try to rebuild it and make it correct? “And in cases like this, they should do it, because the outcome is a tragedy when the decision is to separate children and parents.” The criticisms of the Norwegian Child Protection Service date back some years. Two years ago I reported onthe case of Ruth and Marius Bodnariu, evangelical Christians who were accused in 2015 of breaking the law by smacking their children. Their five children – including a small baby – were put into emergency care, prompting demonstrations by sympathisers around the world. The children were eventually returned to their parents – but the family then decided to leave Norway. They now live in Marius’s home country, Romania. In the same year, 2015, more than 140 professionals in the childcare field – lawyers, psychologists and social workers, wrote a National Notice of Concern to the government. They said that “a long list of children – the actual number is not known by anyone – are exposed to serious failures of understanding and infringements of their rights.” They added that “when expert witnesses submit their reports and give evidence in court, we often see that the observational basis upon which they report is very weak.” That open letter has now been signed by a further 120 specialists. Meanwhile, a family involved in a custody battle with the state has won a rare legal victory, gaining the right to have its case heard later this year at the highest level of the European Court of Human Rights. And, increasing the international pressure still more on Norway, several families from the country have sought refuge in Poland to avoid the threat of care orders by the child protection service. They believe Poland places more emphasis on keeping families together. Among those now in Poland is Leen, the 14-year-old daughter of Palestinian parents who were given asylum in Norway. Her father, Talab, a journalist, had served five years in jail in Syria, much of it in solitary confinement, for criticising the regime there. Talab and his older daughter, Hiba, are still in Norway, while his wife and Leen are in Poland where they are now seeking asylum for a second time. Hiba, who works as a nurse, explains what happened to her younger sister: “One day she went to school and she didn’t come back. And my family, my parents and brother were looking for hours as her phone was turned off, going everywhere, looking like crazy on the street and we couldn’t find her. “Then, hours later, we had two child protection officers at the door and they said Leen is with them. They asked for her belongings, because she was taken under an emergency care order. She had told the school nurse that she had been physically abused at home.” Leen was taken first to a foster home, then to another care institution, then to a hospital. Eventually – a year after she was first put into care – she ran away. She met up with her mother, who took her to Poland, where they have lived for the past year. Speaking from Poland, she says the original allegation of abuse was made by another child at her school, where she was being bullied. Then at her foster home, she became depressed and started self-harming. She was treated with anti-psychotic drugs – and then other medication for the side-effects, which she says made her increasingly physically ill. But medical certificates issued following tests in Poland do not confirm all the diagnoses made in Norway. Doctors there say she is physically fit and suffering only from stress caused by her experiences over the past two years. “When we came to Norway, we thought that this was where we would live in peace and we would forget all the traumatic and sad events,” Hiba says, referring to the family’s escape from Syria. “But we have all lived this trauma again.” “I didn’t see the growing-up of my older children when I was imprisoned in Syria,” Talab says. “So when Leen was born here in Norway, it was a God-given present for us. How could we have mistreated her? It is a very silly joke to hear this from the Child Protection Service. “They behave above regulations, and you can’t win any case against them in the courts, even if you bring witnesses with you. It is as in Syria – the verdict is written beforehand. It is unbelievable in Norway, something very strange in a welfare state – a Scandinavian state.” The family says Leen was never physically punished – and they believe the allegation of violence was taken particularly seriously because they were immigrants to Norway. “If you’re from the Middle East you’re automatically deemed to be abusive and backward,” Hiba says. The Child Protection office dealing with the case said it could not comment in detail. But it said it did not agree with the family’s version of events, and it denied treating children from immigrant families more strictly than others. One journalist has calculated, however, that children with a foreign mother are four times more likely than other children in Norway to be forcibly taken from their families. Reidar Hjermann, the former Children’s Ombudsman, says no-one should be judged to be violent without evidence. But he also says:  “When a family comes to Norway with a mother and father who have themselves been brought up with violence, then I think we should assume that we need to go to help this family to understand that where they come from, physical punishment is rather common, but in Norway it is absolutely forbidden.” He believes “the Norwegian system should do something about its reputation” by improving professional competence in a system that he thinks is currently too decentralised. And he adds: “One of the absolutely overarching strategies is to help children in families. To remove a child from a family is something you try not to do at all.” Katrin Koch, the head of the Child Expert Commission which the disgraced psychiatrist was a member of, says one reason for the disproportionately high number of immigrant families affected by care orders might be that Norway is “quite a conformist country in many ways.” She says: “It might be that the child protection services are not aware enough that there are many ways of raising children. “Another point would be that Norway is a rich country – and the richer you are, the less consideration you have to give to survival issues, and the more consideration you can give to an optimalisation of how children are to be raised.” Child welfare guidelines in Norway, as in some other countries, specify that parenting does not have to be “good” - only “good enough.” But Katrin Koch says: “Maybe the level for ‘good enough’ in Norway is different from other countries.” The Ministry of Children says it’s bringing in legal changes that will strengthen children’s and family rights. It’s reviewing some care orders – though there’s no suggestion that’s linked to the conviction of the expert psychiatrist. Like other agencies in the child protection system, the Ministry won’t comment at all on his case at all. But Inez – who’s now become a campaigner for family rights – regards the silence over the convicted psychiatrist as a cover-up. She and other parents who’ve lost children are also surprised by a family court decision that the disgraced expert can keep custody of his own young children. “I’m at a loss for words, for the outrage,” she says, “knowing other parents who have had lesser allegations and have lost children.” Thore Langfeldt, a psychologist who works with sex offenders, and who gave testimony as an independent expert in the case of the convicted psychiatrist, regards that reaction as “moral outrage”. He says there is no evidence to suggest that people who download child pornography are more likely than anyone else to commit other offences against children. “Sometimes moral panic takes over and empirical psychological data vanish on us,” he says. But Inez, who has been active in her community as a local politician and lay judge, says the case has changed the way she views her own country. “Before 2013 I considered Norway as the best country in the world. And in many aspects it still is a good country. But if the system is closed and there is no transparency, then it is so much easier to sweep things under the carpet when things go wrong,” she says. “There has to be a willingness to fix things, because it ensures that people can trust the system.” Built with Shorthand"
A bridge that crossed an ocean," Robert Paxton McCulloch was already a multi-millionaire by the time he turned 18. But inheriting part of his grandfather’s fortune in 1925 didn’t blunt his ambition or work ethic. Driven by a compulsion to invent, after graduating from Stanford University he started a company that created supercharged car engines. While he was still a young man McCulloch sold the business for $1m. It was the first chapter in a lucrative career that would take him from the Midwest to California, where he had successful ventures making chainsaws and boat engines. “He was a genius,” says his grandson Michael. “He was astute at building and invention; he designed engines - that was his forte. “He was a little on the eccentric side, but extremely nice. I only ever saw a very gentle person.” McCulloch married Barbara Ann Briggs, daughter of the co-founder of the engine company Briggs and Stratton McCulloch, who was known to his grandchildren as RP, never lost his temper and was fun to be around, Michael says. He was something of a character who kept odd hours, working late into the night and sleeping until noon. Later, he would order the same thing at the same branch of Marie Callender’s pie place; a distinctive sight in the outfit he wore almost every day. “It was a cream chino suit, a very thin black tie, a white shirt, and he had his trousers taken up three inches shorter. He would wear yellow socks, with white and brown saddle shoes,” says Michael. “When he passed away, I wanted a pair of those shoes because that was his trademark. I opened the closet and there were 40 pairs of shoes and 25 suits and nothing else.” Robert Paxton McCulloch was already a multi-millionaire by the time he turned 18.

I opened the closet and there were 40 pairs of shoes and 25 suits and nothing else.” McCulloch was a man who fizzed with ideas and was often found tinkering at his holiday house in Palm Springs. It was a place of innovation, where the mundane became fascinating. Drawers did not hold typical domestic trappings - they slid open to reveal chilled cocktail glasses. Such quirks led to Life magazine dubbing the country club home a “push-button paradise” in 1956. The issue featured a number of McCulloch’s inventions “It was way, way before its time,” says Michael. “Everything was electronic. All the doors, all the drawers, everything opened by pushing buttons or by sliding a toggle. “There were features that would turn on the coffee [machine] or the bath or the steam room at whatever time you wanted. All the lighting was controlled by a master panel. No other house had that.” After a successful start in making racing engines, McCulloch branched out into boat engines McCulloch was constantly looking for ways to make life easier. The magazine’s front cover featured another of his creations - a human “Lazy Susan” that rotated with the sun to ensure an even tan. “He came up with a lot of ideas,” says Michael. “He created a jet pack, a two-person helicopter. He made a thing that was like a facelift [using] steam, which would tighten your skin. “It was just something he did for fun. He was a very smart, creative person that needed to keep inventing.” Lake Havasu was created after the completion of the Parker Dam in 1938, which held back the Colorado River It was this compulsion, coupled with good business acumen, that led to his next project. With nowhere to test his boat engines in land-locked eastern California, he hopped over the border into Arizona in search of water. The story goes that it was from the air that McCulloch spotted the ribbon of Havasu’s lake below, snaking through a parcel of land flanked by the Chemehuevi, Whipple and Mojave Mountains. “They noticed it was a really, really beautiful place,” says Michael.  “They took a look around, offered $76 an acre and started building. “He realised there was a huge opportunity there.” The Bridge House Estates committee of the City of London Common Council had known for some time London Bridge was sinking further into the River Thames with every passing rush hour. Horse-drawn carriages had long since made way for cars and double-decker buses and, over the years, the structure had been hammered deeper into the riverbed. The obvious solution to members in 1965 was to demolish it and start again; build a new bridge, for a new era of commuters. Former newspaper and PR man Ivan Luckin had other ideas. “He thought it was all very well knocking it down, but what about its future?”  says former councillor Archie Galloway. “That’s when Ivan made his move. He said to the committee, ‘we ought to sell it’. “A lot of eyebrows went up at that.” Luckin wanted to go a step further and advertise in the United States, where he felt certain someone would be interested in buying a well-known London landmark. “Someone sensibly asked what they might get for [the bridge] and Ivan is recorded as saying, ‘one million’,” says Archie. “And they said, ‘one million dollars?’ “Ivan said, ‘I’m talking about one million pounds.’ [Nearly three millions dollars at the time.] They sat up at that.” News of the sale was soon the subject of newspaper and TV reports trotting out the inevitable line that London Bridge “was falling down”. Luckin’s glossy 40-page brochure for prospective buyers promoted not only the structure itself, but the chance to own a slice of history - a bridge had crossed the Thames in this part of London since Roman times. The new bridge was opened in 1973 by the Queen It was this potential that inspired McCulloch and his business partner, Cornelius Vanderbilt “CV” Wood, who was known for designing Disneyland in California. Stories about how the pair got wind of the sale vary - according to Michael, they saw an advert on TV while on business in London. “They had been having a few drinks together and saw it and I think they probably looked at each other and thought, ‘we should take that apart, that will be our gimmick’.” Another version has Wood at a meeting about the sale of the RMS Queen Mary, at New York’s Plaza Hotel, where he supposedly asked, “anything else for sale?” Either way, Luckin’s perseverance paid off and when the ink dried on the contract of sale on 18 April 1968, he was a man vindicated - his outlandish idea matched only by an even more ludicrous one. “Ivan was immensely proud of it but never went around shouting it from the rooftops,” says Archie. “I think a lot of people thought he was a lunatic, but he was a man of single purpose. “I can’t believe anyone else would have thought of the idea.” When his parents announced they were moving to Lake Havasu City in February 1965, Rick Kingsbury was incredulous. It sounded to him the place barely existed - and he was right. “It wasn’t my idea to move here; no 13-year-old kid in his right mind would want to move to a godforsaken place like this at the time. “We had no electricity, no water, we didn’t have air conditioning. There was one phone, the post office was a closet at the liquor store and the mail went to a box 20 miles away. “Those first few months were like a big camping trip you were never going to go home from. “There was nothing here. I hated the place.” In 1965 there were about 20 homes and a trailer park For Joe Hunnicutt, the worst thing was the dizzying heat of summers inching towards 50C (122F). “I absolutely hated it. My parents took me out of Wyoming and they took me to hell. “We came in August and I stepped outside and I was like,‘are you kidding me?’ “I was eight and all I wanted to do was ride my bike. I couldn’t do that there. “My whole goal was to get out, but you’ve got to give it to them, the people that stuck it out in that godforsaken middle of nowhere.” Those who moved to Lake Havasu between 1964 and 1974 call themselves pioneers - a nod to their 19th Century forefathers who travelled westwards in wagons in search of a better life. But Rick wasn’t imbued with such spirit and it was a year before he saw the merits of living somewhere with one stop sign, two roads and 600 neighbours. The first 10 houses were built in 1964 by Alfred Anderson “I was a reluctant pioneer,” says Rick.“It was only during that second summer I realised what a paradise it was for a kid. “There was all this exploring in the desert, so there was this feeling of Tom Sawyer, of living in this wonderland. “We had this great big lake pretty much to ourselves and we were up to our necks in the cool water. “It was this huge playground and it was all ours.” By the end of 1965, the elementary school had acquired two new classes, and a grocery store had opened its doors. The real change, however, came in 1968, when news trickled back to this tiny desert “city” that its founder had made a bizarre purchase. In the beginning there was just one major crossroad “The whole economics of the place and the attitude of the town changed overnight,” says Rick. “It was like a rocket ship, it took off and went crazy. In the three years it took to build the bridge, the population tripled. “But there was almost a little regret for me. We were growing and I realised it was going to go away. “It was all going to change.” Visitors to Lake Havasu City might assume it existed only because its founder had embarked upon a curious plan to rebuild a piece of British history in the desert. In reality, McCulloch’s small community grew steadily in its fledgling years. The US census recorded that by 1970 the city had more than 4,000 residents - a substantial increase on the handful that called it home six years earlier. But even the engineer’s most faithful supporters struggled to share his vision back in 1964. Early West remembers how in the spring of that year, he and McCulloch had been drinking coffee outside the entrepreneur's new factory in Lake Havasu when, seemingly out of the blue, he said: “I see a city.” “I didn’t know what to say; there was nothing, just desert,” says Early. “I said, ‘I don’t see that city’. And Robert said, ‘I promise, you will’.” Adverts appeared in newspapers offering free trips to Lake Havasu City Lake Havasu’s growth was in part down to dynamic marketing of the American dream - the promise of a better (and sunnier) life. “RP started doing commercials and advertising in the Midwest where it was freezing,” says Michael. “He purchased a bunch of planes and started flying people out on free flights. “They were treated like kings. They were put up in a beautiful hotel for two or three days, had all their meals paid for and all they had to do was go on a tour for a couple of hours. “And it worked like a charm. They sold a lot of those homes that way.” Visitors to Lake Havasu City might assume it existed only because its founder had embarked upon a curious plan to rebuild a piece of British history in the desert.

They were put up in a beautiful hotel for two or three days, had all their meals paid for and all they had to do was go on a tour for a couple of hours. “And it worked like a charm. They sold a lot of those homes that way.” Hundreds boarded the McCulloch-branded propeller planes on chilly runways in Chicago, Boston and New York. On arrival, they were chauffeured to the Havasu Hotel, where a waterfall cascaded dramatically over its front door. “It was unbelievable,” says Evie Cistaro, who visited from Boston on the Thanksgiving weekend of 1972. “We stopped and picked up people in Pennsylvania and Chicago and when we arrived it was 75F (24C) and the sun was shining. “They wined us and dined us and showed us the land, and we bought it and signed. “It was a new beginning.” A salesman was assigned to each couple that stepped off the plane Joe Hunnicutt remembers hearing the sales pitch from his father, Ray, who sold lots for McCulloch. “They drove people around to buy property and I used to sit in the back of the Jeep with them,” he said. “I had that [pitch] memorised... some of it was true, some of it wasn’t.” Hundreds boarded the McCulloch-branded propeller planes on chilly runways in Chicago, Boston and New York.

I thought, ‘it’s an investment’. “But I remember people walking up and down the aisles [on the flight back] saying, ‘who wants to buy a pile of rocks?’ “And I thought, ‘they don't see beyond’.” Evie’s salesman brother, Jay Scavusso, found the Gunnarssons their home The Gunnarssons moved three years later into the only house on an undeveloped hill. “People used to say… ‘you live way up there?’,” says Brooklyn-born Betty. “You could look out for almost a mile. The boys had bikes and they would go out into the desert and [crumble crackers] to make trails so they didn’t get lost. “The experience opened up their eyes. It was a good life.” Before April 1968 few people knew where Lake Havasu City was, but news of the sale made international headlines and gave the tiny desert community a high profile. However, the purchase of London Bridge was also the source of much scorn. Many people assumed McCulloch had lost his mind - although others recognised there might be some cunning behind the bizarre scheme. “There were lots of articles that described RP as crazy,” says Michael. “Then that changed - to crazy like a fox. “People couldn’t conceptualise it… take this bridge in London and put it in the middle of the desert?” A rumour that McCulloch - a millionaire and successful businessman - had “bought the wrong bridge” probably didn’t help, although it was, of course, complete nonsense. McCulloch and Wood went to London to inspect their purchase “I know for a fact they knew exactly which bridge they were going to buy,” says Michael. “Do you think anyone in their right mind would look at Tower Bridge and think they could take it apart and bring it here? “But RP and CV felt that by allowing that rumour to perpetuate, it gave them continued publicity, so they let it go.” Before April 1968 few people knew where Lake Havasu City was - but news of the sale made international headlines and gave the tiny desert community a high profile.

She remembers how the McCulloch salesmen would point her out as a local curiosity to those fresh off the flights, and say “there’s the girl that comes by boat”. She watched as the bricks piled up on the side of the road slowly transformed into a bridge. “I thought it was pretty bizarre at the time,” she says. After all, there was no river in the city for the exported bridge to cross. “Most people build bridges to cross a river, McCulloch built a river under a bridge.” English expat Linda Binder felt similarly when she heard the bridge she had often walked across as a child was moving. “I saw in the papers McCulloch was buying London Bridge and I thought, ‘what are those crazy Yanks doing building a bridge on sand?’ “But I think he did an extraordinary job of bringing it over and having the foresight to bring it brick by brick and rebuild it with the city around it. “I mean, who does that?” Years later, the Londoner moved to Lake Havasu where she became an Arizona state senator and, for many years, the point of contact for British dignitaries visiting the new city. Her husband, Bill, recalls how his friend CV Wood had to get permission from the President of the United States to create a channel under London Bridge. US president Lyndon B. Johnson had to be persuaded by Wood to sign off on the channel “Woody told me the [plan] was to build the bridge on dry land and dredge it out, but they applied for a permit and got denied,” says Bill. Wood was told such permission could be only be granted by the highest authority in the land, so he used his connections to secure a 10-minute audience with Lyndon Johnson, only to be told by the president: “Sorry, you can’t set this precedent. You can’t move a river.” “Woody said the pressure was really on,” says Bill. “He was a Texas boy and so was Johnson, so he started talking with this Texan accent. “He said ‘by golly, the next time someone buys London Bridge and moves it to the US, well, you’ll have to move another damn river’. “Johnson looked at Woody and said, ‘sign it’ [to an aide about the necessary paperwork] and left the room.” Wood, right, was an instrumental part in McCulloch’s plan It wasn’t the only time Wood - who was married to Hollywood actress Joanne Dru - put his famed persuasiveness into action. He is also said to have taken less than two hours to convince 16 environmental agencies opposed to the bridge to get on board. “The reality is RP was an engineer, an entrepreneur,” says Michael. “But CV, he was a showman; he could sell ice to Eskimos. “That’s why they were so good together. They made a good pair.” The first stone arrived in Lake Havasu on 9 July 1968, its swift delivery in part because work had begun to take it down long before McCulloch had signed a cheque for $2.46m. Alan Saines numbered the pieces as they came off the bridge in London. “There was only me numbering them and there were hundreds. If we did 20 a week, we were lucky. “It wasn’t a case of smashing it; the [stones] had to be taken down carefully and stored carefully and all the time they were building the new bridge.” Alan Saines was 17 when he got his first job, taking down the bridge Alan Simpson worked on the design of the new bridge for engineers Mott, Hay and Anderson. He said the old bridge came down in slices to make room for the new one. “The only way of doing it was to take down one side of the old bridge so there was just room for the new bridge, then move over to the other side, switch the traffic, then take down the rest of the bridge in the middle and tie [it] back together. “It was complicated. And it wasn’t until fairly late in the day that taking it all down carefully to ship halfway around the world became an additional requirement.” Dockers put the stones on to freighters bound for the US The stones were sent to Surrey Docks, where fellow Mott engineer Bernard Waterworth would consult a long-range telescopic photo of the bridge and direct some pieces on to freighters bound for Long Beach, California, via the Panama Canal. Others first went to Merrivale Quarry in Devon, where the faces were sliced off to cut down on shipping costs, before continuing their 5,000-plus mile journey. “It was an historic monument and you were aware it was unusual,” explains Bernard. “You don’t forget it - projects like that are few and far between.” About 10,600 stones arrived in Lake Havasu, making the final leg of the journey by road on flatbed trucks. Curious tourists would line the roads to watch them trundle into the storage compound, where the stones were unloaded and put in order, ready to be used by construction crews. The interior of the bridge was sold for $2.5m and made into counter-tops and headstones “We would see the trucks coming down the highway and we would sit and watch them go by,” says Norma Grzesiowski, who had just moved to nearby Desert Hills. ""We were thinking, ‘what are they doing? What are they building?’” The cornerstone was lowered by Sir Gilbert Inglefield as McCulloch and Wood looked on “We decided to steal some of the stones and the four of us were in my ’53 Chevy station wagon waiting with bolt-cutters to get in the yard,” remembers Rick Kingsbury. “But those things weighed three times as much as my car did! The ground was shaking as they went by on those eight-axle trucks. “We thought... ‘well that’s a bad idea’.” About 10,600 stones arrived in Lake Havasu on flatbed trucks.

The ground was shaking as they went by on those eight-axle trucks. “We thought... ‘well that’s a bad idea’.” The cornerstone was laid on 23 September 1968 in a ceremony attended by London’s lord mayor. Then work to resurrect the bridge began, starting with the arches, which were laid across the sand. The rebuild began by calculating the angle of the arches “You just saw the skeleton going up, and then they put the face on,” says Norma, who used to sit in a boat on the lake and watch. “The builders explained it was like putting together a puzzle. It was exciting, but it was surreal.” Construction workers had to build the bridge in the sweltering Arizona heat The rest was built around the framework in reinforced concrete. To avoid the sinking fate of its 133,000-tonne predecessor, it was made hollow and finished with a veneer of stone, making it 33,000 tonnes. “It almost felt like I was in a movie,” says former labourer Roy Martin, who helped winch the stones. “People were always coming up to us and asking questions, wanting to take pictures and wanting to know if we had any extra pieces they could take home as souvenirs.” The stones were manoeuvred in by hand and secured with pins, wire and concrete. The work was slow and laborious - crews had to force the 400-500lb pieces in one at a time. On a good day they’d get through 10; the worst was one. If a stone was too damaged to use, it had to be replaced, says Harvey Robertson, who laid steps on the south side of the bridge. But the local rock didn’t match that which had been blackened by a century of London pollution. “It was a lighter colour, so they had these kerosene burners making soot,” he recalls. “Then they painted it on there to make it look dark and weathered, so people wouldn’t know they weren’t the original stones.” The dredge swung across the channel, eating out a path for the water Once the bridge was up, the dunes were sucked out of the arches to make way for the president-approved channel. The land underneath the structure was dredged, allowing London Bridge to tower above a waterway for the first time since it had left Britain. “I remember thinking at the time McCulloch had more money than sense,” says Harvey. “But once I started working on it, I thought he was pretty much a genius.” On 10 October 1971, Lake Havasu’s London Bridge opened to great fanfare. The British were out in force, represented by a delegation from London accompanied by a troupe of red-jacketed horse-riders trotting through the desert. McCulloch, London's lord mayor Sir Peter Studd and Wood attended the dedication The  English Village offered a taste of home with its red phone box, double-decker bus and pub serving Yorkshire pudding and roast beef. But the jewel was the bridge, with the British and US flags flying down both sides. Riders on horseback made a strange sight against the desert backdrop “The whole place was just buzzing,” says Norma Grzesiowski. “They had a big tent down there on the bridge and lots of events and games going on. “I remember them releasing the birds and they had a big hot-air balloon with the British flag on. It was breathtaking - such an exciting thing to be part of.” There was a party atmosphere as the anticipation built According to a report in the Lake Havasu City Herald at the time, some 50,000 people lined the roads to watch the celebrations. The gala featured a float-filled parade and the dramatic release of 30,000 balloons and 3,000 birds, to a backdrop of “home at last” which had been scrawled across the sky. The dedication day festivities were an explosion of colour Bobbi Holmes performed in the opening ceremony - an experience, she jokes, that scarred her for life. “I was a member of the pom-pom girls and we did a dance. We were carrying these pom-poms and doing this routine and my arms felt so heavy. I thought, ‘I never want to be in a parade again’. “But it was really fun and people came from all over. The English Village reminded me of Disneyland, which I later realised was because CV was behind it. “It was pretty, sparkly, clean, with beautiful flowers. It was kind of magical.” On 10 October 1971, Lake Havasu’s London Bridge opened to great fanfare.

It was kind of magical.” “Everyone came out,” says Joni Echelberger, whose family had not long moved from Illinois. “My aunt and uncle got to have the $100 dinner in the big tent and I was so jealous because I wanted to be in there. “We were outside waiting and waiting and waiting for the fireworks and they wouldn’t go off until the celebration was done [so] they didn’t go off until midnight. “For such  a  small  community,  it  was  really a  big  deal.” A long red carpet led to the huge striped tent Joe Hunnicutt remembers a “crazy” day that was bursting with community pride. But he tells a different story about those birds, claiming McCulloch hadn’t been able to find doves as planned. Instead, he mainly settled for pigeons. “I remember standing there with my dad and he was wearing his blazer and tie, smoking a cigar, and he says, ‘You know, I think McCulloch is going to regret this particular decision.' “And since 10 October 1971, Lake Havasu City has been infested with pigeons. “They’re the joke and scourge of the town; you can’t get rid of them.” Six years later, McCulloch died from an accidental overdose of alcohol and pills. His death was keenly felt in the community he had built, where his legacy is remembered with a bronze statue and a road bearing his name. Early West, who worked for him for 40 years, describes him as a man who “thought number one about his employees” and remained down to earth. A statue of McCulloch and Wood stands at one end of the bridge “Bob was  a  rich  man,  but  he  was  pretty  common,” the 86-year-old says. “Ordinary people live on a certain level, and he didn’t get too much above that. “I never  noted  him  putting  himself  above  anyone  else.” Early West was convinced by McCulloch to move from the entrepreneur’s LA factory to Lake Havasu Fifty years on and people are still poking fun at McCulloch’s dream. At this year’s Academy Awards, host Jimmy Kimmel made a jibe about Lake Havasu while encouraging Oscar winners to keep their acceptance speeches short. His gag actually caused a surge in interest in the resort - not that it really needed the help. According to the state tourist board, 3.65m people visited London Bridge in 2017 - making it Arizona’s third most popular attraction after the Grand Canyon and the Glen Canyon national parks. Thousands of tourists have pierced a map in the visitors’ centre with pins marking their home state McCulloch’s grandson Michael says people come because they’re ""curious"". It’s a word that sums up Lake Havasu perfectly. Driving in from Highway 95, the billboards scream “Visit the home of the London Bridge”. Before long, a flash of blue appears - not a desert mirage, but the waters of the Colorado River filling the city’s man-made lake up ahead. Then before you know it, the bridge appears, dominating a landscape peppered with fast food outlets, hotels and palm trees. It’s a surreal moment, even though you’ve been warned what to expect. For the 52,000 residents that call Lake Havasu City home, the bridge is just a part of everyday life, providing the only access to and from the marina and the homes perched on the first spit of land purchased by McCulloch back in 1958. And although the whole project cost about $12m, McCulloch is said to have recouped his costs before the last brick had even been laid in its new home. The English Village was recently refurbished after standing derelict for years Today, the resort thrives not just on tourism from the bridge, but from income from water sports enthusiasts and college kids on spring break. The calm lake and sunny weather have made the city a legitimate holiday destination - an outcome even its founder would probably not have predicted. That a sinking bridge in London would be the making of a city in Arizona is a testament to McCulloch. But that it became such a success is down to boldness, determination and belief - a reflection, perhaps, of the American spirit. Michael McCulloch says Lake Havasu was his grandfather's ""pride and joy"" “The bridge changed things immensely, I don’t know what the city would be like if it wasn’t here,” reflects Michael. “It was [supposed to be] a retirement resort but it’s turned into a sustainable economy and a lot of people are born here and have chosen not to leave. “I think RP would be amazed by that.” Built with Shorthand"
You're losing everything - but you donât understand why,"A run of bad luck leaves one man struggling to make sense of the UK benefits system. Very soon he is left with no income and at risk of losing the roof over his head. Can he find his way through a bafflingly complex maze of rules? Put yourself in his shoes. Your name is Tony Rice. You're the sort of bloke who gets along with everyone. Always making people laugh. Ever since you left school you've been in and out of all sorts of jobs. Manual labour, mostly - builder, dustman, crane driver, painter and decorator. Hawker Siddeley, the aerospace company - you like it there, until the factory shuts. You split up with your girlfriend so you ask your mum to put you up until you can sort out a flat. Save a few quid. You're very close to your mum and dad. They're your best friends, really. Your dad has lung cancer and needs a bit of looking after. You take him for a drive most days because he doesn't like staying in all the time. He's like you, not a man to sit about. At one time he worked three jobs, all at once. Still does half an hour each morning in the garden. So you're back in the council house in Chingford, north-east London, that you've called home since you were eight years old - even after you left. Your sisters have moved out and had kids of their own but you want to take care of your mum and dad, same as they took care of you. And then you get a big shock. Suddenly, unexpectedly, your mum dies in hospital, two weeks after she has a replacement heart valve fitted. It's the day before she's supposed to get out. Her death is hard for you to accept. You don't know how to process your grief. All through your 43 years on Earth so far you've always tried to be tough. You don't cry at the funeral. You want to be strong for your sisters. You want to just get on with it. But the depression creeps up and up on you. It's just you and your dad in the house now. You've become his full-time carer - there's no-one else left to look after him now mum is gone. Anything he needs, you do it for him. His cancer spreads from his lungs to his other organs until, inevitably, it kills him. Two parents gone within two years. And now you're alone in the house. The council says you have to move to a flat, so you pack up and go. You like it. Decent size, first floor, communal gardens, nice neighbours. It needs doing up but you aren't afraid of putting a bit of work in. You want to go back to work again so you go door-to-door selling Avon products. You start to notice your neck feels stiff. Your back, too. Must be from all that physical labour over the years. Plus a couple of road accidents you had when you were younger. Once a driver did a U-turn in front of you when you were on your motorbike. Your knees hit the car first then you went over the roof and landed on your head. Years ago, this was. There's this bloke you get to know. Friend of a friend. You fetch his paper every morning. Sometimes he cooks for you in return. One day he invites you in for a drink. You go indoors and take a seat. There's another fella there. You accept a drink from the friend of a friend. He's been drinking already. Then he starts getting a bit loud, so you ask him to keep it down. He doesn't like that. Comes over and hits you. You're still in your chair. You get up and have a pop in retaliation, then the other fella separates you. There's an unopened packet of knives in the room. You see it happening in slow motion. The friend of a friend selects a knife from the packet. You don't think he's going to use it, but then he does. He stabs you in the thigh. You try to grab the knife to defend yourself. You get cut again in your arm and around your eye. Right, you say.I'm getting out of here. You turn to leg it. ""Don't tell anyone about this,"" he says, and then he sticks the knife in your shoulder blade. That's the worst one. You thought this bloke was all right. You thought he was your mate. You got that wrong. You go to hospital. They fix you up and send you home but the pain is still bad. Your back and your neck. What's worse, you can't stop thinking about the attack. Reliving it over and over. Lying awake. The friend of a friend is jailed for the stabbing but that doesn't stop your paranoia. You walk down the road looking at every single car that passes, every motorbike. They might be coming for you. You see a pizza delivery bloke. He's looking for an address. You think he might be a hitman coming after you. He stops and looks at you. You think you're going to be attacked again. You don't trust anyone. You used to be really fit. Cycled all the time. Now you can't. And you love your cycling. All your muscles lock up. Every time you wake up in the morning, you're aching. You go to your GP. He examines you and signs you off work for six months. He says you have post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. There's no way you can work. You're also diagnosed with muscular arthritis. That, plus the scars from the knife attack, means it's painful to turn your neck or lift your arms above shoulder height. You're on something called Employment Support Allowance. ESA. Minimum-level state benefits, that means. It's for people who can't work because of ill health or disability. You get housing benefit as well, which goes straight to the council to pay for the flat. Then a few weeks later the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) calls you in. It's a work capability assessment, they say. There's a form to fill in first about what you can and can't do. Can you pick up a Â£1 coin?  Can you raise a hand to your head? Well, just about, though it's painful. You go along and the person assessing you says you're fit for work. You say you're not. Your GP agrees that you're not. But the assessor's opinion outweighs any other. Your benefits are stopped - both the ESA and the housing benefit. You've got no money coming in. Nothing. You're falling in arrears with your rent. Friends are feeding you. You go to your local food bank. It's embarrassing. You don't like it. But the one round the corner isn't too bad. They don't ask any questions. You just go there and get your stuff. You push your bike, the bike you can't ride any more. They give you pasta, potatoes, tins of soup, couscous - you don't like the couscous much but you take it anyway, it's not like you can afford to be choosy. Then you hang the shopping bags on the bike and push it home in the rain. You're losing weight because of the lack of food. You're still in pain. You're still depressed. You used to be really outgoing. You liked talking to people and going out and doing stuff but now you're just not in the mood. The council apply for a possession order of your flat. They go to court and get one, suspended. They won't take the flat off you if you can make payments towards the arrears - Â£300 a month. You keep going back to the Job Centre and asking if they can do anything for you. And finally - after seven months with no money coming in whatsoever, the DWP tells you that you can go on a new benefit called Universal Credit - the part of it that replaces Jobseeker's Allowance. They told you before you weren't eligible, but apparently now you are. You don't understand what's changed. There's no explanation. It seems as though there's been a mistake somewhere. Now you get Â£414.33 for your rent and Â£317.82 for living costs. It's different from the benefits you were on before. Before, the Housing Benefit was paid direct to the council for your rent. Now, you get the housing costs and the living costs paid directly to you in one lump sum - one of the features of Universal Credit introduced by your local MP, Iain Duncan Smith. Except you don't realise this - that the money is no longer going direct to the council and you need to sort it out yourself. No-one explained it to you, not in a way you understood, at least. You end up going even further into arrears with the rent. A new benefit for working-age people that replaces six benefits - including Jobseeker's Allowance and Housing Benefit - and merges them into one payment It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler, and to ensure no-one is better off claiming benefits than working But it has proved controversial from the beginning, with reports of IT issues, massive overspends and administrative problems What is Universal Credit - and what's the problem? Because you've been assessed fit for work, you're supposed to spend 35 hours a week looking for a job. But when the DWP summon you to a jobseeker's meeting to ask what you're doing to find work, you don't get the message. No-one tells you. There's no letter - not one that reaches you, anyway. It could be that they've sent you the message electronically - but you're no good with computers. You don't have one at home and the sole time you tried to use one down the Job Centre you didn't know what half the keys did. So because you don't turn up to the jobseeker's meeting, you get what is called a sanction - that means they stop the Â£317.82 for monthly living costs. You know nothing about this. You don't actually work out that you've been sanctioned for 212 days. You just know there is less money coming in. All you have to live on is the Â£414.33 that's supposed to be for housing costs. But you're still paying the council Â£300 a month for the earlier rent arrears - which means you are left with Â£114.33 a month to subsist on. That's Â£26.38 a week. You can't survive on that. And, once again, you can't pay the rent. You're back to relying on food banks and donations from friends. You take the bracelet you wear around your wrist to the pawnbroker. It's still not enough. It seems that every time you go to the Job Centre, someone gives you a different story about what you should be doing. You try to phone the DWP to sort things out, but no-one seems able to help you there, either. Each phone call costs you something like Â£8 - the claimant helpline is premium rate from mobiles and you haven't got a landline. Your rent arrears are now in excess of Â£10,000. The council seeks a court order for your eviction. You're looking at spending Christmas on the streets. You go to see a legal adviser. You haven't been able to see a lawyer until now, because benefits law isn't covered by legal aid any more, but some housing law is. Your lawyer and a Citizens Advice caseworker can't make head nor tail of what's going on at first. Eventually, they work out that you've been sanctioned. They write to the Universal Credit department repeatedly to ask for an explanation - it takes a long time for them to figure out why you have been sanctioned and what you could do to get the sanction lifted. But first you have to go to court to try and avoid eviction. Your legal adviser is a man called Simon Mullings. He tells you how serious the situation is. He's not going to sugar-coat it for you. The council are trying to be reasonable, he says, but they have a statutory duty to recover the lost rent. If you lose this case you'll be homeless. You sit through three very scary hearings as your legal team argues your case. You have a barrister, Mary-Rachel McCabe. She tells your whole Kafkaesque story to the judge. ""Tony has been failed by a malfunctioning system,"" she says. ""From the moment Tony claimed Universal Credit last year, he suffered the consequences of its arbitrary rules and procedures, and so was immediately plunged into further rent arrears and other debt."" The judge is visibly shocked. The system is ""appalling"", she says. McCabe tells the court that the sanction and the finding that you are fit for work are now being challenged with the help of a benefits adviser from Citizens Advice. If that's successful it will give you an extra Â£317.82 a month and allow you to pay your rent. A new court hearing is set for May. That's a reprieve. If you can show a pattern of payment by then, maybe you won't be evicted. Mullings, your legal advisor, tells you it might not feel like it, but you're one of the lucky ones. At least because this was a housing case you had legal representation. If you hadn't, you would have been steamrollered. The court you've been going to, Edmonton County Court, has seen lots of similar Universal Credit cases, Mullings says. Other courts that he works in nearby - Stratford, Romford - they're not seeing these cases yet, because Universal Credit hasn't been rolled out into those areas. ""But they're coming down the line,"" says Mullings. ""So this is the vanguard of a tsunami of Universal Credit problems. Unless the government radically changes tack."" For you, though, things are looking up. It's still a struggle but it's getting a bit better. You feel like you can't move on while this is hanging over you. You want to get stronger. Like you used to be. Nothing ever used to get you down. ""I've always tried my best, even though my body really hurts,"" you say. ""I just keep going, I'm like that. But the pressure - I can't think straight, I can't concentrate on one thing any more. I think about nothing but my problems."" A friend asks if you've seen a film called I, Daniel Blake. It's about a man caught up in the nightmare bureaucracy of the benefits system. You haven't had time to watch it. But you say you should play the lead in the sequel. Your name is Tony Rice, and you're not going to let this break you.
