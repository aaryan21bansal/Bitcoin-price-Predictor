Bumper BBC audience for Eurovision and FA Cup final,"This video can not be played Watch highlights of the Eurovision show Nearly nine million people in the UK watched the Eurovision Song Contest on BBC One on Saturday, which saw the UK come second to winners Ukraine. Figures were considerably up on last year, when an average of 7.4 million watched as the UK scored ""nul points"". TV audience numbers for the Turin show peaked at 10.6 million, the BBC said The Eurovision broadcast followed on the heels of BBC One's coverage of the FA Cup final, which drew an average audience of nearly six million. Viewing numbers soared in the final half hour of the match at Wembley, which sawLiverpool beat Chelsea 6-5 on penalties- peaking at eight million. There were also four million stream requests for the coverage across the BBC's digital platforms. The live game was also shown on ITV1 where the audience averaged 1.6m. peaking at 2.6m. December's Strictly Come Dancing final averaged 11 million viewers, while theQueen's Christmas message drew an audience of 8.96 million. Liverpool""s Kostas Tsimikas celebrated with the trophy after a tense conclusion to the game High hopes accompanied this year's British entry to the Eurovision. Sam Ryder was one of the favourites to win the competition with his song Space Man - and topped the jury vote midway through proceedings on Saturday night, after two consecutive years of the UK coming last. But, at close to midnight BST, a huge surge of public support in the popular vote propelled Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra to victory. Their winning song, Stefania, combined old Ukrainian folk melodies and traditional flute with contemporary rap and hip-hop beats.

PM due in Northern Ireland amid political crisis,"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson talks about ""unnecessary barriers"" on goods coming into Northern Ireland. Stormont's political parties have criticised the prime minister after a series of ""robust"" meetings on Monday. Boris Johnson was at Hillsborough Castle to encourage the parties to re-form Northern Ireland's institutions after the assembly election. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has withheld its support until the government takes ""decisive action"" on post-Brexit trade arrangements. Mr Johnson said a ""legislative solution"" was needed. Unionist politicians have protested against theNorthern Ireland Protocol, a part of the UK-EU Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods. This ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, but it has introduced some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The assembly election on 5 May cemented a majority for those who accept the protocol, A majority of politicians elected in the NI Assembly election on 5 May - including those of the new largest party, Sinn FÃ©in - accept the protocol,but it is opposed by unionist politicians. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to make a statement on the government's plans to act on the protocol on Tuesday, with the government poised to introduce legislation that could override parts of the Brexit deal. This video can not be played The UK government is to introduce legislation that will allow it to override parts of the Brexit deal ""We would love this to be done in a consensual way with our friends and partners, ironing out the problems, stopping some of these barriers east-west,"" Mr Johnson said about the protocol after meeting Stormont's five main parties. ""But to get that done, to have the insurance we need, we need to proceed with a legislative solution at the same time. ""We don't want to scrap it (the protocol), but we think it can be fixed."" Most politicians elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly want the protocol to remain Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald, whose party delegation was the first to meet the prime minister, accused Mr Johnson of unacceptable and obstructionist tactics in relation to the protocol. She said the government was placating the DUP and that Mr Johnson gave ""no straight answers"" during a ""very tough meeting"" at Hillsborough Castle in County Down. ""The British government is in a game of brinkmanship with the European institutions, indulging a section of political unionism which believes it can frustrate and hold society to ransom,"" she said. Following his party's meeting, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he did not have details of the government's proposals for dealing with the protocol, but that he would judge Mr Johnson's plan by actions, not words. On the return of Northern Ireland's political institutions, he said: ""We cannot have power-sharing unless there is a consensus. That consensus doesn't exist."" When asked if he had appealed to the DUP to return to Stormont, the prime minister replied: ""You bet, I said to the DUP in particular we want to see you back in the executive, we want to see you nominating, we want to see a Speaker in the assembly."" A number of protesters gathered in Hillsborough, County Down, on Monday ahead of Boris Johnson's visit Mr Johnson was booed and jeered by about 200 people as his cavalcade arrived at Hillsborough. Among them were campaigners forIrish language legislation, anti-Brexit activists and victims' campaigners objecting to the government's proposed legislation fordealing with legacy cases from the Troubles. The DUP, which supported Brexit, has argued the protocol has eroded the foundations devolution was built on and undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK. Despite signing up to the deal himself, Mr Johnson agreed changes were needed. Writing in the Belfast Telegraph,external, the prime minister said the protocol was out of date and did not reflect the reality of a post-Covid era with a European war and a cost of living crisis. He added that he was open to dialogue but warned the UK would have to act if the EU did not change its position. On Monday, Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said there were solutions to ""many of the issues that are being raised particularly from the unionists and the business communities"" about the protocol. ""This is not a time for unilateral action, announcing legislation which would essentially breach international law, undermine an international treaty and create a lot of unnecessary tensions between Brussels and London,"" he added. US Congressman Bill Keating, chair of the House sub-committee on Europe, said the government's action on the protocol had been ""a grave concern"" in the US and it ""undercuts the Good Friday Agreement"". ""You don't get round international agreements you were party toâ¦ by undercutting it with domestic unilateral legislation,"" he told BBC Radio 4's The World Tonight.

The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal:It means goods can pass freely between Northern Ireland (in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (in the European Union) Basically, lorries don't have to stopand prove their goods follow EU rules when they cross the border Instead, checks are donewhen goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland, Wales) The border is a sensitive issue because ofNorthern Ireland's violent pastand politicians do not want new checkpoints there Butthe protocol is unpopular with unionist politicians(who support Northern Ireland being part of the UK). They say it means Northern Ireland is treated differently from England, Scotland and Wales The UK government has hinted that itcould drop parts of the protocol, but the EU says it could retaliate Read more:A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Ros Atkins onâ¦ The Northern Ireland Protocol What do voters think of NI Protocol? How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed A senior UK government source said that barring any last minute changes, the government would introduce the legislation to strip away parts of the protocol to enable easier trade. Such legislation would have to go through parliament however, which could take months. Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said she received no straight answers from the prime minister on the NI Protocol Some fear that should the UK act unilaterally, it could spark retaliation from European countries and ultimately a trade war - the last thing many businesses and households want at the time of a cost of living crisis. The EU has acknowledged the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses. In October, it put forward proposals which, it said, would cut paperwork and checks on goods entering NI from Great Britain. However, the UK rejected these plans last week saying they would make things worse. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill also met the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin on Monday. Herparty won the most seats in May's historic electionbut cannot take up that power-sharing role without the DUP agreeing to enter government in Northern Ireland. After meeting Boris Johnson, Ms McDonald said he had indicated there were plans ""to fix rather than scrap the protocol"". The DUP was among the parties to meet Boris Johnson in Hillsborough on Monday Mr Donaldson said he had waited ""a long time for this moment"" for government proposals and said the EU had harmed the Good Friday Agreement by not respecting Northern Ireland's place in the UK. Alliance Party deputy leader Stephen Farry said his meeting with Mr Johnson had been a frustrating engagement with ""robust exchanges"". ""We've seen a lot of soft words from the prime minister, an attempt at some sort of consensual way forward, but those words belie the fact that tomorrow Liz Truss is set to make a statement to parliament setting out the basis of the UK taking unilateral action on the protocol,"" he said. Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie said the prime minister had ""made it clear"" to him that he intended to bring forward legislation to deal with protocol concerns. ""The protocol really does need to be dealt with so we can move forward,"" he said. Mr Beattie said the assembly and executive should be restored if the government signalled in the next week that it would bring forward measures. The Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader Colum Eastwood said his meeting with Mr Johnson had also been ""robust"". ""If the British government tomorrow signal their intent to break international law by legislating to rip up the protocol at Westminster he will not have the support of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland,"" Mr Eastwood said. The UK government and unionist parties have made the case that the protocol is damaging the Northern Ireland economy but the evidence for that is inconclusive. A free market think-tank has repeated the claim the protocol is costing Â£850m a year. The report by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA) is based on a previous estimate by the Ulster University economist Esmond Birnie. Read more: How the protocol affects NI's economy That research has previously been used by the DUP to bolster its case against the protocol but the research used a limited dataset and then added the cost of what the UK government is spending on mitigation measures. Last week, the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchsuggested Northern Ireland's economy has slightly outperformed the UK average, partially due to the protocol.

Unilateral action on protocol 'may erode peace',"Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney says the EU is flexible and want to compromise Unilateral action by the UK government to change post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland could undermine the peace process, Ireland's foreign minister has warned. Simon Coveney accepted there was a need to address unionist concerns about how the protocol was working. He said there would be a ""consequence"" if the UK's actions created significant uncertainty on the island of Ireland. A UK minister said an EU trade war with the UK would be ""self-defeating"". The prime minister will visit Northern Ireland to speak to parties on Monday. Boris Johnson is expected to tell political leadersany action on the protocol must restore power-sharing. Mr Johnson's visit coincides with increased speculation that the UK government is poised to introduce legislation to strip away parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol - now under fresh scrutiny following the 5 May assembly election - was designed to ensure free trade could continue across the Irish land border. The election cemented a majority for assembly members who accept the protocol, including the new largest party,  Sinn FÃ©in, but it has been opposed by unionist politicians. Following the election, the anti-protocol Democratic Unionist Party has refused to engage with the assembly. A new administration cannot be formed without them. Mr Coveney said the way to deal with the problems around the protocol was continued dialogue between the EU and UK. He also warned that any move by London to walk away from the arrangements would ""send headlines around the world that Britain is prepared to break international law"". ""What I see at the moment is a British government making statements and briefing against the EU, and creating a lot of tension in my country, your closest neighbour, and also potentially being on the verge of making a decision that could fundamentally undermine the functioning of the institutions of the peace process in Northern Ireland,"" he told Sophy Ridge on Sunday on Sky News. Most politicians elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly want the protocol to remain Mr Coveney said the EU was flexible and wanted compromise. ""What's happening at the moment has forced Ireland into taking a much more strident position and responding honestly to the unhelpful briefing that we're getting from very, very senior levels of the government this week,"" he added. He said the briefings ""seems to be laying the groundwork for a decision, I believe, could be deeply harmful to the relationship between Britain and Ireland if we don't see sense in the next few days"". This video can not be played Watch: The business secretary says he does not think there will be a trade war if the UK overrides the Northern Ireland protocol But Mr Kwarteng said the government's priority was political stability in Northern Ireland, adding ""if that means re-looking at the protocol, we absolutely have to do that"". ""I don't think there is going to be a trade war. There has been a lot of talk, a lot of threats about what the EU will or won't do. That is up to them,"" he told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem What do voters think of the NI Protocol? How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed Simon Hoare, chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, has accused the government of ""testosterone sabre rattling"" in the dispute over the protocol. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, the Conservative MP said Foreign Secretary Liz Truss had been a ""little too muscular"" in negotiations with the EU. He admitted the protocol was not perfect but the way to improve it was through ""dispute resolution mechanisms"" already agreed. ""It's frankly a naive nonsense for the government to ask anybody to believeâ¦ that it didn't understand what it signed up to,"" he added. ""You sign agreements, you understand the small print and if you don't you shouldn't be signing it."" The protocol,a part of the UK-EU Brexit dealwhich keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, puts a trade border in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The DUP has argued the protocol has eroded the foundations devolution has been built upon and undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK. The EU has acknowledged that the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and it put forward proposals in October to try to ease that burden - it said they would mean a reduction in paperwork and checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. However, last week the UK rejected these plans saying they would make things worse. A spokesperson for No 10 saidMr Johnson would hold private meetings with the partiesand the UK government would ""play its part to ensure political stability"". The prime minister is expected to say there is ""no substitute for strong local leadership"". On Monday, Mr Johnson will say that the UK and EU's shared objective should be for a reformed protocol to enjoy a majority support when it faces a consent vote at Stormont in 2024. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says his party will not support the election of a Speaker and deputy speakers until their concerns are resolved The DUP's move to block the election of a speaker on Friday means the Northern Ireland Assembly cannot function. The party said its actions sent a clear message about its opposition to the protocol. On Saturday, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald accused the prime minister of being ""in cahoots"" with the DUP. Ms McDonald said the protocol was going nowhere and both she and would-be first minister Michelle O'Neill would be telling Mr Johnson so on Monday.

Why were NI leaders given unequal job titles?,"Former First Minister David Trimble and former Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon in 1998 Why are Northern Ireland's leaders called the first minister and deputy first ministers when both roles are the same? Despite the unequal job titles, the two leaders have identical powers and responsibilities and one cannot rule without the other. Who got to to be first minister was a major issue throughout the 2022 election campaign, so why is it so important to be considered a first among equals? Although it is a joint office, the current distinction is that the first minister's role can only be held by Stormont's biggest party, which until now has always been a unionist party. Last week, for the first time in history, an Irish nationalist party has the right to nominate a first minister afterSinn FÃ©in won the most seats in last week's Northern Ireland Assembly election. However, they still need the co-operation of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - the second largest party in Northern Ireland - in order to take the post and form a government. Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill (centre) could be in line for the first minister's job, but needs DUP support The posts were established under the 1998 Belfast Agreement, commonly known as the Good Friday Agreement. The deal helped to end decades of violence in Northern Ireland known as the Troubles, as unionists and nationalists agreed to share power in a new devolved government. From the very beginning, the joint roles were steeped in symbolism, according to one of the architects of the agreement, Mark Durkan from the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). But the initial symbolism was meant to promote reconciliation, not hierarchy, he said. The SDLP proposed a joint office of first ministers, to be elected with cross-community support from both unionist and nationalist assembly members. According to Mr Durkan, the insistence that the leaders be called first and deputy first ministers came from the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), which was then the biggest political party in Northern Ireland. ""While the ministers would have joint and equal powers and functions that could only be exercised jointly and equally, they did insist on a differential as far as the titles were concerned,"" he recalls. The UUP had spent much of the talks opposing the idea of having any devolved ministers at Stormont. As the talks progressed the UUP agreed to set up a power-sharing executive led by two ministers, but wanted the job titles to differ. ""They believed that was going to be important to how they could sell this change in their position to their members, and indeed, to the wider unionist public,"" Mr Durkan says. ""So basically we were faced with letting the talks break down on the question of the names or getting substantive agreement on this institutional model."" Former UUP leader Sir Reg Empey was the party's chief negotiator during the All-Party Talks. He said there was a realisation the first-past-the-post Westminster model wasn't going to work for devolved government in Northern Ireland. ""You weren't going to get buy-in from nationalism. We had to look for a different model,"" he recalls. ""Scottish devolution was coming to fruition and we wanted a bit of consistency within the UK if possible."" Originally, the UUP favoured a local government model run on a committee basis. ""We came under pressure from a number of sources. People felt that you needed to have ministers who were identifiably heads of department and government,"" added Sir Reg. Michelle O'Neill lost her job in February when the DUP's Paul Givan quit as first minister If a first minister quits, the deputy first minister automatically loses their job and vice versa. This safeguard was put in place to protect the principal of power-sharing but it has also leftStormont without a functioning government for more than a third of its lifespan. Some of Stormont's power couples got on better than others. Firebrand DUP founder Ian Paisley and former IRA man Martin McGuinness of Sinn FÃ©in laughed so much together that the media nicknamed them the Chuckle Brothers. Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness after being sworn in to office in 2007 Mr McGuinness did not appear to object when Mr Paisley regularly referred to him as ""the deputy"", but after the DUP leader retired, Mr McGuinness angrily rebuked another DUP member for using the term. ""I'm not the deputy. I'm the deputy first minister in a department where there is equality between the first minister and myself. And don't you ever forget it,"" he said in 2009. Sinn FÃ©in began regularly using the term ""joint first ministers"" and in 2015 Mr McGuinness proposed a formal change to the titles, but there was no agreement. The word ""deputy"" is sometimes wrongly played up by the media, according to Mark Durkan, who served as deputy first minister alongside David Trimble in 2001. He said their joint leadership was respected and he was never made to feel anything less than Mr Trimble's equal, including during international visits. David Trimble and Mark Durkan pictured on the day they were jointly elected as leaders in 2001 Initially both posts were jointly elected by the assembly with cross-community support from both unionist and nationalist members. That rule changed in 2006, when theSt Andrews Agreement,externalgave Stormont's biggest party first pick for the first minister's job. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in agreed the move but both the UUP and SDLP strongly opposed it. ""The decision to change this at St Andrews so that the first minister would come from the largest party - regardless of whether or not it was part of the largest designation - was a major mistake which we warned about at the time,"" a UUP spokesperson said. The party has tried to reverse the rule change on a number of occasions - just a few months ago its peer Lord Empey proposed an amendment in the House of Lords. Allow Twitter content?

Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance all previously lobbied to rename Stormont's top jobs to properly reflect their equal status. But during this year's election campaign Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald indicated her party's position has changed since Martin McGuinness suggested a joint office of first minister in 2015. ""Martin didn't get a very positive response to his proposal at the time,"" Ms McDonald said to the BBC's The View last month. ""I'm not proposing that we change the job title."" The UUP said any change ""would need to be done after the widest possible negotiations and consultations so as to avoid a repetition of the seedy back door deal that emerged at St Andrews"". Mr Durkan said that renaming the roles to reflect the joint and equal nature of the office would be the ""mature thing to do"". Sinn FÃ©in: What happens now in Northern Ireland?

Labour to call vote on energy firm windfall tax,"This video can not be played Ed Miliband: It's shameful not to bring in a windfall tax Labour will call for a vote on Tuesday to introduce a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, saying it is shameful not to introduce the measure to help tackle the rising cost of living. Shadow minister Ed Miliband told the BBC it was obscene the government had refused to bring in the policy. A windfall taxis a one off levy on companies enjoying unexpected profits. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said it was a bad idea that would deter firms from investing in the UK. But a Treasury source said the option was ""not off the table"". Opposition parties have repeatedly touted the idea of a windfall tax on the record profits of oil and gas companies, saying the money raised could be used to help those struggling the most with rising living costs. And Conservative chair of the Treasury Committee Mel Stride said although he would normally oppose it, the current ""extraordinary circumstances"" meant there was a case for looking at ""a one-off windfall tax"". He said the companies had made ""super-normal profits"" and some of that money should be ""channelled to those who are really struggling"". Sunak threatens energy firms with windfall tax How would a windfall tax on energy firms work? BP profits soar as calls for windfall tax grow Ministers had dismissed the policy, but attitudes within government appeared to warm this week, withChancellor Rishi Sunak threatening to introduce the measureif the firms did not invest enough in new projects. Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said the government would have to look at the proposal if not enough investment was made. Despite Mr Kwarteng's comments, a Treasury source told the BBC that the chancellor remained pragmatic about the idea and he still held the same position as earlier in the week. Labour's shadow chancellor, Rachel Reeves, accused the cabinet of being in ""complete chaos"" over whether to back the tax. Households in the UK are being hit with rising costs when it comes to fuel, energy and food, as inflation reaches a record high in the country. Labour, the SNP and the Liberal Democrats have all proposed using a windfall tax to raise money to support the hardest hit. A debate on the Queen's Speech is to be held on Tuesday, and Labour will put forward an amendment to allow the Commons to vote for or against the measure. Shadow climate change secretary - and former party leader - Mr Miliband told the BBC's Sunday Morning programme it would give Conservatives MPs a choice, saying: ""You can vote for a windfall tax or you can explain to your constituents why you are refusing to provide them the help that they need."" He added: ""I think it is obscene, frankly, that we have as a result of surging energy bills, oil and gas companies making billions of pounds in our country and the government refuses to put a windfall tax on them. It is shameful. ""The case for a windfall tax now is unanswerable... Everyday that goes by is sleepless nights for millions of people with this government refusing to help."" Mr Kwarteng said the government had already put forward Â£9bn of support for those struggling with their bills, including a Â£150 council tax rebate for rate payers. He said it was right for the chancellor not to ""take anything off the table"" four months ahead of the government's next budget. But despite hints at a change of direction from the government, the business secretary told Sunday Morning his own view was that he did not believe in windfall taxes. This video can not be played Kwarteng: I don't believe in windfall taxes Mr Kwarteng added: ""What you are taxing is investment in jobs, you are taxing investment in wealth creation, you are taxing investment in new technologies. ""And that is what we want to see, we want to see more investment. We don't want to see taxes that essentially act against any incentive to invest."" The minister said also called the policy a bad idea, and an old one, saying: ""I am not surprised that a Labour frontbencher is saying we should put up taxes - that's not something that is new to me.""

Drug use should be health issue - new police chief,"Drug use should be seen as a public health issue rather than a criminal justice problem, says Richard Lewis Drug-related deaths in Wales ""will continue to rise"" unless a different approach is taken, according to Dyfed-Powys Police's chief constable. Richard Lewis said he believed drug use should be seen as a public health issue rather than a criminal justice problem. He said evidence around decriminalisation of drugs should be taken from other countries, but admitted it was a ""political matter"". The Home Office said it was investing in treatment and recovery services. In 2020, there were 224 deaths due to drug poisoning registered in Wales,77% of which were related to heroin or morphine,external. According to Public Health Wales, deaths involving cocaine have been on the rise, representing 15% of all drug misuse death in 2020. Dyfed-Powys Police appoints new chief constable Chief constable wants single Welsh police force Mayor's drugs body to look at legalising cannabis What is a Section 60 stop and search? Speaking on theBBC Politics Wales programme, Mr Lewis said: ""Despite some notable successes in terms of seizures, we still see those drugs on our streets. ""Having spoken to numerous heroin addicts... I asked one heroin addict: 'As soon as we take your dealer out how soon is it before you are able to access drugs?' and he said: 'The same day'. ""If we keep doing things in the way that we have for the last 50 years... we will achieve the same results and deaths will continue to rise."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan has established anew group looking at whether to decriminalise cannabis. Chief constable Richard Lewis says there is a need for a public health response to drug addiction Asked if he supported decriminalisation of drugs for personal use,a policy adopted by countries such as Portugal, Dr Lewis said: ""I don't go that far. ""I think two things can be true at the same time. I think we can have a public health approach to those that suffer from drug use, those that are addicts, and we can have a criminal justice response to those that peddle drugs in our communities. ""But it's important that we do take evidence from other countries."" He said police powers to stop and search people ""takes drugs off our streets and that leads to convictions and imprisonments for those that offend"". Cardiff Universityresearch found black people were most likely to be stopped,external. According to the data for 2020-21, 56 out of every 1,000 black people were stopped and searched in Wales, compared to 28 per 1,000 people from a mixed ethnic background, 16 per 1,000 Asian people, and eight per 1,000 white people. In Wales, stop and search is thepower given to police to search an individual or vehicleif they have ""reasonable grounds"" to suspect the person is carrying, for example, illegal drugs or a weapon. Section 60 orders allow stop and searches to be carried out without requiring ""reasonable grounds"". Dyfed-Powys Police covers an area greater than half the size of Wales Mr Lewis said: ""Stop and search works - 16,000 knives and instruments were taken off the streets last year due to stop and search tactics. ""Any knife taken off the street is a good outcome... but it would be a pretty blunt instrument if the only thing we did as a criminal justice response was stop and search. ""It's important to say that those disproportionality figures are now dropping and that's a result I think of the work we've done with police officers to ensure they're adequately trained, understand bias and unconscious bias."" As Wales' newest chief constable, Mr Lewis has alsocalled for Wales' four police forces to be scrapped and replaced with a single nationwide service. The Home Office said the UK government's 10-year strategy would ""drive down drug supply and demand through tougher response to criminal supply chains"". ""We also know through our Project ADDER, which aims to cut drugs crime, how important local partnerships are to addressing drug use and this is why our strategy is focused on drug treatment and recovery services, with an additional Â£780m over three years specifically to rebuild those,"" it added. ""Additionally, the government is investing Â£300m dedicated funding to tackle drug supply and country lines over the next three years.""

US gunman deliberately sought black victims - mayor,"This video can not be played Watch: US President Joe Biden says ""we must work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America"" A gunman who killed 10 people at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, planned further attacks after the mass shooting on Saturday, police have said. The suspect, 18, drove more than 320km (200 miles) to carry out what is believed to be a racially-motivated crime. He planned to keep driving and ""shoot more black people,"" Buffalo's police chief told US media. A pensioner, a former policeman and a grandmother were among the victims. Mayor Byron Brown said the suspect arrived in Buffalo intending to take ""as many black lives as possible"". A 180-page document seemingly authored by the alleged attacker Payton Gendron has emerged, in which he describes himself as a fascist and a white supremacist. Questions are being asked about how he was able to carry out the shooting when concerns had already been raised. ""I want to know what people knew and when they knew it,"" New York Governor Kathy Hochul told ABC News. FBI officials have confirmed that the gunman spent a day and a half in hospital undergoing a mental health evaluation last year after he wrote that he wanted to commit a murder/suicide in a high school project. No criminal charges resulted from the incident, and Buffalo police chief Joseph Gramaglia told reporters the gunman had only made ""generalised threats"". He does not appear to have remained under watch by authorities. Mr Gramaglia told US media that there was evidence to suggest he wanted to targeted a second store on Saturday if he had not been stopped. On Monday, police said he had visited Buffalo in March and then again one day before the deadly mass shooting Residents held a candlelight vigil on Sunday near the site of the shooting Meanwhile, the gun store owner who sold the semi-automatic used in the attack told several US outlets that no alert came up when he ran the suspect's name through a government background check system. New York's Attorney General Letitia James said her office would focus on extremist material online. ""This event was committed by a sick, demented individual who was fuelled [by a] daily diet of hate,"" she said. The shooting has stunned the local community. One of those attending a vigil on Sunday told Reuters: ""It just hurts, why somebody would do that."" Ten died and  three others were injured. Of the 13 people shot, 11 were black. Among those reported killed were a man buying cupcakes for his son's birthday and a woman who had gone shopping after visiting her husband at a nursing home. By Mike Wendling, BBC Trending Christchurch, El Paso, Pittsburgh and now Buffalo - all places where racially-motivated assailants, radicalised online, have taken their ideology to deadly extremes. The gunman in Buffalo, like ones before, live-streamed his violent rampage and left a so-called ""manifesto"" online. It details his extremist beliefs and is packed with cherry-picked statistics, conspiracy theories and internet memes. The file contains reams of racist and anti-Semitic sludge along with straightforward admissions that the author is a fascist and a white supremacist. If the author can be believed - as the document also clearly contains disinformation and attempts to trick reporters into reporting false stories - he was radicalised early on during the Covid pandemic, on extremist websites and message boards. Like after the 2019 mosque shootings in Christchurch, big social media companies will struggle to remove footage of the attack. And surely the American debate over gun control will be reignited, however briefly. But the underlying problem seems as intractable as ever: a worldwide network of young violent extremists, some of whom are motivated to launch deadly attacks against innocent people. The attacker, dressed in military gear, drove into the car park at Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo - an area in which police said he had done ""reconnaissance"" the day before - at about 14:30 EST (19:30 BST) and began livestreaming the rampage. A security guard fired several shots back but the gunman's bulletproof vest stopped one that hit him, police said. He then killed the guard and stalked through the store firing at other people. Witnesses described horrific scenes. ""It's like a nightmare... you see this on TV, you hear about it on TV... but I never thought I would be one of them,"" said one. Among the victims was Katherine Massey, 72, who hadwritten in favour of federal gun legislation,externalfor her local paper less than a year ago. The gunman was arrested after the attack and has pleaded not guilty to murder charges. US President Joe Biden said facts were still being established but strongly condemned racist extremism. ""We must all work together to address the hate that remains a stain on the soul of America,"" he said. The White House said Mr Biden and the First Lady would travel to Buffalo on Tuesday to meet with the community. Saturday's attack is thought to be the worst mass shooting so far in the US in 2022. Some 40,000 deaths a year involve firearms in America, a figure that includes suicides - and mass shooting events occur frequently. Less than a day after the attack in New York state, one person was killed and five were injured in a shooting at a church in Orange County, in southern California. The gunman was a Chinese immigrant apparently motivated by hatred for Taiwanese people, authorities said on Monday. Churchgoers tackled him and tied him up by the ankles using an extension cord.

'Bodies everywhere' - Witnesses tell of Buffalo attack horror,"Witnesses to a racially-motivated attack at a New York state supermarket have been describing the horrific moment an 18-year-old white man pulled out a gun and began a shooting spree that left 10 people dead. The attacker, dressed in military gear, drove into the car park at Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo at about 2.30pm (19:30 BST) and began livestreaming his rampage via a camera on his helmet. ""When I first saw him shooting he shot a woman, he shot a deacon, he shot another woman... and then he went in the store and he started shooting again,"" eyewitness Grady Lewis told reporters. Katherine Crofton, a retired firefighter and doctor,told the local paper,externalshe had been playing with her dog and smoking a cigarette when she heard a shot from her front porch. ""I didn't see him at first, I turned around and I saw him shoot this woman,"" she said. ""She was just going into the store. And then he shot another woman. She was putting groceries into her car. I got down because I did not know if he was going to shoot me."" Ten killed in racially motivated attack at US supermarket FBI hate crime reports spike to 12-year high in 2020 US gun culture in seven charts The suspected gunman has been identified in court documents as Payton Gendron, of Conklin, New York. Of the 13 people shot, police said 11 were black. The authorities say it was a racially motivated attack in what is a predominantly black neighbourhood. Inside the ""packed"" supermarket, operations manager Shonell Harris told Buffalo News she was putting out groceries when the shooting happened. ""I heard a noise, and then it got louder and closer, and everybody started running"", she said. The gunman was arrested after the shootings outside the Tops Friendly Market store A small vigil is set up across the street to the crime scene Hearing the gunshots, Ms Harris said she made for the back exit, and ran around to the front of the store to look for her daughter, who was also working inside the supermarket. At the front of the store, she said she saw the gunman, clothed ""like he was dressed for the army"", shoot another person. She then ran back around to the back exit, where she found her daughter. ""I just grabbed her, I hugged her,"" she said. ""It's like a nightmare... you see this on TV, you hear about it on TV... but I never thought I would be one of them."" Three people were shot dead in the car park and the other seven were killed inside the supermarket, police said. As the shooter entered the store, a security guard named by local media as Aaron Salter - a retired police officer - fired multiple shots, but the gunman's bulletproof vest stopped one that hit him, police said. He then killed the guard and stalked through the store firing at other people. The local paper has named two others who died in the attack - supermarket customers Ruth Whitfield and Katherine Massey. A vigil was held for Ms Whitmore, 86, on Saturday night. A church deacon who worked as a driver was also killed, Buffalo News reports. Jennifer Tookes, who had been shopping in the store with her cousin when the shooting started, told NBC News that her cousin had hidden in the supermarket's freezer until the gunfire stopped. Ms Tookes added that she saw three bodies lying outside the car park when she escaped outside: ""One was right by the door. One man was by his car. Another girl was right there."" Ken Stephens, a member of a local anti-violence group who was at the scene, told the New York Times: ""Bodies were everywhere."" This video can not be played Watch: Mayor speaks of pain in wake of deadly shooting Witness Katherine Crofton said that after the shootings inside the supermarket, the gunman came outside. ""The guy walked out of the store, the cops were just screaming at him, and he just stood there,"" she said. ""It was like he wanted them to shoot him."" The attacker was arrested by police and has been charged with first-degree murder. Afterwards, local residents gathered at the scene. Among them was Marilyn Hanson, 60, who told The New York Times she had raced to the store after hearing the news to make sure her daughter, who lived nearby, was not hurt. Finding her safe, Ms Hanson - who shops at the store often - said: ""My daughter was so scared because that could've been me in that store."" ""If a black man did this, he'd be dead, too,"" she added, referring to the fact that the suspect had surrendered and had been taken into custody by police. A member of the local government council, Ulysees Wingo Sr, said most of the shoppers at the supermarket were black and that he knew some of the victims. ""This is the largest mass shooting to date in the city of Buffalo,"" he told reporters. ""I don't think anyone here in the city of Buffalo thought that something like this could ever happen, would ever happen."" Saturday's attack in Buffalo is thought to be the worst mass shooting so far in the US in 2022, and will also further inflame the bitter political battle about gun control in the US. Some 40,000 deaths a year involve firearms in America, a figure that includes suicides. Meanwhile, hate crimes in the US hit a 12-year high in 2020, with over 10,000 people reporting offences related to their race, gender, sexuality, religion or disability. Crimes against Asian and black Americans in particular surged that year, FBI figures suggest - although as police are not mandated to submit hate crime data to the FBI, those numbers are thought likely to be an undercount.

Sweden confirms Nato hopes in historic shift,"Sweden joining Nato is supported by most of the country's political parties Sweden and Finland have confirmed they will apply for Nato membership in a historic shift that comes as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In Sweden, the governing Social Democrats said they backed joining the Western security alliance, paving the way for the country to apply. The announcement came soon after Finland formally announced it too would apply to join the grouping. Russia sees Nato as a security threat and has warned of ""consequences"". Sweden stayed neutral in World War II and for more than two centuries has avoided joining military alliances. Finland shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia. Until now, it has stayed out of Nato to avoid antagonising its eastern neighbour. What is Nato and could Finland and Sweden join? Are Sweden and Finland going from neutral to Nato? In a statement, Sweden's Social Democrats said they would ""work toward"" membership, something supported by the public and most opposition parties. A formal application is likely within days. But the Social Democrats added that they were opposed to stationing nuclear weapons or hosting Nato bases. At a subsequent press conference, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said her party believed joining the alliance was ""best for Sweden's and the Swedish people's security"". ""For us Social Democrats, it is clear that the military non-alignment has served Sweden well, but our conclusion is that it won't serve us as well in the future,"" she added. She also said Sweden would be left in a ""vulnerable position"" if it was the only country in the Baltic region that was not a Nato member. Finland's President Sauli Niinisto earlier confirmed his country would apply, calling it a ""historic day"". He spoke to Russia's President Vladmir Putin about the decision, saying he wanted to ""say it straight"". ""I, or Finland, are not known to sneak around and quietly disappear behind a corner,"" he said. Russia's president had previously told Finland it would be a ""mistake"" to join Nato, which was founded in 1949 to counter the threat from the Soviet Union. President Putin mentioned Ukraine's intention to join the alliance as one of the reasons for the invasion. The Social Democrats chose to announce their decision to back Nato membership with a low-key statement, half an hour before a scheduled news conference. But their decision is monumental, paving the way for Sweden to move away from a position of military neutrality for the first time in two centuries. The announcement isn't surprising. Social Democrat ministers backed the findings of a cross-party report on Friday which concluded that membership would increase security in northern Europe and would be unlikely to trigger an armed attack from Russia. Meanwhile public support for formally joining Nato has grown steadily since Russia invaded Ukraine. Most opposition parties are in favour, with just months to go until Sweden's next general election. Still there are some within the Social Democrats - and in the opposition Left and Green parties - who are anxious about joining. Not everyone's convinced it makes military aggression from Russia less likely. Others are already mourning the loss of a national identity as a neutral, peaceful nation that's used to staying out of major global conflicts. Foreign ministers of Nato countries, who are meeting in Berlin, have pledged to provide security guarantees for both Finland and Sweden while their bids to join Nato are being ratified by all member states - a process that can take up to a year. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said there could not be a ""transition period, a grey zone, where their status is unclear"". Meanwhile both US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said they were confident of overcoming Turkish objections to both Finland and Sweden's membership. Turkey, a Nato member state, accuses both Nordic countries of having given support to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been waging an armed struggle against the Turkish government for decades. On Sunday Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Sweden and Finland must stop supporting terrorists in their countries, provide clear security guarantees and lift export bans on Turkey. But he added that Turkey was not threatening anybody or seeking leverage. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins onâ¦ Finland, Nato and Russia Mr Blinken said he had heard strong support for the Nordic countries ""almost across the board"" and he had held talks with his Turkish counterpart - ""If that's [joining Nato] what they choose to do, I'm very confident that we will reach consensus on that,"" he said. Mr Niinisto has said he is ready to hold talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkish media reported. Both Sweden and Finland have Kurdish communities, and in Sweden's case some parliamentarians have Kurdish origins. Turkey has not provided proof that these communities have links with the PKK.

""The guy walked out of the store, the cops were just screaming at him, and he just stood there,"" she said. ""It was like he wanted them to shoot him."" The attacker was arrested by police and has been charged with first-degree murder. Afterwards, local residents gathered at the scene. Among them was Marilyn Hanson, 60, who told The New York Times she had raced to the store after hearing the news to make sure her daughter, who lived nearby, was not hurt. Finding her safe, Ms Hanson - who shops at the store often - said: ""My daughter was so scared because that could've been me in that store."" ""If a black man did this, he'd be dead, too,"" she added, referring to the fact that the suspect had surrendered and had been taken into custody by police. A member of the local government council, Ulysees Wingo Sr, said most of the shoppers at the supermarket were black and that he knew some of the victims. ""This is the largest mass shooting to date in the city of Buffalo,"" he told reporters. ""I don't think anyone here in the city of Buffalo thought that something like this could ever happen, would ever happen."" Saturday's attack in Buffalo is thought to be the worst mass shooting so far in the US in 2022, and will also further inflame the bitter political battle about gun control in the US. Some 40,000 deaths a year involve firearms in America, a figure that includes suicides. Meanwhile, hate crimes in the US hit a 12-year high in 2020, with over 10,000 people reporting offences related to their race, gender, sexuality, religion or disability. Crimes against Asian and black Americans in particular surged that year, FBI figures suggest - although as police are not mandated to submit hate crime data to the FBI, those numbers are thought likely to be an undercount.

LiveLivePremier League: Five games and Spurs beat BurnleyFollow live text updates and BBC Radio 5 Live coverage from Sunday's seven Premier League games.,"Brentford beat nine-man Everton thanks to two quick second-half goals Everton led twice but defeat means they miss chance to secure safety Man City fight back from 2-0 down at half-time to draw at West Ham Mahrez misses late penalty - goal would have all but won title Leeds score dramatic late equaliser at home to Brighton Leicester fight back to beat Watford 5-1 - Vardy and Barnes both score twice Palace draw against Villa, Wolves draw with Norwich Kane earlier gave Tottenham 1-0 win over Burnley - Spurs up to fourth Gary Rose There's nervous times ahead for fans of several clubs with plenty still to be settled at the top and bottom of the table. Arsenal continue their bid to finish in the top four when they take on Newcastle tomorrow. Join us again for coverage of that. See you later! FT: Everton 2-3 Brentford Everton Frank Lampard speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live:""We knew a win would get us safe. First part of the game we were great. When it was 11 v 11 we were great. I didn't see anything other than a win at that point but the red card changed the game"". On the red card:""It's a big lesson for him. The possibility of the penalty with Richarlison, all I hear is my players dive, but a shirt tug is a shirt tug. No complaints, once that is given it's a red card. 70 minutes in the Premier League with 10 men is too hard to sustain. You have to ask for everything to go your way and it didn't. The effort was brilliant and I can't complain. The effort and spirit was great, the reality is we need to go again on Thursday."" On Thursday's game against Crystal Palace:""It's mental and physical. It's in our hands so we want to take stock tonight. If we win on Thursday then we are in the Premier League next year. I have belief in these players and these fans that they will turn up with the same attitude that they did today."" The top... The bottom... FT: Everton 2-3 Brentford Brentford Brentford manager Thomas Frank speaking to BBC Sport:""It was very difficult today. It was an unbelievable atmosphere. ""They went 1-0 up and we talked about staying cool and in the game. It was a clear red card but sometimes you don't see teams winning against 10-men when they sit back. ""Second half we did fantastic. We were patient and in the end we got the goals. We made a change, we made it clear how we wanted to attack with more crosses - and the third goal comes from a cross. ""The whole season we have said we want to finish as high as possible. we will do our very best to win on Sunday."" FT: Everton 2-3 Brentford Everton Everton boss Frank Lampard to Sky Sports:""Disappointing. The start was great, we could have scored three. The red card changes the game completely. ""It was as criticial as can be. We had complete control. ""There was a possible penalty in the build-up for a clear pull on Richarlison's shirt. You wonder if a player should go down because it's a penalty. ""The ball goes down the other end and it's a mistake by Jared Braithwaite to let him run behind."" On his half-time instructions: ""Just to dig in. We did it against Newcastle although for less time. It's a big ask to ask players to play for 70 minutes a man down against a good team. The players gave every drop. The fans gave every drop. ""Big circumstances went against us. ""Hopefully Michael Keane will be back on Thursday. I'm not hopeful of Mina or Godfrey. We had three centre-backs out today. it's very difficult. Seamus played there. We played a back three at the end. Everyone has given everything, ""The important thing is we have a positve attitude. it's in our hands at Goodison again hopefully with 11 on the pitch. ""The effort was incredible. The players deserve a little rest. The legs are hanging off a bit with all the injuries."" FT: Everton 2-3 Brentford Brentford Brentford boss Thomas Frank to Sky Sports:""Crazy game. This is what we love about football. Everything is possible. It went our way. I know it's not nice to be on the other side. ""They did very well at the beginning, unbelievable atmosphere. The character and coollness we showed throughout the game helped us. To turn around is very impressive. ""No doubt it [the first red card] was a crucial moment in the game. It was a clear red card. Football is small moments you need to handle. ""There have been a lot of situations this season where teams went down to 10 men and the other team didn't win. It's not easy. ""We'd love to do that, to finish top 10 would be remarkable."" FT: Everton 2-3 Brentford Everton Everton manager Frank Lampard to BBC Sport:""It's pretty simple. We had control of the game. We looked like we would score more goals and win the game. The red card changes everything. You can't play with 10-men for 70 minutes in the Premier League and expect much more [from the players]. ""Maybe Richarlison should go down more easily with the shirt pull but no complaints about the red card, it is a mistake by Jarrad [Branthwaite]. ""The goal they scored from a corner is not a meant header and then they score again really quickly. The fans have given everything and we must go again on Thursday. ""Hopefully Michael Keane, who was sick overnight, comes back. We have three centre-halves out and it's very hard to sustain results like that. We will fight until the end no matter what bodies we have left. ""The first 20 minutes felt comfortable. The crowd were flying. No complaints about the players. We just have to rest a bit, stay positive, it's in our hands and we'll go again."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only - standard message rates apply) Having watched this live feed through this match, I feel I have to step in and check these embarrassing, hide-behind-the-sofa cringe comments from blinkered Everton fans. Richarlison also had hold of Ajer's shirt for the supposed ""foul"". Unlucky, but Braithwaite was last man, and the law says that's a red. The problems for Everton were brought upon themselves. We'll beat Leeds next week though, don't you worry James, Brentford fan FT: Everton 2-3 Brentford James McFaddenFormer Everton forward on BBC Radio 5 Live If that was previous to Frank Lampard coming in I think they would have lost the game and lost it far more easily. It's all ifs, buts and maybes but if Everton kept 11 men on the pitch they would have won the game today I have no doubt about it. Because of the way they started, because of the crowd, because of the togetherness in the squad. It was a tough afternoon for them. Fair play to Brentford, they deserved to win the game because they found a way to break Everton down. They have certainly shown they really can attack these games and keep destiny in their hands. FT: Everton 2-3 Brentford Everton Everton striker Dominic Calvert-Lewin speaking to Sky Sports:""Very frustrating. We started so well. A big decision has gone against us and it was difficult from there. We got the lead and we were defending, defending but unfortunately it went against us today."" On his opening goal:""It came off me but unfortunately it hasn't amounted to anything. A lot of disappointment having given so much today but we have to go again Thursday. We want to do it for ourselves, the manager and the fans. ""We dug deep. We showed spirit and we grafted. It is a long time to keep defending. We just have to pick ourselves up but we have the opportunity on Thursday to go again. ""It's still in our hands. The chat after the game was positive. We have to rest and recover and work as hard as we possibly can on Thursday."" #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only - standard message rates apply) Say what you want about the teams involved but this season has had a cracking relegation battle. Nick FT: Everton 2-3 Brentford Brentford Brentford's Rico Henry to Sky Sports:""It was a battle. Thomas Frank said it was going to be hostile. They came out fast. The manager said we had to match the intensity and that's  what we did. ""After that [red card] we had more possession. We knew we had to dig in there and stick together. ""Thomas Frank asked me to push on a bit when they went a man down and it paid off. He said keep moving the ball. We had to be patient. ""That's our goal, we want to finish in the top 10. We'll bring it to Leeds.""  FT: Everton 2-3 Brentford James McFaddenFormer Everton forward on BBC Radio 5 Live Going down to 10 men, I still think the circumstances surrounding it should have been a penalty kick which meant Branthwaite wouldn't have seen red. Having said that, they clawed it back, managed to get themselves in front and with a player of the quality of Christian Eriksen, you know the quality of delivery he can put in. I think Everton have shown enough in the energy and application. They lost the game but they showed they are up for the fight and they will be fighting to the end. It is still very much in Everton's hands with teams below them needing to pick up points and just three points from two games enough to secure survival for the Toffees, but it will mean a few more nervous days ahead. Everton 2-3 Brentford That is it, all over! A rollercoaster of a day for Everton fans. Survival was thirty minutes away but a mad two minutes in the second half cost them. Brentford take the three points. Everton 2-3 Brentford The free kick comes to nothing and so does a late shot from Richarlison. That's probably that. Everton 2-3 Brentford Josh Dasilva wins a free kick on the right side of the box off a frustrated Vitaliy Mykolenko. Brentford fans are the ones partying now and they taunt their counterparts with a chant of how they messed things up at 1-0 up, although not quite as PG as my description. #bbcfootball or text 81111 (UK only - standard message rates apply) James:Rondon going in like he's going for his PB in the long jump! What is he thinking doing that in the modern game?!? Unbelievable. Tambuwal:That could be Solomon Rondon's last game for Everton. Cristian Patilea:If Everton escape the drop, it will not be because of themselves Everton 2-3 Brentford Mason Holgate clears a shot off the line to keep Everton just about in the game. There's four minutes of added time. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Labour picks Wakefield candidate amid row with HQ,"Simon Lightwood promised to fight ""tooth and nail"" for the constituency if elected Labour has selected its candidate for the Wakefield by-election prompted by Tory MP Imran Ahmad Khan's resignation after his sexual assault conviction. NHS worker Simon Lightwood who was chosen to contest the seat urged the Conservatives to set an election date. However, the executive committee which runs the local Labour Party walked out of the final selection meeting. The groupresigned last weekafter objecting to the way the final two candidates had been shortlisted. The by-election was prompted by the resignation of Khan after his conviction for sexually assaulting a 15-year-old boy. The seat is seen as a key target for Labour, which had held it for more than 87 years before the Conservatives won it in 2019 with a majority of 3,358. Mr Lightwood, a member of Labour's National Policy Forum, had been shortlisted alongside Kate Dearden, who works for trade union Community. Speaking after his selection, he said he was honoured to have been chosen. ""Twenty years ago I joined the Labour Party here in Wakefield, and for 10 years I lived, studied and worked in this great city,"" he said. ""Times are much tougher than they should be for hardworking people across our constituency,"" he said, promising to fight ""tooth and nail"" for the area. The outgoing executive committee did not stay at the meeting today to vote for the party's candidate At the hustings today, Wakefield's outgoing executive committee walked out, saying in a statement it ""could not support the unfair and anti-democratic selection process"" imposed on party members. They said to have stayed and voted would have ""condoned the processes"" used and they did not want to take part in a process they believed breached Labour Party rules. The group said turnout for the hustings had been low, claiming only 23% of members locally were there. The BBC has asked the Labour Party for its reaction to the executive committee's comments. A date for the Wakefield by-election has not yet been set. Mr Lightwood said: ""Wakefield has been without an MP and a voice at Westminster for over a year. The Conservatives now need to call this by-election so local people can finally get the representation they deserve."" Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

I think Everton have shown enough in the energy and application. They lost the game but they showed they are up for the fight and they will be fighting to the end.

Finland confirms Nato bid despite Putin warning,"Sweden joining Nato is supported by most of the country's political parties Sweden and Finland have confirmed they will apply for Nato membership in a historic shift that comes as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In Sweden, the governing Social Democrats said they backed joining the Western security alliance, paving the way for the country to apply. The announcement came soon after Finland formally announced it too would apply to join the grouping. Russia sees Nato as a security threat and has warned of ""consequences"". Sweden stayed neutral in World War II and for more than two centuries has avoided joining military alliances. Finland shares a 1,300-km (810-mile) border with Russia. Until now, it has stayed out of Nato to avoid antagonising its eastern neighbour. What is Nato and could Finland and Sweden join? Are Sweden and Finland going from neutral to Nato? In a statement, Sweden's Social Democrats said they would ""work toward"" membership, something supported by the public and most opposition parties. A formal application is likely within days. But the Social Democrats added that they were opposed to stationing nuclear weapons or hosting Nato bases. At a subsequent press conference, Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said her party believed joining the alliance was ""best for Sweden's and the Swedish people's security"". ""For us Social Democrats, it is clear that the military non-alignment has served Sweden well, but our conclusion is that it won't serve us as well in the future,"" she added. She also said Sweden would be left in a ""vulnerable position"" if it was the only country in the Baltic region that was not a Nato member. Finland's President Sauli Niinisto earlier confirmed his country would apply, calling it a ""historic day"". He spoke to Russia's President Vladmir Putin about the decision, saying he wanted to ""say it straight"". ""I, or Finland, are not known to sneak around and quietly disappear behind a corner,"" he said. Russia's president had previously told Finland it would be a ""mistake"" to join Nato, which was founded in 1949 to counter the threat from the Soviet Union. President Putin mentioned Ukraine's intention to join the alliance as one of the reasons for the invasion. The Social Democrats chose to announce their decision to back Nato membership with a low-key statement, half an hour before a scheduled news conference. But their decision is monumental, paving the way for Sweden to move away from a position of military neutrality for the first time in two centuries. The announcement isn't surprising. Social Democrat ministers backed the findings of a cross-party report on Friday which concluded that membership would increase security in northern Europe and would be unlikely to trigger an armed attack from Russia. Meanwhile public support for formally joining Nato has grown steadily since Russia invaded Ukraine. Most opposition parties are in favour, with just months to go until Sweden's next general election. Still there are some within the Social Democrats - and in the opposition Left and Green parties - who are anxious about joining. Not everyone's convinced it makes military aggression from Russia less likely. Others are already mourning the loss of a national identity as a neutral, peaceful nation that's used to staying out of major global conflicts. Foreign ministers of Nato countries, who are meeting in Berlin, have pledged to provide security guarantees for both Finland and Sweden while their bids to join Nato are being ratified by all member states - a process that can take up to a year. German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said there could not be a ""transition period, a grey zone, where their status is unclear"". Meanwhile both US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said they were confident of overcoming Turkish objections to both Finland and Sweden's membership. Turkey, a Nato member state, accuses both Nordic countries of having given support to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been waging an armed struggle against the Turkish government for decades. On Sunday Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Sweden and Finland must stop supporting terrorists in their countries, provide clear security guarantees and lift export bans on Turkey. But he added that Turkey was not threatening anybody or seeking leverage. This video can not be played Watch: Ros Atkins onâ¦ Finland, Nato and Russia Mr Blinken said he had heard strong support for the Nordic countries ""almost across the board"" and he had held talks with his Turkish counterpart - ""If that's [joining Nato] what they choose to do, I'm very confident that we will reach consensus on that,"" he said. Mr Niinisto has said he is ready to hold talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Turkish media reported. Both Sweden and Finland have Kurdish communities, and in Sweden's case some parliamentarians have Kurdish origins. Turkey has not provided proof that these communities have links with the PKK.

Ministers accused of lack of action over cladding,"Welsh government minister Julie James says she is ""disappointed"" at the UK government's ""England-only"" approach The Welsh government should focus on its own response to the cladding crisis, rather than political rows with Westminster, campaigners have said. In England about 40 construction firms have signed a UK government pledge to fund any required fire safety work. Climate Change Minister Julie James said she was ""disappointed"" at the UK government's ""England-only"" approach. The UK government said building safety was devolved but urged the Welsh government to take similar action. However, leaseholders said the political arguments were not helping those living with the problems ""24/7"". Building firm fails to get cladding case dismissed Flat owners feel abandoned over cladding funding What happened at Grenfell Tower? Following the 2017 Grenfell Tower tragedy in London, a number of apartments blocks in Wales were found to have fire safety defects and remediation work is yet to be carried out on many of them amid rows over who should pay. Ms James said the UK government's approach to addressing building safety issues in England was making it harder to ensure developers in Wales were taking their responsibilities seriously. Seventy-two people died in the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire, which spread due to inflammable cladding In England the building safety levy introduced by Levelling Up Minister Michael Gove will see the industry raise Â£3bn over the next 10 years to address issues. Ms James has called on the UK government to extend the developers' pledge and the levy beyond England. ""The UK government's unilateral approach to building safety issues makes it harder to ensure all developers take their responsibilities to contribute towards the cost of fixing building safety problems in Wales seriously,"" she said in a written statement to Members of the Senedd (MSs) on Thursday. However campaigners frustrated by what they regard as a lack of action by the Welsh government accused Ms James of ""missing the fundamental point"". The Celestia development in Cardiff Bay has been identified as having fire safety defects, including with the cladding. Mark Thomas, chair of the Celestia Management Company, which is responsible for the running of the 450 apartment complex, said: ""There's a lot discussion about conflicts between the Welsh government and the English [UK] government and consequential funding and Mr Gove's unilateral actions, but that doesn't actually help us living with the problem on a 24/7 basis"". Celestia's Mark Thomas accused Welsh ministers of failing to deal with the situation as a ""matter of urgency"" Welsh Conservative MS Janet Finch-Saunders accused Ms James - who also holds responsibility for housing - of a ""petulant abdication of responsibility"". ""Devolution cannot mean taking responsibility when ministers fancy it - it is their duty and the job for which they are more than well paid,"" she added. Redrow - the developer behind the Celestia complex, and one of the signatories to the developers' pledge in England - said it would look to treat its customers in England and Wales ""fairly"" while a Welsh government plan was developed. In a statement, Redrow said: ""We have consistently said that we believe the housebuilding industry, alongside main contractors and material suppliers, should play its part in resolving the issue of legacy fire safety in high rise buildings and that the financial burden should not be borne by leaseholders."" Laing O'Rourke - which was contracted to build the Celestia buildings - said it had ""engaged proactively"" with Redrow and the management company. The Welsh government said work has already been carried out, or is planned, to remove non-compliant aluminium composite cladding from all affected buildings in Wales. It has also set up a Welsh Building Safety Fund worth Â£375m and a Leaseholder Support Scheme to help those facing ""extreme hardship"" as a results of costs connected to building defects. A UK government spokesman said: ""We have been working with the devolved governments to help shape building safety policy and are in regular dialogue with the Welsh government on the issues raised. ""Our new industry wide agreement in England will make sure developers pay to fix the problems they created, including both cladding and non-cladding defects. ""While building safety is a devolved matter, we encourage the Welsh government to introduce the same legal protections as those under the Building Safety Act and are committed to supporting them in this task.""

Ten killed in racially motivated attack at US store,"This video can not be played Watch: Mayor speaks of pain in wake of deadly shooting An 18-year-old white man has shot dead 10 people in a black neighbourhood of New York state in what authorities are calling a racially motivated attack. The man, named as Payton Gendron in court papers, was arrested after a stand-off at the scene - a supermarket in the city of Buffalo. He began firing in the store's car park before entering and continuing his rampage, streaming the attack online. US President Joe Biden condemned what he described as an ""abhorrent"" act. ""We are investigating this incident as both a hate crime and a case of racially-motivated violent extremism,"" said Stephen Belongia, from the FBI's Buffalo office, adding there was evidence of ""racial animosity."" CBS news reported that the attacker shouted racial slurs during the shooting and suggested that he had a racial slur written on his weapon.  He also apparently posted a manifesto online which included racist language and ideas. 'Bodies everywhere - Witnesses tell of Buffalo attack horror FBI hate crime reports spike to 12-year high in 2020 US gun culture in seven charts The suspect is believed to have driven for some 200 miles to reach the predominantly black area of the city. Three people were shot dead in the car park and the other seven were killed inside the supermarket, police said. Most of the victims were black. ""He exited his vehicle. He was very heavily armed. He had tactical gear. He had a tactical helmet on. He had a camera that he was live-streaming what he was doing,"" Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia told reporters. He said the suspect surrendered his weapon after a tense stand-off and was taken into custody. He later appeared in court charged with first degree murder. Three more people, all supermarket staff, were wounded in the shooting but did not sustain life-threatening injuries. A retired police officer, named in local media as Aaron Salter, was working as a security guard in the store and was shot dead inÂ the attack. Police said he had tried to shoot the suspect, who then shot him dead. Two of the other people killed have been named in the local paper as Ruth Whitfield and Katherine Massey. A church deacon who worked as a driver was also killed, Buffalo News reports. Suspect Payton Gendron appeared in court charged with first-degree murder ""This is the worst nightmare that any community can face and we are hurting, we are seething right now,"" Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown told reporters. ""We cannot let this hateful person divide our community or our country,"" he added. Grady Lewis, who witnessed the attack from across the street, told local media that he saw the man open fire. ""I saw the guy go in, army-style, bent over, just shooting at people,"" he said. Shonnell Harris, who was working in the shop during the attack, told Buffalo News that she heard more than 70 shots as she ran to escape the building through a backdoor. ""The store was full. It was the weekend,"" she said. ""It feels like a nightmare."" Describing the aftermath of the attack, one police officer told Buffalo News: ""It's like walking onto a horror movie, but everything is real. It is Armageddon-like"". Later on Saturday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said the suspect was a ""white supremacist who has engaged in an act of terrorism"". This was ""a military style execution targeting people who simply wanted to buy groceries in a neighbourhood store,"" she said while visiting Buffalo. In a statement, US President Joe Biden said he and the First Lady were praying for the victims and their families. ""A racially-motivated hate crime is abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation,"" he said. ""We must do everything in our power to end hate-fuelled domestic terrorism."" Hate crimes in the US hit a 12-year high in 2020, with over 10,000 people reporting offences related to their race, gender, sexuality, religion or disability. Crimes against Asian and black Americans in particular surged that year, FBI figures suggest. As police are not mandated to submit hate crime data to the FBI, those numbers are thought likely to be an undercount.

'Bodies everywhere' - Witnesses tell of US store attack,"Witnesses to a racially-motivated attack at a New York state supermarket have been describing the horrific moment an 18-year-old white man pulled out a gun and began a shooting spree that left 10 people dead. The attacker, dressed in military gear, drove into the car park at Tops Friendly Market in Buffalo at about 2.30pm (19:30 BST) and began livestreaming his rampage via a camera on his helmet. ""When I first saw him shooting he shot a woman, he shot a deacon, he shot another woman... and then he went in the store and he started shooting again,"" eyewitness Grady Lewis told reporters. Katherine Crofton, a retired firefighter and doctor,told the local paper,externalshe had been playing with her dog and smoking a cigarette when she heard a shot from her front porch. ""I didn't see him at first, I turned around and I saw him shoot this woman,"" she said. ""She was just going into the store. And then he shot another woman. She was putting groceries into her car. I got down because I did not know if he was going to shoot me."" Ten killed in racially motivated attack at US supermarket FBI hate crime reports spike to 12-year high in 2020 US gun culture in seven charts The suspected gunman has been identified in court documents as Payton Gendron, of Conklin, New York. Of the 13 people shot, police said 11 were black. The authorities say it was a racially motivated attack in what is a predominantly black neighbourhood. Inside the ""packed"" supermarket, operations manager Shonell Harris told Buffalo News she was putting out groceries when the shooting happened. ""I heard a noise, and then it got louder and closer, and everybody started running"", she said. The gunman was arrested after the shootings outside the Tops Friendly Market store A small vigil is set up across the street to the crime scene Hearing the gunshots, Ms Harris said she made for the back exit, and ran around to the front of the store to look for her daughter, who was also working inside the supermarket. At the front of the store, she said she saw the gunman, clothed ""like he was dressed for the army"", shoot another person. She then ran back around to the back exit, where she found her daughter. ""I just grabbed her, I hugged her,"" she said. ""It's like a nightmare... you see this on TV, you hear about it on TV... but I never thought I would be one of them."" Three people were shot dead in the car park and the other seven were killed inside the supermarket, police said. As the shooter entered the store, a security guard named by local media as Aaron Salter - a retired police officer - fired multiple shots, but the gunman's bulletproof vest stopped one that hit him, police said. He then killed the guard and stalked through the store firing at other people. The local paper has named two others who died in the attack - supermarket customers Ruth Whitfield and Katherine Massey. A vigil was held for Ms Whitmore, 86, on Saturday night. A church deacon who worked as a driver was also killed, Buffalo News reports. Jennifer Tookes, who had been shopping in the store with her cousin when the shooting started, told NBC News that her cousin had hidden in the supermarket's freezer until the gunfire stopped. Ms Tookes added that she saw three bodies lying outside the car park when she escaped outside: ""One was right by the door. One man was by his car. Another girl was right there."" Ken Stephens, a member of a local anti-violence group who was at the scene, told the New York Times: ""Bodies were everywhere."" This video can not be played Watch: Mayor speaks of pain in wake of deadly shooting Witness Katherine Crofton said that after the shootings inside the supermarket, the gunman came outside. ""The guy walked out of the store, the cops were just screaming at him, and he just stood there,"" she said. ""It was like he wanted them to shoot him."" The attacker was arrested by police and has been charged with first-degree murder. Afterwards, local residents gathered at the scene. Among them was Marilyn Hanson, 60, who told The New York Times she had raced to the store after hearing the news to make sure her daughter, who lived nearby, was not hurt. Finding her safe, Ms Hanson - who shops at the store often - said: ""My daughter was so scared because that could've been me in that store."" ""If a black man did this, he'd be dead, too,"" she added, referring to the fact that the suspect had surrendered and had been taken into custody by police. A member of the local government council, Ulysees Wingo Sr, said most of the shoppers at the supermarket were black and that he knew some of the victims. ""This is the largest mass shooting to date in the city of Buffalo,"" he told reporters. ""I don't think anyone here in the city of Buffalo thought that something like this could ever happen, would ever happen."" Saturday's attack in Buffalo is thought to be the worst mass shooting so far in the US in 2022, and will also further inflame the bitter political battle about gun control in the US. Some 40,000 deaths a year involve firearms in America, a figure that includes suicides.

"Klopp 'could not be more proud' after FA Cup winLiverpool boss Jurgen Klopp ""could not be prouder"" of his side after they again outlast Chelsea on penalties to win the FA Cup.","This video can not be played Tsimikas scores winning penalty for Liverpool against Chelsea Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp said he ""could not be prouder"" of his quadruple-chasing side after they beat Chelsea on penalties to win the FA Cup. The Reds replicated their shootout win over Chelsea in the Carabao Cup final bytriumphing 6-5 on spot-kicksafter a goalless 90 minutes and extra time. ""I couldn't be more proud of my boys, the shift they put in, how hard they fought,"" Klopp told BBC Sport. ""It was an incredible game, a nerve-wracking shootout, my nails are gone."" Follow reaction and relive the FA Cup final as it happened Player Rater: Who was your FA Cup final star man? Watch all of the latest FA Cup highlights and reaction here Klopp, 54, became the first German manager ever to lift the FA Cup after edging out compatriot Thomas Tuchel in a Wembley final for the second time in less than three months. As in February's final, the shootout went to sudden death with Alisson's save from Mason Mount handing Liverpool the advantage before Konstantinos Tsimikas slotted home the winning penalty. ""It was intense - Chelsea would have deserved it exactly the same way we did, just like in the Carabao Cup - that's how small the margins are,"" added Klopp. ""Chelsea played outstanding but in the end there must be one winner and that was us today."" The dramatic win kept alive Liverpool's slim quadruple hopes - although the Premier League title may well elude them - with two games left, they trail leaders Manchester City by three points and have a goal difference that is inferior by seven. ""The quadruple thing is absolutely outstanding that we can talk about it. It's crazy,"" added Klopp. ""It's out of this world - this was game number 60 in an intense season."" Klopp has famously christened his side ""mentality monsters"" for the way they have responded to setbacks as they chase glory on four fronts this season. But the Reds boss said Tuchel's Chelsea also merited that moniker after playing their part in another absorbing encounter between the two clubs. The sides traded gilt-edged chances during a rollercoaster period of normal time and each struck the woodwork - Luis Diaz and Andy Robertson for Liverpool and Marcos Alonso for Chelsea. ""I really feel for Chelsea - for the second time, 120 minutes and you get nothing, that's too hard. But for us I'm pretty happy,"" added Klopp. ""We are mentality monsters but there were mentality monsters in blue as well - it was one penalty that was the difference."" The FA Cup is the sixth major honour Jurgen Klopp has won as Liverpool boss, having already lifted the Premier League title, Carabao Cup, Champions League, Uefa Super Cup and Fifa Club World Cup While Klopp was full of praise for the beaten finalists, BBC Sport pundits marvelled at his Reds side after they secured the second trophy in their quadruple quest. ""What a team Klopp has put together,"" former England striker Alan Shearer told BBC One. ""To have two trophies already and the way they have done it - that takes belief, incredible."" It was the fourth time this season the sides could not be separated in 90 minutes although Liverpool again prevailed on penalties to claim their eighth FA Cup, equalling Chelsea's tally in the process. Ex-Tottenham midfielder Jermaine Jenas added: ""They were pushed all the way. They were tested. The questions were asked and they've come out on top again."" Victory might well have come at a cost for Liverpool, however, with Klopp forced to withdraw top scorer Mohamed Salah, Virgil van Dijk and Robertson at various stages during the final. Van Dijk failed to re-emerge for extra time, although Klopp later claimed the defender suffered a ""hurt muscle"" but was ""fine"" while Robertson's issues appeared to be cramp-related. Most concerning, though, was the sight of a disconsolate Salah trudging off in the first half, with the Premier League title race approaching its conclusion and just a fortnight before the Champions League final with Real Madrid. ""It was a big blow with Mo going off,"" Reds captain Jordan Henderson told BBC Sport. ""But that's what we're all about. The attitude to dig deep and to win it on penalties is incredible.

Saudi oil giant sees profits jump 82% as prices surge,"Saudi Aramco has posted its highest profits since its 2019 listing as oil and gas prices surge around the world. The state-owned energy giant saw an 82% jump in profits, with net income topping $39.5bn (Â£32.2bn) in the first quarter. In a press release,external, the firm said it had been boosted by higher prices, as well as an increase in production. The invasion of Ukraine has seen oil and gas prices skyrocket. Russia is one of the world's biggest exporters but Western nations have pledged to cut their dependence on the country for energy. Oil prices were already rising before the Ukraine war as economies started to recover from the Covid pandemic and demand outstripped supply. Other energy firms including Shell, BP and TotalEnergies have also reported soaring profits as a result, although many are incurring costs exiting operations in Russia. Aramco's president and chief executive, Amin Nasser, said on Sunday that the company was ""focused on helping meet the world's demand for energy that is reliable, affordable and increasingly sustainable"". ""Energy security is vital and we are investing for the long-term,"" he added. In March,the oil and gas producer pledged to ramp up investmentand boost output significantly over the next five to eight years. Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited the world's biggest oil exporter that month to try to persuade it to release more oil into world markets in the short-term. Why won't the world's big oil producers lower prices? Saudi oil giant to ramp up energy production Apple loses position as world's most valuable firm Saudi Arabia is the largest producer in the oil cartel Opec (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) and by raising production it could help to reduce energy prices. But the country has been condemned for a range of human rights abuses: its involvement in the conflict in neighbouring Yemen, the murder in 2018 of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, for jailing dissidents and for widespread use of capital punishment. Aramco itself also faces security challenges because of the conflict in Yemen, with Huthi rebels targeting some of its sites and temporarily knocking out a big portion of the kingdom's crude production. Its latest set of results come days afterAramco reclaimed the top spotas the world's most valuable company from Apple for the first time in almost two years. Aramco also announced on Sunday it would issue 20 billion bonus shares to shareholders - one share for every 10 shares already owned.

Most concerning, though, was the sight of a disconsolate Salah trudging off in the first half, with the Premier League title race approaching its conclusion and just a fortnight before the Champions League final with Real Madrid. ""It was a big blow with Mo going off,"" Reds captain Jordan Henderson told BBC Sport. ""But that's what we're all about. The attitude to dig deep and to win it on penalties is incredible. ""We're here to lift trophies, we work so hard all season. It's a big moment for us, we haven't come this far, [and been] in this final, for some time, so to win it was special. ""It's incredible some of the talent we have got and the personalities in the dressing room. You put that together and you win trophies."" While the destiny of the Premier League title remains firmly in Manchester City's hands, Liverpool will hope to at least repeat their 2001 feat of two domestic cups and a European trophy. ""We've won two so far this season - we have three big games left and hopefully we can win all three and finish the season on a high,"" Henderson added.

How the UK broke losing streak,"Sam Ryder topped the jury vote at Eurovision, ultimately coming second to Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra Fifteen years ago, I landed in Finland to cover my first ever Eurovision Song Contest. That year, the British entry was Scooch's Flying The Flag (For You), a trifling three minutes of kitsch nonsense. And on the taxi drive from Helsinki Airport, my driver had something to say about it. ""Oh, you're from England?"" he inquired. ""Your song is a joke."" He wasn't wrong. Scooch finished joint 22nd (out of 24), tying with France on 19 points. Malta later admitted they'd awarded 12 of those points in a symbolic protest over vote trading in Eastern Europe. Scooch in 2007: Let us never talk of this again For the next decade and a half, the UK didn't fare much better. In 2019 and 2021, our acts took last place. When I arrived in Turin last week, however, the taxi driver was delighted to see me. ""England! England is going to win,"" he declared, before treating me to his interpretation of Sam Ryder's Space Man. In the end, Sam didn't quite top the scoreboard, but he came close: taking the silver medal position and earning the UK's best result since Imaani came second in 1998. Ukraine wins Eurovision, while UK comes second Eurovision 2022: Song contest in pictures Eurovision Song Contest: As it happened The Eurovision anthem born in a war zone Sam Ryder is 'ignoring the hype' at Eurovision When a president tried to intervene in Eurovision... So how did the UK break its losing streak? ""I think it's just a flip in attitude,"" says Amy Wadge, who co-wrote Sam's song, as well as hits for Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello, Kylie and Alicia Keys. ""For a long time we, as Brits, built this thing up of, 'Well, we're just going to lose'. ""But this year the thinking was, 'How about we don't do that, and we look at it with the sort of respect that other countries do?"" Amy Wadge won a Grammy for her work with Ed Sheeran And that's the key. When Britpop was in its ascendancy in the 1990s, the UK decided Eurovision wasn't worth the effort. It was outdated, irrelevant, and nothing to do with contemporary music. Record labels stopped putting acts forward for the contest and, in turn, the standard of our entries dropped.  By the mid-2000s, we'd entered a cycle of self-imposed decline, unable to escape the bottom of the scoreboard (with the notable exception of Jade Ewen and Andrew Lloyd Webber's effort in 2009). Faced with those disastrous results, the music industry distanced itself even further. Eurovision was a ""poisoned chalice"", one record label executive told me. If you had spent thousands of pounds developing an act, why expose them to the risk of coming last and ending their career before it began? Faye Tozer from Steps summed it up, when I asked if her band would put themselves forward for the 2021 contest. ""In an ideal world, everybody has this vision of Steps going to Eurovision and being the perfect act, with the perfect song, and we turn it around for the UK,"" she said. ""But I think in reality, [winning] is just never, ever going to happen so it's weighing up whether it's worth that risk to us or not."" Amongst the press and the public, conspiracy theories started to circulate about the UK's lack of success. Eastern European countries were voting for each other to win, they said, conveniently ignoring victories by Germany, Norway and Sweden. This video can not be played The highlights of Eurovision 2022. Then it was Brexit. ""Angry Europeans to use Eurovision to punish UK for leaving,external,"" ran a typical headline in the Express in 2017. But the UK's average position in the three years before Brexit was 22. In the three years after, it was... 22. No, the real explanation was more simple: Our songs were bad. ""Without being disrespectful to the artists who represented us for the past few years, it has been a case of 'will this do'?"" says Eurovision expert Jonny Carey. ""Very often, it has just been a case of churning something out that isn't very Eurovision-friendly."" And while the UK's back was turned, Eurovision was becoming more credible. Acts like Loreen, MÃ¥ns ZelmerlÃ¶w and Duncan Laurence were scoring genuine hits and establishing careers. Then, in 2021, MÃ¥neskin won. The Italian rock band became an international success story, touring with the Rolling Stones, winning MTV Awards and achieving one billion streams of their hit song Beggin'. ""Having a band like that win, then have chart success around the world - and also breaking America - made people in the UK sit up and listen,"" says Dan Shipton, who has designed the staging for the UK's Eurovision entrant five times (including this year). ""It made people realise there is a place for Eurovision. There's been a massive energy shift and it's really exciting to be a part of."" Maneskin are the most successful act to emerge from Eurovision in recent years MÃ¥neskin's victory also coincided with the UK getting the dreaded ""nil points"". That night the BBC's Eurovision producer drowned his sorrows with his Spanish counterpart in a bar in Rotterdam. Together,they made a pact,externalto do better next year. For the UK, that meant teaming up with TaP Management, the company who look after Lana Del Rey, Ellie Goulding and (until recently) Dua Lipa. This video can not be played Watch: Sam Ryder and Graham Norton on Eurovision triumph Their chief executive, Ben Mawson, felt the UK had been wasting a golden opportunity; and offered the BBC the resources of his company - which has in-house designers, choreographers and recording studios in addition to its talent management arm. ""Our conclusion was [Eurovision] is not as political as people think,""he told Radio 1's Newsbeat last October. ""And I think we should focus on getting some really special music and a really special artist that represents Britain in the best possible way."" The search was on... and by January, TaP and the BBC had found the man for the job. Sam Ryder rose to fame on TikTok during the lockdown, amassing 12 million followers for his covers of Britney Spears and Queen. Artists like Alicia Keys, Sia and Justin Bieber all reposted his videos. Until Ed Sheeran joined TikTok at the end of last year, he was the platform's most-streamed British artist. TaP discovered him through Dua Lipa's producer Koz, who had been working with Sam on new music. Crucially, he had already written and recorded Space Man. ""The song was written a year and a half ago with no intention of Eurovision in our minds,"" says Sam. ""It was a gorgeous, boiling hot day in London, so naturally, we were in a studio with no windows and Space Man just seemed to come out of spaceâ¦ man."" ""We did it entirely over Zoom,"" adds Amy Wadge. ""It was the first song that we ever wrote together - and in an hour and a half we landed on something, and I was quite excited about it.""

Space Man pays homage to the music Sam grew up with in Maldon in Essex. You can hear elements of Elton John's Rocket Man, David Bowie's Space Oddity and Brian May's guitar work with Queen in the song's DNA. That familiarity - an explicit acknowledgement of Britain's rich musical legacy - paid dividends with Eurovision voters. For Amy, it also explains why the song came together so quickly, ""I'm 46 and I spend most of my life trying to think like a young artist,"" she says, ""and I suddenly had an opportunity to write a real classic rock song, which is always a bit of a gift. It was lovely for once to be able to really dig into the Elton John part of my personality."" Space Man had already earned Sam a record deal when TaP approached him to enter Eurovision. But it wasn't just the song that impressed them. It was his ability to sing it live. ""I've been doing management for about 10 years now and I honestly haven't come across a voice like it,"" says David May, who started managing Sam in 2019. ""The delivery, the control, his tone. Everything about it is absolutely phenomenal."" ""He's got a terrific vocal range, and his songwriting is distinct as well,"" agrees Radio 2's Ken Bruce, who's been commentating on the Eurovision Song Contest since 1986. ""His TikTok success is all about great recordings by great artists - and those artists all turned around and got back to Sam and said, 'You're fantastic, you're doing a great job on my song.'"" After Eurovision, Sam Ryder has plans to release new music, as well as a tour with Paloma Faith Sam and David only needed a moment's pause before accepting the task of representing the UK. ""It was something that we hadn't particularly thought about,"" David says. ""But the convincing factors were the excitement of the BBC, TaP's enthusiasm for changing the narrative, and the love everyone had for Sam and for Space Man."" Of course, a second place finish isn't solely about a good song by a good singer. Sam was sent to every corner of Europe, familiarising fans with his song, and building up a unshakeable buzz. Next, Eurovision veterans Dan Shipton and Marvin Deetman were brought in to design a stage show that would sell the song to a TV audience of 200 million. ""It was a team effort,"" Dan says, ""but the idea was to place Sam in a world of stars without using the digital screens ""The song has a real British heritage sound, so we wanted to draw on our inspirations of Queen and Bowie and how they used lighting and filters to produce 'stars' on camera. ""That was our starting point - to put him in a world of light and have him literally floating in space."" Sam's elaborate set was the biggest prop on stage at Eurovision, with three petal-shaped lighting rigs that were 6m (19.6ft) and 3m wide And so the puzzle was complete: A great song, a performer who could sell it, a production that caught the eye, and a months-long diplomatic tour. The result, as we all found out on Saturday night, was the UK's best result at Eurovision since 1998. ""A fairytale ending,"" as Graham Norton put it,. ""It's entirely deserved,"" says Ken Bruce. ""The feeling is that the UK has broken the taboo."" And the BBC is determined not to squander that opportunity. ""We have to carry on,"" says Andrew Cartmell, head of the UK delegation to Eurovision. ""This cannot just be one off. We must continue. ""The British music industry is perhaps the best music industry in the world. This is the result we should have been having, and we have to make sure the UK is a powerhouse of Eurovision for years to come."" ""Watch this space,"" says Sam. ""The UK is going to be a force next year. It's gonna be mad. The UK is going to bust down doors to be a part of Eurovision next year. ""I can't wait to see it.""

LiveLiveFinland formally confirms Nato membership bid8 minutes ago,"Sweden's governing party drops its long opposition to the country joining the Nato alliance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine The news came hours after Finland formally announced it was seeking to be part of the alliance Russia - whose war in Ukraine has sparked the moves - has warned the expansion of Nato would be a mistake Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg says the doors are open for both countries to join, describing the potential change as ""historic"" On the ground, Russia's offensive in the eastern Donbas region has lost momentum, according to UK military assessment Meanwhile, Ukraine has won the 66th Eurovision song contest - in a symbolic show of public support following the country's invasion Edited by Tom Spender Please join ushere for the latest updates and analysis. And that's all from us today. We're pausing our live page for now but will resume our coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine here in the morning. In the meantime you can read our news stories on Sweden and Finland's moves towards joining Natohereand the latest assessments of what's happening on the battlefieldhere. Here's a round-up of today's main events: Putin's warnings to Finland and Sweden not to join Nato have gone unheeded. His invasion of Ukraine has triggered something he does not want: further enlargement of Nato right up to Russiaâs borders. So how could he respond? Military moves For now, President Putin has his hands full in Ukraine so he is unlikely to make any sudden moves in Finland or Swedenâs direction. Russian troops close to the 800-mile(1300km) border with Finland have been redeployed south. In time though, he is likely to move both troops and missiles nearer to Finlandâs border and mount aggressive air and naval patrols Hybrid warfare Cyber-attacks and cyber-espionage have been going on for some time, aimed at most European states. These can now be expected to be directed specifically at Finland and Sweden if they join Nato, accompanied by the usual official denials of culpability. Subversion Putin likes to play a long game and he may well decide that these two Nordic countriesâ historic neutrality means any decision to join Nato can be reversed. In time, he may opt to try to shape public opinion against Nato with the help of online bots and fake accounts. As we've been reporting, Sweden's ruling party has confirmed it is in favour of applying to join Nato. The party's decision came a few hours after Finland also confirmed it was seeking to be part of the alliance. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson addressed reporters soon afterwards: Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent If Sweden joins Nato, it'll represent a return to
strategic significance for its largest island, Gotland. Lying just 200 miles from Kaliningrad, headquarters of Russiaâs Baltic
fleet, the island had been likened to an unsinkable aircraft carrier. An ideal
spot, during the Cold War, from which to defend Sweden and project power over
the Baltic. There was a time when as many as 20,000 troops were stationed there. But Gotland's last military units stood down in 2005 and Gotland fell
into military obscurity. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and its subsequent sponsorship of
separatist fighters in the Donbas led Sweden to reconsider. On a visit to the island in 2016, I saw preparations for the return of a
garrison. Michael BydÃ©n, Sweden's Supreme Commander, told me it was all about
sending a message to Russia. ""If you come here, it will hurt."" But it was also about making sure that Sweden - which was already
experiencing regular Russian military incursions into its airspace and
submarine activity close to the capital Stockholm - was not taken by surprise. The Gotland Regiment was reactivated in 2018. Last month, the government announced plans to spend $163m boosting the
islandâs defences. Back in 2016, a
decision to join Nato was still some way off, but listening at the time to
Swedish airforce communications â all in English â was just one of many signs
that when the time came, ""interoperability"" with Nato forces would
not be a problem. Sweden and Finland are supported in their moves towards Nato membership by almost all Nato members - only Turkey has expressed reservations. Ankara accuses both countries of having given support to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been waging an armed struggle against the Turkish government for decades. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Sweden and Finland must stop supporting terrorists in their countries, provide clear security guarantees and lift export bans on Turkey. But he later added that Turkey was not threatening anybody or seeking leverage. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Nato officials and Swedish and Finnish politicians all say they are confident any concerns can be addressed. Ukraine needs heavy weapons from the West and a ""real oil embargo"" on Russia to defeat the latter by the end of the year, senior Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak says. ""Ukraine is not interested in a protracted war with Russia, same as the whole world. ""We can't beat month this month [as published], but we can do it this year. ""The recipe for victory is simple: real oil embargo + tanks, aircraft and artillery.  Let's end it together,"" he tweets in English. Sweden stopped being neutral ""when we entered the EU in 1995"", the countryâs former prime minister Carl Bildt has told the BBC. The country has not been in a military conflict in over 200 years. If both Sweden and Finland join Nato, Bildt said, it would be possible to ""solidify and unify the defence and security arrangements for the entire northern European area"". Although formalising membership might take some time after application, both countries could formally join a Nato summit taking place in Madrid in June, he said. ""I think it's very important to have the support particularly from the US - that's key,"" he added. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier that his country strongly supported both countries' bids for Nato membership. On the battlefield in Ukraine, Nato's secretary general says Russia's war is not going to plan. Speaking at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, Jens Stoltenberg said Russia was not achieving ""its strategic objectives"". ""They failed to take Kyiv, they are pulling back from around Kharkiv, their major offensive in Donbas has stalled,"" he added. Mr Stoltenberg also saidUkraine could win the conflict. His comments come as Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) estimates Russia has lost about a third of its ground combat force since the war began in February. In its assessment, the MoD's estimate of Russia's losses cover men killed or wounded and equipment destroyed or captured. Ukrainian forces were counterattacking in the city of Izyum, regional governor Oleh Sinegubov said, something that could complicate Russian plans to capture the Donbas. However Ukraine's military also acknowledged setbacks in its latest updates, saying Russia was advancing in several areas in the region. Sweden's decision to apply join Nato will end 200 years of military non-alignment. In Finland, which today also confirmed it will put in a Nato bid, polls carried out by Finnish broadcaster Yle showed 76% of the population would support the countryâs membership. But in Sweden joining the alliance is a less popular stance. Recent polls suggest that about half of the population are in favour of joining the defensive military alliance. Although this proportion is far higher than it was before Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, the countryâs ruling party had previously been split on the issue. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson says her country's decision to apply for Nato membership is ""not something against Russia"" but something that is best for Sweden. She previously said the decision to join the alliance would help Sweden achieve more security and contribute to more security. Andersson confirms her party hopes to synchronise Sweden's membership application with Finland's as much as possible. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously described Finland's intention to join Nato as a mistake. Sweden's Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson says she will go to parliament tomorrow aiming to secure support for an application to join Nato. She also says there's a good chance Turkey's reported doubts about Finland and Sweden's potential membership can be solved. As we reported, on Saturday Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said it was ""unacceptable and outrageous"" that the prospective new members supported the outlawed Kurdish militant group PKK. But on Sunday Nato's Deputy Secretary-General Mircea Geoana said he was confident the concerns could be addressed. Announcing Finland's intention to join Nato earlier, the country's Prime Minister Sanna Marin said her nation's decision would also have to go through parliament but she trusted the Finnish parliament would debate ""this historic decision with determination and responsibility"", while President Sauli Niinisto said he was confused by reports of Turkish concerns.  Finland and Sweden both look like they are a step closer to joining Nato after their announcements today. But what military capabilities will the two nations bring to the alliance? Finland has many more troops at its disposal than its neighbour to the west but the vast majority of those are its huge number of reservists, which it could call up in the event of war. In contrast Sweden has more than five times as many helicopters as Finland. Magdalena Andersson says as a member of Nato Sweden will ""only achieve"" more security and contribute to more security. ""Sweden will be a security provider,"" the Swedish prime minister adds. But she says Sweden will be vulnerable during the application process - before it gets the full backing of other countries a Nato member would have. Magdalena Andersson has also just told reporters that if Sweden was the only country in the Baltic region that did not join Nato ""we would be in a very vulnerable position"". As we've been reporting, Sweden has confirmed its intention to formally apply to join the alliance. The announcement being made by the ruling Social Democrats comes a few hours after Finland announced it was seeking to be part of the alliance. Sweden's Prime Minister Magdalena
Andersson is currently speaking at a press conference. She says Sweden needs the formal security guarantees that come with membership of Nato. She is addressing reporters as Sweden has just announced it intends to apply to join the Nato alliance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of what's been happening so far today. Sweden'sruling party has just said it backs the country joining Nato. We're expecting to hear more about this in a news conference shortly. The comes hours afterFinlandformally announced it
wants to join the military alliance. Its bid needs to be discussed by its
parliament â but the president and prime minister have both spoken in favour of
joining. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenbergsays the two nations joining would be a historic moment. The people ofUkrainehave had some welcome positive news, with the country's resounding win at the Eurovision Song Contest. The victory was based largely on the votes of the international public, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying it shows the world is impressed with Ukrainian courage. And on the battlefield, Russia's offensive in the easternDonbasregion has lost momentum, according to an assessment from the UK military. Maddy SavageReporting from Stockholm The Social Democrats
chose to announce their decision to back Nato membership with a low-key
statement, half an hour before a scheduled news conference. But their decision
is monumental, paving the way for Sweden to move away from a position of
military neutrality for the first time in two centuries. For political analysts in Sweden the announcement isnât surprising. Social Democrat ministers backed
the findings of a cross-party report on Friday which concluded that membership
would increase security in northern Europe and would be unlikely to trigger an
armed attack from Russia. Meanwhile public support for formally joining Nato has grown steadily since Russia invaded Ukraine. Most opposition parties are in
favour, with just months to go until Swedenâs next general election. Still there are some
within the Social Democrats - and in the opposition Left and Green parties - who are anxious about joining. Not everyoneâs convinced it makes military
aggression from Russia less likely. Others are already
mourning the loss of a national identity as a neutral, peaceful nation thatâs
used to staying out of major global conflicts. We've got more now on the decision of Sweden's ruling party to back the country joining Nato. A statement says: ""The Social Democrats' party board has decided that the party will work for Sweden to apply for membership in Nato."" But it does not want nuclear weapons or Nato bases in Sweden. ""The Social Democrats will thus work to ensure that Sweden, if the application is approved by Nato, expresses unilateral reservations against the deployment of nuclear weapons and permanent bases on Swedish territory,"" the statement continues. Swedish leader Magdalena Andersson and other senior ministers from her party will speak in a news conference in about half an hour. Â© 2025 BBC.

Sweden stopped being neutral ""when we entered the EU in 1995"", the countryâs former prime minister Carl Bildt has told the BBC. The country has not been in a military conflict in over 200 years. If both Sweden and Finland join Nato, Bildt said, it would be possible to ""solidify and unify the defence and security arrangements for the entire northern European area"". Although formalising membership might take some time after application, both countries could formally join a Nato summit taking place in Madrid in June, he said. ""I think it's very important to have the support particularly from the US - that's key,"" he added. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier that his country strongly supported both countries' bids for Nato membership. On the battlefield in Ukraine, Nato's secretary general says Russia's war is not going to plan. Speaking at a meeting of Nato foreign ministers, Jens Stoltenberg said Russia was not achieving ""its strategic objectives"". ""They failed to take Kyiv, they are pulling back from around Kharkiv, their major offensive in Donbas has stalled,"" he added. Mr Stoltenberg also saidUkraine could win the conflict. His comments come as Britain's Ministry of Defence (MoD) estimates Russia has lost about a third of its ground combat force since the war began in February. In its assessment, the MoD's estimate of Russia's losses cover men killed or wounded and equipment destroyed or captured. Ukrainian forces were counterattacking in the city of Izyum, regional governor Oleh Sinegubov said, something that could complicate Russian plans to capture the Donbas. However Ukraine's military also acknowledged setbacks in its latest updates, saying Russia was advancing in several areas in the region. Sweden's decision to apply join Nato will end 200 years of military non-alignment. In Finland, which today also confirmed it will put in a Nato bid, polls carried out by Finnish broadcaster Yle showed 76% of the population would support the countryâs membership. But in Sweden joining the alliance is a less popular stance. Recent polls suggest that about half of the population are in favour of joining the defensive military alliance. Although this proportion is far higher than it was before Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine, the countryâs ruling party had previously been split on the issue. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson says her country's decision to apply for Nato membership is ""not something against Russia"" but something that is best for Sweden. She previously said the decision to join the alliance would help Sweden achieve more security and contribute to more security. Andersson confirms her party hopes to synchronise Sweden's membership application with Finland's as much as possible. Russian President Vladimir Putin previously described Finland's intention to join Nato as a mistake. Sweden's Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson says she will go to parliament tomorrow aiming to secure support for an application to join Nato. She also says there's a good chance Turkey's reported doubts about Finland and Sweden's potential membership can be solved. As we reported, on Saturday Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said it was ""unacceptable and outrageous"" that the prospective new members supported the outlawed Kurdish militant group PKK. But on Sunday Nato's Deputy Secretary-General Mircea Geoana said he was confident the concerns could be addressed. Announcing Finland's intention to join Nato earlier, the country's Prime Minister Sanna Marin said her nation's decision would also have to go through parliament but she trusted the Finnish parliament would debate ""this historic decision with determination and responsibility"", while President Sauli Niinisto said he was confused by reports of Turkish concerns.  Finland and Sweden both look like they are a step closer to joining Nato after their announcements today. But what military capabilities will the two nations bring to the alliance? Finland has many more troops at its disposal than its neighbour to the west but the vast majority of those are its huge number of reservists, which it could call up in the event of war. In contrast Sweden has more than five times as many helicopters as Finland. Magdalena Andersson says as a member of Nato Sweden will ""only achieve"" more security and contribute to more security. ""Sweden will be a security provider,"" the Swedish prime minister adds. But she says Sweden will be vulnerable during the application process - before it gets the full backing of other countries a Nato member would have. Magdalena Andersson has also just told reporters that if Sweden was the only country in the Baltic region that did not join Nato ""we would be in a very vulnerable position"". As we've been reporting, Sweden has confirmed its intention to formally apply to join the alliance. The announcement being made by the ruling Social Democrats comes a few hours after Finland announced it was seeking to be part of the alliance. Sweden's Prime Minister Magdalena
Andersson is currently speaking at a press conference. She says Sweden needs the formal security guarantees that come with membership of Nato. She is addressing reporters as Sweden has just announced it intends to apply to join the Nato alliance in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of what's been happening so far today. Sweden'sruling party has just said it backs the country joining Nato. We're expecting to hear more about this in a news conference shortly. The comes hours afterFinlandformally announced it
wants to join the military alliance. Its bid needs to be discussed by its
parliament â but the president and prime minister have both spoken in favour of
joining. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenbergsays the two nations joining would be a historic moment. The people ofUkrainehave had some welcome positive news, with the country's resounding win at the Eurovision Song Contest. The victory was based largely on the votes of the international public, with President Volodymyr Zelensky saying it shows the world is impressed with Ukrainian courage. And on the battlefield, Russia's offensive in the easternDonbasregion has lost momentum, according to an assessment from the UK military. Maddy SavageReporting from Stockholm The Social Democrats
chose to announce their decision to back Nato membership with a low-key
statement, half an hour before a scheduled news conference. But their decision
is monumental, paving the way for Sweden to move away from a position of
military neutrality for the first time in two centuries. For political analysts in Sweden the announcement isnât surprising. Social Democrat ministers backed
the findings of a cross-party report on Friday which concluded that membership
would increase security in northern Europe and would be unlikely to trigger an
armed attack from Russia. Meanwhile public support for formally joining Nato has grown steadily since Russia invaded Ukraine. Most opposition parties are in
favour, with just months to go until Swedenâs next general election. Still there are some
within the Social Democrats - and in the opposition Left and Green parties - who are anxious about joining. Not everyoneâs convinced it makes military
aggression from Russia less likely. Others are already
mourning the loss of a national identity as a neutral, peaceful nation thatâs
used to staying out of major global conflicts. We've got more now on the decision of Sweden's ruling party to back the country joining Nato. A statement says: ""The Social Democrats' party board has decided that the party will work for Sweden to apply for membership in Nato."" But it does not want nuclear weapons or Nato bases in Sweden. ""The Social Democrats will thus work to ensure that Sweden, if the application is approved by Nato, expresses unilateral reservations against the deployment of nuclear weapons and permanent bases on Swedish territory,"" the statement continues. Swedish leader Magdalena Andersson and other senior ministers from her party will speak in a news conference in about half an hour. Â© 2025 BBC.

Brexit deal change must result in NI government - PMBoris Johnson is to visit Northern Ireland amid a political crisis sparked by tensions over the protocol.,"Boris Johnson is to tell Northern Ireland's leaders that any move to change post-Brexit trade rules must also restore power-sharing at Stormont. The prime minister is visiting Northern Ireland on Monday amid a political crisis sparked by tensions over the Northern Ireland Protocol. Following the 5 May election, the anti-protocol Democratic Unionist Party has refused to engage with the assembly. A new administration cannot be formed without them. A spokesperson for No 10 saidMr Johnson would hold private meetings with the partiesand the UK government would ""play its part to ensure political stability"". The prime minister is expected to say there is ""no substitute for strong local leadership"". He will urge members of the Stormont assembly to ""get back to work to deal with the bread-and-butter issues"". But the prime minister will also tell political leaders that ""there will be a necessity to act"" on the protocol if the EU does not change its position. Sinn FÃ©in's President Mary Lou McDonald and vice president Michelle O'Neill say the protocol is going nowhere Mr Johnson's visit coincides with increased speculation that the UK government is poised to introduce legislationto strip away parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol,a part of the UK-EU Brexit dealwhich keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, puts a trade border in the Irish Sea between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. It was designed to ensure free trade could continue across the Irish land border, but it has been opposed by unionist politicians. The DUP has argued the protocol has eroded the foundations devolution has been built upon and undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK. The EU has acknowledged that the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses and it put forward proposals in October to try to ease that burden - it said they would mean a reduction in paperwork and checks on goods entering NI from Great Britain. However, last week the UK rejected these plans saying they would make things worse. On Monday, Mr Johnson will say that the UK and EU's shared objective should be for a reformed protocol to enjoy the broadest possible cross-community support when it faces a consent vote at Stormont in 2024. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem What do voters think of the NI Protocol? How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed The Northern Ireland Assembly election on 5 May cemented a majority for politicians who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, the republican party Sinn FÃ©in. The DUP's move to block the election of a speaker on Friday means the Northern Ireland Assembly cannot function. The party said its actions sent a clear message about its opposition to the protocol. Its leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the prime minister must ""outline what he intends to do"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says his party will not support the election of a speaker until there is action taken over the protocol On Saturday, Sinn FÃ©in leader Mary Lou McDonald accused the prime minister of being ""in cahoots"" with the DUP. Ms McDonald said the protocol was going nowhere and both she and would-be first minister Michelle O'Neill would be telling Mr Johnson so on Monday. ""The DUP have not simply called a halt to the formation of an executive, they have equally attempted to place a veto on the operation of the assembly,"" she said. ""The British government have assisted the DUP in these blocking tactics."" By refusing to support the election of a speaker, the DUP - previously the largest party in Stormont and holder of the post of first minister - has blocked a government from forming. Without a speaker, there can be no debates in the assembly, no committees can be held, and the actions of ministers, currently acting in a caretaker capacity, cannot be scrutinised.

And that's all from us today. We're pausing our live page for now but will resume our coverage of Russia's invasion of Ukraine here in the morning. In the meantime you can read our news stories on Sweden and Finland's moves towards joining Natohereand the latest assessments of what's happening on the battlefieldhere. Here's a round-up of today's main events: Putin's warnings to Finland and Sweden not to join Nato have gone unheeded. His invasion of Ukraine has triggered something he does not want: further enlargement of Nato right up to Russiaâs borders. So how could he respond? Military moves For now, President Putin has his hands full in Ukraine so he is unlikely to make any sudden moves in Finland or Swedenâs direction. Russian troops close to the 800-mile(1300km) border with Finland have been redeployed south. In time though, he is likely to move both troops and missiles nearer to Finlandâs border and mount aggressive air and naval patrols Hybrid warfare Cyber-attacks and cyber-espionage have been going on for some time, aimed at most European states. These can now be expected to be directed specifically at Finland and Sweden if they join Nato, accompanied by the usual official denials of culpability. Subversion Putin likes to play a long game and he may well decide that these two Nordic countriesâ historic neutrality means any decision to join Nato can be reversed. In time, he may opt to try to shape public opinion against Nato with the help of online bots and fake accounts. As we've been reporting, Sweden's ruling party has confirmed it is in favour of applying to join Nato. The party's decision came a few hours after Finland also confirmed it was seeking to be part of the alliance. Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson addressed reporters soon afterwards: Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent If Sweden joins Nato, it'll represent a return to
strategic significance for its largest island, Gotland. Lying just 200 miles from Kaliningrad, headquarters of Russiaâs Baltic
fleet, the island had been likened to an unsinkable aircraft carrier. An ideal
spot, during the Cold War, from which to defend Sweden and project power over
the Baltic. There was a time when as many as 20,000 troops were stationed there. But Gotland's last military units stood down in 2005 and Gotland fell
into military obscurity. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, and its subsequent sponsorship of
separatist fighters in the Donbas led Sweden to reconsider. On a visit to the island in 2016, I saw preparations for the return of a
garrison. Michael BydÃ©n, Sweden's Supreme Commander, told me it was all about
sending a message to Russia. ""If you come here, it will hurt."" But it was also about making sure that Sweden - which was already
experiencing regular Russian military incursions into its airspace and
submarine activity close to the capital Stockholm - was not taken by surprise. The Gotland Regiment was reactivated in 2018. Last month, the government announced plans to spend $163m boosting the
islandâs defences. Back in 2016, a
decision to join Nato was still some way off, but listening at the time to
Swedish airforce communications â all in English â was just one of many signs
that when the time came, ""interoperability"" with Nato forces would
not be a problem. Sweden and Finland are supported in their moves towards Nato membership by almost all Nato members - only Turkey has expressed reservations. Ankara accuses both countries of having given support to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has been waging an armed struggle against the Turkish government for decades. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Sweden and Finland must stop supporting terrorists in their countries, provide clear security guarantees and lift export bans on Turkey. But he later added that Turkey was not threatening anybody or seeking leverage. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Nato officials and Swedish and Finnish politicians all say they are confident any concerns can be addressed. Ukraine needs heavy weapons from the West and a ""real oil embargo"" on Russia to defeat the latter by the end of the year, senior Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhaylo Podolyak says. ""Ukraine is not interested in a protracted war with Russia, same as the whole world. ""We can't beat month this month [as published], but we can do it this year. ""The recipe for victory is simple: real oil embargo + tanks, aircraft and artillery.  Let's end it together,"" he tweets in English.

Ten shot dead in suspected race attack at US store,"This video can not be played Watch: Mayor speaks of pain in wake of deadly shooting An 18-year-old white man has shot dead 10 people in a black neighbourhood of New York state in what authorities are calling a racially motivated attack. The man, named as Payton Gendron in court papers, was arrested after a stand-off at the scene - a supermarket in the city of Buffalo. He began firing in the store's car park before entering and continuing his rampage, streaming the attack online. US President Joe Biden condemned what he described as an ""abhorrent"" act. ""We are investigating this incident as both a hate crime and a case of racially-motivated violent extremism,"" said Stephen Belongia, from the FBI's Buffalo office, adding there was evidence of ""racial animosity."" CBS news reported that the attacker shouted racial slurs during the shooting and suggested that he had a racial slur written on his weapon.  He also apparently posted a manifesto online which included racist language and ideas. 'Bodies everywhere - Witnesses tell of Buffalo attack horror FBI hate crime reports spike to 12-year high in 2020 US gun culture in seven charts The suspect is believed to have driven for some 200 miles to reach the predominantly black area of the city. Three people were shot dead in the car park and the other seven were killed inside the supermarket, police said. Most of the victims were black. ""He exited his vehicle. He was very heavily armed. He had tactical gear. He had a tactical helmet on. He had a camera that he was live-streaming what he was doing,"" Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia told reporters. He said the suspect surrendered his weapon after a tense stand-off and was taken into custody. He later appeared in court charged with first degree murder. Three more people, all supermarket staff, were wounded in the shooting but did not sustain life-threatening injuries. A retired police officer, named in local media as Aaron Salter, was working as a security guard in the store and was shot dead inÂ the attack. Police said he had tried to shoot the suspect, who then shot him dead. Two of the other people killed have been named in the local paper as Ruth Whitfield and Katherine Massey. A church deacon who worked as a driver was also killed, Buffalo News reports. Suspect Payton Gendron appeared in court charged with first-degree murder ""This is the worst nightmare that any community can face and we are hurting, we are seething right now,"" Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown told reporters. ""We cannot let this hateful person divide our community or our country,"" he added. Grady Lewis, who witnessed the attack from across the street, told local media that he saw the man open fire. ""I saw the guy go in, army-style, bent over, just shooting at people,"" he said. Shonnell Harris, who was working in the shop during the attack, told Buffalo News that she heard more than 70 shots as she ran to escape the building through a backdoor. ""The store was full. It was the weekend,"" she said. ""It feels like a nightmare."" Describing the aftermath of the attack, one police officer told Buffalo News: ""It's like walking onto a horror movie, but everything is real. It is Armageddon-like"". Later on Saturday, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said the suspect was a ""white supremacist who has engaged in an act of terrorism"". This was ""a military style execution targeting people who simply wanted to buy groceries in a neighbourhood store,"" she said while visiting Buffalo. In a statement, US President Joe Biden said he and the First Lady were praying for the victims and their families. ""A racially-motivated hate crime is abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation,"" he said. ""We must do everything in our power to end hate-fuelled domestic terrorism."" Hate crimes in the US hit a 12-year high in 2020, with over 10,000 people reporting offences related to their race, gender, sexuality, religion or disability. Crimes against Asian and black Americans in particular surged that year, FBI figures suggest. As police are not mandated to submit hate crime data to the FBI, those numbers are thought likely to be an undercount. Saturday's attack in Buffalo is thought to be the worst mass shooting so far in the US in 2022, and will also further inflame the bitter political battle about gun control in the US. Some 40,000 deaths a year involve firearms in America, a figure that includes suicides.

Ministers accused of lack of action over claddingLeaseholders say the political arguments are not helping those living with the problems.Wales politics,"Welsh government minister Julie James says she is ""disappointed"" at the UK government's ""England-only"" approach The Welsh government should focus on its own response to the cladding crisis, rather than political rows with Westminster, campaigners have said. In England about 40 construction firms have signed a UK government pledge to fund any required fire safety work. Climate Change Minister Julie James said she was ""disappointed"" at the UK government's ""England-only"" approach. The UK government said building safety was devolved but urged the Welsh government to take similar action. However, leaseholders said the political arguments were not helping those living with the problems ""24/7"". Building firm fails to get cladding case dismissed Flat owners feel abandoned over cladding funding What happened at Grenfell Tower? Following the 2017 Grenfell Tower tragedy in London, a number of apartments blocks in Wales were found to have fire safety defects and remediation work is yet to be carried out on many of them amid rows over who should pay. Ms James said the UK government's approach to addressing building safety issues in England was making it harder to ensure developers in Wales were taking their responsibilities seriously. Seventy-two people died in the 2017 Grenfell Tower fire, which spread due to inflammable cladding In England the building safety levy introduced by Levelling Up Minister Michael Gove will see the industry raise Â£3bn over the next 10 years to address issues. Ms James has called on the UK government to extend the developers' pledge and the levy beyond England. ""The UK government's unilateral approach to building safety issues makes it harder to ensure all developers take their responsibilities to contribute towards the cost of fixing building safety problems in Wales seriously,"" she said in a written statement to Members of the Senedd (MSs) on Thursday. However campaigners frustrated by what they regard as a lack of action by the Welsh government accused Ms James of ""missing the fundamental point"". The Celestia development in Cardiff Bay has been identified as having fire safety defects, including with the cladding. Mark Thomas, chair of the Celestia Management Company, which is responsible for the running of the 450 apartment complex, said: ""There's a lot discussion about conflicts between the Welsh government and the English [UK] government and consequential funding and Mr Gove's unilateral actions, but that doesn't actually help us living with the problem on a 24/7 basis"". Celestia's Mark Thomas accused Welsh ministers of failing to deal with the situation as a ""matter of urgency"" Welsh Conservative MS Janet Finch-Saunders accused Ms James - who also holds responsibility for housing - of a ""petulant abdication of responsibility"". ""Devolution cannot mean taking responsibility when ministers fancy it - it is their duty and the job for which they are more than well paid,"" she added. Redrow - the developer behind the Celestia complex, and one of the signatories to the developers' pledge in England - said it would look to treat its customers in England and Wales ""fairly"" while a Welsh government plan was developed. In a statement, Redrow said: ""We have consistently said that we believe the housebuilding industry, alongside main contractors and material suppliers, should play its part in resolving the issue of legacy fire safety in high rise buildings and that the financial burden should not be borne by leaseholders."" Laing O'Rourke - which was contracted to build the Celestia buildings - said it had ""engaged proactively"" with Redrow and the management company. The Welsh government said work has already been carried out, or is planned, to remove non-compliant aluminium composite cladding from all affected buildings in Wales. It has also set up a Welsh Building Safety Fund worth Â£375m and a Leaseholder Support Scheme to help those facing ""extreme hardship"" as a results of costs connected to building defects. A UK government spokesman said: ""We have been working with the devolved governments to help shape building safety policy and are in regular dialogue with the Welsh government on the issues raised. ""Our new industry wide agreement in England will make sure developers pay to fix the problems they created, including both cladding and non-cladding defects. ""While building safety is a devolved matter, we encourage the Welsh government to introduce the same legal protections as those under the Building Safety Act and are committed to supporting them in this task.""

Mark SavageMusic correspondent, BBC News Ukraine's win raises a question over who will host next year's Eurovision ceremony. The winning country usually stages the show, but Ukraine is unlikely to have that capability. Its state broadcaster, UA:PBC was targetted in the opening days of the war, and their commentator, Timur Miroshnychenko, had to broadcast his contributions from an underground bunker. In the past, other broadcasters have stepped in when a country is unable or unwilling to host the contest... most recently in 1980, when the Netherlands took over from Israel, who declined to run the show after winning in two consecutive years. Eurovision organisers the EBU have just released a statement saying they will consider all options for 2023. ""Obviously, there are unique challenges involved in hosting next year's competition,"" the statement read. ""However, as in any other year, we look forward to discussing all the requirements and responsibilities involved in hosting the competition with UA:PBC and all other stakeholders to ensure we have the most suitable set-up for the 67th Eurovision Song Contest.""

How the UK broke its Eurovision losing streak,"Sam Ryder topped the jury vote at Eurovision, ultimately coming second to Ukraine's Kalush Orchestra Fifteen years ago, I landed in Finland to cover my first ever Eurovision Song Contest. That year, the British entry was Scooch's Flying The Flag (For You), a trifling three minutes of kitsch nonsense. And on the taxi drive from Helsinki Airport, my driver had something to say about it. ""Oh, you're from England?"" he inquired. ""Your song is a joke."" He wasn't wrong. Scooch finished joint 22nd (out of 24), tying with France on 19 points. Malta later admitted they'd awarded 12 of those points in a symbolic protest over vote trading in Eastern Europe. Scooch in 2007: Let us never talk of this again For the next decade and a half, the UK didn't fare much better. In 2019 and 2021, our acts took last place. When I arrived in Turin last week, however, the taxi driver was delighted to see me. ""England! England is going to win,"" he declared, before treating me to his interpretation of Sam Ryder's Space Man. In the end, Sam didn't quite top the scoreboard, but he came close: taking the silver medal position and earning the UK's best result since Imaani came second in 1998. Ukraine wins Eurovision, while UK comes second Eurovision 2022: Song contest in pictures Eurovision Song Contest: As it happened The Eurovision anthem born in a war zone Sam Ryder is 'ignoring the hype' at Eurovision When a president tried to intervene in Eurovision... So how did the UK break its losing streak? ""I think it's just a flip in attitude,"" says Amy Wadge, who co-wrote Sam's song, as well as hits for Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello, Kylie and Alicia Keys. ""For a long time we, as Brits, built this thing up of, 'Well, we're just going to lose'. ""But this year the thinking was, 'How about we don't do that, and we look at it with the sort of respect that other countries do?"" Amy Wadge won a Grammy for her work with Ed Sheeran And that's the key. When Britpop was in its ascendancy in the 1990s, the UK decided Eurovision wasn't worth the effort. It was outdated, irrelevant, and nothing to do with contemporary music. Record labels stopped putting acts forward for the contest and, in turn, the standard of our entries dropped.  By the mid-2000s, we'd entered a cycle of self-imposed decline, unable to escape the bottom of the scoreboard (with the notable exception of Jade Ewen and Andrew Lloyd Webber's effort in 2009). Faced with those disastrous results, the music industry distanced itself even further. Eurovision was a ""poisoned chalice"", one record label executive told me. If you had spent thousands of pounds developing an act, why expose them to the risk of coming last and ending their career before it began? Faye Tozer from Steps summed it up, when I asked if her band would put themselves forward for the 2021 contest. ""In an ideal world, everybody has this vision of Steps going to Eurovision and being the perfect act, with the perfect song, and we turn it around for the UK,"" she said. ""But I think in reality, [winning] is just never, ever going to happen so it's weighing up whether it's worth that risk to us or not."" Amongst the press and the public, conspiracy theories started to circulate about the UK's lack of success. Eastern European countries were voting for each other to win, they said, conveniently ignoring victories by Germany, Norway and Sweden. This video can not be played The highlights of Eurovision 2022. Then it was Brexit. ""Angry Europeans to use Eurovision to punish UK for leaving,external,"" ran a typical headline in the Express in 2017. But the UK's average position in the three years before Brexit was 22. In the three years after, it was... 22. No, the real explanation was more simple: Our songs were bad. ""Without being disrespectful to the artists who represented us for the past few years, it has been a case of 'will this do'?"" says Eurovision expert Jonny Carey. ""Very often, it has just been a case of churning something out that isn't very Eurovision-friendly."" And while the UK's back was turned, Eurovision was becoming more credible. Acts like Loreen, MÃ¥ns ZelmerlÃ¶w and Duncan Laurence were scoring genuine hits and establishing careers. Then, in 2021, MÃ¥neskin won. The Italian rock band became an international success story, touring with the Rolling Stones, winning MTV Awards and achieving one billion streams of their hit song Beggin'. ""Having a band like that win, then have chart success around the world - and also breaking America - made people in the UK sit up and listen,"" says Dan Shipton, who has designed the staging for the UK's Eurovision entrant five times (including this year). ""It made people realise there is a place for Eurovision. There's been a massive energy shift and it's really exciting to be a part of."" Maneskin are the most successful act to emerge from Eurovision in recent years MÃ¥neskin's victory also coincided with the UK getting the dreaded ""nil points"". That night the BBC's Eurovision producer drowned his sorrows with his Spanish counterpart in a bar in Rotterdam. Together,they made a pact,externalto do better next year. For the UK, that meant teaming up with TaP Management, the company who look after Lana Del Rey, Ellie Goulding and (until recently) Dua Lipa. This video can not be played Watch: Sam Ryder and Graham Norton on Eurovision triumph Their chief executive, Ben Mawson, felt the UK had been wasting a golden opportunity; and offered the BBC the resources of his company - which has in-house designers, choreographers and recording studios in addition to its talent management arm. ""Our conclusion was [Eurovision] is not as political as people think,""he told Radio 1's Newsbeat last October. ""And I think we should focus on getting some really special music and a really special artist that represents Britain in the best possible way."" The search was on... and by January, TaP and the BBC had found the man for the job. Sam Ryder rose to fame on TikTok during the lockdown, amassing 12 million followers for his covers of Britney Spears and Queen. Artists like Alicia Keys, Sia and Justin Bieber all reposted his videos. Until Ed Sheeran joined TikTok at the end of last year, he was the platform's most-streamed British artist. TaP discovered him through Dua Lipa's producer Koz, who had been working with Sam on new music. Crucially, he had already written and recorded Space Man. ""The song was written a year and a half ago with no intention of Eurovision in our minds,"" says Sam. ""It was a gorgeous, boiling hot day in London, so naturally, we were in a studio with no windows and Space Man just seemed to come out of spaceâ¦ man."" ""We did it entirely over Zoom,"" adds Amy Wadge. ""It was the first song that we ever wrote together - and in an hour and a half we landed on something, and I was quite excited about it.""

Space Man pays homage to the music Sam grew up with in Maldon in Essex. You can hear elements of Elton John's Rocket Man, David Bowie's Space Oddity and Brian May's guitar work with Queen in the song's DNA. That familiarity - an explicit acknowledgement of Britain's rich musical legacy - paid dividends with Eurovision voters. For Amy, it also explains why the song came together so quickly, ""I'm 46 and I spend most of my life trying to think like a young artist,"" she says, ""and I suddenly had an opportunity to write a real classic rock song, which is always a bit of a gift. It was lovely for once to be able to really dig into the Elton John part of my personality."" Space Man had already earned Sam a record deal when TaP approached him to enter Eurovision. But it wasn't just the song that impressed them. It was his ability to sing it live. ""I've been doing management for about 10 years now and I honestly haven't come across a voice like it,"" says David May, who started managing Sam in 2019. ""The delivery, the control, his tone. Everything about it is absolutely phenomenal."" ""He's got a terrific vocal range, and his songwriting is distinct as well,"" agrees Radio 2's Ken Bruce, who's been commentating on the Eurovision Song Contest since 1986. ""His TikTok success is all about great recordings by great artists - and those artists all turned around and got back to Sam and said, 'You're fantastic, you're doing a great job on my song.'"" After Eurovision, Sam Ryder has plans to release new music, as well as a tour with Paloma Faith Sam and David only needed a moment's pause before accepting the task of representing the UK. ""It was something that we hadn't particularly thought about,"" David says. ""But the convincing factors were the excitement of the BBC, TaP's enthusiasm for changing the narrative, and the love everyone had for Sam and for Space Man."" Of course, a second place finish isn't solely about a good song by a good singer. Sam was sent to every corner of Europe, familiarising fans with his song, and building up a unshakeable buzz. Next, Eurovision veterans Dan Shipton and Marvin Deetman were brought in to design a stage show that would sell the song to a TV audience of 200 million. ""It was a team effort,"" Dan says, ""but the idea was to place Sam in a world of stars without using the digital screens ""The song has a real British heritage sound, so we wanted to draw on our inspirations of Queen and Bowie and how they used lighting and filters to produce 'stars' on camera. ""That was our starting point - to put him in a world of light and have him literally floating in space."" Sam's elaborate set was the biggest prop on stage at Eurovision, with three petal-shaped lighting rigs that were 6m (19.6ft) and 3m wide And so the puzzle was complete: A great song, a performer who could sell it, a production that caught the eye, and a months-long diplomatic tour. The result, as we all found out on Saturday night, was the UK's best result at Eurovision since 1998. ""A fairytale ending,"" as Graham Norton put it,. ""It's entirely deserved,"" says Ken Bruce. ""The feeling is that the UK has broken the taboo."" And the BBC is determined not to squander that opportunity. ""We have to carry on,"" says Andrew Cartmell, head of the UK delegation to Eurovision. ""This cannot just be one off. We must continue. ""The British music industry is perhaps the best music industry in the world. This is the result we should have been having, and we have to make sure the UK is a powerhouse of Eurovision for years to come."" ""Watch this space,"" says Sam. ""The UK is going to be a force next year. It's gonna be mad. The UK is going to bust down doors to be a part of Eurovision next year. ""I can't wait to see it.""
